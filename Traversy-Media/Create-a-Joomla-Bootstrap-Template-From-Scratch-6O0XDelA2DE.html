doing is taking a bootstrap template
actually we're going to be taking one of
the example templates from the get
bootstrap website and we're going to
convert it into a Joomla template and
there's a few things we're going to do
we're going to we're going to use a
couple modules from this bootstrap
Joomla comm this is my site and it's
just basically I take some of the
bootstrap components and puts them into
a Joomla module so you can easily
customize it and so forth so we have a
couple modules the first one is the
navbar module you can basically install
this and you can choose things like the
the coloring you can make it darker
light you can make it fix to the top or
the bottom you can float it there's a
couple different customization options
and it also offers drop-down
functionality then we have the jumbotron
module which is basically just like a
showcase area you can add your headings
you can change the colors of the text
you can add a background and a
foreground image things like that and
then we have the carousel module which
is a JavaScript bootstrap carousel or
slider right now you can have up to
three slides but I will be making it so
you can add more than that and then we
have the block module which is basically
just a like a bootstrap block we can
actually have the the glyphicon the
icons that come with bootstrap things
like that we can change the text
colouring okay so those are the four
modules that I have so far so the
template we're going to be using if you
go to get bootstrap comm and go to
getting started
and over here on the right you want to
click on examples and the one we're
going to be building is the Jumbotron
template so if we click on that very
basic the reason I'm doing I chose one
of these example templates is because of
how simple it is my goal isn't to teach
you how to design a great bootstrap
template it's to show you how you can
how you can integrate a bootstrap
template and these modules so basically
we'll have the navbar module the
Jumbotron module will be the main
showcase and then we have these
bootstrap block modules we're not going
to use the carousel because we're using
the the Jumbotron which is basically a
static showcase area all right so let's
go ahead and create a folder and I'm
going to call this just TPL underscore
Jumbotron and now we need our basic
bootstrap files so let's get that
if we go to go back to the homepage and
click download bootstrap and we want to
click this one
and you should get a folder like this
the distribution folder and basically
going to empty I'm going to take all of
these and put them into our folder
all right so that is the we get the CSS
we don't need all this okay we just want
the bootstrap dot CSS so I'm going to
delete all these
and fonts we're going to keep because
these give us our glyphicon that we can
use in the block module JavaScript I'm
going to get rid of this minified one
all right so now we need an index file
so create an index dot HTML
so what I'm going to do right now is
just get the static site finished and
then we can just convert it to a jeweler
template all right so that's all we need
for our static site or our template so
I'm going to open this up and what we
want to do is go back to that example
and I'm going to do ctrl you to see the
source and I'm just going to copy that
paste that in the HTML file and let me
see
we need this Jumbotron CSS file as well
so let's go let's go Bend view the
source again and click on this Jumbotron
CSS link which is basically just some
padding but and I'm not going to
actually call it Jumbotron CSS I'm going
to create a custom CSS file and this is
where all all our custom CSS will go
because we're not going to touch this
bootstrap CSS file just paste that in
there save that
all right so our index.html we need to
do a few things you can see here I'm
going to get rid of this description
author and shortcut we'll do that within
Joomla title we will get rid of the
title when we convert it we'll just keep
it for now and this here this link to
the bootstrap minified we want to change
this we want this just to go to CSS
slash bootstrap CSS and our custom this
will be our custom which is in CSS
instead of Jumbotron we're just going to
say custom CSS okay you can get rid of
this stuff
for the JavaScript they put it at the
bottom but I actually like to put them
up top okay so I'm going to grab the
bootstrap CSS file I'm sorry
link and good to get rid of this SG
jQuery CDN because we're going to
download it locally okay so up here
we'll put in our JavaScript again we
need to get rid of this path and it
should just be bootstrap J s and we'll
put a comment in there as well
now we want to include jQuery as well so
I'm going to go ahead and go to
jquery.com
and click the download' jQuery button
and I'm going to get the just get the
compressed 1.11 obviously this may be
different depending on when you're
watching it Kabul we're going to select
all this copy it and go back to our
JavaScript folder create a new file
called jQuery j/s all right so open that
paste that in save and close okay now we
just need to include it here we're going
to include it above the bootstrap JS
file
all right so that takes care of the head
while these for the static site and we
should be good let's go ahead and save
this and take a look okay I'm going to
open our index file and there's our
static template alright so that looks
good now what we need to do is convert
this to a Joomla template okay so let's
see what we're going to do is rename
this index.html we're going to name it
index.php and we're going to keep the
CSS and fonts and JavaScript folder we
need to create a couple more folders
okay we're going to create a folder
called HTML and this is going to be an
override folder so let's say we install
a certain module let's say we install
the jumbotron module and we want to
change some maybe we want to add another
paragraph or some line breaks or
something to the to the output so in our
HTML folder we could create another
folder called whatever the module name
is and then put a file in there a view
file and that's what will be used to to
output that module on our site all right
so that's what HTML the HTML folder is
for alright so we're also going to
create in an images folder
and I think yeah I think that's it we're
not going to use language strings to
make this a multi-language template that
I think that goes a little beyond the
scope so we're not going to do that
maybe I'll make another video doing that
but I just want to just keep everything
basic for now so we get our index file
the most important file to have is the
de manifest okay for our template which
is going to be called template details
dot XML and this is where we'll put all
of our meta info this is where we define
our module positions and things like
that so let's open that up now I'm just
going to paste some stuff in here I'm
going to paste all the metadata alright
so I'll start from the top first we just
have our XML declaration we use an XML
1.0 we have our doctype and then we're
going to open up a tag an extension tag
and that's going to take a few
attributes okay the first is the version
now this template I want to work on
joomla 2.5 as well as joomla 3 so you
want to put the earliest version which
is going to be 2.5 the type is a
template method we're going to say
upgrade because we want to be able to
when this template updates when we
update it I want to just be able to
install it over the the current template
so that's why we're using upgrade here
instead of install the client is going
to be the site it's not going to be an
administrative template it's a front-end
template and then we just have the name
creation date author author email URL
copyright license version I'm just going
to put 1.0 in a description all right so
that's them that's the basic metadata
that we need
so down here what we want to do is we
need to define all of our core files all
right
files and folders and what I mean by
core is everything that's directly in
the template folder we don't have to
name these files in these subfolders
just what's here okay and I think we
have everything
yeah that's actually I'm going to bring
over this favicon just going to use the
bootstrap icon as a favicon alright so
what we want to do is open up a files
tag and close it and then in between
here let's do our folders first so we
need a folders tag
okay I'll just copy this and what do we
have five
all right so we have our CSS folder we
have fonts HTML
images and JavaScript okay so now we'll
do our files file name
give me three of those
I actually you know what one thing I did
forget is in every directory in Joomla
you should have an index dot HTML file
and it can be blank it can have anything
but the read the reason we do this is so
that people can't browse your
directories from in a browser okay so it
stops them from doing that so let's
create index dot HTML and common a
common practice with this is just to
have the dot you put a doctype and then
just some title tags
okay so save that and then we want to
copy this and paste it into all these
directories well
and you'll find if you browse any Joomla
core modules or folders you'll see this
index file in all of them alright so we
do need to include that in our manifest
as well
okay so we got index dot PHP
index dot HTML
favicon dot ICO
and we need our details
all right so that looks good so the next
thing we need to do is define our module
positions and we're not going to have
that many I don't think
all right so to figure this out let's
look at our template okay so we know
we'll need a menu module for our navbar
and by the way I don't think I'm going
to keep this form here uh in the Joomla
template so we'll just have the title
and links I will need a Jumbotron module
position which I usually call showcase
and we get some blocks
okay so I'll call these box one box two
box three and that's it really this
footer I'm going to we're going to use a
template parameter where we can enter
our copyright text from the back end so
that's not going to be a module all
right so we have menu we have showcase
and our box modules and you can call
these anything you want a lot of
templates we'll call it call these user
1 user 2 but I never really liked doing
that I think blocks are blocked it makes
more sense all right so that's our
positions alright so next we want our
parameters and we're not going to have
too many pretty much just the copyright
I think all right I apologize for my
voice and kind of lose my voice so some
a little hard to understand I apologize
alright so we're going to have some con
fig tags and then inside that we want
fields and actually this needs to have a
name attribute and it's going to be
named params okay and then inside here
we'll create a field set and that's
going to have a name call it general
and this is also going to have a label
say general
and finally we want a field tag so field
and then the name actually know what
we're going to have a couple parameters
because I want I want the user to be
able to change this
okay the brand name and we'll create a
parameter for that okay so we'll do that
first we'll say
logo logo text okay so let's let's see
that's the name then we have to do a
type and the type is going to be text
and then we need a label say logo text
you could also make an image parameter
or a media parameter where they could
upload their image but I'm not going to
I'm not going to do that because this is
going to take long enough as it is
description
and I think that's it yeah that's it so
we can close this with a forward slash
and then a greater than so that's one
field let's copy this and we'll change
this name to copyright call it copyright
text
and change the label
all right so that's our two parameters I
think that's all we need
yeah the last thing we need to do is
just close out our extension tag so you
can see that all this information goes
inside of the extension tag all right
and that's it that completes our details
manifest now the last thing really to do
here is to convert the index dot PHP
file because right now we have all
static content all right what we want to
do is add our module positions and our
component dynamic code and stuff like
that but before we do that I want to
install this onto our site and then work
work on it from there so that we can see
our changes all right so what we're
going to do is we're going to package
this okay and the way that we package it
is just to put it all in a zip file and
the template details is very important
you want to make sure that all the
folders and files are listed in there or
it won't install correctly all right so
let's go ahead and just going to use
WinRAR to zip this
and you're going to do is zip all right
so now we should be able to install this
now what I have here is just a brand new
Joomla 3.2 installation I haven't
created any content or I haven't done
anything so it's brand new all right so
let's sum and this is actually going to
be my demo site for bootstrap Joomla
alright so we're going to we're going to
install this right on this live site
so let me login here
all right so here's our back end the
first thing I do it's uh
all right so here's the front end the
first thing I do when I install Joomla
is get rid of this title I don't want
this home here alright so we can do that
by just going to the menu item the home
page menu item
and on their page display we just want
to set this to no and I'm just going to
give the page title I'll say bootstrap
Joomla demo alright so
get rid of that home and we have a title
now what I'm going to do is I'm going to
enable what I'm going to enable i
template well we have to install it and
then we'll enable it and we'll change
all the static text to dynamic content
so let's go to template manager and I'm
sorry extension manager and we want to
choose the zip file we created
where is it
okay
all right so we have an issue here um
demo templates CSS
um let's go back to our
xml file CSS
oh we made a mistake this should be
folder not folders
all right so sorry about that we're
going to save that and I'm just going to
open up the zip file and just throw that
in there all right so now we'll go and
try that again
all right so now it's installed so let's
go extensions template manager and you
can see our jumbotron 2 template right
here let's enable that I'm sorry set it
as default right now if we reload all
right so this looks a little messed up
because it's not it's not including ours
our temp our Joomla template CSS alright
so let's go ahead and go back to notepad
now what I'm going to do is I have my
notepad plus plus FTP client set up so
that I can directly edit files on on
this domain alright so I'm going to do
that
all right so what I'm going to do is go
to my templates directory and bootstrap
Joomla
okay and let's see
I called that bootstrap Joomla you just
check this
um
not sure why it's called bootstrap Jim
aware that came from
huh
oh I'm sorry I mean no I'm in the wrong
directory I'm not in my demo site
alright so I want to go to demo all
right so now templates jumbotron alright
so this is our template this these files
here so let's open up index.php alright
so we need to do a couple things here
well actually we need to do quite quite
a bit here we want to get rid of this
title tag because Joomla will create the
titles for us but norther for Joomla to
do that we need to add a little snippet
here and we do that with the with a J
doc statement okay so once a J doc
include and then type the type is going
to be head alright so let's see now the
reason that the the CSS isn't working
for us is that the way we have it in the
CSS folder it's looking for this folder
inside of the root alright and it's not
in the root it's inside of our template
directory so we need to add a couple
things here alright the first thing we
want to do is that go out our base URL
and Joomla gives you a handy function to
do that so say PHP echo this
base URL all right close up that so this
basically is going to echo out this okay
our base URL now from there we want to
go into our templates directory so slash
templates slash and then what we want to
do is we want to include the name of the
template and Joomla we can do that with
saying this template alright so that's
going to give us the template name and
then we want to go to the CSS so slash
CSS and then the file alright so let's
just copy this we'll go up to the slash
and copy
and then here we'll do the same thing
what not sure what happened there
okay copy
all right so that looks good same thing
here with the JavaScript files
all right so let's save that now it
should read our CSS in JavaScript
alright so simple as that right now this
looks good but it's all static content
we don't want that so what we're going
to do here is we'll do the navbar first
so we're going to need to install our
navbar module alright first what I'm
going to do is we need to get rid of
this okay so
actually I'm going to cut it and I'm
going to put it in another file just in
case we need to look at it so in place
of that we need to pet we need to add
our menu module position right so it's a
menu
and the way we do this is with j-dog
statements so we're going to say J dot
include type is going to be modules okay
name is going to be whatever the
position name which is going to be menu
and then style and in style we're going
to put none
you could put XHTML and what that will
do it is it allows your module to have a
title an h3 title by default but we
don't want our menu to have a title so
it's just going to be none you can also
create custom styles there actually it's
I've actually called chrome module
chrome but I'm not going to get into
that in this video all right so if I
save that and if we reload this it's
going to just disappear all right
because we don't have a module in that
position so we want our mark our
bootstrap module there so we need to
install that first so I'm going to go to
extension manager choose file and all
these modules I'm installing you can get
at bootstrap Joomla comm all right so
let me just find where I have them
all right so I'm going to install the
bootstrap nav I'm just going to install
them all right
right now the bootstrap I'm sorry the
mod Jumbotron
and the bootstrap block
all right so now let's go to module
manager and the bootstrap nav and click
on that and we want this assign to all
pages all right now here we want to want
to choose the menu which is going to be
the main menu navigation type you want
to make sure is now far you can also
have the list group which is a vertical
menu color is going to be docked and
fixed see is it fixed here well we can't
tell I think it is so we're just going
to say fixed top float we're just going
to leave branding type all right so this
is going to be text you can also use a
logo if you want and we can choose our
brand text here instead of the template
parameters so we'll do that we'll call
this just calling
Jumbotron template all right so we want
to publish this select the position
which is going to be menu and now let's
click Save and close and with some
templates you may want it like I said
create an override if you want to change
the way it's displayed let's just see
what we got here alright so there's our
navbar these easy as that now when we
create menus in the backend they'll show
here all right so let's actually do that
let's create an article
and let's just say about and for a text
let's just get some sample texts from
alarm if some
generate some dummy text okay I'm going
to copy that and go ahead and paste this
inside of the source code as I want
paragraphs
all right so we'll save that and of
course we need to create a menu item for
it
and we're going to select articles
single article choose the about article
all right so now if we go to our
front-end and reload we have our boat
page now if we click on it it's going to
take us to the page but this is still
static content so the page the pages
text isn't going to show yet all right
so our menu is now all set okay so the
next thing we want to do is the
Jumbotron
all right so for that's from here to
here so again I'm going to cut that out
and just paste it in here and basically
we're going to use the J doc again
and we'll call this
showcase module okay so we want to
change the name to showcase style we'll
keep at none now the Showcase is just
going to be on the homepage so we need
to create an if statement saying that we
only want to show this if it's enabled
if the showcase module is enabled on
that page all right so we can say PHP if
and we want to save this count modules
alright so we'll say if this count
modules and then inside there as a
parameter we want to put the position
name in our case of showcase all right
and this is the this is PHP shorthand if
so we're not using a curly brace we're
using this colon and then when we want
it to close will say PHP and DEF
okay alright so basically like I said
it's just saying if the showcase isn't
enabled on that page I'm sorry if it is
enabled then show it so let's save that
and if we reload the Jumbo trying to
disappear okay now we're going to go to
module manager and click on the
jumbotron module ok menu assignment
we're going to say only on page is
selected and then we'll unselect all the
pages and just select home all right
it's going to be published the position
should be showcase
ok now the text let's go to go to our
little snippet here and the text will
say hello world for the heading I'm just
going to copy the paragraph paste that
in here
all right so set our text I don't think
we wanted to center it no you can change
the color if you'd like show button
we're going to say yes button text is
going to be learn more and the button
link I'm just going to leave as a dummy
link for now and then the button class
ah if you have used bootstrap before
then you probably know that the buttons
have certain classes for certain colors
for instance the button primary is blue
all right we can also say we want it
large I'm going to take out this button
color we don't need that all right so
that's good the background color is set
to light gray that's good you can use a
background image I'm not going to but
you can and you can also use a
foreground image all right you can
change this the width of that but this
looks good for now so I'll tie the title
save that and see how it looks
all right so there it is this is our
module now all right and if we go to
about it should not be there all right
so next we're going to use the bootstrap
block module which will be each of these
okay so let's get out of here all right
so let's go code that in the template
first all right so we have our static
blocks here now these are all going to
be in the same module position actually
no not sorry they're not
all right so let's uh right under the
container div I'm just going to copy the
showcase snip it
and we'll say box one
box one
all right so we need three of these and
I'm actually going to cut this static
content place it in here
all right so now we'll copy this box
twice this will be box two
this will be three
all right
save that and now we need to create them
let's make sure that the static content
is gone all right
actually there's one thing we need to
change we're going to change this from
none to XHTML because we want it to have
a title actually you know what no we
don't because the title can be included
in the module parameters
so bootstrap block
all right so we'll just leave the
default heading and paragraph default
colors now this glyphicon class if you
want to use an icon next to the title
you can go to get bootstrap
and if we go to CSS
I'm sorry components you have all these
choices of glyphic odds or icons that
you can use so all you need to do is
copy the class name and paste that in
and you'll have an icon and by default
there is one here it's the th I'm not
exactly sure which one that is
ah see
th
I don't know I can't find it right now
but we actually don't want to use the
glyphicon so we're just going to take
that out show read more let's take a
look
yep and we'll call it view details
and for the button we want the button to
be white so for that we need to change
this class from primary to default okay
and that should do it
yeah so let's save this and see what
we're looking at
all we need to choose the pages so we
want this only on pages selected and
we're just going to choose the home the
home page
all right so the reason it's so long
here is because we don't have blocks to
in box three so let's do that now
all we want to do here is we can
actually just check bootstrap block and
then click duplicate
I don't know whatever this is here but
it's not something that has to do with
the module so let's uh we want to
duplicate it one more time all right so
let's click on this one
we'll just call this a walk - and then
what we want to do is we want it
published we want to select position we
want to select box - and everything else
is good
get rid of the cliff akan class okay
save and close and then finally we want
the the other duplicated module we'll
call this block three published and box
three position
all right so let's reload this
huh
oh these are set to no pages
all right
uh-uh
um all you know what we made a mistake
we need to actually we needed to keep
some of the bootstrap markup here um for
the columns that we didn't so we're
going to do is just copy this I'm going
to cut it and then I'm going to go back
with ctrl z go back to static all right
so what we want to do is we want to
include these inside of these columns
all right
so for here for example so we get rid of
that and then here we just want the box
one
all right and then here you want box too
sorry about that
hope that didn't confuse you and here we
want box three
all right so we're doing this because we
need these column classes in order for
them to to float side by side all right
so let's save that
oh okay we have the boot the blocks but
we included another Jumbotron in there
it looks like yeah okay this showcase
get rid of that
all right so everything here is dynamic
except for the copyright now what we
want to do is we want to include our
parameter here so the way that we grab
our parameters is pH P and we're going
to echo out this params get and then the
name of the parameter in this case I
believe is copyright
all right so save that and what we need
to do is um
we want to go to our template manager
and click on the jumbotron template and
then general and here's our our two
parameters the logo text we actually
took care of from within the bootstrap
nav module so we don't need that
copyright and say copyrights strap
Joomla 2014 alright so save that and
then that should show down in the bottom
here
um which it didn't
oh oh yeah I named it copyright text so
we just want to change this copyright
text and then save it again
all right so there's our copyright so
this is all well and good but the one
thing we don't have that we need to add
is the main component snippet basically
our articles because if we click on
about we don't have anything here so
that's really easy to do we want to go
you want to figure out where you want to
put your main content in your template
we're going to put it under the box
under the boxes all right so like right
here so this again will be using J doc
include and type is going to be
component and above that we want to put
arm where we want our messages for
instance if you get a failed login you
need an area for you for the sorry your
credentials didn't match message or
something like that and what we want to
do is just change this to message
all right so let's save that mm-hmm
go back here and reload
and now we have our content our about
page all right we don't have anything
set for the home page but by default the
home page if you feature an article
inside of article manager it'll show up
here but in our case we don't want an
article on our home page it's just made
up of strictly modules so if you did
want articles on your home page let me
just show you you go to on article
manager and if we set this about page to
featured and then we go to the home page
it now shows down here alright so that's
how you can show a component on your
home page so I think that's it we
integrated a template we integrated the
navbar the the jumbotron and the
bootstrap blocks so I hope that you
could follow this and hopefully this
will help you if you're using if you're
using bootstrap with Joomla</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
