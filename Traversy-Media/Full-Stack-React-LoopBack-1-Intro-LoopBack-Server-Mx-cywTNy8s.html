development series in this series we're
gonna build a full stack application
with react and loopback so loopback is
an ojs API framework used to create REST
API s and it makes things a hundred
times easier on the backend by giving us
a command line tool to generate all of
our models and routes
it also comes prepackaged with back-end
authentication now we're not going to
implement the authentication part just
yet we will build an app where we can
create read update and delete meetups
through our react application and once
we get to that stage I'll then look into
continuing the series with with user
authentication alright so this is the
app here this is the front end it's the
react app we're using materialized CSS
for our framework and you can see we're
listing our meetups here and we can
click on a meet-up and it'll take us to
the details page we can edit it we can
delete it we can click down here to add
a new Meetup let's say J s meetup and
city now we're gonna add an address
field as well because just the city
doesn't make much sense but we can go
ahead and add that we have our little
side menu here that pops out now it's on
the surface it's very simple but of
course whenever you're building a
full-stack application a lot goes into
it ok not just the code on the back end
in the front end but also meshing the
two together ok so notice on this tab we
have the loopback API Explorer running
and you can see we have our meetups we
have all of our routes now if you have
no idea what loopback is I would suggest
going back and watching the video I did
it on it a couple weeks ago where we
actually built this the same type of
thing we built a REST API for meetups
and the Explorer is really nice it's
basically a client that allows you to
fetch your your items for instance right
here if we go to get meetups and we
click the button there try it out you'll
see it'll fetch all of our meetups
including the one we just created we can
make post requests put require
also down here you can see we have a
user model with all of our routes for
authentication we have a login route
logout and our back-end authentication
is already set okay but like I said
later on when we get to this point here
I will look into adding authentication
on the front-end alright but it's
basically already set up on the back end
so loopback is gonna be the the easy
part of this series the hard part the
the most of the coding we're going to be
doing is in react alright and then I'm
going to show you of course how we can
have them both running on the same port
now during development they're gonna run
on separate ports we'll have our back
end on three thousand and we'll have the
react application on on three thousand
and one and then once we you know once
we're ready we'll go ahead and we'll
compile the static assets into the
client folder on the server okay into
loop backs client folder and then we'll
be able to run it as one application
alright and if you watch my mean stack
front-to-back series then you know what
I'm talking about we're gonna basically
do that same kind of thing we're gonna
make it so that we can just run a simple
command and it'll all get compiled into
into the client folder from the source
alright so that's what we'll be doing
guys now I don't want this to be too
many videos I don't want this to be a
you know a 20 video series so the videos
will be kind of long I'm guessing maybe
a half hour to 40 minutes or so per
video so what we're gonna do now that
I've given you an introduction we're
gonna go ahead and set up our back-end
we're gonna set up our loopback API and
like I said that's that's pretty much
the easy part because it gives us a
really nice CLI to work with we're going
to generate our meetups model we're
gonna implement MongoDB meaning we're
gonna install the connector so that it
works with Mongo and then we're gonna go
from there alright now like I said if
you don't know anything about loopback I
would suggest watching that first video
I will put a link in the description and
I think it's only about 20 minutes or so
alright so let's go ahead and get
started alright guys so we're going to
be starting from absolute scratch I'm
using vs code for my text editor and
using the integrated terminal down here
and I'll even though I'm using Linux
Ubuntu this is a cross-platform series
you can follow along on Windows or Mac
ok the two things that you need to have
installed though before doing anything
is no js' if you don't have that just go
to node.js or download and install it
second thing you need is MongoDB alright
if you're on Windows or Mac you can just
download and install it I do have a
video called MongoDB in 30 minutes where
I show you exactly how to install it on
Windows if you're on a Windows machine
if you're on a bun - this is a really
good document right here to follow to
install it you basically just run a
couple commands and then make sure you
start up your server with sudo service
Mongo dee start in fact I'm gonna go
ahead and run that just to make sure
that it's running alright so what I have
here is just an empty folder called
meetups this is who we're gonna build
our application so first thing we'll do
is install loopback loopback has a
global CLI utility a command line
interface and that's what we used to
create our models and routes and that's
how we integrate our data source or
MongoDB in our case you can use loopback
with many different databases but we're
going to be using Mongo alright so first
thing we'll do is that will say sudo
since I'm on Linux I need to say sudo
and then I'm gonna do NPM install - JEE
because we want to install it globally
so that we could access it from anywhere
and then loopback
- CLI all right that'll install it
globally on our machine and then we can
use the elbe command now one thing I
want to mention is if you're on Windows
and you're using git bash instead of you
know PowerShell or whatever you may have
an issue when it asks you some questions
with him you know when you have to use
the arrow buttons to go up and down if
that happens just just use the Windows
command prompt - when you run the elbe
command alright so now that that's
installed we're going to go ahead and
we're going to run lb
so it's gonna ask us the name of our
application meetups is good I'm gonna
hit enter we want version three which is
the latest version and then this is what
I was talking about on Windows get bash
it might this might not work but you
want the first option anyway which is
API server
it's a loopback API server with local
user authentication so we're gonna hit
enter
and it's gonna create all the folders
and files inside of our meetups
directory alright so now that that's
done you can see up here if we want to
create a model we can do lb model and to
run the server or run the app we can do
no dot I think we can do NPM start as
well actually let's take a look at the
package Jason yeah see there is a start
script and if we look at the
dependencies there's just a few things
from loopback we have cores so that's so
that we can use this with other domains
some dev dependencies es lint so not too
much let's go ahead and run the server
so we'll say node dot okay so it's gonna
open it up on localhost 3000 now if we
just go to localhost 3000 we're just
gonna see this object it just has the
uptime this isn't what we want this is
where our application will live our
react application but right now we want
to go to slash Explorer and that'll give
us the loopback API Explorer now any
resources or models that we create will
show up in this Explorer and it'll show
us all of our routes now by default we
have a user model that has all these
different routes so we can get users and
add users and all that we can login we
can get an access token
so the backend authentication stuff is
is is already there for us with loopback
and this would take forever to create
with you know something like node and in
Passport
but like I said we're not getting into
authentication just yet I still have to
look into that we just want to build an
application where we can basically
create read update and delete meetups
and then we'll look into authentication
so what we want to do now is we want to
generate a new resource for meetups all
right
so we can we can have all these routes
and we can get them and in post and put
in all that and that's really simple all
we have to do is run l lb model and
that'll create it but before we do that
we need to create the MongoDB data
source all right so what I'm gonna do is
just minimize this a little bit and
let's take a look at our files here so
client this is where our react
application will go but that's not going
to be for awhile
server if we look in here and we look in
this data sources JSON file you'll see
that we have a data source called DB and
this actually is just memory it's just
using memory there's no database or
anything like that and obviously that's
not what we want we want to use MongoDB
so we need to add a new data source so
we're gonna what we're gonna do is
install something called the Mongo
connector all right so to do that we can
just go to our command line let's stop
the server with ctrl C and we're gonna
do an NPM install - - save and this is
called loopback
- connector - MongoDB all right now well
that will get saved to our dependencies
as well
all right so now that we did that we
need to set up the data source with that
connector so we need to do LV and we
need to say data source and then we need
to name it I'm just gonna call it Mongo
DS or Mongo DS for a data source and
then we're going to add the flag - -
connector and then we want to put in
Mongo DB and enter all right so it's
going to ask the data source name which
is Mongo des by default
let's click enter and then this part is
really important you want to make sure
you go down to Mongo DB because you can
use multiple different types of
databases with loopback you can use
MySQL postgrads or
Redis Cassandra all these IBM databases
we're gonna choose MongoDB so for this
here could this connection string URL
I'm just gonna hit enter to skip that
and then we're gonna manually fill in
some of this stuff so host will be
localhost port is going to be the
default Mongo port which is two seven
zero one seven and then user and
password and I'm just gonna skip and
then database let's call this C will
just call this meetups
- app alright and now notice that the
data source JSON file now has all that
stuff in it alright now one thing I want
to do here is I'm gonna change the Mongo
des this is this was temporary here or
at least this part two DB and then I'm
gonna get rid of this DB okay and the
reason I'm doing that is because this is
referenced in a few different places
around the server and I don't want to go
and change all that so I'm just gonna
change this to DB because we're not
using that memory anyway so let's save
that and just to show you if we go to
model config you'll see that that DB is
referenced in a few places so as far as
the other files on the server once we
create a model for our meetups we'll see
the the resource for that but this stuff
we have a config file where we can
change the port and stuff like that the
route right now it's gonna be slash API
where we make our request - for instance
it'll be slash API slash meet-ups then
we just have some middleware stuff and
our model config alright so let's go
ahead and create a new model called
meetups so we're gonna go down here
let's clear this out and to create a
model all we have to do is say lb model
and it'll ask us some questions the
model name we're gonna call meetups and
we're gonna select our datasource notice
how MongoDB is already there for us
that's because we already installed it
and set it up so we're going to choose
that we're going to choose persisted
model
it's gonna ask if we want to expose the
Meetup the meetups resource to the rest
api we want to say yes or why enter
custom plural form so if we wanted to
put something else for the resource name
for the plural form we could do that I'm
just gonna hit enter and then calm in
our server we're gonna choose common and
it's gonna ask us for our properties so
we know that with our meetups we want
them to have a name a city and an
address so let's go ahead and add name
it's gonna ask the type it's gonna be a
string so I'm gonna hit enter required
I'll say yes and enter ok the default
value leave blank for none so that's
what we want blank so we'll click enter
and then it's gonna ask us for the next
one which is gonna be City same stuff
string required yes blank yes the next
one will be address which will be a
string I'm gonna make the address not
required so we'll put an N and enter ok
once we have all the properties we want
we can just hit enter and it'll take us
out of that screen all right so now if
we go over and we look at our server
folder we should have enough server
folder our common folder we now have
models and we have meetups Jason ok this
is where all the the fields that we just
created reside you can see we have our
name city and address and the types and
stuff alright so this is kind of like
kind of like a mongoose schema if you've
ever worked with mongoose now any any
any access control that we set for
instance if we want to say that you know
only authenticated users can read or
write to meetups and stuff like that
that's gonna go in this array right here
this ACLs but like I said we're not
gonna get into that just yet so if you
are interested in seeing how to add
permissions and stuff like that I would
suggest watching that other loopback
video all right but we're not going to
get into that in this in this series
just yet
so let's go ahead and close that up and
then if we restart our server so we can
either do NPM start or node dot and then
we go back to our Explorer and reload
now we have a meetups resource so if I
click on that you'll see that we have
all these routes for our meetups we
didn't have to do anything to create
these we have get route so we can fetch
them we have a post to add them put in
patch to update we have a delete so we
can get counts and there's a lot of
different routes that were created so if
we were to go to the get right here
you'll see it has all the fields and we
were to click try it out that'll
actually fetch all the meetups in the
database okay it's gonna make a request
to this URL right here and you can see
the response is just an empty array
which obviously is that's correct
because we haven't added anything now we
actually can add meetups through this
interface so let's go to post meetups
and then down here where it says data
we're just gonna put in some curly
braces and we're gonna put some jason so
we'll say name make sure you wrap the
keys and the values in double quotes so
we'll call this angular meetup all right
so we know we have a name we have a city
so for city I'll just say Miami and then
we also have address so for address I'll
just say 40 Main Street all right once
we have that data in there we'll go
ahead and click try it out and makes the
post requests and we get our 200
response which is good and now there's a
meetup in our database alright so if we
were to go up to get and click this
again let's try it out you'll see we'll
get our angular meetup alright let's go
ahead and add one more so we'll go back
down to post meetups and we'll change
this to react meetup and let's change up
this info will say this is in Boston
and we'll say I don't know let's say to
Albany Street alright so that went ahead
and added it now if we go back up to our
get and click on is I get yeah
and click on try it out we get our two
meetups
all right we can also go to localhost
for three thousand slash API slash
meet-ups
and there they are so this is the URL
that we're gonna make our request to
from our front-end react application
okay and notice that an ID is also
created automatically now just to show
you that this stuff is definitely in our
MongoDB database I'm gonna go ahead and
open up the Mongo shell you guys don't
have to do this I'm just showing you and
then we'll say show DBS and we have
nevermind the meetups that's the first
one I created we're looking at this
meetups app so let's say use meetup
stash app and again you guys don't have
to do this and then we'll say show
collections we have a meetups collection
so we'll do DB dot meetups dot find and
there they are
there's our angular and react meetup so
we know the stuff is getting stored in
Mongo so let's ctrl C get out of that
and I'll close this up
alright so believe it or not our back
end is done that's how that's how easy
loop back is to work with all right even
just just to create these routes for the
meetups if we were using you know just
node and Express it would take quite a
while we need to implement something
like Mongoose we would need to create
our models we would need to create our
schema we'd need to create all of the
routes and and connect the model to each
route and make our queries and and we'd
have to do a lot of different stuff but
loop at make makes that really easy
alright so now that we have our back-end
set up in the next video we're gonna go
ahead and we're gonna start to setup
react hey guys if you've been watching
