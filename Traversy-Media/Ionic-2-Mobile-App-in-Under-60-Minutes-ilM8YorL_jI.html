build in this project we're going to be
building a mobile application using the
ionic 2 framework now if you don't know
what ionic is it's an html5 and
JavaScript mobile framework and what is
what it essentially does is it allows
you to create apps with JavaScript and
then wrap that web app inside of a
native container all right so it's
perceived as an as a native mobile app
and it gives you access to a lot of the
different native components all right it
also gives you a customizable UI and a
ton of custom elements to work with now
it's important to know that ionic 2 uses
the angular 2 framework so I would
suggest that you learn at least the
basics of angular 2 before getting into
ionic it is possible to learn both at
the same time and for what we'll be
doing you don't have to be an angular 2
pro by any means
I would suggest checking out my angular
2 and 60 minutes video before attempting
this all right now with ionic you're
building a core app but you can export
it as an Android and an iOS app alright
usually if you're building native
applications with you know objective-c
for iOS and Java for Android you'll have
to build two separate applications and
that's extremely expensive especially
where you know objective-c and Java
developers are much more expensive than
JavaScript developers so you can see
that this is this is a really nice
framework to have for iOS you do need a
Mac and you also need an Apple Developer
license as far as I know so we'll be
focusing on Android now most likely you
want to get the Android SDK and Android
studio installed it is free you'll want
this if you want to use the Android
virtual device which is what you're
looking at right here I'm not going to
go into the whole installation process
there are a ton of videos on that on
YouTube and tutorials if you want to get
that set up but I will show you exactly
what you'll need to install all right
now before we do
that let's take a look at the
application we'll be building so it's an
application called I in reddit and we're
using the reddit the subreddit
API to basically just fetch a list of
posts or reddit's within a certain
category all right so you can see we're
getting the image to the title or
getting the thumb the score or the
thumbs up and the comments all right so
by default we have this set to food but
if I go and I click this and this is
extremely slow by the way just because
it's the virtual device this would be
much faster if you exported it and
installed it on a physical device
alright so if we want to change it to
sports we'll go ahead and click OK and
you can serve this in the browser as
well and it's much faster and that's
that's how we'll be developing all right
so you can see that the sport it's
updated to the category of sports now
this is the main page if we click on
View it'll actually take us to an inner
page or a details page looks like that
image isn't showing up for some reason
let's try this one I think some of them
yeah some of them don't have images we
can put in a simple if statement in
there to take care of that but you can
see we have the image that the title the
author the score and the comments and
then a button to view it on reddit all
right so that's the details page now we
also have a settings page where we can
change the default category so this will
actually change it in local storage so
that when you come back to the app the
category will be changed we can also
let's see we'll change it to back to
food we can also change the limit all
right so I have it set to 5 but we can
go ahead and change that anywhere from 5
to 25 and of course you can add more if
you want so click OK and let's go ahead
and save changes and now you can see we
have food and we have 10 10 listings all
right and then we just have a simple
about page which just gives us a
description
the version number all right so that's
what we'll be building pretty simple I
think it's good for a starter
application and the API is really easy
to work with if you look up here we just
need to make a request to a URL like
this and we're just basically changing
the category name and the limit okay and
this is what it gives us just a bunch of
JSON content now of course you'll need
nodejs installed to to install ionic and
Cordova Cordova is basically sits on top
of it and that's what allows it to chain
to turn the JavaScript code into native
code alright so if all this sounds
really difficult don't worry about it
it's really not that hard we're not
going to actually publish it on a
physical device and we're just going to
get it to the point where it's running
on the emulator which is pretty much the
same thing after that you can do I think
it's ionic build Android and it'll build
out an apk file and you can actually
install that on your physical device all
right I don't even have an Android
device to do that with but let's go
ahead and get started
if we look over here we're at i/o Nick
frame our comm Docs /v - slash setup
slash installation and we're going to
kind of follow along here now ionic one
actually uses angularjs or angular one
but we're going to be focusing on
version two which uses angular 2 so
let's go ahead and open up a command
line I'm just going to open that up on a
separate screen alright so I'm going to
go to the directory where I want to
create the application and I'm just
going to close this out all right so
let's say CD I'm going to go to my C
Drive and then project and this is where
I'm going to set up the application over
Android studio let me just show you real
quick now the SDK manager you can get to
through Android studio or if you
have the Android environmental variables
you can use this command here now what
you're going to want is obviously the
SDK at this point the latest is API 25
which is 7.1.1 you're also going to want
the build tools for that version okay
you're going to want where is it you
want hexam this right here this is the
emulator accelerator you're going to
want to install that so check that off
and you're going to want a system image
for that virtual device I would suggest
this Intel Atom if you're on 64-bit use
the 64 version and then that will let
you set up an emulator all right so if
we say Android AVD Android virtual
device that should open up the device
manager you'll see I already have one
here the Nexus 6 but you want to create
a new one give it a name select your
device now the target is the API you
want to use and then this is where
you'll select the system image okay for
instance the atom Intel Atom all right
you can go ahead and create that all
right but unlike I mean there's there's
a lot of videos on YouTube to show you
how to do all that so let's get back to
our project now if we look at the
documentation here you want to install
ionic and Cordova using NPM so you'll
want to do NPM install global Cordova
and ionic alright I already have it
installed so I'm not going to run it but
you want to do that and then once you do
that you can use ionic start to create a
project so let's go ahead and say ionic
starts and we're going to call this I on
reddit and you want to make sure you use
- - v2 if you don't use that it's going
to install ionic one which we don't want
alright so let's go ahead and run that
and that will create the whole folder
for us
and it could take a couple minutes so
what I'm going to do is pause this and
I'll be back when it's finished all
right so that's dawn took about a minute
and a half not too bad so what we're
going to do now is CD into iron reddit
alright and then from here we should be
able to actually start our application
we can serve it in the browser by saying
ionic serve okay so it goes through a
little process here but once it's
started and we start to edit our code
it'll live reload alright so there it is
there's our application we could
actually publish this now if we wanted
to it's basically just a boilerplate we
have a home page if you look at the tabs
down here click about we have an about
page which has nothing on it and then a
contact page which just has their
Twitter handle all right so that's the
boilerplate now we're going to leave
this running and let's go ahead and open
up our code editor I'm using Visual
Studio code I like using this with any
angular project because it has nice
typescript highlighting and when then
what we're going to do is open up the
folder so let's see projects and I in
read it alright so let's take a look at
the structure here now the main folder
we're going to be focusing on is the
source folder that's where all the
angular - all the components the pages
is when we create a service everything
is going to go in this folder now let's
take a look in the app folder alright so
we have the app dot module file now if
you followed along with mice angular 2
and 60-minutes video or you just know
angular 2 then this should look familiar
this is basically where we bring in all
of our other components and we add them
to ngmodel
or I'm sorry ng module alright and
you'll see we have the about page the
contact the home page and the tabs page
which represents the tabs down here all
right in addition to that we have the
app component ts file this is basically
the main app component this is where we
add our service providers and so on all
right we're not going to do too much in
this file though all of the sub
components are actually in this pages
folder so you can see we have about
contact home and tabs all right if we
look at a boat it has three files it has
the TS okay which is the main component
file the HTML file which is the template
and an F CSS file for styling
okay uses sass by default so if we look
at the TS file you see just like any
other angular 2 application we're
bringing in component from angular core
it also uses a nav controller ok so that
we can change pages easily then we have
the component decorator with the
selector and the template URL and then
the class name which is by default the
component name and then page and then
our constructor and we're injecting the
nav control here as a dependency alright
if we look at the HTML ionic has its own
directives so we have this iron header
and the navbar that's what you're seeing
up here and then all the content will go
in here alright so if we go ahead and
say this is about and we save that
you'll see that it'll auto reload and
then if we click about you'll see that
that was added so the workflow is really
easy with this this ionic serve feature
okay so same same thing for the contact
in the home and then in tabs if we look
at tabs TS we're just bringing all the
pages in and we're adding them down here
to these tab 1 root tab - root tab 3
root and then if we look at the HTML we
have these iron tabs all right so what I
want to do first is create our reddits
component component or page whatever you
want to call it in the settings page so
let's create a new full
let me just get rid of those alright so
inside pages we're going to create a new
fought a file a new folder called
reddit's alright and then inside
reddit's we're going to create a file
called Redditt dot TS type script file
and then a new file called Redditt
dot HTML ok that'll be our template you
can create the s CSS file if you want
but we're not going to do that I don't
even think we're adding any extra
styling really all right so what we'll
do here is let's copy what we have in
the about HTML so we'll grab that and
put that in Redditt HTML here this is
going to be the main home page so for
the title I'm just going to say iron III
in reddit ok we'll say this is home save
that and then let's copy what we have in
the about TS file and we'll put that in
red it's TS and then what we'll do is
change the selector to reddit's change
the template to Redditt dot HTML and
then the class name is going to be read
its page alright so we'll save that now
we want to do the same thing for the
settings page so again in pages let's
create a new folder called settings and
we'll create a file called settings dot
T s and then settings dot HTML alright
and again we'll copy what we have in
about TS paste that in settings we're
going to change the selector and the
template and the class name settings
page alright and then let's copy the
HTML
okay up here we'll say settings and
we'll say this is settings all right so
now we have our two pages now we want to
add them to the tabs down here alright
but before we do that whenever you
create a new page or component you need
to add it to a project with a standard
angular 2 app so we're going to go ahead
go up here now we're not going to be
using the contact and home page so I'm
just going to replace that so this will
be reddit's page and then you want to
point to it which is Redditt slash
reddits and then let's change this to
the settings page settings ok and then
we want to change that here in the
declaration so this will be R edits and
settings same thing here reddit's
settings okay so let's save that and
that file should be all set for now and
what we want to do is let's see so we're
getting an error here no component
factory found for home page that's fine
what we need to do is go down to our
tabs page tabs folder and go to tabs ts
and we're going to change this home page
to reddit's page change that and then
contact will change that to settings ok
and then down here let's do the first
tab will be the reddit's okay then we'll
have actually want the settings page to
be the second one and then about will be
the third one save that and then we'll
go into tabs dot HTML and let's change
this to reddit's
this one will be settings and this one
will be about now as far as the icons
okay so ionic has its own set of icons
so for this one let's see so we'll use
we'll keep that as home for the settings
so we're going to use construct and then
for about we're going to keep the
information circle so let's save that
and now down here you'll see for
reddit's we have our home icon settings
has the the tools here the construct
about has the information alright and
says this is home if we click on
settings that's good about that's good
so our navigation is complete now I want
to change the the look a little bit I
want the header and the tabs area to
have a blue color so to do that we can
go to let's see we'll go to our edits
HTML and where we have the navbar let's
just add color equals primary and we'll
save that and you'll see that turns blue
alright now we have to do that on every
page you'll see settings we'll have to
change that as well
so we'll add that here I think secondary
is green by default and let's see about
HTML set color primary
well I had an M there it's alright
alright and then for the tabs if we go
two tabs HTML we're going to add that
there as well
primary and if you go to the
documentation it has all these different
styles and things you can do with the UI
all right so let's close these up and
figure out what we're doing next so what
I want to do next is I want to fetch
data from the API and then bring it into
the home screen or the reddit's page so
we need to create a service for that and
if you've used angular 2 you know that
when you're making any kind of requests
to a third party API you want to put
that in a service you don't want to
stick it in a single component because
you probably want to access it from
multiple components so we're going to
create a folder inside the app folder
called services and let's go ahead and
create a file and we're going to call
this reddit dot dot TS alright and this
is going to work just like any angular 2
service we're going to import the
injectable package so that we can inject
it as a dependency ok all this stuff is
the same it's going to be from angular
core we also want to use the HTTP module
so we're going to say import HTTP from
angular slash HTTP let's see why is that
up I put three T's all right and then
we're also going to use observables
we're going to use reactive extensions
so we're going to say import rxjs /rx
alright and that's all we need to import
so let's add the injectable decorator
there and then we can create our class
so export class and we're going to call
it reddit service
all right so let's define our properties
we have our HTTP I'm going to set that
to the type of any we also are going to
set the base URL and that's going to be
a string all right now let's create a
constructor okay now in order to use the
HTTP module we have to inject it as a
dependency right here so let's say HTTP
and then we're just going to set this
HTTP equal to HTTP okay and then let's
define the base URL so the base URL for
the reddit API is going to be HTTP WWE
at comm /r alright and then let's create
a function called get posts and this get
post is going to take in category and a
limit alright and then what we're going
to do is return this dot HTTP we're
going to use the HTTP module and we're
going to make a get request okay so
we're going to make a get request to
this dot base URL and then we want to
concatenate the category so we're going
to put slash and then category and then
here we're going to say slash top dot
jason and limit equals and then we'll
concatenate that limit variable all
right so that's making a request to
something like this alright so this is
an observable so we have to add a dot
map to it so let's get rid of that
semicolon and say dot map and we want to
map the response to res dot JSON
and that's it that will return all the
posts to us as an observable all right
so let's save that and that should do it
for our service very simple so when we
create a service we're going to add it
as a provider in the app component TS
file so let's go up here and say import
a reddit service all right and let's see
where is that going to be from so we're
going to go dot slash services slash
reddit dot
it alright now we're just going to add
it as a provider right here providers
which is an array and then we're just
going to add reddit service that's it so
we'll save it and then we're going to go
back to our edits component so pages
Redditt
reddit TS and then we're going to bring
the service in here as well let's see
Ward's reddit service okay so that's
going to be from dot dot slash dot dot
slash app slash services slash reddit
dot
okay so that brings it in now we have to
inject it as a dependency so in the
constructor we'll put a comma here and
say private reddit service just like
that okay and then what I'm going to do
is we're going to use a life cycle hook
called ng on and knit and this just this
runs whenever the component is rendered
so for instance if we say console log on
in it
in and save it and we'll open up the
console here and see right here you'll
see on and it ran all right so what we
want to do here is we want to use that
service function that get posts now I'm
not going to put it directly in here I'm
actually going to point to another
function called get posts and it's going
to take in a category for now I'm just
going to hard code sports and then the
limit will say five all right so let's
create get posts all right so get posts
is going to take in category and limit
and then we're going to use the service
so reddit service dot get posts we're
going to pass in the category and the
limit and then it's an observable so we
need to use dot subscribe and in here
we'll pass along response and we're
going to use an arrow function and then
for now let's just console dot log the
response
okay so we'll save that and we should
get a response down in the console
hopefully yep there it is okay so we get
this data children and then we should
have our articles okay you'll see yeah
we have the title right there okay so
what we want to do with this response is
we want to make it available want to
make the posts available to our template
all right so we're going to add them as
a property so what's up here we'll add a
property called items set it to any and
let's see we're gonna
just going to think for a second okay so
we're going to say this dot items and
we're going to set that to response dot
data dot children okay and then we
should have access to those within the
template now because we set this dot
items all right so the items should be
available in reddit's dot HTML so let's
go there
and we're going to use some custom ionic
directives here we want to list so let's
say I n list and inside there we'll have
an item alright now this I an item this
is where we want to loop through the
items so we're going to use an NG four
okay and if you know angular 2 you know
what an NG four is it's just a for loop
we'll say what item of items all right
and then in here
let's just let's test it out we'll put
an h2 and we can use some interpolation
here so that we can use a variable I'm
going to say item dot data dot title
okay save that and there we go now we're
getting titles all right so if we were
to change this to ten we could get ten
of them all right so we want the
thumbnail in here so what we're going to
do is use another ionic directive called
iron thumbnail
okay now we only want this if there's
actually a thumbnail so we're going to
use an NG if so we'll say if item dot
data dot thumbnail then we want to
display an image with the source and the
source will be that ID item dot data dot
thumbnail okay so then we have the title
now I'm also I also want the thumbs up
and the number of comments so under the
h2 let's put paragraph and let's put I
on - icon okay so this takes in a name
we're going to use the thumbs up icon
thumbs up and let's see to get that from
the API we use item dot data dot score
okay that'll give us the amount of
thumbs up alright and then let's saw
let's copy that
oops okay and then this one here we're
going to use the chat boxes icon and
then we're going to use item dot data
num underscore comments all right so
let's take a look at that and let's see
why is that not aligned oh we're going
to want on the thumbnail we're going to
add item - left alright now if you want
to to learn more about oops to learn
more about the elements that ionic
offers let's see ionic -
in list right here component
documentation and you can see all the
different stuff over here alerts and
buttons and lists okay it's different
kind of lists we're using this thumbnail
list right here so you can see it
actually gives you the code all right
this is a really good resource for
information on ionic so that looks good
let's add some spacing between these two
icon things here so I'm just going to
put in and bsp twice all right so that
looks good now the next thing we're
going to want to do is have a button to
link to the single reddit or the single
post so let's go under the paragraph
here and we're going to put a button
we're going to give it a attribute of I
in button clear and we want to align it
to the right so item right alright and
let's give this the text of view and
then what we want to do here is add an
event so it's going to have a click
event and this is just standard angular
2 if you want an event you just put it
in parenthesis and we're going to call a
function called view item all right and
we're going to pass along item dot data
so everything to do with that single
item in that loop and that iteration is
going to be passed along to this
function alright so let's go ahead and
save that and then we'll go back to
Reddit ts and we'll add view item now
what we want to do is we want to switch
pages so that's what this nav controller
is for so we should be able to say
actually first of all we wanted to take
in the item and then we're going to say
this dot nav controller dot push that's
how we can change pages
we want to go to details page which we
haven't created yet so don't worry about
that we will and we can send parameters
along with it and we just want to send
that item all right now the details page
we're going to have to import once we
create it so let's say import details
page okay and that's going to be from
details slash details so let's go ahead
and create that inside pages we're going
to create a new folder called details ok
new file details dot TS details dot HTML
and let's just copy what we have in
about HTML okay and right here for now
we'll just say details save that then
we'll copy what we have in the about TS
ok we'll change this to details my Moses
my mouse batteries are running out
details page all right so again we
created a new page so we have to add it
to app dot module ok that's going to be
from pages details details
all right we're going to add that here
make sure you put a comma save that all
right so if we click view now this is
something that happened you'll see that
this is kind of weird right now if I
click that it actually takes us to the
page now to get rid of that step in
between that weird step which took me a
while to figure out we need to get rid
of the selector for details okay so for
some reason that it causes it to do that
so if we just get rid of that and let's
reload and now if I click view it just
takes us right to details okay all right
so so far so good now remember we want
to access the item that were that is
being passed in so to do that we're
going to use the nav params package
which is part of ionic angular so right
here we can add nav params alright and
then down here let's add a property for
the item should I say any all right and
then what we'll do is just say this dot
item equals actually you know what we
have to inject that as a dependency
right here so we'll say public grams and
set that to nav per Am's
okay and then right here will say params
dot get and we want the item per am and
that's it will now have access to that
entire item so save that and then we'll
go into the details HTML and for
instance let's change this we should be
able to say item dot title save and now
if we click view you'll see that the
title is now the actual title of that
subreddit all right we have access to
all the data for that item
now I want to use a card for this page
so if we look at the documentation and
we go to cards let's look at see as I
scroll down this will change to just
cool I think we want that the image yep
this right here image cards so I'm going
to copy this and then we're going to
paste that in here
okay now let's change the image right
here and we can actually get this with
item dot preview dot images you could
use item thumbnail but it's going to be
very small and expanded so it's the
resolution is going to look really
crappy so some of the posts will have an
image here so images we want the first
one in the array and then we want dot
source dot URL and then right here will
be the title so put item dot title
alright and then we'll get rid of this
paragraph and what I want here is a list
so we'll say I enlist okay we'll put I
in let's say I an item
and we're going to use an icon here so
let's say I an icon and this is going to
be the person icon and let's assign it
to item left okay and let's say author
and then we're going to use I and note
and let's put item dot author okay that
should give us the author so let's save
that see what we get so far if we click
this okay that one actually doesn't have
an image alright so you can see we have
the author here let's actually give this
note I and right I mean item right all
right so now you can see it's aligned
over all right and if we want to get rid
of this right here if it doesn't have an
image we should be able to copy that and
just give this an ng-if and then just
paste that in there
unhandled promise cannot read property
what ng if it's kind of weird expected
token oh maybe I don't need these huh
that's still showing
all right well I'm just going to keep
that for now I don't want to slow the
video down if you guys want to look into
that you can if you don't like that icon
right there and if you have a solution
go ahead and post paste it in the
comments so just take that out for now
all right now under the author I want
the score and the comments so let's copy
this I an item ok we'll paste that in
twice this one here is going to be the
score so change this to item dot score
and then for the icon we're going to
give it thumbs up this one here will be
chat boxes okay so say comments and
change this to num underscore comments
all right and then finally we just want
to link to the actual reddit page so
we're going to go under the list and
we'll put an a tag but we want to format
it as a button
let's give it a target of blank so it
opens in a new window
and then the H ref
okay now the href is going to be HTTP
reddit.com slash and then we can insert
double curly braces and then item dot
permalink all right so let's save that
and then okay that looks good view on
reddit opens it in a new page cool let's
add a block attribute to this as well
that just makes it go all the way across
all right good so we can now list all of
our edits we can view this individual
post so that's good now the next thing I
want to do is I want to have a filter up
here so that we can filter out the
categories so to do that lets go to
reddit's dot t ml and we're going to go
above this iron list and we're going to
create another iron list okay so let's
see it's to iron item and we'll have a
label say iron label and let's add the
fixed attribute here and the label will
say category and then we're going to
have a select button so I in - select
and let's say what we want to happen is
when this changes we want to we want to
function to emit so let's put in an
event handler of iron change okay with
it with standard angular - it would just
be changed but with ionic its iron
change alright and we'll say change
category alright and we're going to add
an NG model here
okay we want to bind this to the
category property and we also have to
have a name with the same value alright
so inside the Select we're going to have
a bunch of options I'm just going to
grab these and paste them in now you can
use any subreddit any categories you
want I'm just using these ones alright
so let's go ahead and save that
and now you see we have a select list
all right it's not going to do anything
yet because we need to create the change
category function so let's go to Redditt
TS and we'll go down here and say change
category now we want to set category as
a property here so let's say category NE
and let's see let's actually add limit
as well and then what we'll do is create
a get defaults function okay so let's
say get defaults and for now we're just
going to set this dot category equal to
sports and we'll set this dot limit
equal to ten all right now this get
defaults we want to run automatically in
the constructor so we'll say this dot
get defaults like that and then instead
of passing hot the hard-coded values
into this get post we're going to pass
in this dot category and this dot limit
alright and then when we change the
category what we're going to do is just
call this again
okay and this time this doc category is
now bound to this right here this
ng-model so it'll change to whatever we
select so let's change let's save that
and you'll see it's automatically set to
sports now if I change it to food and
click OK it changes them all all right
some reason news doesn't have any images
but that's alright alright and it's not
the app it's the API for some reason
that category does it have images okay
so that's working the filtering is
working now what we want to do is the
settings okay so for settings we're
going to have it's going to be kind of
similar to this so I'm going to copy
what we have here in reddit CS and paste
it in settings TS alright and then we'll
just change that that settings alright
it's going to have the items category
and limit X I'm sorry we don't need the
items and let's see we're bringing in
the reddit service and we don't need get
posts or view item or change category we
do want to get defaults so let's go
ahead and save that Oh actually we don't
want the ng on and Eddie that we don't
need that so let's save that alright so
now we need to do the template right now
it's just this we need to have our forum
where we update the limit in the
category so let's go to settings HTML
and I'm going to just paste this in and
go over it so we have a form with a
submit function of set defaults and then
we have
a field here this is just like we have
on the homepage we have the ng model
category and then the different
categories then we have another select
list for limit ng model is limit and our
limit numbers and then just a button to
save changes all right so let's save
that and now if we click settings you
can see this is already set to sports
and ten that's because we have the get
defaults right here now what we want to
happen when we submit this form is we
want to take the values and add them to
local storage so let's create our set
defaults and we're going to say local
storage dot set item and we want to set
the category and we just want to set it
to this stock category okay we're going
to want to do the same thing with the
limit so we'll save that and say limit
set that to this dot limit all right so
that's going to be whatever it is in the
form that we submit okay and then what
we want to do excuse me is just navigate
back to the reddit's page so we're going
to say this dot nav controller dot push
and we want to go to Redditt
page which we have to import and we
don't need the details page so we'll
just replace that alright and then we
just want to change the get default here
and in the reddit's so we need to check
local storage if there's something there
we're going to set it to that instead of
this so let's say if I'm going to say if
local storage dot get item
category is not equal to null so if it
is set then we're going to set this
stock category equal to local storage
get item category okay and then we'll
have an else else then we'll just use
this alright and we're going to do the
same thing with limit copy that
so this will be limit okay set that
limit set this limit and we'll set it to
ten
by default all right so that's our new
get defaults so we also want this same
thing in the reddit's component so let's
just copy that okay we'll save this
alright we're going to go to reddit's
dot t-- s and we're just going to
replace that and save and it should be
at sport still and ten because we
haven't changed it now let's go to
settings and let's change this to 5
click OK and then save all right now you
can see it's updated to 5 if we go and
we set to let's say food click OK save
now we have our food posts and if we
reload it's still food all right so our
application is essentially done the
about page we can just go to about HTML
and I'm just going to throw this in here
just some date just some text all right
so that's it that is our application now
if you want to run this in the emulator
we're going to have to go to our command
line and you're going to have to add the
platform so if you want it to be an iOS
app you need to do I think it's no it's
Cordova platform ad and you could do iOS
but we're going to do Android
all right so that took about two minutes
or so now we want to test it in Android
in the emulator so let's say ionic run
Android and that might take a couple
minutes to startup
all right so it should be starting up
all right so looks to be working let's
go ahead and try to change the category
hope I can't stand house whole this
thing is so safe food okay and there we
go so that change good
so settings let's say we want just five
click OK and we'll save it and now we're
only getting five good so settings are
working check the about page that looks
good alright so we now have our
application now if you want to build the
apk file and try to get that installed
on your physical device you can do ionic
build Android
and let's open up the folder so let's
see projects I an read it it should
build out actually it should tell us the
directory that it builds it in when it's
done okay so there's the the directory
so it should be in platforms Android
build outputs apk and there it is so you
can take this and if you google how to
install an apk file on a physical
Android should it should tell you how to
do that
alright so that's going to be it for
this video hopefully you guys enjoyed it
if you did please subscribe please leave
a like if you didn't like it leave a
dislike whatever you can do and this is
based on a couple of the projects in my
angular 2 projects 12 projects course so
you probably want to check that out if
this interests you is kind of stuff
