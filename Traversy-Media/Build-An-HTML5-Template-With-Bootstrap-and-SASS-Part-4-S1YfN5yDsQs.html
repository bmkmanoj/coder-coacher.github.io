believe of the bootstrap sass template
series right now we have all of our base
HTML done for our inner pages we have
our column for main content and sidebar
so now we're going to go in and add the
content for those as well as if we look
at the the main site we have this area
for our team members we have a
testimonial so we're going to add that
stuff as well all right so let's go to
our boat HTML file and basically what we
have is the navigation the header and
navigation then we have a section for
the top in ER which is this area here
with the search bar then we have another
section for the slogan or whatever
alright so now we need to put this
content in alright so first we have the
carousel which is actually pretty easy
to to implement all right if we go to
the get bootstrap com
and go to JavaScript
and over here you can see carousel click
on that alright so basically it gives
you the code for it so we'll copy that
and then go to our boat page and we want
to be in the section main that we
created and we want to be in the eighth
column dev okay I'm just going to paste
all that in indent it alright so
basically what we need to add to this is
our items okay so we have the first item
we have an image with the source going
to nothing so right here we want to put
our image name and forget what it is is
it okay so we have slide 1 slide 2 and
slide 3 okay so this is going to be
image / slide 1
and I'm just gonna
I'm just going to copy this whole item
we'll do that two more times you just
want to get rid of the active class only
the first one should have that and then
we'll just change this to slide two and
this to slide three save let's check it
out
all right so it's working good we see
this three dots down here we're going to
get rid of those which is you know what
we can get rid of the whole carousel
caption div because we're not using
captions make it even simpler
you can use captions if you want
Oh get rid of this
all right good so next what do we have
we have our just basic text we have a
page header and then a couple paragraphs
so let's do that you want to go right
under the carousel div which ends right
here
and let's see what are we going to do
each two
this is a boat and I'm just going to
grab a couple paragraphs real quick
okay so I just have two paragraphs
save
okay so there's our text
now what I want to do is the sidebar
which has a list and some accordions or
collapse modules okay so let's do that
we'll go under the powerbomb actually
want to go into this column md4 and we
want to use that feature list that we
used on the home page so if we go to
index and where is it right here this
unordered list feature I'm just going to
grab that
okay actually we need a heading 2 so H
we wanted H to whoops
h2 class page header
okay
then under the list we're going to have
our accordions so let's go to the
bootstrap website and same page
JavaScript you want to click on collapse
and we're going to copy this oops
okay
and you want to go right under the
unordered list piece that in
and I'm just going to change the titles
of these okay this first one will say
who we are
this one will say what we do
and this one why choose us and just
gonna um
I'm going to emphasize the what the who
what and why okay so we want to put a
span with the class whoops
a class of eeehm - primary
okay copy that
put that around what
and why
we've got one two
three all right yeah that's good let's
check that out
all right I want to I want to remove
some of this text not have so much in
each slide
all right
it's a little too much text gone but
that's fine
all right so next
let's see we get that all right so next
we want to do the meet our team section
so we want to go under the last section
which is here
and let me just
grab this
all right so four columns we're going to
want four columns which are I'm sorry
for dibs which I have three columns each
so that's one two three four and then in
each one will have a block so block
it's going to have a block light class
also block center and block image
all right and then we'll have the
headshot image so C is going to be image
/ headshot one dot jpg and then an h3
tag Jane Doe and then just a paragraph
with some sample text
all right
so we can copy this
and actually
we're going to rotate from block block
light to I guess just block alright so
let's take away
lock light for the second and the fourth
all right so that will be the team next
we have a testimonial section
and this is going to be
this is going to be a 12 column div 12
and it's going to be a blockquote
blockquote styles are going to go into
our typography s CSS file so this is
going to have a class of block quote
reverse now block won't reverse if we go
to the final page here you can see that
this border on the right here that's not
the default the default is to have that
on this side but I want the text to
start over here and have the board over
here so that's going to have a class of
block quote reverse and I believe that's
a bootstrap core class actually we also
want to have the class just block quote
all right and then inside there I'm just
going to paste in this quote okay
basically it's an h1 and then we have an
emphasis tag around Nelson Jackson and
that's it
and that's actually that's it for the
about page okay so let's check it out
all right so it looks horrible but it's
looking exactly how it's supposed to all
right
these images here actually we got to
change the name of the image but they're
at full size right now but when we get
into the CSS we're going to make them
the correct size but for now let's just
changed headshot to it shot three and
four all right
so now we want to move on to the
services page
and let's take a look at the final page
okay so same thing we have a main area
we have a sidebar in the sidebar we're
going to have a tab module and then a
quick form and then we'll have this
section here with the icons and that's
that's it that's all it's going to be
different from the about page alright so
go to services and go down
on this page we don't have a slogan but
I actually want to put it there so I'm
going to copy it from a boat
okay go right above section main
oh actually we do have it there
nevermind scratch that
alright so section main we're going to
have some text and these videos are
getting kind of long so I'm going to do
some copying and pasting okay so in the
eighth column div I'm going to paste in
I'll go over what I pasted it in we have
a heading alright then we have two
paragraphs and then a line couple line
breaks and then we're starting a
accordion okay so this is basically the
same code that's in the about page for
the accordion let me just indent this
all right so basically we're just having
the title service one service - all
right so save that take a look
all right so it looks good so the
sidebar let's see what we have our tab
module so I'll go to the bootstrap site
and click on tab
and basically they don't give you the
code with the content here so if we do a
actually going to use Chrome tools by
pressing f12 and then use the this
magnifying glass so I can see the code
and I want to grab
who I want here
this div class BS example tabs and then
I'm going to right-click and then copy
as HTML
and go back into our sidebar which is
the call for dev paste that in
okay looks a little messy but what are
you gonna do
okay so let's check that out
all right
so we don't need this drop down to
happen so I'm going to let see me of Li
Li I'm going to copy this profile list
item and oh and just paste it over this
this Li with the class of drop-down and
then I'll just change this actually
going to change all these so this will
be services I'm sorry
support
change this to a boat and change this to
services
now I want to change the class here
and get rid of this these BS tags
classes and we want this to be tab on a
class of tab and also tab primary
because it's going to be that blue color
all right
in this class active on the list item
for services actually want to put that
on the about the Middletown
okay let's see this fix that link all
right so that's good for now next in the
sidebar we have our quick quote form
which I'm going to paste in it's quite a
bit of HTML and this will go right under
the the tab div here which ends right
here
I'm going to paste this in basically we
have a div with the class of block block
primary head okay so that style is going
to look like this so it'll have a
heading alright we can put an icon there
and we don't want to have any padding in
this in the block itself we want the
padding to go in here in the content all
right so that's why we have an
additional class here of no pad alright
so we have an h3 with the icon pencil
icon then we have a div called block
content okay which surrounds the form
and in the form we have a name phone
number email message and button ok the
button has a class of button primary
all right so that's the form so next
we're going to have the what we do area
and we can tell right away that it's
going to be a section primary because it
has the blue background all right so we
want to put that under the what section
is this under the section main
so actually let me just copy our little
snip it
wait a minute
all right so section is going to have
class section primary
under the container I'm going to put a
page heading
all right and this will say what we do
all right so we have a row and then
we're going to have four gonna have
three for calling dibs
and then inside each one we're gonna
have a block
block and then also give it a class of
block icon and that should be good okay
inside there we're going to have a div
the class of icon and then we want an
icon okay this one is going to be F a F
a home and then the size will be F a
three okay so that's the icon' div
underneath that I'll have another div
with the class of icon content
and we'll have an h3 alarm of some
each three
in that a paragraph
now I'm just going to copy the block div
and we want it here
here and we actually want another row of
them as well if you look at here we have
two rows of them of these icon so what
I'm going to do is copy the entire row
and then paste it underneath here
okay
and it's not going to look very good yet
all right so that's the services page we
still have to do the blog in the contact
page so we'll do those in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
