bug replay by clicking on the link in
the description below hey what's going
on guys so I know that a lot of you
really like the project videos where we
build something from start to finish and
those are the kind of the
bread-and-butter videos of this channel
but today I want to do something
different that may not be as fulfilling
visually in the browser but will really
up your vanilla JavaScript game so what
I want to do is talk about some of the
higher-order array methods as well as
writing them in a shorter and more
elegant way using es6 arrow functions so
we'll be working with methods like map
filter sort reduce and I'm sure a lot of
you that are I wouldn't say new to
JavaScript but a lot of you that don't
really understand how these work have
seen these quite a bit and a kind of
confused by them so hopefully this video
can clear it up for you and you can see
what they actually do we're not going to
do anything too too advanced but we will
explain how they work and what the
benefit is and we'll actually compare
them to like a for loop which you know
you would do back in the day so learning
these methods will really help you be a
better programmer I mean you can do
react and angular tutorials and you can
really master the framework but you want
to do stuff like this so that you really
understand the language that's
underneath those frameworks now a lot of
you guys know and have actually
purchased the 21 hour course that I have
on udemy modern JavaScript from the
beginning and we do talk about these
methods but not as much as I would have
liked to so I'll actually be adding some
of this material as well as as well as
some new material that has to do with
functional programming into that course
alright so like I said this isn't gonna
be like a project where we build
something in the UI we're just going to
use the Google Chrome console for our
it but it's really gonna up your a
programming game if you don't know about
these methods so if you want to follow
along all you have to do is create an
index.html file and a main dot J's file
and the HTML file is very simple it's
just basic head body tags I have an h1
and then a link to the main dot J s and
in the main dot J s we have two arrays
one's called companies and it has just a
bunch of objects with a name a category
and a start and end date for that
company
so they're basically companies that are
done with and then we just have a simple
numbers array called ages all right so
these are the methods we're going to
look at so for each is basically just an
easier way to are in a better way to
loop through an array rather than using
like a for loop it doesn't return
anything back to you like some of these
other ones do but it is a much much
nicer and more elegant way to loop
through data so if the first thing I
want to do is just do a standard for
loop just so we can compare what they
look like and I know a lot of you guys
already know this stuff but let's create
a variable called I set it to 0 and then
we're gonna say as long as I is less
than companies which is the array above
dot length so as long as it's less than
the number of companies in that array
and then we want to increment by one
through each iteration and let's just
console.log each company so we'll say
companies and then we need to pluck out
the current index with the variable I so
it starts at 0 each iteration it'll add
one to I and it'll print that out so
let's save and run and you can see we
get that in the console now I'm using
live server from vs code that's why when
I saved it just automatically loaded so
I don't have to keep reloading alright
so that's a basic for Labine I know that
most you guys know this so let's take a
look at for each alright so for each we
can just take the actual array so
companies and we can just say dot for
each and then what that does is it takes
in a callback function okay and this is
synchronous this is not an asynchronous
callback so this takes
in what can take in three different
things so we need basically like an
iterator something that we can use for
each company or whatever is in the array
so I'm just gonna call this company but
you can also get the index and you can
also get the entire array okay so those
are the three things that can be passed
in and that's the same with most of
these high order methods so in here
we'll just go ahead and console dot log
and let's just log company
all right we'll comment out this for
loop and save and we get the same thing
okay so this looks a lot nicer than this
there's no setting I
there's no brackets with I it's just
this is much nicer looking much better
and if we wanted to get just like the
name we could just do company name and
there we go alright so very simple as
I'm sure a lot of you guys already know
about for each so let's move on to
filter so what filter does is it allows
us to do just that filter things out
from the array so let's say that we want
to look at this ages array and we want
to get all of the ages that are 21 and
over all right now I'm gonna first do
this with a for loop so we would define
we would define an empty array we'll
call it can drink because we want 21 and
over and we would set that to an empty
array and then we would do the for loop
so it would have to do let me just move
this we would have to define our high
variable let I equals 0 as long as I is
less than ages dot length and then
increment by 1 and then what we would do
is take well first we would have to do
an if statement and we're going to say
if ages I so if the current iteration is
greater than or equal to 21 then we
won't we would take that can drink
sorry about that banging guys we would
take that can drink array and we would
push on to it we would add to it using
dot push and we would pass in ages I so
whatever the current age the current
iteration is
all right and then we could go down here
we could console dot log they can drink
array okay so we'll go ahead and save
that and now we have an array of 21 and
over okay so you can see 12 16 5 these
aren't in the array so that's how we
would do it with a for loop so let's do
this let's do the same thing with filter
so all we have to do is define a
variable again we'll call it can drink
and we can set it equal to ages dot
filter and then this takes in a function
just like the for each did and we're
gonna pass in I will call this age okay
and we can also get the index and stuff
like that if we want but then we just
have to do our condition which off which
will be if age age is greater than or
equal to 21 then all we have to do here
is return true okay there's no creating
an array and then pushing on to it we
just simply do the condition and return
true so we'll go ahead and just comment
this out and save and you can see we get
the same exact thing alright so this
looks a lot nicer than this now we can
even make this better we can actually
put this all into one line using es6
arrow functions so let's again create
the can drink and set it to ages dot
filter and inside here instead of doing
function like we did above we're just
going to put in the parameter of age and
we're gonna set an arrow function and
then put the condition which is age is
greater than or equal to 21 and that's
it that will work so let's go ahead and
just comment this out and save and we
get the same thing alright so we went
from this ugly piece of code to this
nice elegant one liar
alright so if you are applying for a job
or you're just showing someone your code
if you have this instead of this then
it's gonna make you look like a better
pro
all right so these these methods are
really important you don't want to be
doing things this way when we have this
available all right so we're gonna do a
couple more examples of filter just in
case it's it's still not registering so
let's go ahead and actually gonna put
some comments in here we'll say get 21
and older just so it's clear what's
going on because I want it I want I'm
gonna put this code in the description
for you guys this next one let's go
ahead and filter the retail companies
okay each company has a category and we
want to get just an array or not an
array
well yes an array but we're not creating
a new one like we would with map which
we'll get to but we're just gonna filter
the ones out that are retail so we'll
create a variable called retail
companies and we'll set that to
companies dot filter and then here I'll
go ahead and do the the es5 version
first and we'll pass in these are
companies so I'll just call this company
okay and then we want to do our
condition and the condition is if
company dot category is equal to retail
oops
retail then we simply want to return
true all right so we'll go down here and
let's just consult log a retail
companies and save and now we have three
objects in our a company two four and
nine and those all have the category of
retail all right so what I want you to
do now if you want of course is pause
the video and try to do this in the
shorthand way using arrow functions all
right see if you can do that and then
come back and then we'll go ahead and do
that so we would just create again
retail companies set it to companies
if I can spell companies dot filter and
then we would put in here the parameter
company
now the reason I'm not putting
parentheses around this like this is
because it's only one parameter okay we
can do this in fact if you had more than
one here like if we were getting the
index as well then we would have to have
parentheses but since we just have one
parameter we don't actually need these
parentheses all right so then what we
would do is the the condition which is
company I can't spell company for some
reason dot category equals or is going
to be equal to retail all right so let's
comment this out and save and we get the
same thing okay so let's do let's do all
the companies that started in the 80s so
you can see we have 81 we have 89 so we
want to filter all of the companies from
the 80s let's do that so we'll go ahead
and say get eighties companies I don't
know and we'll create a variable we'll
call it companies or we'll call it
eighties companies and we'll set it to
companies and if you guys want to pause
it and try this on your own do feel free
to do that
so we'll say filter and I'm just gonna
do with the shorthand way right off the
bat so say company and what's our
condition gonna be if we want from the
start date okay remember they have a
start and end we want the start to be
between 80 and 89 so we'll put a
condition here that'll be actually we
want to wrap this in parentheses so
we're gonna say company dot start is
let's see we're gonna say it's greater
than or equal to 1980 and
oh my god I cannot spell company I
should have chose a different resource
so company dot starts is will say less
than 1990 all right so that should do it
has to be greater than or equal to 1980
and less than 1990 and that should work
so let's go ahead and console.log
eighties companies and save we get five
and if we take a look here we have 1 4 6
&amp;amp; 7 &amp;amp; 9 and if we look at the years
they're all in the 80s alright so let's
do one more with filter let's get all
the companies that lasted at least 10
years okay so some of these guys lasted
more some lasted less than 10 years for
instance 99 to 2007 2011 to 6 2016 so
some of these didn't last 10 years so we
want the ones that did all right so it's
what a comment here will say gets
companies that lasted 10 years or more
all right so we'll say con still say
lasted 10 years we'll set it to
companies dot filter okay so company and
then what we want to do here is we want
to wrap this in parentheses and we'll
say company dot end okay so we want to
take the end date and we want to
subtract oops I want to subtract company
dot start all right and then in addition
to that we want to make sure that that
is greater than 10 so that's how we
could get it so say console dot log last
to 10 years and save and now if we look
at our array so we have 81 223 92 well
actually I wanted to do greater than or
equal
ten years because there is one that was
ten years Sookie accompany seven was 86
to 96 so now that's included alright so
I think that's enough with filter you
can see how elegant it is and how easy
it is to just kind of pick out certain
things from the array or certain values
in this case our company objects but
let's move on to map all right so map
works a little bit differently instead
of just filtering things out we can
create new arrays of anything really
from a current array so let's do let's
just grab all of the company names and
put them into their own array
okay so we'll say create array of
company names
all right so we'll create a variable
called company names we'll set it to
companies dot and map and then all we
have to do is pass in our company this
can also take index in the entire array
and actually let's do it let's do it
this way first and you know I mean you
don't have to use arrow functions if you
don't want it's completely up to you
so company and then down here all we
have to do is simply return company dot
look company dot name all right we'll
console.log that sir
and what we call it company names and
save and there we go so now we just have
a simple array with each with all the
company names alright now we can do
whatever we want with this so I'm just
gonna copy this comment it out and I
don't know we'll just call this test and
then we could return like all ones if we
wanted to for each item in the array so
if we log test we just get an array of
ones all right if we wanted to let's
call this a test map actually if we
wanted to let's say each we wanted an
array with the name and then the start
to any air so we could do return you
know what let's let's actually use
template a template string here so with
es6 template strings this is the syntax
for a variable so we'll say company name
and then we'll just do some brackets and
in here we'll put the start to end date
so we could say company dot start and
then we'll just do a dash and then let's
say company dot end so let's try that
and now we just have a simple array what
each value is the name and then a set of
brackets with the start to end date so
you can format it however you want and
then if we wanted to do this the
shorthand way we could go ahead and
let's remove function or move the
parentheses as well so we'll say company
and use an arrow function we no longer
need the return or the curly braces so
on this side we'll get rid of these two
as well or just the curly braces and
that semicolon and that should work so
I'll go ahead and comment this out and
save and we get the same thing okay so
let's see let's do one more example with
map let's use the ages array so what
we'll do here is we'll take each one and
we
get the square root or we'll square it
we'll just use the math object for that
so let's say Const ages square and we'll
set that to ages dot map and then in
here we'll say age we'll use an arrow
and we'll just do math dot square root
or sq RT and we'll pass in age and
that's it so console dot log ages Square
and save and there we go now we have an
array of all of those numbers squared if
we wanted to do like if we wanted to
multiply each one by to say ages times
two and we could simply do age say age
times two
and save Lopes what I do
well forgot the parentheses and there we
go so we're gonna have each number times
two and if we wanted to actually use two
maps let's say we wanted to square it
and then times it by two we could get
rid of this semicolon and then just go
ahead and add another dot map and when
you do this usually you would put these
on separate lines like this to format it
so let's see what that gives us we'll
just call it let's just call this I
don't know age map and it'll change this
to age map and save see what we get so
what it did is it first squared all the
all the numbers and then it multiplied
them by two and we could keep going like
this and we can manipulate our data so
map is is very very powerful so now
let's take a look at sort okay so for
sort it works similar to the rest of
these functions we're gonna create a
variable let's call it sorted companies
and what I want to do here is sort the
companies by the start year okay from
the earliest year to the latest so we
say equals companies dot sort and sort
will take in a function and what we'll
do here is what we'll do here is we need
to pass in two values it basically takes
two in this case two companies and it'll
compare them in a way however we want to
we're going to compare the start dates
and then we return either one or
negative one to kind of move it up and
down in the in the array okay so for
each iteration it'll take two companies
and compare them so we need what's to
make this even more understandable will
say company one and company two and then
we just want to basically test the start
date so we'll say if c1 dot start is
greater than C
two dots star if that's true then we
want to actually return a one okay else
then we want to return a negative one so
that's how this works you want to return
one or negative one depending on your
condition so if we were to let's see why
am I getting this
I forgot my closing parenthesis so let's
console.log now the sordid companies and
save and let's see we still have our age
map let's get rid of that and if we look
now and we check out the years starts at
eighty one and you see that it's
actually sorted by the start date all
right so to write this in a shorter form
we could say sort of companies equals
companies dot sort now a lot of times I
use C one and C two up above but a lot
of times you'll see a and B okay it's
just kind of the standard so we'll say a
B and then let's do I'll say a dot
starts or I'm just kind of doing this
off the top of my head so we'll say a
dot start is greater than B dot star and
then we need to do the return 1 or
return negative one so what we'll do is
you will use a ternary operator so with
a ternary operator we put a condition
and then if that's true we put whatever
we want to happen here which I'm just
going to return a one else we use a
colon for else we want to return a
negative one not a negative a a negative
one all right and then I'm gonna just go
ahead and comment this out and let's
hope that that works so we'll look at
the dates and there we go so that's an
easier way to write this let me just put
a comment saying what we're doing sorts
companies by star ear
all right so hopefully that's helpful
guys let's do one more with sort
let's sorts ages so we just have a
simple numbers array we want to sort
that from you know lowest to highest so
I'm gonna say Const sort ages and we're
gonna set this to ages dots or and I
want to show you what happens if we just
do this so let's do console.log sort
ages and save and if we look at this it
looks like it works right away right
until we get to a single number or a
single digit number like five and it's
what it's doing is it's basically just
looking at the first number so to fix
this we need to again pass in a and B or
whatever you want to call it and then we
just simply need to say a minus B and
save and now you'll see five is at the
beginning if you wanted this in
descending order then you could just do
B minus a sorry about the yelling
upstairs and now you can see that five
is at the end all right so that's that
so let's talk about reduce a little bit
now reduce is I mean it can be used for
a lot of things and it can get quite
complicated we're gonna keep it simple
and we're gonna use it to let's add all
of the ages together so we have this
ages array with all the numbers let's
add these all together and I'm first
gonna do that with a for loop just so
you can kind of see the difference all
right so what we have to do is first
just create a variable we'll call it age
some set it to zero and then we'd have
to do our for loop which by itself is
just a pain in the ass so what I call
zero I is as long as I is less than ages
dot length and then I plus plus and then
what we would do is take age some the
variable we just created and we would
just kind of a pen
and two plus equals whatever that
iteration is so ages I oops all right
and then we could console dot log what
is it age sum and we get 460 so that's
all of those added together alright so
let's do this with reduce so we would
just create a variable called age sum
and we'll set that to ages dot reduce
and then in here we'll put a function
and let's say age actually I'm sorry
with reduce we need to do total and then
age and then we'll go down here and
we'll just return total plus age all
right and it's also going to take in a
second parameter of the total which is
going to be zero okay it's gonna start
at zero so let's take this and comment
this out and save and we still get 460
now this is kind of long it's actually
just as long or longer than the for loop
so to shorten this up we'd use an arrow
function so we'll go ahead and take away
the function will add our arrow and
let's get rid of the return and the
curly brace and we'll go over here get
rid of the curly brace and this
semicolon and that should do it as well
so we'll comment this out save and we
still get 460 all right so this is a
much more elegant way than doing it this
way so let's let's do another example
with reduce let's let's get the total
years for all companies so the the range
for each company will add all of those
up so get total years for
all companies so we'll say Const we'll
call this total years and we're gonna
set this to companies dot reduce here
we'll put company and then what we'll do
is just return I'm sorry this should get
total and company I always forget that
so total and company and then we want to
return total plus and in parentheses
we're gonna do the company dot end - the
company dot start okay and if we do just
that
let's go ahead and console.log total
years if we do just now we get this
weird looking thing that's because we
forgot the zero remember we have to add
that second parameter of zero okay now
we get 118 and just to test it out if I
go up here and I add an extra year to
let's say this top one will say 2004 to
save it we should get 119 all right so
it's taking the the length of time for
each company and adding them all
together so to do this in a shorter way
you're seeing arrow functions and if you
want to pause it and try this out
yourself and see if you get it right and
then that I mean that's a great way to
learn but what we would do is get rid of
the function we would add whoops at our
arrow we'll get rid of the return
and that get rid of that and that all
right and we'll comment this out and
save and we get 119 still all right so
that is for each map filter reduce and
sort now you can use any of these
together to do certain things so I'm
gonna give you an example it's not
really the most practical example but
let's let's combine methods so what
we'll do is we'll create a variable
called we'll just call it combined and
we're gonna set it to ages and let's
first do let's see let's first do map so
I want to map I want to times them all
by two all the ages so we'll say age
I'll use an arrow and we'll say age and
then multiply that by two so that on its
own and just put this on a new line that
on its own is going to give us an array
of all the ages times 2 which is console
dot log combined so we can see this kind
of morph alright so we have all the ages
times two you know what let me actually
comment out some of this other stuff
because they're getting sorted
get rid of that all right
so save that alright so now we just have
an unsorted array of all the ages now
let's say next we want to filter
anything that's 40 and over okay
and I'm doing 40 because we multiplied
everything so to do that we'll use a
filter and we'll say age and we'll say
any age that is greater than or equal to
40 all right so let's look at that and
now that filtered out anything that was
under 40 let's do a sort and we'll sort
them from lowest to highest so we want
to pass in our a/b values and then just
do a minus B save that now they're
sorted and now let's use reduce to add
them all together so we'll say dot
reduce and we'll pass in our a B and
let's just say a plus B and then add our
zero value for the total and let's save
that and we get 798 all right so you can
see we've used all four methods here to
manipulate our data all right so that's
gonna be it guys what I would suggest
for you is to maybe create your own data
set and try to you know pluck things out
manipulate it could create new arrays
from your array sort things and just try
to do some things on your own because
you're only gonna learn so much from
watching tutorials or even following
along with tutorials you want to
experiment with your own things alright
maybe even use some kind of external API
pull in the data and see what you can do
with it see what you can create with it
using these higher-order functions
