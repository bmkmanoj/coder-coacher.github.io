going to be building a parallax type of
website with some fixed images in the
background that we can you know we can
keep in place and we can scroll and see
different parts of the image in the
website background so this is what we'll
be building so we have a high quality
image here they're also they're all free
stock images I'll show you where to get
them and we just have that we have them
faded out a little bit we add a little
bit of opacity and then we have a
heading here and if I scroll down we
have a couple sections and in between
those sections we have other images as
three images in total and you can see as
I scroll you'll see different parts of
the image okay and it stays in place
same thing here we have the city
cityscape and we can see different parts
as we scroll and then we have the the
first image at the bottom again
alright so it's very simple but I think
this looks very clean and you guys can
use this in future projects so that's
what we'll be building in this mini
project so let's get started
this video is sponsored by dev Mountain
if you're interested in learning web
development iOS or UX design dev
Mountain is a 12-week design and
development bootcamp intended to get you
a full-time job in the industry to learn
more visit dev mountain comm or click
the link in the description below
alright guys so we're going to go ahead
and get started now I'm using atom for
my text editor but of course you can use
whatever you'd like I'm also using the
Emmet plugin for faster HTML for
creating divs and stuff like that
also using atom live server which is a
package that will let us just run this
file on our localhost instead of just
running it on the filesystem but you
don't need that that's you know it's
absolutely fine if you just open up your
your HTML files all right now I have a
folder called parallax website and all
these files will be available in the
description and we have an image folder
with three images okay so we have the
three city images and then I just
haven't blank h2 index.html file now for
these images you can either get them
from the project files or you can go to
texels tickets pixels comm which is just
an awesome
like for free stock images and then I
just search for city and I got this
image here this one and this one okay so
you guys can download those if you want
I got the 1080p the the 920 right here
the large okay so once you get that set
up we can go ahead and start on HTML so
I'm using Emmet so I can do just
exclamation tab and it'll give us kind
of you know our basic HTML structure
let's go ahead and change the title here
I'm just going to call this parallax
website demo and then we also need a
stylesheet because I don't want to put
the style in the HTML so I'm going to
create a folder called CSS and we're
going to create a file here called style
dot CSS and then we just need to link
that inside of our head so to put a link
tag and it's going to go to CSS slash
style dot CSS alright we're not using
any frameworks bootstrap anything like
that
alright now I'm going to open this up by
going to my Adam live server start
server but again you can just you know
open up your index.html file and I just
want to kind of explain the structure of
what we'll be doing with the HTML
alright so we have each section here
where the text is and then in between we
have our images okay and then we have a
caption for each image so basically each
one of these is going to be a div with
the class of either P IMG one for image
1 this will be P IMG 2 P IMG 3 and then
we have one again at the bottom and then
in between that we're going to have
section tags okay section is an html5
tag which will have a class called
section and also a class either section
light or section dark okay you'll see
there's you know two background colors
and that's pretty much it that's the
structure of our HTML so let's go ahead
and go back into Adam we're going to
start at the top here with the big image
and we're going to call this
we're going to give this a class of P
IMG one okay now inside these P IMG divs
we're going to have P text a class
called P text and that's the caption and
then inside that we're going to have a
span with the class of border okay and
let's put some text in here when did we
have parallax website okay and you guys
can use whatever text you want whatever
images you want it doesn't really matter
so if we go ahead and save that
this should auto reload to the school
there we go
so that's what we should have so far all
right and we're going to do all of the
HTML before we do any of the CSS that's
just how I like to I like to do things
some people will do you know certain
sections will do the HTML and then the
CSS go back to the HTML I just like to
do all the HTML and then go to the CSS
alright so we have our first p image 1
class which will be our first parallax
image now we want our section so let's
say section we're going to give it a
class of section we're also give it
going to give this a class of section
light so section - light okay and then
in here we're going to have an h2 and
we're just going to say section 1 and
then let's do a paragraph with some
dummy text now with Adam I can just type
in larom and then a number so I'm going
to say 100 this is going to generate a
hundred words of dummy text so if I
click tab you'll see it gives us a
hundred words all right so if we save
that and we take a look it should look
like this all right so now that we have
section 1 let's go on to the next
parallax image so I'm just going to copy
this and let's just put this right under
the section and we're going to call this
one P IMG - and then for the text here
let's just say image to text okay then
we're going to do our next section so
I'm just going to copy this
okay I tried to make the structure of
each smell extremely simple this is
going to actually be sectioned dark
though because I wanted to have a dark
background say section two and we'll
just keep the same text actually we'll
just get rid of a couple sentences I
guess all right so that's section two
then we want our third image so I'm
going to just copy the P image to here
and we're going to change it to P image
three we'll say image three text okay
and then we'll do our last section which
is also going to be dark so I'm going to
copy that okay this is going to be
section three and then down at the
bottom we're going to have the section
one I mean the P image one again so I'm
going to grab this copy that and put
that right under the section alright and
that's it that's it for our HTML so
let's go and take a look and it looks
stupid but we need to add our CSS okay
so let's go back to Adam and go to our
CSS and we're going to start off with
just adding some styles for the body as
well as the HTML tag alright so we're
going to do a few things here we want to
set the height to be a hundred percent
we want to set margin to be zero we
don't want any margin around the edges
and let's set the font size to 16 pixels
we're going to set the font family and
we're going to set that to Leto and then
a backup of will say sans-serif oops
alright and then we're also going to set
the line height actually let's let the
weight first the font weight which is
the you know the boldness we'll set that
to 400 and then we're going to set the
line height we're going to set that to 1
point 8 p.m. and then we're going to set
the color the default color of the text
to 666 which is just like a kind
a dark-gray all right so if we save that
and take a look that should be in effect
you can see that the text is bigger it's
lighter has a increased line height all
right so that's the body in HTML now
we're going to take care of so we're
going to take care of the images so
let's say we have we have classes of p
IMG one two and three so let's say dot p
IMG one and for that we're going to have
our background image sorry for that bang
outside people working outside URL and
then we want to point to the two image
one you'll see I have an IMG folder with
image 1 jpg that's what I want so we're
going to say dot dot slash because we
want to go outside of our CSS folder and
then into the IMG folder and then image
one dot jpg okay and then what I'm going
to do is set a minimum height of a
hundred percent for this image okay 100
percent of its container and then I'm
just going to copy that we're going to
do the same for the the next two images
we're just going to change this to two
and three and change image to image
three and those are all actually you
know what the first one is going to be a
hundred percent because that's the big
image alright and then the other ones
I'm just going to set to four hundred
pixels because those are smaller alright
and just to show you what I'm talking
about if we go back to the finished one
you'll see this is a hundred percent
height and then these ones they set to
four hundred okay and then the one again
down here is one hundred percent ok
hopefully that makes sense and by the
way that's what our site looks like
right now is this okay so it's coming
together next thing we want to do and
notice that it's not we don't have the
the parallax effect it's just shown it's
just showing the image there's no
scrolling effect or anything like that
all right so let's do let's add the
scrolling effect so we're adding this to
all
images so right above what we just did
we're going to save P IMG 1 P IMG 2 and
P IMG 3 because we want to supply to all
of these images alright so first thing
we'll do is today position:relative okay
we want to make sure the position is set
to relative I also wanted to have an
opacity I want to be they want them to
be a little bit faded so we're going to
say opacity and we're going to set that
to zero point seven zero all right and
then we're going to set the background
position I want it I want the images to
be centered so we're going to say
background - position and we're going to
set that to center all right now for the
background size I wanted to cover the
entire space so we're going to say
background sides and we'll set that to
cover and then we want to make sure that
these images don't repeat so say
background or Peaks set that - no -
repeat we don't want them to repeat
either horizontally or vertically okay
now if we save that and take a look it's
going to look like this now notice
there's still no parallax you know
scrolling effect to do that all we have
to do is add a background attachment
style so let's go right here and I'm
going to say background let's hate this
keyboard background attachment and we're
going to set this to fixed okay so let's
take a look now and now notice we have
that effect okay it's as simple as that
now I'm going to put a little comment in
here just so you guys know that if you
want to remove that effect you can just
set this to scroll instead of fixed so
let's say what do they do so we'll say
fixed
equals parallax and then we'll say
scroll equals normal okay just so you
guys know that you can ease
Changez in fact I'm going to add a media
query down below later and take away the
effect for mobile devices because
sometimes it can give you issues on
mobile devices all right so we
essentially have the effect now it's
just let's work on the sections make
those look a little better because if we
look you'll see that for the sections
there they're up against the edge and we
want to make these look a little better
also add the background colors and stuff
all right so let's go ahead and add in
our section class okay so I want the
sections to be aligned to the center so
we're going to study text align Center
and then I just want to add some padding
so for padding we're going to do 50
pixels on the top and bottom and 80
pixels on the left and right so let's
take a look at that okay so that looks
better now for the seed actually that's
fine yeah that's good now we need to add
the section darken section light class
so say dot section light so it's going
to have a background we don't really
need that section light because I guess
that's pretty much the default yeah
that's the default but we'll just add it
anyway so what's a background color is
white let's do a dark grey I mean a
light gray and let's say for the text
that's going to be 666 and that should
be good and then for the dark section
dark we're going to do a background
color let's see it's 2 8 2 e 3 4 so 2 a
2 e 3 4 and then for the color we're
going to do ddd which is a light gray
all right so let's go ahead and save
that I'll check it out and there we go
so we have our light which has a you
know a light grey background and then we
have our dark background
now we next thing we want to work on is
the P text
okay which we have inside them you
cannot you actually don't see the text
yet we have to position it absolute for
us to be able to see it so oh you can
see it up here right here but what we
want to do is position it absolute and
bring it into the middle make it bigger
make it uppercase and do some other
stuff so let's go ahead and add dot P
text okay so for this we're going to say
position position is going to be
absolute and we want to set top to 50%
because we want to bring it down halfway
we wanted to be in the middle vertically
we're going to set the width of it to a
hundred percent we're going to set the
text align to center we're going to set
the color to the default is going to be
black and then let's set the font size
so font size will set to 17 pixels
I'm sorry 27 pixels and we're going to
set letter spacing to 8 pixels letter
spacing is just you know the horizontal
spacing between each letter of the word
alright and then let's make it upper
case by saying text transform upper case
okay save that take a look and there we
go so now the the words are smack dab in
the middle of the images now I do want
to have the background which is the
border class remember we gave it a class
of border if we look at the HTML we have
a span with the class of border so let's
take care of that actually we'll do ap
text and then border just in cases of
border you know if you're adding on to
this and there's a border class
somewhere else so we're just going to
set the background color background
color will be 777 note 1 1 1
and then let's set the color to white
okay and then we're just going to set up
padding of 20 pixels save that and there
we go so it looks pretty good now I want
the option to not have this background
as well so what I'm going to do is for
these two image to text image three text
I'm going to give those a class of trans
fortran's parent all right so let's go
to our HTML we'll go right here to P
image 3 where we have the border and
we're just going to add trans and let's
do the same here on the border class
trans and C we're going to add dot P
text border dot trans and let's just set
the background color we're going to set
that to transparent alright so we'll
save that let's take a look and now
these two don't have that background
all right I'm actually going to just
change the text of that I think I add it
to traversÃ©e media you guys can
obviously put whatever you want you guys
are free to use this in any project you
want all my code anything that's on my
YouTube channel is completely
open-source you're free to use the only
thing that I ask is that you don't just
sell it outright alright but you can use
it in your project you know for your
company or whatever alright and that's
that's pretty much it guys if we take a
look now I do want to I want to disable
it for mobile devices or just show you
how to do that because if we go bring
this down I want to make it so that it
doesn't happen when it's at a certain
you know when when the window is at a
certain height so it's responsive so
let's just add and here a media query
we're going to say at media and we're
going to say max width
of five sorry about that bang guys 568
pixels so anything under five hundred
and sixty pixels this will be in effect
so we'll say dot P I M G 1 dot P IMG 2 P
IMG 3 and we're just going to set the
background attachment and we're going to
set that to scroll okay so now if we go
back and reload now it's just normal for
mobile devices and if I make this bigger
we still have the parallax effect
alright so I'm going to go before they
stop pushing me off at the banging
upstairs so hopefully this helped you
guys out you know understand how to do
this it's pretty easy I tried to layout
the HTML as simple as possible
