this is of the mean stack front to back
series in the last video we created our
login functionality and logged out so
basically we can go ahead and log in and
it will store it'll store the token and
the user data that it gets from the
server into our local storage and we can
also log out and basically clear out the
local storage so what we want to do now
is we want to be able to make
authenticated requests so if you
remember our profile route in the
backend is protected you need to send
along that token in order for for you to
be able to get back the data all right
in the way that you do that is you send
it in the header in the authentication
authorization with whatever it's called
so that's what we're going to do now
okay so let's go to let's see trying to
think of what I want to do we have our
profile here which basically in the HTML
is just profile works we haven't added
anything to it yet we basically just
generated the component you can see that
the PS file is just standard component
so let's go ahead and do the request so
we'll go to our authentication service
and let's go under the outside of key
user and let's call this get profile
okay and we're going to copy the
authenticate functionality here copy
that and let's change the endpoint to
users profiles profile and this is going
to be a get request not a post request
so we'll change that to get and then we
want to get rid of the second parameter
of user because we're not actually
sending but we're not actually sending
data okay we're just getting it now if
we just run this this is just a standard
get request we're going to get that
unauthorized
because we need to send the token so
what I'm going to do is create an extra
function down here called load token and
then what this is going to do is it's
going to fetch it from local storage
okay and then we'll be able to run it up
here and get that token so let's do the
const token and I'll set that to local
storage dot get item and remember we
sorted an ID underscore token okay and
then we just want to set this dot auth
token to that token we just pulled out a
local storage
remember this slot auth token is
actually a class property right here so
we can access that from anywhere so
inside to get profile we're going to put
this let's go right here and save this
dot load token okay so now that we've
done that we now have oxytocin we now
have access to this dot auth token okay
because we just we just grabbed it from
local storage and since it's a class
property we can access it from anywhere
so now we just want to add an extra
header here so let's say headers dot
append and it's going to be the
authorization
okay headers have to pass they have
different fields for includes the
content type which we set to Jason now
we're studying authorization and we're
going to set that actually just need a
comma there we're going to set that to
this dot auth token I cannot fight today
okay so we're sending the token with the
header to the request or to the endpoint
so I think that's all we need here yeah
it looks like it so let's save that
and then let's go to our profile
component TF file and we're going to
bring in the OP service it's going to be
we going to go up to levels services and
we also want to bring in the router I
went to that angular splash router okay
we need to inject those as dependencies
okay so so PLC router so that's a router
okay so when we go to this profile
component which we need to create a
route for we're going to load the the
user when it initializes so we want to
put that in the ng on an it so we'll
call this dot off service dot get
profile which is the function we just
created and that's an observable so we
want to stay subscribed and then that's
going to give us data which we'll call
profile and then let's set this dot user
equal to profile dot user okay and we
need to add user it's a property so up
here let's say user and such that to be
an object
let's see and then let's do if there's
an error for instance if we're not
authorized and we can just add right
here terror because it's an observable
observables will also return an error or
throw an error and we'll just console
dot log and let's return false all right
so let's save that now let's create the
profile HTML so we'll go to that and
what we're going to do is we're going to
say div and we're going to add an ng-if
which is just an if directive and we're
going to make sure that there's a user
before we actually load this so we're
just making sure that this value this
user has been filled right here okay so
if there's a user then let's say h2 and
give it a class of page header and let's
put the username enhanced so you use our
dot name and then we'll just put a ul
the collapse of list group li with a
class of list group item
and we're gonna have one more of those
and we're just going to put the users
username and also the email okay so it's
just it's getting it from from the
request so that should do it now
let's go and add a route so we need to
go to our app dot module TS and oh we
already have a rope all right so let's
try it out so go and login
today we're logged in and let's try to
go to profile and it works okay we're
fetching that from the server awesome I
really expected to Mars
so let's put the profile link up in the
nav bar so we'll go to navbar HTML and
see we also want to link to the
dashboard so I'm going to copy this
and let's paste it in twice ok so this
one here will be dashboard and then this
will be profile
all right so let's try that okay
dashboard dashboard works profile cool
now obviously we don't want this okay
this is very confusing because we're
logged in and we're seeing login and
register that doesn't make sense and
then if we're logged oh we shouldn't be
able to go to profile and stuff alright
in fact let's go ahead and log out and
we're able to go to dashboard but notice
if we go to profile we don't have that
data that's because we don't have we're
not sending the token so we're not
getting it now we want to take it a step
further and actually not be able to go
to these routes at all we want to be
redirected and we also don't want to see
them here so to do that we're going to
create what's called an authentication
guard which is basically just a service
where we can set some kind of logic and
return either true or false and then we
can insert that into the row itself now
we're going to install a module called
angular 2 JWT in fact let's look that up
go to the github page and we only need
to use a small part of this which is
right here okay so we're going to import
token not expired and then we just want
to create a function that will check if
we're logged in and it's going to just
return token not expired so it does
everything behind the scenes it's going
to check to see if the token is valid
and make sure that it hasn't expired
okay and then what we can do is we can
put this into our routes are not into
our routes put into our links and make
them show or hide depending on if we're
logged in or not ok and then we need to
just basically use this can activate
from our router and then just put that
in the route we want ok so it's a little
hard to explain but I'll just show you
so I'm going to stop the angular server
real quick and we're just going to do
make sure you're in your angular source
folder okay and then we're going to do
NPM install
angular 2 - GWT and then - - save okay
so that will install the module okay
once that's done we can go ahead and run
engine serve again and now let's go to
our off service and we're going to
import that now the package we want to
use is called token not expired so
that's what we're going to import okay
token not expired and it's going to be
from angular to GWT and then we're just
going to create a service function
called logged in and it's basically just
going to check to see if we're logged in
or see if the token is there and make
sure it's not expired so let's say
return token not expired and that that
should do it makes things very easy so
now we want to do is let's protect those
links in the menu so they don't show
when they're not supposed to so we'll go
to our nav bar HTML and then these two
links here these two I hate how it goes
out of the thing dashboard and profile
only want we only want those to show if
we're logged in so right here we're
going to we're going to use an NG if so
we're going to say ng if off service dot
logged in just like that and let's copy
that
put it here as well and then also for
the logout
like that alright so let's see if that
works
alright so now we're not logged in so
we're not seeing those now let's go
ahead and login okay and now we want to
hide the register and login links if we
are logged in so let's go ahead and
paste that same thing in except we're
going to put exclamation right there and
right there so we're saying if we're not
logged in then show those okay so now
those are hidden and home we just want
to show no matter what so now we just
want to protect these routes because if
I log out we can still go to dashboard
and we don't want that so let's create
our guard and I like to create a
separate folder for that so in our app
folder looks in our app folder let's say
new folder and we'll say guards and
we're going to create a file here called
auth dot guard dot TX now this is going
to be set up like a service so we're
going to import injectable okay so that
should be an uppercase I and it's going
to be from angular core and we also want
to bring in the router now we want to
bring in the can activate and that's
going to help us protect our roads
what is that abigai activate can
activate and that's going to be from our
router
okay and then we also want to bring in
our off service because we need to test
that we need to use that logged in
function that we created with the GWT
module so that will be C dot dot slash
services okay and let's put in our
injectable hog what is this called
decorator and then export class off
guard and we're going to say implement
implement can activate
okay let's see we're going to add our
constructor and we need to inject our
off service and the router okay and
let's see constructor isn't going to
take anything then we want to do can
activate and this is when we put our
logic for for the route so let's do if
and then we're going to go to the
service off service dot logged in okay
so if that then we want to return true
meaning we're logged in else then we
want to redirect so this dot router dot
navigate and in here we want to put in
our login row and I'm just going to
return false and that should do it so
basically it's going to just check that
logged in which is this right here we're
using that token not expired if it's not
expired will return true if it is then
we're going to just redirect okay so now
we just need to go to our app dot module
and we want to bring in the off guard
so import off guards and it's going to
be from dot slash guards slash off guard
okay so we bring that in and then
whatever route we want to protect which
is dashboard and profile we're just
going to add a parameter and we're going
to say can activate set that to an array
or just brackets and then we're going to
say off guard okay so any route that you
want to protect that's all you have to
do now okay makes it very simple so
let's save that and hopefully that works
so see we are let's see we're not logged
in right so let's go to slash dashboard
okay so that didn't work let's see it
looks like we're getting some kind of
error reject and no provider for okay so
we just need to add off guard as a
provider because it's in fact of service
so right here off guard okay so let's
see let's try it again we'll go to slash
dashboard brings us to login if we go to
slash profile brings us to login okay
but if we do login we can go to the
dashboard and we can go to the profile
alright so that's it we now have our
full authentication functionality I'm
just going to edit the dashboard HTML
file so in here we'll just pull it in h2
class
page header dashboard and I'm just going
to put a paragraph that says welcome to
your dashboard okay so now we're up to
speed where we've done everything up to
the point where I showed you in the
first video and now we can go ahead and
compile so let's go back to our terminal
and I'm going to stop the angular server
and then what we're going to do is just
ng build okay now before you run it make
sure that you set your in the angular
CLI Jason that you set the output
directory to dot dot slash public so
that it goes right into the public
folder okay so let's go ahead and run
that and if we look at our core our root
folder here now it should have public
and it should look like this we have our
index.html file and these bundled files
okay so now if we go to our localhost
3000 we get our application now there's
one more line I want to add in the
server and the main app j/s so down at
the bottom here after the index I want
to make sure that every route aside from
the ones that we we specified goes to
that index.html file so we want to do
apt-get and in here we can just put an
asterisk which means basically
everything and then we can do request
response class response and then here
let's do red dot send file and we use
path join and we'll say the current
directory mm to scored our name
and then here public slash index dot
HTML okay so any other route is going to
get sent to that
okay so we'll save that and everything
should still work we should be able to
log in okay we logged in profile that
works good logo so we now have a mean
stack application so hopefully you guys
enjoyed this series like I said before
I'm probably going to take it somewhere
else maybe we'll add a blog or I'm not
exactly sure yet I'm going to do some
thinking but at least these now you know
how to create a mean stack application
and that's it please subscribe if you're
not subscribed and thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
