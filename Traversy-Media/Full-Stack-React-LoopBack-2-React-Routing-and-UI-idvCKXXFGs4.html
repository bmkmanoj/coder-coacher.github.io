went ahead and we set up our back end
with loopback so we have our meetups
resource that is taking requests we have
our we can make get requests and post
and put we have a complete restful api
on the backend we even have user
authentication but like I said we're not
going to get into that just yet in this
series so what we want to do now is
create our react application now I want
this server to stay running it's not
running right now if I reload it's it's
gonna you know it's not gonna work but I
don't want to run it down here in vs
code so what I'm gonna do is open up a
separate terminal and by the way this is
terminator this program here and we're
just gonna CD into meetups and from here
let's go ahead and run node dot and
start up our server alright so it should
now be running if I reload it's gonna be
running and I'm just gonna minimize that
so to create our react application we're
gonna create a new folder inside of our
meetups folder alright inside the root
don't put it inside any of these folders
and we're gonna call this client
underscore source underscore SRC alright
and this is where our react application
source code is gonna go and then once
we're done what we'll do is we're going
to compile it we're gonna compile the
static assets into the loop backs client
folder so that we can run that on the
same port but while we're in development
they're going to be running on separate
port so we're gonna have react on 3001
and we're gonna have loopback on 3000
it's gonna be very similar to the mean
stack front-to-back series if you guys
watch that as far as the work flow now
since we're gonna be working exclusively
in the client source folder we're not
gonna really need to touch the server
for a while I'm gonna just open that up
in vs code so I'm gonna go to file open
folder and we're gonna go into meetups
and then go into the client source
folder and click OK alright that way we
don't get confused with the server files
and we know that we're just inside of
the client source folder
alright we can open up the terminal with
control tilde or you can use
you know view integrated terminal and
just make sure if you're not using vias
code you're using some other terminal
just make sure that you're in the client
source folder okay if you don't if
you're not in the client source folder
then it's not gonna be built correctly
okay so what we're gonna do now is set
up react now we're going to use the
create react app CLI which allows us to
generate a react application and it also
allows us to build out static assets at
the end when we're done so to do that
we're gonna say npm actually I need to
use sudo because we're installing this
globally so we're gonna say sudo npm
install - g create - react - app alright
so that'll install it globally okay so
now that that's done i'm gonna clear
this out and by the way to clear this
you can just do ctrl L so now that we
have this installed globally we can
generate a react application so to do
that we'll say create - react - app and
then I'm just gonna do a space and a dot
because I want to create it in this
directory okay and it's just gonna go
through and it's going to generate all
the react files and folders for us now
throughout this series I'm not gonna be
explaining you know the the very very
basics of react now if you haven't used
react before then you you can still
follow along and you should be okay as
long as you have a basic understanding
of JavaScript but this isn't going to be
you know an intro to react if you want
something like that I would suggest
watching my react crash course but this
is more for people that have at least a
little bit experience with react
all right so that's all set so let's go
ahead and clear this out and you'll see
over here that it's created all these
folders for us if we look in the this
SRC the source folder these this is our
main react application we have our
app.js file here which is the main app
component we have our index j s file and
we should be able to now run the server
ok the react server so to do that we can
just say npm start whoops didn't mean to
do that
all right now it's gonna ask us it's
saying something is running on port 3000
because that's the default port for
loopback so it's asking if we want
another port instead so I'm gonna say
yes and then it's gonna open it up on
port 3000 and 1 now I did notice that
when I when I did this in Windows it
didn't ask me if I wanted to open on
another port it just said 3,000 was busy
so what we're gonna do is we're gonna
add a little something to the
package.json file that's inside of the
react app so make sure you're in the
client SRC package JSON file it should
look like this and we want to go to the
start script right here and what we're
going to do is we're gonna say we want
to set port equal to 3001 and then just
a double ampersand okay so that will
make it start on 3001 so let's save it
and we can now close this up and let's
just ctrl C to stop and make sure that
it still works if we do NPM start it's
probably yeah it's still gonna ask us
we'll say yes but now if you're on
Windows it should still it should work
now so just realize that now we have
loopback on 3000 you'll see that that's
still running I have that running here
in the terminal and then we have our
react app alright so we're going to be
working in react for
while so usually when I install react
with this tool with this create react
app I do a little cleanup because we
don't I don't want for instance the
styling and this logo and all that so
we're gonna go ahead and and delete the
logo SVG okay we're gonna delete that
and then it's gonna automatically break
when we delete that that's fine let's go
to index J s and let's go ahead let's
remove this import index CSS line we
don't need that and then we'll save and
we're going to delete the index CSS file
okay let's go to app J s let's remove
this import logo right here we don't
need that we also don't want D well
actually yeah well you know what we'll
just leave the app CSS we can leave that
and save but I want to go to the app CSS
and clear everything out okay just
delete everything and save it alright so
now let's see what else is going on here
logo is not defined so now let's go to
app J s and inside of the render
function here inside the return I'm
gonna get rid of everything in this div
right here and I'm just gonna get rid of
the class name so it's just straight div
and we'll just put an h1 in here and
we'll just say my app and save and there
we go so now we basically have
bare-bones react application now I think
what I want to do first is implement the
router we're going to be using the new
reactor out of version 4 which is much
different than the previous version it's
a little more difficult there's a lot
more options and so on
so if we just go to let's search for
react router version 4 and we want the
web not we're not using react native we
want the web version and you see there's
a lot of different documentation here
alright we're going to be using this
browser router if we click on that
and see I mean this browser router this
hash router let's see where's the page
that I want to show you guys we're also
gonna be using this switch right here
yeah so this is how we're gonna define
our route so we're gonna wrap it in the
switch tag here we're gonna bring that
in from the reactor outer and then
define our routes and we're gonna define
a path that's gonna go to a specific
component in this case the slash is
going to a home component alright so
we're gonna have a meet ups component
that's gonna be our home route that's
gonna be our home page which will list
out the meetups will also have an about
we'll have a meet-up details page will
have the add page the Edit Page stuff
like that so we are gonna need to use
the router now when we define how routes
we're gonna do that in a component
called main okay we're gonna create a
main component to put our switch in with
the routes and then another thing I want
to do is for components that are not
using any kind of state or anything
they're basically just used to display
data or not data but markup I don't want
to use component I don't want to create
a class and extend component we're gonna
do it a different way so this app
component right here we're actually
going to change this up quite a bit so
I'm gonna actually remove the component
up here we just want to bring and react
and then let's see I'll just let me just
get rid of this all together so what we
can do is we can just create a variable
called app right and we're gonna set it
equal to a set of parentheses we're
going to use an arrow function here so
equals and then an angle bracket and
then set that to a set of parentheses
and then in here we can put the there
basically what we would have inside of
the render so we just want to div for
now
and then we're gonna put in our h1 and
I'll say my app okay and if we save that
it should work the same exact way so
this is much easier of course if you
were gonna if we were going to have
state and stuff like that if we were
going to use life cycle methods and you
know all the stuff that goes with a
react component then we wouldn't use
this but this is gonna just basically
just be used to display the main
component and the navbar component all
right basically going to embed those
into this app components so we don't
need all that other stuff so what I want
to do now is install the react router
and we're going to use something called
react router Dom as well so let's go
ahead and stop this with control C make
this a little bigger and let's do NPM
install - - save and we want to put in
react - router as well as react - router
- Dom all right make sure you put the
dash - save in there that'll add it to
the package dot Jason so that should get
added up here there we go
all right so now we have the router
installed so we'll go ahead and run the
server again with NPM start yes okay and
every time we run the server it's gonna
open up a new tab you can just close the
previous one all right so now what we
want to do is let's close up the CSS we
don't need that let's go into actually
let's create our main component because
that's what's gonna that's where the
routes are gonna go so inside the source
folder inside our client source folder
obviously we want to create a new folder
called components and this is where all
the components that we create are going
to go so I'm going to create a new file
in here called mange s
and all the components should have
should start with an uppercase letter
all right now we're gonna use the same
format that we did with the app
component because we're not using any
kind of state or anything here it's
basically just gonna be our routing but
we need to bring in a bunch of stuff so
we need to bring in a react of course we
don't need to bring in component just
react and then we're gonna bring in some
stuff from the reactor outer Dom we want
to bring in switch switch and row and
it's gonna be from react - router - Dom
all right and you need to bring in
whatever components that you're going to
use in your routes you need to bring
those in as well now right now we don't
have any we don't have any other
components so what I'm gonna do is let's
see what should I do I guess let's
create the meetups component first all
right we'll start off with just creating
the meetups component and the about
component so let's say new file meetups
dot Jas and let's also create new file
about dot Jas okay now meetups Jas is is
gonna have state and all that stuff so
we're gonna bring in the component from
react as well so let's go import react
and also component from react all right
and then we'll create our class so this
will be meetups and it's going to extend
component
make sure we export it sport default
meetups okay and then this is going to
have a render and we're going to return
let's return a div and inside here we'll
just put an h1 and we'll just say
meetups h1 okay so there's our component
let's save that and then let's go into
our about J s now the about is just
gonna be just static content so what I'm
gonna do is copy what we have in the app
J s we're gonna use this format so let's
save this or copy this rather and paste
it in about we don't need the CSS and
we'll just change this to about change
this title here to a boat and then we
want to make sure we export about
alright so now we have our two
components that we want to use in our
router so we can close those up for now
about and meetups go back to our main J
s where we're actually creating our
routes all right now we need to bring
those in so we'll say import meetups
from dot slash meet-ups
same thing with about okay so now that
we brought those in we can use those in
our routes so let's create a constant
called main use an arrow this is going
to go to a set of parentheses let's make
sure we export it
okay and then here we're gonna put a
main tag okay so this is just an html5
main tag and then we're going to use the
switch that we brought in from the
reactor outer Dom so we're gonna say
switch and we're just doing what I
showed you in the documentation if we go
back to here we want to create a route
with an exact path and then the
component that we want for that path so
inside here will say route exact path
equals and this is going to be for slash
and then we want to set the component
equal to meetups all right now we can
end that you know what let me make this
a little bigger alright so that's our
first route and then let's copy this and
then we're gonna have a route for a
slash about and that's gonna go to the
about component okay make sure those are
brought in up here alright so let's save
that now in order for this router to
work we need to use this browser router
where is it right here this browser
router so we use it kind of like this
we're going to do this in the index J s
okay which is like kind of like the
entry point so let's import browser
router we'll go right here and say
import browser router this is going to
be from react router Dom
and I know this is a look the reactor
router version 4 is a little complicated
I think I might actually do a video
specifically on the router but we want
to bring that in and then down here you
can see that initially they're just
putting in the main app component what
we want to do is wrap this in the
browser router so I'm going to go to a
new line here and just wrap it so I'll
say browser router whoops and then it
needs to have an ending tag so we'll go
on the other side of it and go like that
all right and we'll just put that on a
separate line okay so that should
implement that everything else can stay
the same and I mean and you guys that
are familiar with react you know what
this is but for those of you that aren't
right here we're selecting the element
that we want to insert react into which
is going to be the ID of route and if we
go into our public folder and we go into
index.html notice that there is a div
with the ID of route so that's basically
where react is going to be is going to
be put in now in this index.html I'm
gonna get rid of these comments here I
don't want these let's change the title
as well change this to meetups get rid
of these comments here and get rid of
these ones and we're gonna be using
materialized CSS but I'm not going to
get into that just yet but let's save
this alright and if we look back at our
meetups component open up the console so
there's no errors that's good and if we
go into
fjs right now we're just we're just
showing the h1 what we want to do here
is put in our main component because
that's where all of our routes are
alright so we're going to replace this
now first we need to bring it in
I'm gonna say import mein from now we're
in the app j/s and the app j/s is not in
the components folder so we need to go
into that with dot slash components
slash main and then we can go ahead and
we can put in main like that all right
so let's save that and see what we get
and we get meetups and that's exactly
what we want because if we look at our
routes meetups is the the component we
want to show for just the slash so if we
go to slash about now we see about okay
so our router is now implemented and
working so any other component we create
we want to add we can just add to this
main J's file alright so I know that
that may have been a little confusing
but hopefully your your kind of grasping
that that this main J s is our router
and we can add any route so you want to
any components we want now one thing
about react is you can do you can do the
same thing a million different ways so
you may be used to doing it a different
way but this is just one way this is
what what I prefer to do if you're
familiar enough with react to build
along with me and do things a different
way on the front end but still have it
you know still follow along and use loop
back and all that that's fine you can do
that if you want but I think what I want
to do now is implement materialized CSS
and create a navbar so that we can
switch from the home page or the meetups
to the about page also implement our
style so for that lets go to
materialized CSS calm go to get started
and down here you'll find the CD ends
okay so we're gonna grab the CSS CDN and
we're gonna go to index.html which is in
the public folder and we're gonna put
this right above the title all right so
that's the CSS and now we want the JS
file which is right here so we'll copy
that we're going to put that right above
the closing body tag now materialise J s
does depend on
jQuery so we're gonna have to get that
as well so let's search for jQuery CDN
and I'm just gonna grab the minified
version three grab the script right here
put it above the materialized j/s and
then the last thing i want to import or
bring in is font awesome so I'm gonna
search for a font awesome CDN I should
know this stuff by now these links now I
will click the first result and let's
get this right here which is our link
tag to the font awesome script or CSS
file and we'll put that in the head
right below the materialize CSS all
right so let's save and right away
you'll see that our application looks a
little different the font is bigger and
it's different
that's because materialise is now kicked
in so we can close up our index.html and
let's create our navbar component
alright so in components and our folder
components we'll create a new file
called navbar j/s all right now with
navbar I'm not going to use the
shorthand syntax like we did with app
and main I'm gonna use the the full
component like we did with meetups
because we may have state in navbar
later on when we implement
authentication and stuff so I just want
to be prepared for that so what I'll do
is just copy what we have in the meetups
component and paste that into navbar and
then just change the class name to
navbar h1 we're gonna get rid of this in
a minute but I'm just gonna test it out
real quick so just change that and then
we want to export a navbar as well all
right so let's save this and then we're
gonna go back into AB Jas and we want
the navbar to go right above main ok
because the navbar is gonna be on every
single page so we don't want to put it
in any of the routed components so we'll
bring it in just like we did main
so let's do navbar navbar and we'll
place that right here
okay and save and now we have our navbar
above about and if we go to the home
page it should still show on meetups as
well all right now one thing I want to
do is wrap the main component in a
container to push it into the middle now
I'll show you in a second I mean you
guys that are familiar with react you
already know this but those of you that
aren't react to use is something called
JSX
that's what this is it's not actually
HTML it's JSX which is pretty much just
embedded HTML inside of JavaScript
because right now we're still in
JavaScript here now there's very few
differences between JSX and HTML but one
of them is that you can't use the class
attribute in fact if I save this we
should get an error down here you'll see
invalid Dom property class did you mean
class name so instead of using class in
our markup we have to use class name and
I guarantee you're gonna see me do this
you're gonna see me make this mistake
about a hundred more times because I
just always do I always forget to use
class name it usually still works but
you'll get this error down here and you
just you want to stick the class name
all right so let's save and now you'll
see that error goes away and notice that
meetups this is now pushed in the middle
because it's wrapped in a container
alright so now let's go to our navbar
component and let's add that okay we're
gonna get rid of this h1 and then let's
go back to the materialized site and go
to see components navbar and I want the
version with the button here so that we
have this little popup menu
so let's see I guess yeah I guess we'll
just copy all of this just to the nav
not the divs below it I'll copy that and
then we'll put that in between these
divs here let me just format this
formatting is not working for some
reason
all right so we'll just tab this over
then okay so there's our navbar now we
have quite a bit we need to do to this
I'm gonna make this smaller and let's
see we're gonna we're gonna add to the
nav tag right here first of all all of
these need to be class name instead of
class so it's a class name and in
addition to actually we don't even want
the nav extended class I'm just gonna
add the class of blue because I don't
want it to be pink I wanted to be blue
materialise allows it allows you to use
color names for classes and then I want
to just darken it a little so it also
get allows us to add like darkened three
so that's what we're gonna use there all
right let's just save this and see what
it looks like
all right so that's what it's gonna look
like now this logo right here we're
going to change this to meetups okay and
then let's see the link will go to slash
and then this this link right here is
what opens up the mobile menu now the
mobile menu or whatever you want to call
it this thing over here we want it to
always show even on larger screens it's
gonna be part of our interface it's not
just going to be a responsive
collapsible menu so what we want to do
is add a class to let's see right here
it says button collapse we're gonna add
on to that a class called show on large
all right and then data activates mobile
demo doesn't really make sense because
it's not just for mobile so let's call
this main menu and then we want to go
down here where it says ID mobile demo
and also call this main menu okay let me
just close this make this a little
bigger so we have some other changes we
want to do here right here with the for
the the button collapse it's talking
about this now we're not using
materialized icons we're using font
awesome so inside of here let me just
spread this out where we have our class
of button collapse inside that you'll
see an eye tag with the class of
material icons we actually want to
change this class to FA and then FA -
bars okay and then just remove the text
that's inside of it so now if we save
that and reload now we get the little
bars icon here
alright now we're getting these errors
down here because we're using class
instead of class name on a lot of these
so let's see we'll change this to class
name this I know this is kind of a pain
in the ass
and you could do a find and if you do
find and replace just make sure that
this cuz this will get changed to class
name make sure you put that back to
class
alright and then let's see we'll get rid
of everything that's under the side nav
ul right here this div with the the
class of nav content we actually don't
want that it may have been easier to
just type all this stuff in rather than
copy it but whatever it's fine alright
so now we have to you ELLs we have this
one and this one all right
now this first one we're actually going
to change we don't need the nav mobile
ID and then for the class name we're
gonna change it to we're gonna keep the
right class and we want to change this
hide on medium and down we want this to
hide on small only okay so hide on small
only because we only don't want this to
show on small screens which is going to
be the link over here alright now
there's only gonna be one link here so
let's get rid of two of these el eyes
all right and this is gonna be for the
meetups or the homepage I should say
meetups the href actually we're not even
going to use an href because we're not
going to use an a tag we're gonna bring
in something called link from the router
dom so up here we'll say import link
from
react - router - Dom all right and then
instead of having an a tag or our way
right here instead of having this a tag
here we're going to put in link and
that's going to have an attribute called
- and we're gonna set that to slash
which will be the home page and then
we'll just take away this ending a tag
and make it an ending link tag like that
all right and then I want to have an
icon next to this meet-ups text so we'll
put in an I class equals F a font
awesome and then let's do F a users and
close it all right and then I'm gonna
get rid of all these allies in the side
nav for now and let's just save and see
what that looks like
all right so now we have our meetups
link over here it looks like we still
have some classes this should be class
name save that where else right here
class name what else am I missing right
here okay
now this this little warning here is
just saying that links must not point to
hash it's talking about this right here
so we actually don't need that I'm gonna
get rid of it and that should get rid of
that error all right and then the last
thing we need to do is implement the
side nav now the side nav is gonna have
two links it's gonna have one two
meetups and then one to add a meet-up
which is a component we haven't even
created yet but let's copy this Li paste
that in twice okay so this one is fine
this is actually gonna stay how it is
the second one however is going to be
the add meetup so it's gonna go to slash
meet-ups slash add which doesn't exist
yet but don't worry about it and then
this is gonna be FA plus for the icon
and for the text we'll say add Meetup
okay now if I save this and we try to
click this it's not gonna work because
with materialise you actually have to
initialize the side bar or the side nav
let me see if I can find that here so
right here we have to add this to our
script in our index.html so let's go
ahead and do that lets go to index.html
in the public folder go down to the very
bottom here and put in a script tag
alright so it uses jQuery so we need to
do document document dot ready and in
here we'll just put an arrow function
and then we need to put in this
okay so we'll save that let's go back
and there we go so now we have our
little side menu okay and where are
we're on the meetups page right now if I
go to add Meetup
that's not gonna work it's I mean it's
not gonna do anything but it's a
component that hasn't been created yet
all right now the last thing I want to
do before we end this this part is put
the floating but add button down here
just that that materialized floating
button let me see if I can find it in
the documentation here so buttons yeah
we want like something like this I'm not
gonna copy it because I'm not using all
of these all of these different allies
and stuff it's pretty easy to just type
in so let's go to app J s and we're
gonna go right under this div of
container we want to go under the ending
div and we want to put in a div here
with a class name I forgot my bracket so
we want to put a class name of fixed -
action - BTN all right and then inside
here we're gonna put an a tag actually
no let's let's do link will bring in our
link from the router so we'll say import
link from reactor outer Dom
and then we'll say link whoops - and
this is gonna go to slash meet-ups slash
ad and it's gonna have a class name of
BTN - loading it's also gonna have a
class of BTN - large and it's gonna have
a class of red all right then we need to
end the link and then inside the link
here we're just going to put an icon so
we're gonna put an eye class FA and then
FA - plus ok let's save that let's check
it out and there we go I forgot to do
class name told you about 99 more times
I'll do that so I think that that's a
good place to stop for now in the next
video what we're gonna do is start to
work on getting the meetups from the API
from the backend and bringing them in I
think we've done a pretty good job of
creating our interface so now we want to
work with the backend so that's what
we'll do in the next one hey guys if
