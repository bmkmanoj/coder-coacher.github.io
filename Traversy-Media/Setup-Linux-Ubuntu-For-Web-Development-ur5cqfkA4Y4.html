that I had planned on making but one of
my disks my main machine crash that had
all my virtual machines on it so I'm
reinstalling Linux Ubuntu I'm getting
everything set up so I figured I'd make
a quick video showing you guys exactly
what I install and what I use alright so
first thing we're going to install is
Google Chrome and this is the only thing
we're going to install that isn't going
to be through the terminal all right so
if we go to google.com slash Chrome
click download now and we're going to
grab the 64-bit deb package here alright
so we're going to say we want to open it
with software install and that's going
to go ahead and download alright so that
should open
okay so now we're just going to click
install
and can ask for a password
all right so that should be all set and
close that up and now if we go up here
and my life is so slow we want to search
for Chrome you can see it just pops
right up so I'm going to just grab this
and bring it over to the sidebar here
and then we'll get rid of Firefox will
stay unlocked from watcher or a
particular clip all right so now we have
chrome installed we can open that up and
yes I want to make it my default browser
but I don't want to send stuff to Google
okay so now is that set up let's let's
remove this stuff I'm not going to use
the LibreOffice or anything like that so
I'm going to get rid of these and see
I'll leave the software installer get
rid of Amazon and I'll leave the
settings continue I don't know why it
does that
so now we're going to install a program
called Terminator which is an alternate
terminal you can use I'm going to just
open up the default terminal to do that
so from here let's do sudo so we can run
it as root and then have to get update
whoops what they do alright alright so
once that's done let's go ahead and do
sudo apt-get install Terminator and say
yes
all right so let's took about a minute
or so and I'm pausing it when that's
running so you know don't be alarmed if
um if yours is way slower so we have
Terminator installed so I'm going to
close this up and let's go ahead and
search for that right here and I'm just
going to bring that over and put it
right there you don't want it want it
above Chrome okay so let's open up
Terminator and I'll make just a little
bigger and with terminated we can split
horizontally you can split vertical so
it's kind of nice let's just close that
up so now next thing I want to install
is the text editor the text editor that
I'm using right now is Adam so to
install Adam we need to actually grab
the PPA which is personal package
archive so let's do sudo and the reason
that we're doing is because it's not
available in the main repositories so
sudo apt-get I'm sorry not apt to get we
wanted to add add apt repository and
it's going to say P PA :
and then it's web web UPD eight-team
slash Adam
I'll see now available very to bid press
ENTER ok so now we're going to do
another update make sure everything is
recent all right so now that's done we
should now be able to do sudo apt-get
and install tap ok yes all right guys
that's about 2 minutes or so now we
should have Adam installed we go and
search for it and I'm just going to
bring it over right here ok so now we
have a text editor so the next thing
we're going to install is no js' so
let's go over here and let's just say
install node the bun to
so we're going to go to see Debian and
Ubuntu and what we have to do before we
actually run the install is we have to
retrieve the installation script from
node source so we're going to use curl
to do that so we'll grab that command
man and paste that in Oh
curls on installed so let's go ahead and
do that so sudo after the install curl
okay once that's done we'll go ahead and
run that and again
okay now we should be able to do sudo
apt-get install nodejs
all right so now nodes should be
installed with stewed nodejs V and you
see we have version six point seven
point zero and we also do NPM V make
sure that's installed alright so next
thing we're going Stoll is the lamp
stack which is we want to patchy and PHP
and MySQL all right so let's first do
Apache so I'm going to say sudo have to
get install apache2 yes
and now setup the Apache server
all right so now if we go to our browser
and we go to localhost you'll see that
an apache - page will pop up and this
gives us some information next we want
to install PHP and also the Apache
module for PHP so let's do sudo apt-get
install and we want PHP and I'm going to
do 7.0 and then we need to do Lib Apache
- - mod
- PHP 7.0 alright so let's go ahead and
run that and yes
alright guys so that's done now we want
to install MySQL so sudo apt-get install
MySQL - server so thrown that yes
okay so it's going to ask us for a
password for our root user and repeat
all right so let's talk about a minute
and a half now what I'm going to do is
restart our Apache server so we're going
to do sudo slash et Cie slash and knit
dot d / Apache - and then restart now to
restart the service for us okay
so if we want to test this out and see
make sure that PHP can get parsed and so
on we're going to CD into splash of our
/ww slash HTML okay and this is our web
root so let's create a new file will say
touch index dot PHP permission denied we
need to do sudo ok and then let's do
sudo nano index dot PHP and let's put in
our PHP tags or just echo and we'll say
hello okay we'll go ahead and do ctrl X
and then yes to save and then if we go
back to our localhost alright and the
reason this is still showing is because
there's an index.html file in that
directory we do LS you'll see it so
let's delete that we'll do sudo RM index
dot HTML all right so now that's gone we
reload and we get our hello okay so now
that we have the lamp stack set up we're
going to move on and I'm going to
install FileZilla which is an FTP client
so that we can connect through FTP to
outside servers so for that sudo apt-get
install FileZilla yes
okay so now let's go over here and
search for FileZilla and we're going to
just bring that over all right so let's
clear this out so the next thing we're
going to install is GIMP which is a
graphic design application that's pretty
much like Photoshop because we can't get
Photoshop for a bun too so we need to
add the repository for that so we're
going to do sudo add app repository and
we want to do PPA colons OTT OH - Castle
goulash I guess that me cuz goulash sh /
gimp all right let's try run that and
see okay enter and now we should let's
do a sudo apt-get update
and now we should be able to do sudo
apt-get install again
okay so let's go up here and search for
our GIMP there it is bring it over and
that's that and just to make sure it
works there we go so it's a it's a
program that's similar to photoshop a
little more minimalistic alright so I'm
not going to go over anything in that
program maybe I'll do a tutorial on it
linger so that's pretty much it as far
as dev tools now what I'm going to do is
just change the backdrop and I have in
pictures my wallpaper and I'm just going
to do set as wallpaper and then I also
want to install the what is the unity
tweak tool and that allows us to do some
things that we can't do with the regular
settings such as I like to change this
color of the launcher here and you can
change the icon size things like that so
let's do sudo apt-get install and is the
unity tweak tool
okay so let's go to here and search for
it and you can see it gives us a whole
mess of options and click launcher and
what I want to do is make this a reddish
a more red color because it kind of
looks orange so see I haven't done this
in a while
let's see color based on the wallpaper
custom you know it just turned black and
click on the red ball it's that's too
bright try this it's a little better
no actually know what let's just make it
black
yeah that's fine I might change it later
but this is pretty cool you can
customize a lot of stuff with this tool
all right so I think that's it guys I
think everything's all set
the time up here it's not for 19 a.m.
okay that's actually I think that
specific time it's actually 719 so let's
change that I'm seeing two changes to I
just if I just do New York that should
work alright so now it's changed alright
guys so that's it the machine is ready
to go ready to stop making some more
videos and tutorials so thanks for
watching and I will see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
