hey what's going on guys so in this
video we're gonna build a small
application using the irelia JavaScript
framework which is a front-end framework
like angular react
view Jas I know another framework and it
can be kind of overwhelming because
there are so many but I like to have I
like to have videos on each one on my
channel so people can hack kind of have
a choice to see how each one works and
then maybe pick one and stick with it
for a while now the difference between
irelia with me is is that I've never
actually used it in in building any kind
of application that's worth anything
this was actually the first application
I've built with it so it's very simple
it's going to be a customer manager
application and it's built off of the
to-do tutorial that is on the irelia
website or in the documentation so what
I've done is is kind of you know mix
things around I turned it into a
customer manager app and then I also
implemented local storage so that the
data is persisted into storage rather
than just you know going away when the
page is reloaded so we're gonna add on
to it now when I zoomed in here yes I am
now this framework is really cool from
what I've read I mean I've read a lot
about it I haven't used it too much it's
supposed to be very simple but also very
powerful if we look down here instead of
using a monolithic approach irelia is
composed of smaller focused modules and
you can use them together as a
full-featured framework you can pick and
choose to build a custom solution
there's two a data binding which works
similar to how angular 2 plus works
it's testable it's extensible HTML you
can create custom elements and
attributes it has a router I believe it
has a CLI as well but we're not going to
be using that we're just gonna basically
create the files from scratch so what
we're gonna do is is at irelia dot IO
we're gonna go to guides and then go to
tutorials and creating it to do app so
this is what I used as kind of a kind of
a script for this application and we're
gonna follow along here and build it out
as well so this is an as prepared as
most of my videos are I don't have the
code right in front of me
but yeah so hopefully you know you guys
can forgive me if I make any mistakes or
anything like that so we're gonna go
ahead and click this link here which is
download the basic irelia project setup
and this is a zip file we're gonna go
ahead and open that and we basically
want to take all of these files and put
them into a new project folder so I'm
gonna create a folder called customer
manager all right and then let's bring
this open up up here let's bring
everything except for the Mac OS folder
we don't want that let's bring that over
and then let's open this up with vs code
oops so I'm gonna say open with code and
we'll go ahead and snap that over and
let's take a look at the file so scripts
is basically the all of the framework
stuff we have irelia core which is the
core framework the routing J's file now
you can use typescript or Atma script
with with this framework so you can see
config typescript and then config ES
next ok es NEX meaning just you know
future features of echo script it's set
by default to use typescript but I don't
want to use typescript so if we go to
index.html you'll see here it's loading
all the files up and one of them is
config - typescript so we actually want
to change this to config -
yes next okay and save that and then
some of the other stuff that's going on
here we're loading system J s which is
the module loader system j s has been
used in other frameworks it was used in
the QuickStart for angular 2 I think
they moved to web pack but it's
basically just a module loader then we
have yes yes next J s we have the core J
s and then this right here we're using
system j s to bootstrap the framework
okay we're calling system dot import
irelia bootstrapper now notice all of
this is wrapped in the body tag which
has a custom attribute of irelia app and
that's set to source slash main so we're
gonna have to create a main dot J's file
alright and all of that is in this
tutorial right here so we're gonna be
looking at this as we go along alright
so let's see the source folder is
completely empty that's where we're
going to create our files J s config is
just compiler options it's gonna compile
down to es6 and that's really it we have
a favicon file as well so let's go over
here to the tutorial and all of this is
just telling you exactly what i just
showed you the index file the bootstrap
are all that we want to go down to where
it's where they're creating the to do
class now we're not building it to do
application we're building a customer
manager application so in the source
folder we're gonna create a file called
customer dot J s okay instead of
creating it to do class we're gonna say
export class customer
and if you look here there's a
constructor so we have to add that so
this is just basic es6 class syntax by
the way I'm creating a vanilla
JavaScript course now and this kind of
stuff is all through the course if
you're interested in a constructor we
want to we want to just pass in any
properties now in this case the to-do
has a description being passed in our
customers however are going to have a
couple fields so we want name email and
phone and then we're just gonna set this
dot name equal to name that's passed in
this dot email equal to email and then
this dot phone equal to phone okay and
that's it so we'll save that that is our
concern customer class now what we want
to do is create our main app class so in
the source folder let's create a new
file called app dot j s and let's go
ahead and import the customer class that
we just created so that's gonna be from
dot slash customer and then we want to
create our class so export class app and
then this is gonna take a constructor as
well and this constructor we're gonna
set a heading property I'm just gonna
set it to customer manager all right
we're gonna set the state for the
customers which right now is just gonna
be an empty array and we're gonna set
the different fields notice over here
they have to do description let me just
make this bigger so they have to do
description right here we're gonna have
to use all three of our fields so
customer name set it to nothing
initially this dot customer email set to
nothing
customer oops
customer phone set - nothing alright I
just want to check something all right
good so that is the app class
constructor now you can see there's to
my other methods they have here add to
do and remove to do so let's go ahead
and create add customer and basically we
want to check to make sure the fields
are there that are needed which are the
name email and phone so this dot
customer name if that is there and
customer email is there and this dot
customer phone is there alright so if
that's true I lost it so if that's true
then the hekawi
right here then we want to do this dot
customers dot push and then we want to
create a new instance of a customer okay
using the new keyword because we're
calling the constructor here so let's go
ahead and do that we'll say this dot
customers dot push and then here we're
gonna say new customer and then pass in
all the fields so this dot customer name
this dot customer email and this dot
customer phone
all right so once we do that we just
want to clear all of our fields so we're
gonna go under let's see we're gonna go
right here and just say clear field so
this customer name equals nothing equals
nothing and customer phone equals
nothing all right so that's our ad
customer now we're gonna do the remove
the remove is pretty simple we're just
getting an index using index of checking
to see if the index is not equal to
negative one because if it's not a match
it's going to equal negative one if it
is a match and it's the one we want to
delete or remove then we're gonna splice
it out of the array so let's go ahead
and do that so remove customer and
that's gonna take in a customer all
right and then we're just going to
create a variable called index and set
that to this stock customers customers
dot index of and we just want to pass in
here the customer that's passed in right
here all right and then we just want to
check to see if it's not equal to
negative one so we'll say if index is
not equal to negative one that means we
want to splice it out so this stock
customers dot splice and we want to pass
in here index and one ok so index
meaning the one that we want to delete
and one just means we want to delete
just one record or just one index so
that should be good for now now if we go
down a little more you'll see that
there's a main.js file and it just has
this to configure function so let's make
sure this file saved and then index.html
we have body
irelia app pointed to that main file so
let's create it in the source folder so
main dot j s and then we're just gonna
grab that function there and paste that
in alright and that should be all we
need to do here so now we'll keep going
and now we want to render the app so
we're gonna create an HTML file called
app dot HTML and we want to wrap we want
these template tags which basically just
wraps this index.html stuff around the
view or around whatever we put in here
in this case is just going to be an h1
and we're gonna put it in heading okay
now this syntax here is just the
template literal expression or variable
syntax this heading is coming from our
app.js file right here this dot heading
so it should say customer manager so we
should be ready to actually run our
application now there's a few different
ways to do this what we're going to use
is HTTP server which is a maje nodejs
module and we're going to install that
globally so you want to open up your cut
your command line at your terminal I'm
using my integrated terminal with vs
code and I'm gonna do NPM install - g--
HTTP
server all right so that installs it
globally and then if you look down here
we want to run it with a couple flags so
- OH
- see - one this has to do with cache
and I did run into some issues with this
hopefully that doesn't happen again but
let's go ahead and run that so it's HTTP
server - is it oh space
- see - one so let's go ahead and run
that and we get customer manage are good
now if I were to add something to app
HTML like let's just say test and let's
save and reload
yep see that's happening again it has
something to do with the cache if I do
control f5 that doesn't fix it I did
find a solution to this if you guys know
an easier solution let me know but I
found it on Stack Overflow
let me just search for it what do they
do really a view not updating HTTP
server I think it was this one here or
no that wasn't it right is this it right
here so basically if you want to force
your irelia app to constantly refresh
after you modify it then we can add this
code right above our bootstrapper inside
the index.html so i'm going to grab that
i'm gonna copy it i'm gonna go to
index.html and paste this in right above
that system import bootstrapper
alright so this bunch of code let's save
that and let's go ahead and restart the
server and I believe now we can just do
HTTP - server with no flags and reload
ok let's go back to app HTML and just
add something save and reload and there
we go so now we get tests all right so
I'm not sure why that happens
like I said I'm new to this framework if
any of you guys know why that happens or
a different way or a better way to do
this let me know but that's that's just
the solution that I could find alright
so back to what we were doing now I
don't want to use bootstrap or
materialize or any big framework like
that but I do want it to look not
horrible so we're gonna use skeleton CSS
so I'm gonna search for a skeleton CDN
and we're just gonna grab the CDN from
this CD nsj com
so let's say copy link tag we'll throw
that in the index HTML head and save and
now you can see that the fonts changed
and it'll look a little better so let's
go back into app HTML and I'm gonna wrap
inside of the template I'm going to wrap
everything in a container okay that'll
push it to the middle and then under the
h1 if we look at the tutorial here you
can see they add a form so we're gonna
do that let's put in form we don't need
an action what we do want is this submit
trigger and then that's gonna be set to
the add customer function or method so
let's say submit dot trigger equals add
customer all right now we need our
different inputs in here so let's say
input type text and the way that we bind
our values is by saying value dot bind
equals and then let's do customer name
now this customer name is coming from a
PS right here so it's similar to how
angular works angular 2 plus with the
data binding all right let's go back to
our HTML and let's just add a
placeholder here
and we'll just say name all right so
let's copy the input we want two more
this next one's going to be type email
and it's gonna be customer email it's or
binding it to and then we'll change the
placeholder to email address yeah and
then this one will be customer phone
I'll change this to phone number all
right and then we just need a submit
button so it's a button have a type of
submit I'll say add customer let's save
that take a look and there we go make
this a little bigger I guess we could
put these on separate lines now skeleton
has a class we can add called you - full
- width and that'll put each each
element it'll make it block level and
make it stretch full width so let's add
that class to all of these alright let's
add it to the button as well see what
that looks like
alright so that's fine so now if I were
to put stuff in here and submit that has
to be an email you can see that it goes
away now the reason it does that is
because in our add customer at the end
here or clearing the fields which is
what we want now it did also push on to
the the customer constructor but we
can't see it because we're not
outputting it anywhere so now if we go
to our tutorial here and go down let's
see right here so what they're doing is
they have a UL under the form and
they're saying Li for a list item and
then repeat dot four so this is similar
to like ng for an angular
and then to do of to do so we're going
to do something similar to this but
we're going to use a table so let's go
to our HTML we'll go under the form and
let's create a table and the table I'm
actually also going to give that class
of you - full width okay first we want
table roll with some headings so we'll
say th and this will be the name th this
will be email phone and then this one
will be blank because this is going to
be the remove button alright now this TR
is where we want our loop so we're gonna
add on to this TR repeat dot four equals
and then we're gonna say customer of
customers
alright and then in here we'll have our
T DS and we should now have access to
customer dot and then whatever so we
want name here let's go ahead and copy
this
so customer name customer email phone
and then this here is going to be the
the remove link so let's our button so
let's say button and let's see I forget
what I had to do here I click dot
trigger
so click dot trigger and we want to call
remove customer and then we can pass in
customer all right so let's save that
and let's try to add a customer well
reload here let's open up our console
make sure nothing Crazy's going on and
we'll say John Doe jeido at gmail and
phone number and add and there we go oh
I forgot to put some text in here it
should say remove ok now we're adding
customers now if I save and reload it's
gonna go away because the data is not
persisting but we're gonna get to that
after with local storage but let's just
quickly add something else here
doesn't matter what and I want to
actually that already works alright so
the remove works
I forgot we already did that if we look
in app j/s it's calling this right here
so everything let me just check this
real quick yeah everything in this to-do
application or the to-do tutorial is
complete ok it's just strictly UI now
we're gonna add on to this and implement
local storage so when we go ahead and we
add a customer here it calls this method
right what we want to do though is call
another method called store customer all
right so we're gonna go right before we
clear the fields
store in local storage so we're gonna
save this dot store customer and we want
to pass in each field so this dot
customer name this dot customer email
customer phone whoops and then we'll
create that function right here so we
don't need to write the word function so
store customer all right and that's
gonna take in name email phone so what
we want to do now in here is first of
all check to see if there's any
customers in local storage now if you
guys aren't familiar with local storage
in the browser it only stores strings
you can't store an object inside of
local storage so what we have to do is
before we actually enter it into local
storage we have to convert it into a
string using json stringify and then
when we take it out to work with it we
have to run it through jason parse to
turn it back into an object to work with
all right so first thing we're gonna do
is just set a variable called customers
just initialize it and then we're gonna
check to see if there's any customers in
local storage by saying if local storage
dot get item and we want to search for
customers that's what we're gonna call
it we're gonna say if it's equal to null
that means it's not there ok and if it's
not there then we're gonna take that
customer's variable that we just created
and set it to an empty array okay else
if it is there then we're gonna take
that customers and we're gonna set it to
whatever is in local storage by saying
get item
customers now remember I told you it's
stored as a string so what we need to do
is run this through a function called
Jason parse wrap that around like that
okay and then underneath the if
statement here we can just simply say
customers dot push ok so we're taking
either whether it's just an empty array
or whatever is in local storage already
and we're gonna push on the new customer
by saying name email and phone ok so all
this data is coming from here we passed
it in here which was passed in here ok
when we add when we called add customer
so once we push it in then we need to
set local storage again because right
now it's just in this variable so we're
gonna say local storage dot set item so
it's basically just get item and set
item and we want to set customers now we
want to set the customers variable but
we want to wrap it in Jason dot
stringify because it has to be stored as
a string ok so when we get it we run it
through Jason parse when we set it we
run it through json stringify and that
should do it so let's save and now if we
go over here and reload and we say John
Doe gmail.com phone number and add ok so
you can see it added to the UI just like
it was before now if I reload it goes
away ok but let's check to see if it
actually went to local storage so we can
do that by going into our Chrome tools
and going to application and look here
if you go to local storage and you click
on localhost you'll see customers and we
have a string a fied array with the John
Doe with the customer object inside of
it alright so it did persist
local storage now what we want to do is
get that from local storage and display
it here when the page look or when the
application loads so to do that up here
where we have this this dot customers
we're gonna have this set to a function
called get custody actually will say get
customers from storage like that all
right and then we'll go down here and
I'll say get customers from storage and
what we're gonna do is is similar to
what we did down below we're gonna set a
variable called customers we're gonna
check to see if it's null check to see
if there's any customers in local
storage so we do that by saying local
storage dot get item customers and see
if that's equal to no all right now if
that is equal to no we're gonna set
customers to an empty array else then
we're going to set customers equal to
local storage dot get item customers but
remember we have to parse it as JSON
object so we're gonna say jason dot
parse wrap that okay so now that we have
that we just want to simply return
whatever's in customers okay whether
it's an empty array if there's nothing
in it or whether there's something in
local storage so let's save let's reload
and there we go so now it's pulling John
Doe out of local storage all right so if
we add another person here let's say
Harry White will say Harry at Yahoo
calm phone number okay so he gets added
and if we reload he's still there
because he persisted to local storage
all right so the last thing we want to
do is we want to remove because right
now if I remove Harry White looks good
but when we reload he's back because
he's still in local storage we didn't
remove him from it so what we'll do is
down at the bottom when we have from
remove customer we'll create another
function underneath called remove
customer from storage alright and in
here it's gonna take in you see how we
did
sorry about my son yelling upstairs you
see how we have in index right here that
we're choosing so we know which one to
delete what we're gonna do is call this
dot remove from storage and we're gonna
pass in that index so that we know which
one we're working with which one we want
to delete alright and then we want to
say let customers we want to set a
variable customers to what's in local
storage so get item all right we want
customers okay so get customers and then
we want to wrap that in Jason dot parse
because if not it's just going to be a
string and then we simply want to say
customers dot splice we want to get it
by the index and we want to delete one
from the index all right and then we
just want to simply reset local storage
so set item and we want to set car
customers
and we want to set that to Jason dot
stringify because we need to stringify
the customers and we're gonna pass in
here customers alright so that should
remove it permanently so let's save and
reload and go to Harry White and click
remove he goes away we reload and he's
still gone alright so we now have a an
application where we can create
customers and persist them to local
storage we can also remove them and
remove them from local storage
alright so it's a very simple
application but like I said I'm very new
to this framework so I wanted to do
something pretty simple and hopefully
you guys hopefully it was clear but I
would suggest looking more into the
documentation there's actually a more
in-depth tutorial if you want to look at
that which is this contact manager app
and it looks like this one actually uses
the CLI and you do a lot more but it's
more advanced and we'll get into that at
some other points but I just want to do
to do kind of an intro video so that's
it guys thanks for watching my son's
getting outta hand upstairs so I have to
go thanks and I will see you next time
