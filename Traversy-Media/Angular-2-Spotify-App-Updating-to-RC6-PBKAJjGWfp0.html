series from an angular 2 course that I
did and it was on building this ng
Spotify application which searches for
music using the Spotify API
well that project was built using
angular to release candidate for and
release candidate 6 has now been
released and there have been a few
changes that may affect this application
if he followed along and you're using
the QuickStart so I wanted to do a video
to kind of show you how to update the
app to rc6
alright unfortunately when a technology
is still in the art and there release
candidate stage things change really
rapidly and severely if you look at the
code from RC one it's it's probably I'm
virtually unrecognizable from the RC six
code and I suspect I'll be doing this a
couple more times as well and it really
sucks because you know you do these
courses and then people try to follow
along a couple months later and things
have changed and then they think it's
your fault and you get disliked so you
know it's tough to keep all of these
updated especially where we have a
twelve project course close to 12
projects that I need to constantly watch
an update so that's what we're gonna do
here we're gonna take the original RC
for application and then just apply you
know kind of recreate it and apply the
changes we need to make and hopefully
it'll also teach you a little bit about
what RC six includes and what's changed
and so on alright so basically one of
the biggest changes is the addition of a
pool or NG module which is a file we
need to create and that's where we want
to import all of our components into as
opposed to just importing them all into
the main app component like we were
doing and this you also be able to load
modules like the HTTP module the route
or things like that within app dot
module alright so what we're gonna do is
over here you can see I have this ng
modify our c4 folder that's the original
application that's what I have here now
and if we go and we try to search let's
say Arrowsmith click on the link shows
us the albums
click on an album we can preview tracks
and so on alright so this other folder
here ng Spotify our c6 is where we're
going to build the new application so
we're gonna use the QuickStart just like
we did with the original so we're just
going to search for angular QuickStart
the first link here and we just want to
grab this git clone command and copy
that and then I'm going to open up a
command line command prompt as
administrator and we'll go to that
folder which I have in project slash dev
slash and she's spotify underscore rc6
okay and actually know what we're going
to delete that folder because that's
where I actually want to put it and
it'll create this command will actually
create the folder for us so I'm gonna
just delete that and we'll paste that in
and I'm gonna call this ng Spotify
underscore rc6
all right so let's go over to the editor
and let's take a look okay so a lot of
this is the same as our c4 okay most of
it is actually if we look at package
Jason and we look at the versions here
you'll see that all of the angular stuff
is now our c6 alright and if we open the
app folder you can see app component TS
which is not a new file
same thing with main TS but then we have
this app dot module dot TS and if we
look at that you can see that that's
bringing an NG module and NG module is
where we can put all of the modules
we're going to use all the declarations
or components you can see that the
actual app component is being imported
in this file and then included in
declarations so any other component we
create we need to include here as
opposed to in the app dock component
file all right now these are getting red
underlines because we didn't actually
run npm install yet so let's go ahead
and do that so we want to CD into that
folder and let's run npm install alright
and while that's running I'm going to
just open up the rc4 folder okay so this
is the original application and what
we're gonna do is go into the app folder
and you can see we have components and
we have a services folder so we want to
create those so in the RC 6 we're going
to create a folder in the app folder
called components and let's also create
a folder called services and then what
I'm going to do is also open it up in my
file manager so projects dev rc6
and I'm going to bring over into
components now from here we don't want
the jsut don't want the compiled files
so I'm going to just recreate these
folders so we have about album artist
navbar and search and now like I said
most of the code in these components
doesn't need to be changed so we're
gonna bring over the TS and the HTML for
each of these that's album okay artists
navbar and search okay so we have those
component files now let's bring over the
service so just the TS file alright
now let's also take a look at the main
component in the rc4 so that's app
component TS i'm going to open that in a
different window in a different editor
alright so notice that we're importing
all of these components in this file and
that's not something we want to do in
our c6 we do want to import them but not
into the app component we want to bring
it into the app module dot TS so i'm
gonna copy all of these and let's bring
them into app dot module dot TS so right
here we don't want the router directives
that's actually something we don't need
to do anymore and then what we need to
do is just
add them to the declarations okay so we
have navbar components and it's a search
component boat alright and let's see
that needs a comma right there
and that's how we include our components
so let's save that and then we're gonna
go to our app component TS and we do
want to bring in the service into here
and we also want to let's see for
providers we want the service in here as
well okay not the HTTP providers we
actually don't need those alright so
that should be good so we'll save that
app component ts file and actually let's
look at the template I'm going to change
this to template URL change this to app
component dot HTML and we're also going
to add module ID set to module dot ID
okay and that's going to make it so that
we can use relative paths so save that
and then we need to create our app
component HTML file and we can actually
just grab that the old version so let's
see where is it
c4 let's bring over go ahead and open it
up
copy that okay so we just have our
navbar component and then we have the
router outlet okay and then we'll set up
the router in a minute so we'll save
that close it okay let's see what else
in the rc4 app we also have the
definitions for album we have album TS
and artist TS we want to bring those
over so we'll copy that and we're gonna
bring that over here
paste that in and now we're going to
implement the router so in the app
folder we're going to create a file
called app dot routing dot TS and the
documentation if you look at the
documentation has some pretty good
information if we go to tutorial and
then routing let's see right here app
dot routing dot t-- s so we're gonna
grab this paste that in and you just
want to include the components that you
want to include in the router so I'm
actually gonna just paste those in here
so we have the search component the
about the artist and the album alright
and then we need to define our routes
down here so we'll leave this blank for
the home page and the home page we want
the search component to render okay then
we're gonna have copy that
I'll have the aboat which is going to be
obviously the about component then we'll
have our artist now artist is going to
have an ID parameter so we're going to
say slash : ID change this to artist
component and then we also have album so
this will be album / : ID we'll change
this to album
okay and then there's one more thing we
need that's the export code which is
right here
okay so we're exporting a constant
routing called routing which is set
module with providers to rot router mod
or router module dot for route and then
we're passing in that app routes which
comes from right here okay so let's save
that and then to use this we need to
include it in the app dot module file so
we're gonna go up here so you can see
that this is kind of like an
initialization for all the the
components and modules so we're going to
say import routing and it's going to be
from dot slash app dot routing which is
the file we just created and then we
need to include that down here and our
imports okay we'll save that I just want
to look at our component files let's see
about TS that's good okay now in album
doc component TS you'll see we have
these router directives we didn't we no
longer need this so we can get rid of
those ok so we'll save that ok an artist
dot TS we also have those we can get rid
of save that navbar
and then search can also get rid of
those all right so the router should
actually be all set so now I want to see
what happens if we go ahead and run this
so if we say NPM start ok and we're
gonna open up a console and let's take a
look at the error here so it's saying
can't bind to ngmodel
since it isn't a known property now the
reason we're getting this is because we
need to include the forms module inside
of the app dot module file so we're
going to go over there and let's go top
here and say import forms module and
that's gonna be from angular slash forms
okay so this is how we include modules
so we're going to add this down here to
import now this this also uses the HTTP
module so we're going to also include
that
so angular slash HTTP and then we'll
include that down here as well just like
that okay I'll save that now down here
we're getting an error because we didn't
include the base href in our HTML file
so let's do that we're gonna go down
into index.html and go right here
say base href so this is just for the
default path for your router which we're
going to set to slash now we also want
to include our bootstrap file which I
believe we're using a custom IDE boots
watch version so let's go to our RC for
app and open up index.html bring that
over okay so I'm going to grab this link
right here and I'll put that right here
and that should be it so we'll close
that out save now this style dot CSS
we're gonna go down here to style dot
CSS and just get rid of everything in
here
and save it alright and now if we look
over at our application it's running
there's no errors let's go ahead and
test it out
okay oh we do have some CSS that we need
to add though so let's do that okay
we'll go back to our c 4 code and open
up styles.css and just grab everything
in there paste it in here and save okay
and then we're gonna go back to
localhost 3000 let's try that again
all right so Aerosmith we have all the
albums a album track so we can preview I
don't have my sound on but you can see
it's working view and Spotify and
that'll take us to the Spotify page
alright so the application is now
completely compatible and working with
release candidate 6 ok let's make sure
the about works which it does so the
routing is working so I will include a
link to the github repository for the
new code if you got confused at all just
leave a comment and I'll see if I can
help out or if somebody else can help
out and I will be in the process of
updating some of my other angular 2
videos as well as the edge' wanax course
which I would suggest that you check out
alright so thanks for watching and I'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
