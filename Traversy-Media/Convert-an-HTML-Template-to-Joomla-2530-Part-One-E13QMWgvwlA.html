Joomla template a joomla 2.5 template
which will also work for a joomla 3.0
and we're going to take a standard HTML
CSS template and convert it into a
joomla template this is the template
that we're going to convert this is
straight HTML CSS it's called business
design and I didn't create this template
this is created by site creative as you
can see in the footer but we will be
taking this and converting it into a
Joomla template and I chose this design
just because it's very simple I will
have a logo a navbar module and a static
image module as well as some side and
footer modules in this particular
template doesn't have any inner pages
but what I want to do is just the inner
pages will be the same except they won't
have this image okay so let's get into
it first thing I want to do is go to my
Joomla site and it's just a brand new
Joomla installation without without the
sample content
so this is a straight I just installed
it there's no no content nothing's been
added to it so you can follow along if
you want to install Joomla I do have
some videos that will show you how to
install Joomla with zamp
which is a that's what I'm using it's a
local Apache server and it has MySQL PHP
5/3 and um Apache so the first thing I
want to do is add some content I want to
be able to just program the template and
have the content already be there so
we'll create the menu with the menu
items as well as the content the main
content on the home page and the each
module so let's login to the admin area
try to keep this this whole video within
three parts I don't really want to have
a million parts so I'll try to do it
quick
all right so what I'm going to do is I'm
first going to create the home page
content and that's going to be an
article so what we can do is go to our
template the HTML template and open up
the index file and what we want is the
the let's go back to Chrome what we want
is this this entire thing here so from
business design to enjoy the design so
let's grab this I'm just going to copy
it for now I'm not going to cut it out
and I'm going to put that in the home
page I really don't like JC I mean I
don't like tiny MCE the editor I prefer
JC e so I'm going to actually install
that alright so we have the home page
and we'll keep we don't need categories
and featured yes so save that
now I'm going to go ahead and install
GCE you can just Google jce and you
should be able to find it I believe
there's a free version I'll see
I'm just going to
right here
this might not be the latest version but
that's alright
I just really don't like the default
editor because it's just it rearranges
HTML and I just it just does stuff that
just can cause problems so after I
install it I go to global configuration
and change the edit default editor to
jce
all right so now if we look I'm not
going to I'm not going to create all
these pages I'm just going to create
I'll probably create the about page and
then the rest will just be just a dead
length that'll go nowhere because you
guys know how to create pages so I'll
create that one about page
so this will be about us and for content
let's just grab some dummy content lorem
ipsum blip some calm
come on
okay I'm going to generate some content
while the site's slow
all right so I'm just going to grab some
of this
copy that and I'm going to paste it into
the HTML I'm going to add just the
paragraph tags because if you don't do
it through the HTML then it's going to
copy the format of the text which I
don't want alright save that let's go
ahead and create those menu items so
I'll go to menus so our main menu and we
get the home let's go let's see what we
got
click view site so we have the home page
content by default joomla includes all
this stuff and i don't want that so
we'll go to go to article manager and
options and i'm going to let's see
I don't want to show the author I don't
want to show that show the dates or the
navigation
no read more I don't want to show icons
so I'm going to click hide for all these
and then in category I don't think I
just hide whatever is there
same thing with categories
all right stay even close
so now if we go back to the front end
we still get this category showing
let's see hi-oh show category hide link
category no show title yeah
all right see if that got rid of that
stuff
in this um this home and home page I
don't want that
so I'm going to go to the homepage in
the article manager and I want to hide I
want to hide the heading so I'm going to
click on article options and hide for
the show title and then go back to the
main menu and click on home because
right now if we reload
we still have that home and home page go
to page display options show page
heading no article options show title
hide and that should clear this up yeah
there we go alright so and we can also
change the title you can see up here it
just says home let's change that by
going to page display options and here
we want to put we'll just put business
design
alright now we'll create the rest of the
menu items so click new and that we do
have an about us articles so I'm going
to click on single article and I'm going
to call is it about us or about about us
okay save and new and next we have
technology solutions we got to select
the article for about us first
oh good you know
so now we're just going to create a
blank link so we want to select external
URL and that's going to just be a palm
symbol
all right so save and new next we have
portfolio same thing it's going to be
just a blank link
next we have strategic partners
okay
so then we have contact and then jobs
maybe I'll make another tutorial after
this where we'll actually create these
pages but for this particular tutorial I
just want to show you how to make the
template and how to set it up
contact and then we'll do jobs
all right so we should have our menu and
in the default joomla template the menus
on the side so if we reload we should
see all those links you should be able
to go to the about Us page yep
alright so what we have next we have the
menu of the console it's grab this image
it must be set as a background image I
don't like that let's just go see how it
looks in index.html
so the header in this tech particular
template it's just a div and the div
contains the image so what I'm going to
do is just copy this div and I'm going
to put that in a module position so if
we go to module manager um new custom
HTML
this is going to be the main image and
it's going to be in the guest header
well yeah we'll put it in the header
we're going to have to program this
position when we make the template if we
toggle the editor we can just add in the
HTML and we want this to only display on
the home page so I'm going to click only
on the page select it and click home ok
so that's that let's get out of here
next I want to do the side modules which
will be the right position so we have a
copyright and then an other info box so
let's select new custom HTML
and this is going to be what is this
copyright
and will choose to show the title we'll
just have to maybe add some CSS to get
it to display right position I'm going
to program this is going to be the right
position and let's just grab that text
sometimes I don't even use the editor at
all I just use a straight HTML so let's
save that and create another module on
the right
grab that so this is other info and
that's going to be on the right I'll
paste that text in with some paragraph
tags
and I'm going to just leave these at all
pages and we have show on all pages okay
so next we have the footer menu will say
footer menu and footer right for the
footer menu I'm just going to
I'm going to create another menu called
footer menu
and I'm just going to copy all the items
from the other menu so I'll go to main
menu select all these and then let's see
we want to we want to copy to the footer
menu
okay so now we have if we select footer
menu it should be the same so it has
that two next so I probably to delete
those so let's go back to module manager
create a new module which will be a menu
and we want to make sure a footer menu
selected can you name it we don't want
to show the title position will be will
say footer for the left and that's on
all pages so save that and create a new
module and this will be the footer right
position we don't want the heading to
show and this will just be we'll call it
credit because what it is it's just the
back link to the template creator and
let me grab that
so span ID copyright alright so I'll
grab that whole span tag
I'm sorry we chose menu we don't want
menu we want custom HTML for this module
so new custom HTML
put that span tag in and this will be
credit what I write hide the title
and make sure it's on all pages yeah all
right so let's save that
all right so now we have all our modules
set up I'm actually going to stop this
video and continue on another one
because we're over 15 minutes now
so I will see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
