continue on our angular 2 front-end and
I want to start with the home page just
to get that looking good there's not
much to do besides add markup then we'll
move on to probably the register page so
we'll create the form and then we'll
need to create a service on our angular
app so that we can make our request to
our back-end and register a user so
let's open up the home component HTML
file and we're just going to add some
stuff in here I'm going to paste most of
this in okay because it's just HTML so
we have a Jumbotron which I'm putting
classic text center we have our h1 a
paragraph with the class of lead and so
you can see that whole thing and then we
have a did with two links formatted as
buttons so we have the classes button
primary and then we're doing our router
link to the register and then we just do
the same thing for the login okay so we
have two buttons and then under that
we're just going to have three different
four column divs let me just grab that
real quick okay so I'll paste that in we
have a class of row and then we have
three call MD for divs with an h3 and
then a paragraph and if you want to copy
that if it is so it saves that and then
if we reload the home page it should
look like that
so now let's close the home up and let's
go to our register component so we want
to go to register and let's go to
register component PS and we're going to
create a property for each field for the
user so above constructor we're going to
put in name which is going to have the
type of string okay remember angular 2
uses typescript so we can use static
typing here
user name email and password
okay so those are the properties and
let's see we'll save that for now and
then let's go into the register HTML and
we're going to put it up full so I'm
going to paste in a very basic form okay
so we have our h2 with the class of page
header says register and then a form and
then each field is wrapped in the full
form group class it has a label and then
an input okay which are all text except
password is a password so what we want
to do is is we want to be able to access
the data that's in each of these inputs
and those are going to pertain to these
properties so to do that we need to add
in an NG model and that needs to be
wrapped in brackets and parentheses okay
and then we say ng model and then we're
going to set this one to the name
property alright now we also need to
have an attribute called name and set
that to whatever we set in the ng model
if we don't do that we're going to get
an error okay we want to do that for all
of these so let's just copy that and
then this one will be the username and
this one will be the email
and password
okay so now that we did that we want to
create an event whoops what I do here
oh okay so we want an event so on the
forum with events in angular2 you want
to use parentheses and we just want to
say the type of event which is going to
be a submit and we want to set that to
call a function called on register
submit just like that so let's save it
and then we're going to go back to the
class and create that on register submit
and then just to test it out we'll do
console dot log and just do one two
three all right so let's save that and
let's make sure that that tucked up
correctly so if we go to register and we
click Submit let's go down here and see
we get one two three now to get the the
data for mitrios we can just use this
dot name and that should give us the
name value so let's try that we'll just
put something in there and submit and
you can see we can get that because
that's a linked these properties are now
linked our bind it or bound how you say
it to each of these inputs okay so the
next thing we want to do is we want to
create an object from these fields so
that we can get that ready to submit
into our request so let's do a const
user and let's set that to an object
with a name and the value of that is
going to be this dot name user name
let's do name email
email username and password okay so
that's going to build out that object
and then let's do some validation and to
do that we're going to need a new
service a validation service so let's go
over to our app folder our source app
folder and we want to create a new
folder called services okay and then
we're going to looks and want to do that
we're going to navigate to that folder
so I'm going to stop the the front-end
server for a moment and we're going to
CD dot dot back into the app folder and
then we're going to go into services and
then from there we're going to do ng G
service validate okay and now you can
see it created a validate service file
so in order to use that we need to go to
our app module file and we need to
actually bring that in ourselves because
for some reason they don't have they
don't have that available for services
like they do with components so it's
doing port validate service from and we
want to go with dot slash services slash
validate dot service ok and then we just
need to put that in the providers right
here ok and that should do it so let's
save that close it up and then let's go
to our validate service and we're going
to create a validate register function
ok so let's go under the constructor and
let's say validate register
and that's going to be passed in that
user object and then we want to just
make sure that it has all of the fields
okay because everything is required so
let's say if will say if user dot name
is equal to undefined or and I guess we
can just copy this okay or user dot
email is undefined or user name or user
password we don't need this last one
okay so if any of those are undefined
then we want to return false okay and
then let's do an else and we'll do a
return true so that's our validate
register now I also want to be able to
validate the email so let's create
another one validate email and that will
be passed in an email account or an
email address and we want to validate
this with a regular expression now I
don't have it off the top of my head so
if we search for a JavaScript validate
email and I think it's this one right
here right here we're going to grab this
from Stack Overflow okay we're just
going to change that to conch so
basically we have our regular expression
this long long thing here and that's
going to make sure that it's in the
format of an email and then we just want
to return that regular expression test
and then pass in the email and it'll
return either true or false true if it's
or it's a good email false if it's not
all right and then we'll save that and
that's all we have to do here so let's
go ahead and close it up now back in our
register component we're going to have
to we're going to have to import the
validate service okay so we're going to
import that from and I need to go out
twice dot slash dot dot slash services
slash validate dot service ok and then
we need to inject it into the
constructor any time we use a service
and a component we need to inject it
like this so we'll say private validate
service and insist that to uppercase
validate service so now we can use this
dot validate service so let's go down
here and we're going to go ahead and do
required fields so we can save this dot
or not we want to do an if so we'll say
if not validate service and then we're
passing in a user looks actually this
should be this dot validate service dot
validate register
okay so if not that means that they're
not all filled so let's test it out by
just doing a console log please
fill in all fields all right and then
we're going to just return false all
right and then we're going to do the
email one so we'll grab this validate
email so we'll change the function name
to validate email and then here we're
going to pass in user dot email that's
all we need we don't need the whole user
and we'll say please use a valid email
all right so let's go ahead and save
that we'll try it out so if we reload
this look we need to start the server
back up so we're going to go back to
angular source and run ng serve
it's clear this down here okay so if we
try to submit you can see down here
please fill in all fields so if we fill
in all fields but not a valid email
please use a valid email and if we said
a test that tests comm and submit you
can see we get nothing that that means
that everything is passed okay so we now
have our form validation and you can use
this this type of service in all your
angular apps so we probably won't get to
the submission the registration in this
video so I cuz I need a little more time
for that so what we're going to do is
implement the flash messages before we
go so let's do a handler to flash
messages okay so we're going to want to
install it with this right here actually
did we already install it I think I did
let's look at package Jason no we didn't
know we did so we have to run this not
make sure that you don't run this from
the root it has to be in the angular
folder let's slow down here we'll stop
the server and we're going to make sure
you're in the angular source folder and
then we're going to run that install
see oh I didn't do NTM we want to run
this
okay so that's going to go ahead and
install that flash messages module all
right so now we're going to run ng serve
again and then let's go to our app dot
module TS and we're going to have to
bring that that flash messages module in
so let's go right here and say import
flash messages module and it's going to
be from angular 2 - flash messages and
then we have to add that - to our
imports right here so let's go right
below the router and we'll say flash
messages module so it saved that and
then we need to put and just like we did
with the router need to have an outlet
so we're going to go to our main app
component HTML file and let's put it
right above the router outlet okay so
we'll just say flash what is it / -
messages
all right so let's save that and we can
close that up and then we're going to go
back to our register component TS file
and up at the top we're going to bring
that in so it's saying import flash
messages what is it flash messages
service from angular to blast messages
okay so it has its own service now just
like with any other service we need to
inject it into the constructor so right
here we're going to put a comma and then
let's do privates let's see I'm going to
say let me just check to make sure what
we're putting here
so private flash messages service
actually let's just do flashed message
we can call it whatever we want we just
need to set it to this okay so then
whenever we want to do a flash message
now we can say this dot flash message so
let's go down here and instead of a
console log we're going to say this dot
flash message and then that's going to
take in actually each called dot show as
well so dot show and that will take in
the message which we want that to be and
then some options and we can set a CSS
class okay now since this is an error
message I'm going to set it to alert -
danger
and we can also set the time out so the
time it takes for it to disappear I'm
going to say 3,000 milliseconds so 3
seconds and then I'm just going to copy
that and paste that here and we'll just
take this message and put it here all
right and then we'll get rid of that
so hopefully this works make sure our
server is going ok and then we'll go to
our register page and reload and let's
try to submit please fill in all fields
and it should disappear and then if we
put in a bad email address please use a
valid email awesome and again this is
something that you can use in your and
all your angular projects it's really
nice okay so in the next video I promise
we'll create our off service and we'll
start to work with the backend</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
