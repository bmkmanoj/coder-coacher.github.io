do a video on the Google Maps API and I
thought that was a pretty good idea
because there is a lot of info out there
there are a lot of videos but most of
them are really old and not very well
put together so I want to do kind of a
no nonsense guide on creating a map
adding markers we're going to organize
the code so that we can easily add
markers to an array we're going to make
it so that we can have custom icons for
our markers if we want we're going to
add pop-up overlays and so on
alright so that's what we'll be doing in
this video let's go ahead and get
started this video is sponsored by dev
Mountain if you're interested in
learning web development iOS or UX
design dev Mountain is a 12-week design
and development boot camp intended to
get you a full-time job in the industry
to learn more visit dev mountain comm or
click the link in the description below
alright so let's go ahead and get
started now I have the documentation
open for Google Maps which is
developers.google.com/maps
and there's a few different guides if
you're developing for Android iOS web
services but we're going to be dealing
with just web so we're going to click on
that and we're also dealing with the
JavaScript API there's a lot of
different services a lot of different
API is you want to make sure you're
using the JavaScript one all right and
then if we go to create map with a
marker we're not going to just we're not
going to strictly follow this and you
know copy all the code exactly but it
gives you a good idea of how to get
started so I figured I would just you
know kind of go and kind of keep this
open as we go along now in order to use
this if you look down here when we
actually include the map API script you
need to have an API key alright so to do
that we're going to go to our Google API
console which is console
developers.google.com/maps so let's say
create project and for this I'm just
going to say test project and click
create
alright and then this isn't just for
maps this is for any any Google API
geocoding
you know YouTube video api's things like
that so let's go over here and click
this and go to let's say we want to go
to dashboard and if we click on enable
API these are all this this is all the
stuff we have to choose from so we can
work with Google Docs and Gmail and
Google+ social social networking API is
all this stuff analytics what we want is
right here Google Maps JavaScript API so
we'll click on that and then we're going
to say select project and let's select
and we're going to choose test project
and then if we go to enable that should
enable it and it should give us give us
a key so if we go down to credentials
and create credentials we want to create
an API key and there it is right there
ok so let's go ahead and just copy that
now you can restrict this to certain
domains if you want but we're just going
to leave it completely open and let's
just click close alright so there's our
key there we can come back to this page
whenever we want so now we can get
started on our project so I'm going to
go into Adam which is the text editor
I'm using and I have a folder called my
map with an empty index.html file and
that's all we're going to need for this
project now I do have a couple plugins
installed that I'm using I'm using Emmet
so I can use shorthand like if I wanted
to do a div I could say div tab that'll
give me a div tag or I could do ID hello
and tab it'll give me an ID of hello so
if you see me do that I'm just I'm using
Emmet alright and then I'm also using a
package called atom live server which
just opens this file up on my localhost
and you don't need this you can just
open it up in your file system but I'm
going to go ahead and use this so if I
go start server it'll actually open it
up on a port on my localhost
alright now if you want these installed
as well you just need to go to settings
and if you go to install and you want to
search for
Emmit packages and you want to install
this here all right and then if you want
this the live server just search for
atom live server packages and you're
going to want this one here by jazz chen
okay so those are the two plugins that
I'm using but again you don't need those
you don't need to use atom use whatever
you'd like
alright so with Emmet I can just do an
exclamation and then tab and it's going
to give us kind of an HTML structure so
just a save some time and I'm just going
to change the title here we'll just say
my google map alright and then down in
the body we're going to need to put
we're going to need to include the
Google the Google map API script so if
we go back to that documentation page
here and we look at the example we want
this here the script tag so let's copy
it and I'm actually just going to
minimize this and we can make this you
can make this really small because
everything is responsive and I'll just
make this a little smaller alright so
let's go ahead and paste that in our
body and notice that we need to put our
API key in so let's go back to that
credentials page I guess this isn't
responsive but I'll just scroll over and
I'm just going to grab the key here make
sure you guys use your own this one will
not be valid so we'll go ahead and paste
that in now notice that it has a
parameter called callback that's set to
an it map so it's going to try to load a
function called init map so what we'll
do is put in another set of script tags
right above whoops and in here we're
going to have to put our function okay
we're going to call it a knit map okay
now we're going to need a place in the
HTML to dump our map so if we look at
the code sample here you'll see there's
an ID of map so that's what we're going
to do right above the script in the body
let's put a div with an ID of map
okay and nothing goes in there it's just
just the plain dip I'm also just going
to put an h1 above it and we'll just say
my google map all right and then inside
a NIT map we're going to want to do a
couple things so we're going to want to
set a variable called map and set it to
a new Google Map object okay since we
included this script right here we can
do this new Google Maps dot and then we
can do different things to get the map
we just do dot map and that's going to
take in two parameters one is going to
be the the element that we want to dump
it in which is the idea of map and then
some options now I like to put my
options inside of a variable so what I'm
going to do is save our options
oops and set that to an object and then
here we want to put our zoom level which
I'm going to set to eight I think the
max is like fourteen or something like
that we'll check that out and then we
also need the center okay wherever we
want to Center this now right here they
put it in a variable called ul you our
view and you see it's an object with a
latitude and longitude I believe that's
in Australia what I'm going to do is get
the latitude and longitude for our
Boston which is the area that I live in
and we're just going to grab that and
then over here let's put an object with
lat paste that in and then we'll grab
that put a comma here LNG and then we're
going to do negative and then pass that
in alright so there's our options now we
need to create the map object so let's
save our map equals and then we can do
new Google Maps dot capital ant map and
remember that takes in two parameters
one is going to be document dot get
element by ID and it's going to be the
ID of map we're referring to this right
here and then the second parameter will
be the options that we created now if I
go ahead and save this and let it reload
you'll see that nothing we don't see
anything that's because we haven't set a
height and width to our
okay so it has the idea of map so let's
go in the head here and say style and
say idea of map and we're going to set
the height to 400 pixels and then we'll
set the width to a hundred percent of
its container and if we save that and
let it reload now we have a map okay and
you can see it's centered on Boston and
we can go ahead and change the zoom
level if we want so if we were to say
like zoom to save that you'll see it
zooms way out if we go let's say zoom 13
you'll see it goes away into the city
all right so I'm just going to keep it
at 8 all right so that's how we can get
just just the map so now we want to add
a marker so to do that if we look at the
documentation here we create a variable
called marker set it to a new marker and
then we put in the position and then the
map we want to add it to all right so
let's go down here under where we
created the map variable let me just add
some comments here as well so this is
the map options and this is we're saying
new new map and then here let's say add
marker so we'll do variable marker so
that's a new Google Maps dot marker
alright and then this is going to take
in an object with a position of where we
want to put the marker and I'm going to
grab the position for let's say Lin mass
which is the city that I was born in
alright we'll grab that just like we did
with the center we're going to do lat
paste that in and then LNG and we'll
grab that okay paste that in now we have
the position and then we need a
parameter or counter parameter but a
value here that's going to be the map we
want to add it to which is the map we
created right here so it's just
do that alright and then if we save and
go back you'll see that we have a marker
okay we can zoom in and you can see it's
on Lin mass alright now we can add as
many markers as we want but for now I'm
just going to stick with this one and
then I'll show you how we can make it so
that we can add more in an efficient way
now the next thing I want to do is show
you how to use a custom icon okay
because you may not want this this
marker okay so right here we can just
add in I think it's icon and then I'm
just going to grab a link here to a
beach flag icon so let me paste that in
you'll see it's at the developers Google
site it's in the documentation images
slash your Beach flag so if we save that
you'll see that the mocker has now
changed all right now if you have
multiple markers you can make it so that
you can have different icons for each
one or you know some of them may be you
know to mark a beach like we're doing
here or to mark a restaurant things like
that mosquito in here but that's how we
can add a custom marker now let's go
ahead and add an info window so that
when we click on this we have this
pop-up with some text or some content so
for that what we're going to do is go
under the mocker and we're going to do
we're going to create a variable called
info window and then let's set that to
new Google dot Maps dot info window
alright and then that's going to take in
an object with the content that we want
so I'm just going to put an h1 here you
can put HTML and I'm just going to say
Len mass now that itself isn't going to
do anything if I save it you'll see it
doesn't work what we have to do is add a
listener to to listen for that info
window so right under it let's take
marker dot
adlistener and we want to listen for a
click because we want this to happen
when we actually click it and then we
have a function that runs okay and then
we're just going to say info window and
that has a function associated with it
called open and then that's just going
to take in the map and the marker so
let's save that and now if we go over
here and click you'll see we get our
pop-up window with the h1 all right so
that's kind of cool so that's basically
how you can add you know single marker
with with a custom icon with an info
window but now what I want to do is I
want to make it so that we can have
multiple markers now what we could do is
copy all of this right here and then
just paste it in for each each and every
marker but that's not very efficient we
want to do this in a different way so
I'm going to cut I'm going to comment
out what we just did I'm going to keep
the options in the map and then just
comment out the rest which is down to
here alright and then we're going to
just do things a little different so the
first thing I want to do is I want to
have a function called add marker where
we can just pass in values and we can
then put the dynamic values here instead
of hard-coding it alright so let's say
add so add marker function so function
add marker alright and then let's make
that take in the coordinates
so we'll say chords all right and then
let's copy this where we actually
created the marker and we'll paste that
in and instead of this being hard-coded
we're going to say chords ok now if we
leave it like this every single marker
is going to have this icon and I'm just
going to keep it like that for now after
I'll show you how we can make it make
them different alright so we have this
add marker function we also want
you know what let's not do the
infowindow just yet let's just go ahead
and call this ad marker function and
let's grab the location this right here
are the coordinates and tap that in and
let's see if this works so we'll save
and there it is all right now if we
wanted to add another one we could copy
this paste it in let's get the
coordinates for let's say aims very mass
which is where I live now just copy that
paste that in and we'll grab this one
that save it let's go back and I see we
have two markers okay
so let's add another one we'll say I
don't know two Haverhill so grab
actually let's copy this and paste that
in here grab that
Oh got the floor on that one and now we
should have three so we can keep adding
markers alright now what if we wanted to
have custom icons for certain markers so
what we would do here or what I would do
this oh there's a lot of different ways
to do stuff like this this is just one
so what I would do is I would change it
from just entering the chords into this
function to entering some properties
alright and chords will be one of those
properties so what we'll do is let's go
in here and stay chord with chords : and
then that's going to be its own object
we have to add another one over here
another curly brace that should be
chords alright we're going to do that
for all of these looks
it should only be one there okay
alright and then down here instead of
taking chords it's going to be a props
object which is this entire thing and it
has a value of chords so right here what
we'll do is just do props dot chords so
if we save that that should do the same
exact thing now in addition to the
coordinates we want to be able to put an
image or an icon so let me just bring
this down here like that and then we'll
put a comma and then let's do we'll just
say icon image alright and then let's
grab this copy that put it in there and
then instead of doing this hard-coded
image we'll do props dot icon image
alright now we're only putting it in the
first one which is Lin mass so that
should only be the would be the only one
with the beach icon so let's save and
there we go so all the markers these two
are going to have just a standard you
know standard map icon or marker and
then Lin has the the beach flag okay
now this isn't really a
optimal because since we're not
inputting I con image into either of
these it's it's undefined so it's
actually setting icon to undefined and
that's you don't want that so we can set
it a different way so what we'll do is
comment this out for now and then let's
go under still in the add marker
function but under where we created the
variable for the marker and we can
actually test to see if that parameter
is there if that icon images there so
let's say if props dot icon image then
we want to set the image and we can do
that by taking that marker and saying
set icon and then we want to set it to
props dot icon image let's put a comment
here say check for custom icon and then
we'll say set icon image save that and
now you can see it's the same thing but
it's much it's better because we don't
have an undefined value here all right
so let's see what else we want to do
here let's go ahead and do the info
window all right now obviously we don't
want the same info for everyone so we
have to pass that in as a property as
well so we'll go up here put a comma and
let's say content and I'm going to set
that to an h1 and let's say landmass and
then down here we're going to do kind of
the same thing we did here we're going
to check to see if the content was put
in for that particular location so let's
say check check content so say if props
dot content then we're going to do what
we did up here we're going to create the
info window and then we're going to add
the listener so I'm just going to copy
that
put that in and except we don't want
this hard-coded value
want this to be the props dot content
that was passed in all right so let's
save that and now if we go and click on
this one here you see we get our pop up
these ones don't because we didn't pass
anything in if we wanted to we could
take that and let's go ahead and put a
comma there and then we'll say we'll
pass in the content and I believe this
one's aims very so now if we save that
and we go click up here you see we get
the aims very mass alright so hopefully
this is making sense to you guys
I mean you do have to have a little bit
of knowledge of JavaScript to really
grasp what's going on as far as you know
JavaScript objects so let's see what
else I want to do now I don't want to
have to call this add marker like this
so three different add markers and then
for every single one we want so what
we'll do is put all of this stuff all of
these properties into an array up at the
top all right actually we'll just do it
right here so let's create one second
all right so let's create an array of
markers okay so we'll say var I'll call
it markers set it to an array okay and
then what we'll do is grab this one so
everything that's inside of these curly
braces and copy that paste it in alright
then we'll put a comma and let's grab
the second one paste that in comma grab
this last one
there we go and now what we'll do is
loop through this and then for each
iteration we'll just call add marker
once as opposed to calling it every
single time here and filling up our page
so for that let's do loop through
markers and we'll do a for loop and
we'll put in here var I is equal to zero
and then we want to say as long as I is
less than markers dot length okay and
then we just want to do I plus plus
which will increment it by one after
every iteration so what we'll have to do
here is just take add marker paste that
in like that and see and then all we
have to do we don't need to pass in a
single object will just say markers and
then the current iteration okay so I
represents whatever one of these that
we're currently on so it'll go it'll do
this one and this one this one and keep
going and then we can just get rid of
these three so a much much cleaner way
to to do things all right so let's save
that and there we go so works the same
way but it's much cleaner okay so let's
see what else we want to do here let's
make it so that when we click on an
empty area in the map or click anywhere
in the map it will actually create a
marker for us now it's not going to
create like a you know a Content window
or anything like that it's just going to
be the image because I mean we could
create a form and then do it that way
but that's that's going to that's going
to get too complicated I want this to be
kind of basic so to do that we're going
to have to add a listener we can add a
listener on the map to listen for a
click event so let's put this right
under or actually let's go up to the top
right under where we created the map so
we'll say add I will say listen or click
on map so to do that we're going to do
Google dot dot event dot listener or I'm
sorry add listener okay and we want to
pass in the map we want to listen on
which is you know the variable map and
then the event which will be a click and
then we want to run a function all right
so this function will take in an event
parameter and then in here we just want
to call add marker okay now remember the
add marker takes in properties object
right so we'll pass in an object and
then like I said we can't we're not
going to do a custom icon or anything
like that we just want the coordinates
okay so just chords and we can get that
with event dot lat LNG that will
actually get the latitude and longitude
of the area that you click in so we'll
just say add marker all right so let's
save that and now you'll see when I
click anywhere because it goes and add
the marker if I reload they're going to
be gone and they're not getting saved in
the database or anything that's
something that maybe we could do in a
different video but I think that that's
going to be it for now
so just imagine if you had a forum and
you could submit that form to a database
you could save locations and then when
we're calling or when we're fetching
this array right here this array of
markers this could be stored in a
database all right and you could you
could update them you can make it so
that when you click on in a form opens
you can edit the information so you can
do some really cool stuff with this and
I'm not like I said I'm not going to get
into database stuff back-end stuff I
just want to give you kind of an
introduction to some of the things that
you could do with the JavaScript API all
right so hopefully you
I enjoyed this video I know it's a
little different than what we usually do
but you know I like to try to fulfill as
many requests as I can so thanks for
watching and I will see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
