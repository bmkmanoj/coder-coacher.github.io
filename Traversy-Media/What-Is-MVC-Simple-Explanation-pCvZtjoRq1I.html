following my channel for a while then
you probably know that I like to take
difficult concepts and try to explain
them in a simple way so that you can
really wrap your head around it so in
this video I'm going to try and explain
the basics of MVC now I'm not going to
go into too much depth because I want
this to be beginner friendly I also want
it to be short and like I say in many of
these videos feel free to share your
opinion and knowledge or disagree just
be respectful to everybody so MVC stands
for model view controller and it's a
software architectural design pattern
now I'm explaining this from a web
development point of view it works a
little different for other types of
programming and some programmers even
say that you can't have true MVC in web
development or in a web framework and
I'm not going to debate whether that's
true or not but I'm going to be
explaining things from a web dev
perspective
all right so MVC is definitely one of
the most frequently used design patterns
most of the popular web frameworks use
at least some parts of MVC and the
general purpose or goal is to separate
functionality not just functionality but
logic and the interface all kinds of
things in an application so this
promotes organized programming and it
allows multiple developers to work on
the same project with these ok and this
is somewhat true for all design patterns
but especially with MVC so before we
take a look at the different components
that make up MVC let's take a look at
some popular frameworks that use MVC
concepts now notice I said MVC concepts
the reason for that is because MVC can
mean different things to different
people and frameworks can kind of borrow
some of the concepts and still be
considered MVC and a good example of
that would be something like Ruby on
Rails or PHP code ignitor these
frameworks actually have folders in
their file structure called our folder
structure called models views and
controllers and then something like
Django for Python just borrows certain
concepts but doesn't actually have that
strict folder structure
and then another thing that can happen
is one framework will put one aspect of
the app in the controller and then
another one would put it in the model so
I think that's why MVC is so confusing
because there's not just one way to do
it there's actually many many ways to do
it all right so we're going to now get
into the three components of MVC which
is Model View controller so first we
have the model which is responsible for
getting and manipulating the data so
it's basically the brain of the
application usually it interacts with
some kind of database this could be a
relational database like MySQL or NoSQL
database like a MongoDB it really
doesn't matter and in many frameworks
that support multiple databases the
model code will stay the exact same okay
it's just the database driver that needs
to change and it doesn't even it doesn't
even have to be a database that works
with it it could be a simple file okay
so you could just you could have your
model interact with a JSON file and pull
data from that alright so it takes care
of queries like select insert update
delete the model also communicates with
the controller in most cases the
controller can request data through the
model and in most cases the controller
updates the view but with some
frameworks the model can actually update
it directly update the view another
example of what makes MVC complicated so
just realize that there's different
implementations and they can act
differently from framework to framework
all right so next we have the view and
you can probably guess what that takes
care of that that's the actual view of
the application so it's the user
interface it's what the user sees when
they interact with the application so
the view usually consists of HTML and
CSS along with dynamic values and from
the controller so the controller does
communicate with the view as well as the
model now depending on which framework
you use the template engine may vary and
the template engine is what allows
dynamic data if you have straight HTML
we can't output variables we can't use
logic
select an if statement so with template
engines we can do that stuff right in
the view or right in the template so
some examples of template engines would
be handlebars dust these are based on
JavaScript then we have for Ruby on
Rails we have ER B which is embedded
Ruby you can also use Hamel H a ml and
then with Python you have flask I'm
sorry
with flask you have Jinja or Jinja too
and there's a lot more of them out there
and some do more than others some are
better than others but you have a lot to
choose from especially with JavaScript
all right so finally we have the
controller and the controller takes in
user input so this could be from from
user visiting a page or clicking a link
which makes a get request or submitting
a form which makes a post request and we
also have delete requests put requests
for updating and these can't be made
directly from the browser from the
browser you can only do a get or a post
but we do have HTTP clients that are at
times built in with the framework that
can do that now the controller acts as
kind of a middleman between the model
and the view the controller will ask the
model to get some data from a database
and then the controller will take that
data and load a view and pass that data
into it ok and then from there the
template engine takes over and can
basically do some logic do some output
for the variables and things like that
alright and the controller can also load
a view without passing it data so just a
plain web page with HTML and CSS no no
actual templating logic so here's a very
simple example or diagram now we have
the user which sees the view of the
application in the browser and it can
make some kind of requests with input to
what's called a router ok and their
request could be some kind of link that
they clicked on some kind of route and
then the router will call a specific
controller method based on that route
and if data is needed if you need to
fetch some data the controller will then
interact with
model which interacts with the database
and then once the controller gets that
data passed back it can then load a view
and it can send the data to the view and
it'll get dealt with by the template
engine okay and then once that's all
done it'll send it'll send the view back
to the browser for the user to see okay
so hopefully that was hopefully you
could understand that at least just a
little bit it is it's a little tough to
explain all right so now I just want to
take a look at some pseudo code that I
wrote this isn't in a particular
language this is in code that's going to
work anywhere it's just an example so
how this whole thing works with MVC is
you get some user input in this example
we'll say the user clicked a link or a
wrote in the URL your app comm slash
user slash profile slash one so
ultimately they want to view the user's
profile that has the ID of one so the
first thing it's going to do is go into
the route and it's going to see if see
what it matches so it would match this
because its users slash profile and then
excuse me slash one now one can change I
mean obviously you don't want to just
load this one profile all the time this
could be anything so that's why we have
the colon here in front of the ID it's
kind of like a placeholder all right so
it's going to match that route and then
we're going to just basically call this
users get profile and pass in the ID
okay so this is calling the users
controller right here okay and the class
is going to match this in most cases and
that's going to have a function of get
profile you can see that's right here it
takes in an ID and then what it's going
to do is grab a variable profile and set
it equal to this dot user model dot get
profile profile ID so now it's calling a
function called get profile within the
model okay and if we go down here in the
user model class we do have a function
called get profile and it's passing the
ID in
so this is where we want to interact
with the database because that's what
the model does so it's calling this DB
jet and passing in a query select all
from users where the ID is equal to the
ID that's being passed in it's going to
get that it's going to put it in a
variable called data and then it's going
to return that data back okay so that
when it gets the data back it will be
put in this profile variable so now what
we want to do is render a view so we're
going to render a view that's in the
user's folder and then profile and we're
going to pass the data we got into the
view okay and then down here in the
actual view file the template engine
will basically make it so that we can
insert these dynamic values right in the
HTML many of them use this syntax the
double curly brace some use one curly
brace some use percent signs and curly
braces so it's all different depending
on what engine you're using so what it's
doing is it's going to display the
user's name in the h1 and then an email
and a phone number in the list item ok
so that's how that all works hopefully
that was a somewhat clear and you can
understand to me this code looks a lot
like CodeIgniter for PHP but you know
they're all relatively similar in some
way ok they all go by you know the model
being the data and the controller being
kind of the traffic controller and the
view being what the user sees and also
interacts with alright so hopefully you
