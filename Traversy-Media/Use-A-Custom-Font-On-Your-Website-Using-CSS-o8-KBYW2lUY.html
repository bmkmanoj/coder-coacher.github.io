solutions this video is going to be
going to show you how to use a custom
font on your website on your HTML
website you probably know there's about
16 web safe fonts which you don't need
to include any special files or anything
that would be Arial Verdana Tahoma which
are all great fonts but it kind of
limits you when in terms of a looking of
your website so you can get different
kinds of fonts we're actually gonna use
this we're gonna use Jill sans light or
Gill sans lait don't really know how
it's pronounced but this is fonts calm
which is a pretty good place to buy
fonts as you can see this one's 30 bucks
I think some of the prices for fun this
isn't too bad but some of them are just
crazy
paying over $100 for some letters but I
mean I already have this I'm not going
to purchase it or anything I already
have it on my computer I'm gonna upload
it to the website so I mean you know you
buy the font download it and if you want
to use it on your computer on your local
machine and Photoshop or whatever then
you have to go to control panel and
fonts and the file you download wherever
you get it you want to drag over and put
it in here I already have the Jill
stands I believe
right here you'll see this a couple
files that means that it's just some
different variations you can see this
ultra bold Jill sans light which we are
going to use and then ultrabook all this
condensed in ultra bold so we're gonna
use Jill sans light so I'm just gonna
copy it out of here
and put it on my desktop to upload to my
site now my site is just um it's just an
HTML template if I actually don't have
it on a server or anything that's just
right on my local machine because
there's no there's no PHP or anything
it's just straight HTML and what I want
to do is change these headers these h3s
to jill sans right now the aerial and i
want to change the h2 this is actually
an image which i'm going to have to
switch out so we want to do an touch
that i get some another H 3 and H 2 so
we're going to go into our web site and
this is the root of the web site and you
know we have a CSS images now we want to
create a fonts folder and this will be
just like background images you know you
can include it in your CSS just like as
if it was an image so we're gonna take
that let it go
let me take that Jill sans font and
we're gonna put it in our fonts folder
so now we're going to open index.html
and Dreamweaver and from here we can
access CSS files we're going to use
template CSS so what we're going to do
is I'm going to put in app flan face
just like any other CSS style and we're
going to put font family
Jill Jill sans and white and of course
whatever font you're using that's what
you'll put and now I'm going to do SRC
URL we're just going to do it just like
an image we can actually take this put
that here and then just change this to
fonts
and change this to it was yeah you gonna
put the actual file name there so we're
just gonna go here I'm gonna copy this
and put that
right here
it's a TTFN you also might be RTF or CCF
alright so that's that so all we have to
do now is add the font to our tags the
h3 tags are right here I'm actually
going to increase it to 22 pixels
because the spawns kind of small it's a
small an Arial so and now we're just
gonna do one family just like any other
font we're going to Bill sands and I'm
also gonna make this bold and save now
I'll go back to our site and refresh
this should change and this
you see now that Jill sands this was an
h3 that changed now I just want to
change this this is an h2 so we'll go
into h2 and I'm going to change this to
28 and I'll just copy this save I'll
reload
what does it change yeah yeah changed so
now the h2s all the h2s and h3 is on the
site will be Jill sands you know you can
change whatever you want you can make
the paragraphs a different font or
whatever it's pretty easy so that's that
