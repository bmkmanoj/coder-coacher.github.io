that wants to become a web developer in
2017 whether you're just starting out
and you know absolutely nothing about
coding or your front-end developer and
you're not sure where to go next even if
you are one of the lucky people that
know everything and you want to just get
a sense of what technologies are
currently in this guide is going to
benefit you all right so we're going to
take a look step by step at which
technologies you should focus on and at
what point you should move on and start
to learn something else all right when
you're a web developer you can never get
too comfortable if you stay at the same
level of just building HTML CSS and
basic JavaScript sites your entire
business is going to be eaten up by
something like Wix there's now programs
that can do your entire job and can do
it better than many of the web designers
out there all right so you need to stay
ahead of the machines all right so let's
create a plan to make you the best
developer possible so where do you start
this is actually probably the easiest
question of all anyone that tells you to
learn anything other than HTML and CSS
first is not a web developer and the
reason that you learn these first is
because HTML and CSS are the building
blocks of the web of all websites all
web applications even if you have the
most advanced web application running on
a server powered by nodejs or PHP with
all types of functionality and databases
the most complex backends possible the
front of that website is still going to
be produced with HTML and CSS and
probably some client-side JavaScript and
HTML handles the markup in presentation
CSS handles the styling and the
positioning another really important
reason to learn HTML and CSS is because
there's no alternatives
okay these are always used and there's
no way to be a web developer without
knowing them when it comes to
server-side languages you have a choice
between you know PHP Ruby on Rails Java
tons of different technologies but as
far as the front-end you need to know
HTML and CSS
yes you have html5 and XHTML and so on
but they all stem from the same tag
syntax and once you know one the other
is really easy to learn all right when
it comes to html5 versus HTML 4 or XHTML
it's your preference but I would always
suggest using HTML 5 it's less strict it
has more features and it's it's by far
more popular now you can get by in the
world of server-side programming by
knowing let's say 50% of PHP however
when it comes to HTML and CSS you really
should know them inside No okay you
should be able to position anything
anywhere on the page and know exactly
what tags to wrap those elements in this
should really shouldn't be a big deal
because both of these things are really
easy to learn they're not programming
languages with tough logic to grasp it's
simple markup and style sheets all right
it's very declarative and they're just
really simple to learn relative to other
programming technologies all right so
you learn HTML and CSS now let's take a
look at some of the basic tools that
you're going to need to create your
websites all right so first of all
you're going to need a text editor and
there's a ton out there it's all
preference everyone's different some
people can just use Windows notepad and
if you want to step it up a notch you
could go to notepad too which gives you
some extra features I would suggest
using something like sublime text or a
DeMeo which are basically advanced text
editors they're not quite I des but they
do have really nice code highlighting
they have plugins and there's just a lot
of different features that are really
helpful if you want you could get some
kind of IDE could use Dreamweaver or
NetBeans or maybe some kind of premium
software but I wouldn't suggest that I
mean you know it's all preference if you
want to spend some money on it on a
really complicated IDE you can do that
but I just think it over complicates
things
a lot of stuff that you really don't you
don't need if you're coding Java or C
sharp or something like that that's a
little different where you have to
compile code and all that that's
something that you you probably do want
an IDE for but I would suggest sublime
text overall so image editing
don't let this overwhelm you I know you
know Photoshop and illustrator these are
really complicated powerful programs you
just need to know the basics
okay so basic image slicing cropping
things like that you know if you want to
resize an image just very basic things
when it comes to at least in web design
all right now if you don't want to spend
the money for Photoshop and Adobe
products you could use something like
GIMP or something else I personally use
Photoshop that's all I've ever really
used so I don't know too many options
but just do a quick google search and
you'll find a bunch of a bunch of
different great options you also want an
FTP client I would suggest FileZilla and
then an SSH tool which it gives you a
way to access your server your remote
server putty is a good one for Windows
this isn't something
SSH isn't something that you need to
know at this point but you do need to
know at least FTP so you can get your
files onto the server okay you also want
a good browser you can either use chrome
Chrome or Chrome I'm just kidding if you
like Firefox or even Internet Explorer
god bless you that's fine I would
suggest Chrome it's it's really fast it
has a great JavaScript engine that the
dev tools are great I wouldn't use
anything else
Firefox is up there too but yeah you
need a good browser obviously cloud
storage this is something that's
optional with something that I don't do
without I use Dropbox just so I have
access to my files from anywhere from
any machine from on vacation in it and I
need to update some code
I'll use Dropbox and of course I also
use git and github but we'll get to that
later
alright so basic JavaScript
once you learn HTML and CSS this is
where I would suggest you go next
alright and I'm not talking about nodejs
or any reactive frameworks or anything
like that at this point I'm talking
about basic JavaScript so you want to
learn things like data types strings
numbers arrays object and objects and so
on functions conditionals loops
operators these are all these are all
things that you'll need to know in any
programming language so it's really
helpful for you to learn this now if you
learn how to work with functions and
conditionals
that will also help you later on if you
wanted to learn something like Java or C
sharp or some high-level language so you
want to you want to grasp the the basic
programming principles
all right event handling is another one
so when you click a button you want to
fire off an event you want something to
happen dynamically on the page all right
I'd also suggest learning JSON which is
JavaScript object notation most of the
API is that we deal with now our in JSON
format and it's really easy to learn you
could spend a day and you could learn it
and master it's really easy alright so
you want to get Jason under your belt at
this point jQuery is a great library for
a Dom manipulation it makes a lot of
things in JavaScript much easier but I
would only suggest learning it if you
want to feel comfortable with JavaScript
all right so learn your functions and
loops and all that and then move on to
jQuery and you'll see how how much
easier some things are to do when it
comes to selecting things in the Dom
events things like that all right so
once you learn HTML CSS and basic
JavaScript you want to know how to
deploy a website alright I say a website
because you're not building web
applications at this point an example
would be a site for some
a business or something like that all
right so you want to get a shared
hosting account Hostgator is really good
I know a lot of you probably disagree
when it comes to hosting everyone has
different preferences but I've dealt
with Hostgator for a while I have a
reseller account with them and they've
been really good as far as support and
all that in motion also pretty good
really cheap you want to start with a
shared hosting account to learn cPanel
which is really popular control panel
for managing your server on your hosting
account so you can set up email accounts
you can set up your FTP accounts from
there
SSH things like that ok
next thing you want to be able to do is
to upload a project via FTP
so grab FileZilla and it's all gooey
it's all drag-and-drop you can take your
local version of your website your HTML
site and just drag it and upload it to
your server alright once you do that
you'll need to register a domain name
and link that to your hosting account so
that you can access your website on the
web alright and that's pretty much it as
far as deploying a basic website it's a
lot easier than deploying something like
an ojs application so once you've
mastered the stuff we've talked about so
far you can call yourself a web designer
ok notice that designer is underlined I
wouldn't suggest calling yourself a web
developer yet not having any knowledge
of programming logical programming aside
from basic JavaScript it really doesn't
really doesn't make you a developer I
mean you could say it but you might get
some some blowback in the development
community alright so while you're a web
designer you can build simple but
professional websites so as I said small
businesses always want web sites
nice-looking websites and they don't
really need any special functionality
you know and about page services things
like that contact page really easy stuff
you can build UIs for web applications
so you don't have the ability to build
the backend yet and
work with databases but you can you know
build the UI the user interface in the
front end you can do PSD or of course
any any image format to HTML CSS
conversions so a lot of times a designer
might have an image of what they want
and you'll be able to take that and then
use your HTML and CSS skills to turn
that into a website and you'll be able
to work for a company or you could be a
freelancer all right now a web designer
paygrade is going to be much lower than
a programmer but it is still you can
still make a good living you can still
you know pay your bills and all that and
I enjoy what you do at the same time so
where do you go next once you are
basically a front-end developer or a web
designer you can move on to learn some
front-end framework so bootstrap
foundation you could start with
server-side languages like PHP or Ruby
you could start to learn JavaScript
frameworks like react or angular or you
could start learning databases so MySQL
PostgreSQL database out of these choices
what I would choose to do next is
front-end frameworks all right and the
reason for that is frameworks like
bootstrap save you a ton of time when it
comes to building out UI's they also
help you with design if you don't have a
really good eye for design if you're not
a graphic designer
these frameworks will help you with that
and help you create nice looking buttons
and nav bars and all that all right so
let's take a look at some of the
different front-end frameworks all right
so as I said Twitter bootstrap is the
one that I would suggest it's definitely
the most popular the most has the most
features foundation I would say is in
second place has a lot of the same stuff
bootstrap has the grid system all that
and then you have others which I haven't
really used skeleton Mui and peer are
some of them there's a lot more
I can't really say too much about them
because I haven't used them too much all
right now let's say Twitter bootstrap
for example gives us a whole bunch of
stuff okay so it gives us CSS components
to work with buttons lists groups formed
and input controls and formats them to
look really nice alright so we don't
have to individual add custom individual
styles for each of these elements also
gives us helper classes so if we want to
float things or align text we can just
add a simple class on it we don't have
to actually write out the CSS grid
system probably one of the best things
about using one of the using these
frameworks make allows you to lay things
out on the page without having to do
your custom floats and all that if you
want a three column row our four column
row it's really easy to do you just add
a couple classes and another big plus to
that is that it makes your site
responsive alright and what that means
is that your site is going to adapt to
whatever screen it's being looked at on
so if your users are on a mobile device
the grid will it'll reshape itself for
that screen size and it'll look good on
that device as well as you know a
27-inch desktop screen alright so that's
a huge plus
javascript widgets are also available so
bootstrap has things like slideshows
collapsible tabs things like that that
you can implement really easily so next
thing I would do is choose a server-side
programming language so we have PHP
which is not the best language
structurally but it is rock-solid and
it's not going anywhere now I realize
that as I go through these a lot of you
are going to disagree with what I say
which is absolutely fine everybody's
entitled to their opinion but PHP is a
strong language it's been used on all
the huge websites it works really well
with relational databases like MySQL
alright so you have PHP another one is
no js' which is
a really new and exciting and powerful
framework it's not a language it's a
it's a JavaScript runtime okay so it is
JavaScript and what's attractive about
this is you probably know some
JavaScript so what you would do is just
add on to your your JavaScript skills
with nodejs and you also need to
understand some fundamentals about you
know server-side code and how that works
but since you know javascript already
this may be a good choice all right we
also have Ruby and Ruby on Rails which
is a framework now this is a really
powerful framework you can build really
advanced web applications but it has
leveled off a little bit the community
is kind of quiet right now at least from
what I've seen I would suggest learning
Ruby on Rails but not first we also have
Python which is really easy to learn
it's not as popular it's more for
scripting type tasks I would suggest
going with PHP or nodejs
and notice I do have PHP underlined
that's ultimately what I would suggest
one because that's what I did and I
think that you already knows from
JavaScript so I think it's healthy to
start to learn a different language as
well and you can see the similarities
and the differences between both alright
so now that you know a server-side
language you want to start to work with
databases and by no means do you have to
master the server-side language before
working with databases these actually go
hand-in-hand all right so first of all
we have relational databases which are
databases that run on tables okay your
data is kept in tables in those tables
you have columns sort of like an Excel
spreadsheet but on a much higher level
all right so we have MySQL which is
extremely popular also extremely easy to
use
we have postgrads PostgreSQL which is
similar to MySQL but it's a little more
advanced and in my opinion a little more
powerful I would suggest you learning
MySQL first because it's easier
and it's also there's a huge community
it's really popular you also have no SQL
databases or non-relational databases
and these work similar to Jason okay so
if you have a JSON array in JavaScript
you have these objects that are wrapped
in a curly brace and then you have key
value pairs that's ultimately what NoSQL
database looks like especially something
like MongoDB which is a document
database a document database is just a
type of no SQL database
you also have column databases and a
couple other ones couchdb is another
really popular no SQL database now you
need to pick a combination here and I
would definitely suggest either PHP in
MySQL or nodejs and MongoDB okay so
these two go together really well
PHP MySQL node and Mongo so if you're
learning PHP I would also suggest MySQL
alongside of that okay same thing with
Mongo with node so at this point there
are some other technologies that you
should be learning as well
one is git which is a version control
system this allows you to basically save
versions of your applications you also
want some kind of repository github is
definitely the most popular it makes it
easy to backup your work it makes it
easy to share your work with other
developers you can create branches so
that you don't actually affect the main
repository the main code and you can add
some kind of functionality for instance
a login or something like that and then
you can merge it with the master branch
without any kind of you know
interruption in the code for other
people working on it all right so it's a
really important thing to learn you also
should start to get your feet wet with
the command line okay
so basic command line tools and commands
SSH is really important you use SSH a
little bit when you're working
get and gives you a better faster way to
work with the server you can upload
files things like that so you want to
start to look into that stuff alright
now as far as the front end you also
want to start to learn some CSS pre
compilers pick either sass or less
they're very similar and these give you
a more efficient way to write your CSS
you can use variables which is really
powerful
mix-ins which are like functions in CSS
you can nest styles you can do a whole
bunch of stuff I actually have a few
good videos on my channel on set on on
both actually but I would suggest sass
it's a little more powerful and a little
easier to use you also want to start to
learn about api's and rest services with
your your browser and you can make HTTP
requests whether it's a get request to
fetch data from a server or post request
to upload data to a server you want to
get familiar with HTTP and restful
services alright and I also have some
videos on creating REST API s on my
channel HTTP and SSL you also want to
learn a little bit about that so that
you can create secure sites and you can
you know upload SSL certificates and and
get into that as well
alright so deploying apps you want to
move away from a shared shared hosting
account and start to learn more about
dedicated servers and VPS VPS is a
virtual private server which is
basically a dedicated virtual machine
that you rent out okay you get a lot of
the same abilities as you would get with
a dedicated server but it is cheaper
alright now as far as app posting
there's a lot of different services
especially if you're using nodejs and
JavaScript technologies you can look
into Heroku digitalocean which basically
gives you what's called a droplet and
it's basically a little Linux instance
ok
so just a little Linux server that they
give you and you have complete access
you can do or install whatever you'd
like on it you also have AWS which is
Amazon Web Services which offer a whole
bunch of services as far as hosting as
far as storage things like that so you
want to read a little bit about that
ok deploy tools alright so for instance
if you're using node.js you might want
to look into something like flightplan
which allows you to easily deploy your
your application onto a remote server
deploying can get a little tricky I'm
actually going to be coming out with a
deployment series hopefully that shows
you how to deploy these apps I know that
on my channel we have a lot of tutorials
on building these apps but not much on
actually getting them out there alright
so hopefully I will have that for you
guys in the future you also want to
learn a little bit about the Linux
command line ok when you're working with
dedicated servers chances are it's going
to be a Linux server just you know basic
how to get around file structures how to
create files you probably want to learn
Nano or some kind of command line text
editor those kind of things all right
you want to know how to do maintenance
on your apps and also how to update them
when they're on a remote server alright
so if you have learned what we've talked
about up to this point you're now a web
developer you can create simple to
advanced web applications you can build
back-end API s all right hopefully you
can build restful services and you know
a little bit about you know HTTP
requests and all that also you can work
with servers whether it's an Apache
server or an express server or something
like that also admin databases so if
you're working with PHP and MySQL you
should you should know how to go into
the database and add tables and all of
that whether it's through the command
line or it's through a tool like PHP
myadmin
if you're working with nodejs and Mongo
you should be able to know how to use
the Mongo shell and it once you know all
this stuff you should be able to get a
really really good job or you could keep
freelancing and up your your prices or
you could start your own business
alright so once you know languages and
databases and all that you might want to
look into frameworks which can really
help you streamline your your
development can really speed things up
ok so javascript has a whole set of
frameworks we have react which is a UI
framework it's actually a library but it
could be a framework as well and it is
to help you build really powerful user
interfaces all right it doesn't handle
database access things like that it's
it's more in the UI but it's extremely
powerful for building interfaces
you also have angular 2 which is more of
a full client-side framework it has an
HTTP module so you can you know make
post requests and all that you also have
view j/s which is similar to react as it
works in the view model and then you
have Express which is a back-end
framework for nodejs
that can handle routing and templates
and all that stuff alright so you want
to pick one of these one or two of them
and learn that as well now if you're
into PHP you have a whole bunch of
different frameworks you can choose from
so laravel seems to be the most popular
one of the most powerful it is a little
difficult to learn if you want something
easier I would suggest code ignitor it's
not as powerful it's not as popular
right now but it is really easy to learn
and can really set the stage for you to
learn other frameworks as well alright
another one is Symphony which is also
really powerful but kind of tough to
learn now if you're if you want to do
something else aside from JavaScript and
PHP you could do Ruby on Rails which
uses the Ruby programming language also
really popular
but as I said earlier it is kind of
leveling off a little bit now most of
these frameworks have a certain design
pattern called MVC which stands for
model view controller and that's really
important for you to understand so the
idea of this is that a model is the part
of the application that works with the
database okay makes calls to the
database brings in data inserts updates
data things like that the view works
with the user interface okay so the
templates the part of the application
that the user sees and then the
controller is basically handles the
routing it handles when to call model
functions things like that and these MVC
frameworks handle things like routing
database mapping they offer different
helpers for various tasks data binding
templating and UI okay so they're all
different some of them may only use
certain aspects of MVC but it is a
really important design pattern for you
to learn all right so content management
systems and I'm talking about PHP
content management systems like
WordPress Joomla Drupal these are tools
that allow you to basically build
websites without having programming
knowledge to and to an extent if you
really want to customize these these
websites and applications you will need
to know PHP and of course HTML and CSS
but you can install WordPress or Joomla
or Drupal without any programming
experience whatsoever but I would
definitely suggest learning the stuff
that we've already talked about at least
front-end development and maybe a little
PHP before using these these systems at
least on a client level or in a business
level all right so these technologies
are great for client work and
maintenance the reason I say that is
when you build a WordPress website for
example you can give your customer the
the backend admin login they can go in
and then they can
update their articles they can add blog
posts they can do all this stuff on
their own without having to bother you
to edit the code and I'll tell you that
when I ran my company tech guy web
solutions I focus mostly on Joomla
Joomla has kind of died down since that
time but it was really popular and it
was a great platform they have a lot of
great components and modules and I would
build the Joomla site and give my
clients that info and they would handle
the you know the updates of the blog and
all of that now I did it kind of
backwards I started to use Joomla on a
professional level before I even knew a
lot of PHP and that really that really
limited me because clients would ask for
stuff and I wouldn't be I couldn't do it
I mean I could look for other components
to do kind of what they wanted but not
really I couldn't go in and edit the PHP
and that was a big mistake I should have
really learned PHP before I started to
work with that stuff on a client level
all right so that's why I put this way
at the end here all right so with all of
these WordPress Joomla Drupal there's
thousands of plugins and add-ons that
can do all kinds of stuff you have
e-commerce plugins you have SEO plugins
pretty much anything they all have their
own repositories where you can download
them and install them some are most of
free some are not this makes for really
fast development especially if you're
using not a custom theme but something
that you buy or that you download and
you're using pre-made modules and all
that it makes it really fast but it can
be very limiting all right
if you're using a theme that someone
else made it can be really hard to tweak
that to be to make it the way you want
it all right sometimes you probably just
want to build your own custom theme all
right but of course you have to know how
to do that now I have WordPress
underlined because at this time that's
definitely what I would suggest it
started out as a blogging platform but
it's really now just a complete website
and web application
platform not only that but I think it's
the easiest to customize WordPress
themes are really easy to build I do
have a bunch of tutorials on that as
well building plugins isn't too hard so
I would just definitely suggest
WordPress at this time all right so now
you're going to want to start to look at
mobile app development it is the future
obviously everyone has a smartphone and
tablet so you definitely want to look
into this you don't need to learn Java
and objective-c and I chose the I'm
talking about these languages because
Java is the official language for
Android Objective C is for iOS for Apple
but with the addition of technologies
like react native ionic Cordova these
allow us to build mobile apps using
javascript okay so we can build out
JavaScript applications and then wrap
them in a native container using
something like ionic and Cordova and
then react native which is awesome new
technology allows us to use the react
framework to be able to do this it
actually creates native components from
react code alright so now what now what
do you do after you know all this stuff
ok so now you can focus on your career
focus on your business you know promote
your business find clients all that good
stuff you do want to go back and learn
more if at this point you've mastered
PHP and MySQL I would suggest to go back
and learn nodejs and MongoDB because you
know the more skills you the more skills
you have the better you're going to do
as a developer keep up-to-date with the
latest technologies of course you don't
want to fall behind and have Wix now you
know building PHP sites in one click and
taking your job away from you you want
to you know know all the latest
technologies you may want to go and
learn a high-level language like Java or
C sharp which I have yet to do I mean I
know the basics but I would like to get
more
to that it's not needed but you know
just a suggestion all right so that's it
for this guide to learn most of these
technologies that we've talked about
you can visit travis e Mediacom check
out my courses by edge wanax and of
course subscribe to my channel I know
this was kind of a long guy that
hopefully you know you guys that stayed
with me thank you for that and I will be
making more of these types of videos
because I really want to help you guys
that are getting into web development I
know how tough it can be and I know that
there's a ton of technologies and it's
wicked overwhelming and you know you
