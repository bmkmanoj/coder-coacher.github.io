application we can go ahead and search
for an artist and they'll pop up down
here click on one takes us to the
artists page which is the artist
component and it gives us the name okay
so what we want to do now is we want to
have an area up here where we have the
name and a heading and we have the in
image and the genres and then down here
we want to be able to fetch the albums
from the API and list those as well all
right so let's first go to the HTML file
artist AA component on HTML and we're
going to change up a few things here so
we're gonna get rid of that and let's
see we're going to add a header here and
I'm gonna give this a class of artists
header all right and then inside that
header we're gonna have an image now not
all artists will have an image so we
have to do a conditional here so we're
going to put a div and then we're gonna
do ng-if and what we want to do is check
to see if there's anything in the images
array so we can say artist dot images
and we want the first one so 0 actually
we know we don't need that yet we're
just testing so artists images dot
length if it's greater than 0 that means
there's an image all right now if
there's an image we want to display it
so let's say image we'll give it a class
of artists
- thumb and let's also let's make it a
circle we can do that with bootstrap so
we'll give it a class image circle and
then for the source attribute we're
gonna put in our curly braces and let's
say artist dot images and then we want
the first one so the zero index and then
dot URL and that should give us the
image so let's go ahead and save that
and we're gonna have to go back to
localhost 3000 and reload and then
search again and we'll click on that and
now you can see we get the image now
that's way too big we're gonna fix that
in the CSS but I just want to get the
rest of the header done first
all right so under the header we're
going to I'm sorry not under the header
within it under the image we want to put
an h1 and that's gonna have the artist
name all right and then I also want to
get the genres the first thing we want
to do though is test to see if there are
Chandra's because not all of them have
them so we're going to say ng-if okay so
ng-if artist dot genres dot length is
greater than zero then we want to will
say genres and then we want to have a
span and we want to loop through the
array of genres that's offered so let's
say artists know what you want to do
that we want to do an ng for
and here we'll say let's hardest of
artists dot genres alright
and then in here we just want to say
genre all right so let's save that I'm
gonna have to go back and reload and we
get the title
ok genres aren't showing up let's see
let oh this needs to be Chandra there we
go alright so now let's go to the CSS
file so Styles dot CSS let's see we're
gonna add here we want the artists
header so for that we're gonna add
padding bottom 20 and then margin bottom
20 and let's do border bottom which will
be solid one pixel and let's make it a
dark gray okay and then we're gonna do
the artist thumb so for that let's set a
width of 80 pixels we're gonna set
height auto and let's float it to the
left and then we'll do margin right and
that's gonna be 10 pixels alright so
let's go check that out
and there we go there's our header so
that looks pretty good now we want to do
is we need to fetch the album's for the
artist so to do that we're gonna add
another service function so let's go to
our Spotify service I'm gonna copy get
artists and then we're going to change
it to get albums all right now we need
another property up here for albums URL
and this is actually going to be the
artist ID that comes in just so we don't
get confused I'm going to change that to
artist ID all right and then let's
change this to albums URL and then all
we need to do here is change this to
artist ID since we changed it and then
it needs to go to slash albums so we're
going to concatenate slash albums and
then just change this to albums okay so
that should do it let's save it now
we'll go back into the artist component
and let's see we're gonna copy this
right here and let's paste that in like
that and I'm going to change this to get
albums and change this to albums okay
now when this comes back it's actually
going to be in an array called items so
we want to say albums dot items and
we'll save that and then let's go back
into the HTML and we want to stay within
the div but outside of the header and
let's put a div give it a class of
artists albums
and in here we're gonna have a row and
let's do an ng for because we need to
loop through the albums so this will be
wet album of albums all right and then
here just to test it out let's say album
dot name save that ok and there we go we
get a list of all the albums so that's
the functionality is there now we just
need to style the style this a little
bit and we want to get the images so
what we'll do right here is let's create
another div and let's give it a class of
call MD 3 ok so we want a couple three
column divs and that'll have the album
image images inside alright so in here
let's actually put another div and we're
going to give it a class of well which
will give it a background and also a
class of album alright and then let's do
we're gonna have to test to see if
there's an image because not all of them
have images so we'll do ng if and let's
say if album dot images dot length is
greater than zero
then we want to show the image give it a
class of album - thumb and also image -
thumbnail which is a bootstrap class and
then for the source for the source we're
going to put in our curly braces and
then say album dot images 0
dot URL alright let's go ahead and save
that and there we go we get all the
album images and don't worry about the
styling it will take care of that after
so under the image we're gonna have the
album name let's put it in h4 and then
under that we're gonna have a link or a
button or a link that looks like a
button and let's see we're gonna say
actually that doesn't need an a tag
right now let's just have it go nowhere
because what its gonna do is go to an
album page that we're gonna create in
the next video so let's give it a class
of BTN BTN default and BTN block alright
and then let's say album details
okay and then let's just add the CSS now
lips let's go to style.css and let's say
dot artist artists albums dot well I'm
going to set a margin bottom of 20
pixels let's set an overflow of auto and
I want to set a minimum height of 400
pixels all right and then let's see the
album itself
let's do text-align:center give it a
background of red gray padding
we'll say 10 20 and then a border gray 1
pixel solid alright and then let's say
dot album thumb I want to set that width
to 100% all right and I also want to add
a border around the main div that we
created so right up here let's say dot
mean border I just want it on the bottom
alright save that now you can see we
have that border and let's search and
there we go okay so we have each album
details isn't going to do anything yet
we're going to get to that in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
