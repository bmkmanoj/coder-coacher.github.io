left off after looking at all the
different selectors so we looked at the
document dot get element by ID get
elements by class name get elements by
tag name query selector and query
selector also now we're gonna talk about
traversing the Dom so basically kind of
moving up and down looking at parent
nodes child nodes and siblings so if we
look at the index.html here when we talk
about a parent node basically what that
means is let's let's take this h2 for
example so this h2 has a parent of this
div right here with the idea of main
this is this is the h2 parent because
it's inside of it
okay now this h2 is a child of the div
so that's a child and then we also have
siblings and this form here is a sibling
of the h2 because they're on the same
level neither one of them are inside of
each other so they're siblings so I'm
gonna show you how to query parents and
siblings and children and all that
alright so let's go back into dom j s
and all this code up here is all the
stuff from part one so first thing we're
gonna look at is parent nodes or parent
we have we have a couple different
methods we're going to use so I'm gonna
grab this item list right here
all these list items so I'm gonna create
a variable and I'm gonna call it item
list and I'm gonna set it to document
dot and I'm gonna use query selector and
we'll just grab the ID of items okay
because it's a ul with the ID of items
and that's what I'm grabbing so let's
take a look at the parent node okay so
we're gonna use the parent the parent
node method
our Pam sorry parent node property so
we're gonna console dot log and let's
say item list dot
parent node you see it actually comes up
here so let's go ahead and save that and
see what it gives us so it gives us the
div with the ID of main so let's take a
look at the HTML and we have our UL with
the idea of items that's what we're
selecting and then the parent node if
you pre go above h2 is not the parent
node that's a sibling
the form is a sibling h2 is a sibling
the div here is actually the parent
because it's inside of the div all right
so that's what it's giving us now we can
use this as a selector if we wanted to
so if I wanted to grab this and say like
let's say item list parent node dot
style dot background color equals and
we'll say light gray all right so what
do you think this is going to change
this is going to change the parent node
which is the div with the ID of main so
let's save and there we go so now we
have the gray background on the the main
the div with the idea of main and if we
look down here in the console it's
logging in and it now has that
background color now we can keep going
we can chain these things so if we want
to let's say grab this console log and
let's say parent node dot parent node so
what do you think that this is going to
give us we know that the div with the
idea of main is the parent node of the
items what's the parent node of the div
with the idea of main so let's check it
out and I think it's gonna be the
container so let's see let's go ahead
and save and we get the div with the
class of container all right and we can
keep going we can say what's the parent
nodes that and we get the body okay so
we think we can just keep chaining these
on all right now I'm just going to
comment this stuff out
and next thing we're gonna look at is
parent element so parent element is
basically the same thing actually know
what I'll do is just copy this because
for what we're doing it is essentially
the same thing so if I were to change
element so say element parent element
let's say we should get the same thing
and save and we get the same exact thing
we're getting the gray background we're
console logging down here so parent node
and parent element for the most part can
be used can they can be interchangeable
all right so what about children so
we're gonna look at we're gonna look at
a property called child nodes so it's a
child nodes and let's do a console dot
log geez I can't type console dot log
and we're gonna take that item list
which is the UL and we're gonna say dot
child nodes I cannot type on this
keyboard so let's take a look at what we
get here so what we're getting is a node
list okay some basically an array and
it's giving us all these different nodes
are all these different items here we
have 0 1 2 and notice that this 0 is
actually a text node okay so the text
node is actually the it just represents
whitespace okay so it represents if
there's a line break or anything like
that so if we look in our HTML here this
is what it's grabbing now it's getting
each list item but it's also getting
this text node in between which is
actually the line break if I were to go
ahead and let's just get rid of all line
breaks basically put all these el eyes
on one line and save and then take a
look
oh I guess we have we still have it here
and here so now if I save that then it
doesn't have any text notes it's just
all the list items so that is kind of a
pain in the ass so I would not suggest
using child nodes let me just get this
back to her I need it what I would
suggest using is children okay so you
have child nodes you also have a
property called children so let's look
at that
so if we say console dot log and we say
item list dot children and save let's
take a look at this and now it's just
the list items it's just the elements
it's not gonna look at the line breaks
as text nodes and put that into this
collection alright notice it's also an
HTML collection it's no longer a node
list okay so there are some differences
now if we wanted to access a specific
child like let's say this one right here
which is item two has the index of one
I'm sure you guys if you guys have been
following along you probably know how we
can do that we can say item list dot
children and we can put in our brackets
and we'll select the one element and
then you'll see it's listing out item
two okay and if we wanted to do
something with that we could take it and
let's say dot background color and we'll
set that equal to yellow let's see that
didn't work oh if we got style
and there we go so we can use that all
right so we also have a property called
first child so let's say first child and
we're going to console dot log the item
list and we're gonna call first child
all right now you probably think you
know what this is gonna give us you
probably think it's gonna give us this
item one but let's go ahead and save and
it doesn't it gives us the text node
okay just like with the child nodes this
is going to include any whitespace any
line breaks or anything if I were to go
and get rid of that line break right
there or just that space and save then
it'll give us the first one okay so to
me first child is is kind of useless at
least for what I've used it from what
I've been to what I do so there's
another method called first element
child which is probably what you want to
use so it's a first element child and
we're gonna just console.log the item
list dot first element child and then
that will give us the actual li alright
and we can take that first element child
and let's say dot text content and we'll
change that to let's say hello one save
and you can see that the first one is
now hello one and then we also have last
child and last element child which does
the same thing so I'm just going to copy
that
block its comment all this out and let's
change this to last child and last child
element our last element child
so let's first see what last child gives
us we'll go ahead and save that it gives
us that last text node and let's go
ahead and save this and we just need to
change this to last element child and
we'll change this text to let's say
hello for all right so now you can see
that it's logging us the last li and
then it's also changing the text content
to hello for all right so first child
last child first element child last
element child next thing we're going to
look at is siblings okay so up to this
point we've been looking at parent
parents and children now let's look at
siblings so let's say we want to get the
next sibling okay that's actually a
method so we're going to console dot log
and let's grab the item list and you can
test this out on any element you want I
just chose the item list but let's say
dot next next sibling and save and again
it's going to give us the text node okay
so just like with first first child last
child next sibling we also have next
element sibling so it's say next element
sibling go ahead and change this to next
element sibling and why did that happen
item list our next element sibling Oh
does it not have any yes see it okay so
it's null because it doesn't actually
have a next sibling if I were to put
let's say a span here let's save that
and then you can see it's the span okay
so I just chose something that doesn't
actually have a next sibling
all right let's see what else are we
gonna look at we're also gonna look at
previous sibling so behind console dot
log and let's say item list dot previous
sibling see what that gives us again
it's going to give us the text node and
I'm sure you already guessed that we
have previous element sibling as well
okay so that's going to give us the h2
because before the UL it does sibling
before it is the h2 and of course if we
wanted to do something with that we
could take it and let's say dot style
dot color and we'll set that to let's
say green and there we go so you can see
you can select anything you want and you
can do whatever you want with it with
JavaScript you don't need jQuery I know
I sound very anti jQuery I just think
that like I said the analogy that I like
is is using a sledgehammer to kill a
mosquito you don't need it it'll work
but you don't need it and it adds that
extra it adds that extra file to your to
your page and slows just slows you down
that much now don't get me wrong there's
there's a lot of really nice jQuery
plugins for things like you know
hardcore animation like when you scroll
down a page and you want certain things
to pop out at certain spots I mean you
can do that kind of stuff in JavaScript
but there are really nice jQuery plugins
that will save you a lot of time and
it's a lot less code so I'm not saying
don't use jQuery for anything I'm just
saying for simple Dom manipulation
there's really no need for it alright
guys so what I want to do now is I want
to get into actually creating stuff
creating Dom elements from JavaScript
and inserting them because right now up
to this point we've just been selecting
them we've been changing the content and
stuff like that but I want to show you
how we can actually create elements and
insert them alright so we're gonna look
at let's see we're gonna look at a
method called create element alright so
let's go ahead and let's create a div so
we'll create a variable I'll call it new
div not new deck new div I don't need a
new deck I don't think
and we'll say document dot create
element should I edit that out
so create element div and what we'll do
is add a class to that actually let's
console.log at first so we'll just say
new div and you can see we just have a
single div so we can take this div and
we can do different things with it let's
say we want to add a class to it so
we'll go ahead and we'll say new div dot
and we'll use class name
okay so class name and we'll just set it
to hello save and now we're logging it
again and you can see it has a class of
hello if we wanted to add an ID to it
then we could say actually let me put a
comment here we'll say add class and
then we'll say add ID so we'll take our
new div and and we're gonna say dot ID
equals and we'll say hello one save and
now you can see it as a class of hello
and an ID of hello one now if we wanted
to create another attribute on to it
like let's say a title let's say add
attribute we can say new div dot set
attribute set attribute and it's going
to take in one parameter is going to be
the actual attribute you want let's say
we want to add a title and then the next
one will be the value we'll just say
hello div let's save and now you can see
it has a title on it so what if we want
to insert something in here because
right now we just have just the div tag
we don't have any content inside of it
so for that we're going to have to
create a text node so we're going to
take actually we're going to create a
new variable here
and we're gonna call this new div text
and we're gonna set this to document dot
create text node okay and then in here
we can put whatever we want let's just
say hello world all right so now we have
this this div text what we want to do
now is append it to our divs
all right so let's say add text to div
so we'll say new div and we'll say
append child okay because it's gonna be
a child of the new div and we're gonna
pass in our new div text all right so
now it's safe and console.log and you'll
see that now hello world is inside of
that div
so we've constructed this all from
JavaScript all right now what I want to
do is I want to insert it into the Dom
because right now it's just it's just
it's just existing inside of our
JavaScript it's not actually in the Dom
all right so what I'm gonna do is we
need to figure out where we want to put
it so I'm gonna say I want to grab the
header container if we look at the HTML
inside the header we have the class
container because I want to put it I
want to put it right here
all right well right below this div so
let's create a variable and we'll just
call it container of course you could
call it anything you want and we're
going to use the document dot query
selector and inside here we'll say in
the header we want the container class
alright and then I'm also going to grab
the h1 the header h1 so we'll set that
to document dot query selector
let's grab the header h1 alright and
then what we'll do is let's see we'll
take our container and we're gonna say
dot insert before okay and that's
exactly what it's gonna do it's gonna
insert before and it's gonna take in two
parameters one is gonna be what we're
inserting which is new div and then one
is gonna be what we're inserting before
which is gonna be the h1 all right
so let's go ahead and save that and
there it is there's our hello world if
we go ahead and we inspect it you'll see
that it has all of the as the class the
ID the title and it has the text that we
constructed in the JavaScript all right
whoops what I do so if we wanted to
change let's say we wanted to change the
font size we could simply go in here and
say new div dot style dot font size and
we'll set it to let's say 30 pixels save
and we can treat it just like any other
div element okay so it's now part of the
Dom I'm sorry I said div element I mean
Dom element all right so I think I'm
gonna stop the video here guys because
in the next video I want to start to get
into events right now we've just been
selecting things from our JavaScript and
we've just been kind of you know adding
styles and changing text but I want to
add some interactivity which is
something we haven't done yet so in the
next video we're gonna get into using
events both click events keyboard events
and then I think we'll do one more video
after that and we'll turn this into an
actual application where we can add
items and we'll add them to the Dom to
the lists right here and then we'll add
a delete button we'll be able to clear
them out so we'll create a little
application at the end I didn't really
plan on doing that but I think that
that's a good idea
you guys can let me know what you think
all right so thanks for watching and I
will see you in the next part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
