ago I created an intro to electron video
and a lot of you guys liked it and I've
gotten a lot of requests since then to
do more with electron which is a
technology to create desktop
applications with JavaScript so what
we're gonna do in this video is we're
gonna we're gonna go a little bit
further than we did in that intro video
and create a shopping list desktop
application which is cross-platform and
I'm gonna show you how you can build it
out to an actual desktop app as well
okay whether you're on Windows Mac or
Linux alright now we're not gonna have
it saved to any kind of database or
anything like that it's just going to be
in the actual application itself so when
you close the application the items will
go away but we may create another video
later on where we can use like some kind
of local storage or a flat file or maybe
some kind of database but we're gonna
learn quite a bit in this video how to
create menu items how to create keyboard
shortcuts for your application how to
publish it how to how to manage more
than one window so there's gonna be
quite a bit in this video okay and I'm
gonna try to stick it all in one video
so it should be about an hour or so so
let's take a quick look at the
application so we're going to be using
something called electron packager which
is gonna package it for either Windows
or Mac or Linux and once you do that
once you've run the package command
you'll get this release builds folder
and this will be the actual application
you can see this there's an exe file
here shopping list exe and we haven't
even have a custom icon I'm gonna show
you how to do that as well so if we open
this up that's gonna open up the desktop
application notice it has a menu here
now we just have a file it's pretty
simple we just have file we have add
item clear items and quit and then we
have the developer tools now we're gonna
make it so that if you put it in
production mode before publishing it the
developer tools won't show because if
you're gonna you know use this as an
actual desktop application you
probably don't want people toggling dev
tools and stuff so I'll show you how to
do that but basically we can click add
item it'll open up a new window and we
can enter something in here we'll say
milk and that'll get added to the list
and by the way you've probably noticed
we're using materialized for our for our
UI framework let's add something else
will stay bread and then to remove them
we can double click that will remove
them or we can go and we can clear out
all the items we're also gonna add
keyboard shortcuts so you can see ctrl Q
will quit
we have ctrl R to reload and ctrl I to
toggle the dev tools alright so I'll go
ahead and quit so very simple
application but like I said you guys are
gonna learn a lot when it comes to
creating the menu and all that stuff so
hopefully you enjoy it and let's get
started so if you guys really enjoy my
content you feel like you really get
something out of it consider becoming a
patron to push me to keep bringing you
high-quality educational videos showing
your support with even $1.00 means the
world we have different perks and tiers
including a $2 tier that'll give you
every udemy course that I release
absolutely free to learn more check out
patreon.com/crashcourse
and i'm gonna go ahead and open it up in
visual studio code and then i'm also
going to open up open get bash up in
that folder okay now obviously if you're
using mac or linux you just use your
terminal if you're using windows I would
suggest using something like git bash
but of course you can use your regular
command line if you want now I'm not
using the integrated terminal here
because I want to have the I want to
have all this room so you guys can see
all the code since we're not using a
browser I don't need to split the screen
so I'm just going to keep the command
line over here alright so first thing
we're gonna do is run NPM in it because
we need to create our package JSON file
alright so it'll make this a little
bigger so let's see package name
projects oh I'm in the wrong folder hold
on guys let me just see
into shopping lists alright so I'm going
to run NPM and knit and let's go through
this version that's good description
will say shopping list shopping list
desktop app entry point I'm going to use
main j/s for my entry point author put
my name but of course you can put your
own license I'm going to say MIT alright
that looks good so now we have our
package dot JSON file over here now
we're gonna install electron let's clear
this up so to do that we're gonna say
npm install - - save electron and that's
gonna save it as a dependency in our
package JSON file alright and then the
last thing I want to do in this file is
I want to create a start script so I'm
gonna replace this test we don't need
that and then replace it would start and
then we're gonna go ahead and just say
electron dot alright because I just want
to say NPM start instead of electron dot
so we'll go ahead and save that and then
that should be it for now so let's close
that up and let's create our main dot JS
file which is our main file so in here
we're gonna bring in a couple things of
course electrons so let's say Const
electron and we'll set that to require
electron
all right we also want to bring in a
couple core modules I'm going to bring
in the URL module which is just a core
nodejs module and then also the path
module okay so next thing we want to do
is we want to grab some stuff from
electrons so we're gonna go Const and
we're going to use a little bit of
destructuring so we need some curly
braces and we're gonna get the app
object and we're gonna get the browser
browser window object okay I'm going to
pull that out of electron alright next
thing we're going to do is create a
variable to represent our main window
basically we're gonna have two windows
our main window which is with the one
that's gonna list all the items and in
the add window which will be the little
one where we actually enter the item so
let's work on the main window first now
in electron what we have to do first is
just listen I can't take today so listen
for the app to be ready and we can do
that by saying app dot on and then we're
gonna pass in here ready alright so once
the app is ready its gonna run a
function and this is where we want to
create our window so we're going to say
create new window alright and it's gonna
say main window that variable we just
created we're gonna set to new browser
window and then we're going to just pass
in an empty object here because there's
no there's no configuration options that
we need right now for this alright so
next thing we want to do is load the
HTML file into the window okay we don't
have our HTML file yet so let's create
that so I'm gonna say new file and we'll
call this main window dot HTML all right
so we're just going to put some basic
HTML tags I'm using Emmet so I just did
exclamation tab and I'm just going to
get rid of all the metadata here we
don't need that
we'll just we'll keep the title and in
here we'll say shopping list okay and in
the body I'm not gonna I'm not gonna
deal with material eyes and the styling
until the end okay we want to get all
the functionality first so for now in
the body I'm just gonna put an h1 and
we're just gonna say shopping list and
we'll save excuse me I'm losing my voice
so that's all we'll do right now for
that for the HTML so let's go back to
main je s and we're going to take that
main window that main window object and
we're gonna call dot load URL and inside
here we're gonna use the URL module and
we're gonna call dot format okay and
then in here we passed in some curly
braces and this takes in a couple things
so it's gonna take in path name so for
path name basically we want to say the
current directory slash
main window dot HTML so we can just use
the path module and call join okay so
first we're gonna pass in double
underscore dur name which is the current
directory and then we want main window
dot HTML okay I'm going to put a comma
here and the next option is going to be
the protocol which is going to be file
colon and then we have one last option
which is gonna be slashes and that's
going to be set to true now if this if
this piece of code right here confuses
you basically what it's doing is it's
just passing in file like this slashes
and then whatever the the current
directory so that comes from der name
slash and then main window dot HTML it's
basically passing that path into load
URL okay it's just a fancy way of doing
it so next thing we want to do is
actually now we can try it out so let's
save it and let's go over here and let's
say npm start
and there we go there's our window
shopping list now since we haven't
created any of our own menu items or
anything that we have the default menu
which just says file exit and as these
edit options view which has the we can
toggle the developer tools and some
other stuff here reload the application
window help so just just the default
menu all right so we can go ahead and
close out and notice that once we close
this will actually stop as well all
right so now that we have our main
window at least coming up and we're able
to run electron now let's work on the
actual menu because we want to replace
that with our own so when we create a
menu we create what's called a menu
template so we're gonna go down here
we're gonna say create menu template and
we're gonna create a variable called
well I'm gonna call it main menu
template but you can call it whatever
you'd like and it's basically just an
array okay when you create a menu in
electron it's just an array of objects
so the first object is gonna be the file
okay so that's gonna take in a label and
we're gonna set that to file all right
now that's all I'm gonna do for now for
the template I just want to test it out
so we're gonna go back up here I want to
make sure you're still in this function
right here this app ready function
alright and then we want to build the
menu from the template alright so we'll
say build menu from template and we do
that by creating a variable I'm gonna
call it main menu and I'm gonna set it
equal to menu now right now it doesn't
know what this is this menu this comes
from electron so we actually have to
bring in and up here so we're gonna put
a comma and then just say menu and then
that menu object has a method called
build from template okay so then we just
want to pass in here whatever our menu
template in this case it's this main
menu template so I'm just gonna pass
that in there alright so next thing we
need to do is just insert the menu and
we can do that by taking that menu
object and calling set application menu
and then we're just gonna pass in main
menu just like that alright so let's go
ahead and save this and let's try
running it with NPM install NPM start
and now there it is there's our menu
just has the file as nothing else but
that's all we have in our template okay
and you'll see that it just over writes
the entire sample or whatever you want
to call it boilerplate menu that's there
by default all right so let's close that
up and then we're gonna go down and
we're gonna add some other stuff to our
menu alright so for the file that's
gonna have a sub menu and we're gonna
have three things we're gonna have add
item clear items and quit so let's go
ahead and put a comma right here and
we're gonna put in sub menu okay and
that sub menu is also gonna be an array
of objects okay so we're gonna have a
label here and this is gonna be for add
item okay let's see yeah well just do
that we'll just add did the the actual
labels and stuff and then we'll add the
functionality after so let's say add
item let's do another one
we'll say label clear items and then
we'll put another one and this one will
be this one will be quit all right now
quit is very simple so we're just gonna
add that now so we're gonna put a comma
and then click OK when you want to add a
click event to any of these you just do
click and then some curly braces and all
we're gonna do here is say app quit
because that that just cuts the whole
application ok quits out of the
application so we can do that now so
let's save it and give it a shot
so file now you can see we have our
three items and if I go to quit it shuts
it down now I also want to have a hotkey
for quit I want to be able to do ctrl Q
so what we can do is we can add an
accelerator so if we go right here and
we say accelerator and basically we're
I'm just going to use a ternary operator
here because we need to test to see what
platform are on we need to see if we're
on a Mac or something else because if
we're on a Mac we need to use command
and if we're on Linux or Windows we need
to use control so what we can do is we
can say process dot platform equals
Darwin now Darwin is is going to be the
value for this if you're on a Mac and
let me just show you real quick if I go
ahead and clear this out and I just say
node that brings us into the into the
JavaScript v8 engine and we can look at
things like process which just has a
bunch of stuff and platform is one of
them so if we say process dot platform
you'll see that I'm on win32 if you're
on a Mac you're gonna see Darwin so this
is what we're testing right here and you
have access to all of this stuff from
within your application so let's get out
of that and what we're gonna do is say
if we're on a Mac then we're going to
use command command + upper case Q else
then we're going to use ctrl + upper
case Q alright we just need a comma
right here alright so this is a ternary
operator basically it's like an if
statement we're saying if this is true
then this else this represents else than
this okay where else because we're not
on a Mac so let's save it let's try it
out say NPM start
and let's do control Q and it closes it
up good so that's how you can add
shortcuts alright so now what I want to
do is work on the add item okay so when
we click add item what do we want to
happen we want another window to open so
let's go to this add item right here
let's put a comma and we'll say when we
click this add item we want to call a
function called create add window okay
so we're just going to call that
function now this function doesn't exist
we have to create it so let's go up here
and we're going to go under the app on
ready function which ends right here so
you want to put it right here we're
going to say it's a handle add window or
handle create add window okay so we'll
say function create add window and then
basically we're just going to do the
same thing we did here when we take we
create a new window our new browser
window and then we load the URL so let's
add another variable right here we'll
say let's add window this time and then
what I'm gonna do is just copy all of
this and then I'm gonna paste that right
in the create add window and then we're
gonna change main window to add window
in both of these spots
okay now this add window new browser
window this is actually going to take in
some options I want to set the width of
the window to 200 and I want to set the
height to 300 and then I'm also going to
set the title to say add shopping list
item all right and then down here we're
not actually opening main window this
time we're gonna open a file called add
window dot HTML alright and then this
stuff is all the same the protocol that
slashes all right so that looks good
so now what we want to do is save this
and create our the other HTML file which
is going to be called add window dot
HTML alright so in here let's put some
basic tags I'm gonna get rid of the meta
stuff and for the title we'll just say
add shopping list item and in the body
here we're gonna put in a form okay we
don't need an action and inside the form
let's put a div and then inside the div
we'll have a label
alright the label doesn't need a four
it's fine
we'll say enter item sorry about that
jetski noise guys let's see we'll have
an input here and let's see it's going
to be a text we're gonna give it an ID
of item and let's also make it auto
focus so that as soon as the window
loads that act that input will be auto
focused okay and then under the div
we're gonna put a button okay let's give
this button a type of submit and we'll
just say add item all right so let's
save it and now let's give it a shot so
we'll go ahead and I'm gonna clear this
out we'll say
NPM start so we'll say file add item
okay that doesn't look right I think I
have the height and width backwards
let's close that up let's say yeah I do
so wit should be 300 height should be
200
there we go all right so obviously it's
not gonna do anything yet we haven't
hooked that up but it does open the
window now one thing I want to mention
is that if I go when I click the X for
the the main window this one will stay
open and we don't want that that doesn't
make any sense what I want to happen is
when we click the X for the main window
we want the entire application to close
ok so to do that is actually pretty easy
we're just going to go to up here where
we have the app dot on ready and we're
going to go under the load URL which is
right here and let's say quit quit app
when closed
so we'll say main window dot on closed
ok when the main one windows closed
we're going to call function and we're
gonna say app dot quit all right so now
if we go when we try if we open up our
small window here and I go when I close
the big window it just closes the entire
application which is what we want and
then one last thing I want to do to kind
of optimize this is when we close the ad
window then we want to we basically want
to set that ad window variable to null
because what will happen is it'll keep
taking up that memory space so this is
actually it relates to garbage
collection so say garbage collection
handle and what we can do to fix this is
we can say add window dot on so add
window dot on close or on our function
and then we're just gonna set the ad
window - no okay so that'll just
optimize it a little bit for us all
right now there's a couple other things
that we need to be aware of now if
you're on Windows like me you're
probably not seeing a problem but I'm
just gonna run this if you're on a Mac
you're probably not seeing file right
here you're probably seeing electron
because by default it's gonna show
electron not file and basically the way
that we can fix that on a Mac is by
adding an extra object up here like that
just an empty object so that file is
actually the second menu item now if we
keep it like that and we run it on
Windows now we're going to have an issue
because we have this little space here
and we don't want that so what we're
gonna do is we're gonna put a we're
gonna first of all just get rid of this
and we're gonna put an if statement down
here we're gonna check to see if we're
on a Mac if we aren't a Mac then we're
gonna push on an empty object up there
just like I just showed you so to do
that it's put a comment here we'll say
if Mac had empty object - menu so we'll
say if remember we can access it with
process process dot platform if it
equals Darwin then we want to take the
main menu template and we just want to
say dot unshifted pass in an empty
object so if you don't know what
unshifted it's an array method and it
just adds on to the beginning of the
array okay just like push would add on
to the end so it's just adding it to the
beginning just like I just showed you
except it's doing it down here okay and
it's doing it only if it's on a Mac so
that takes care of that
now for the rid of that for the
development tools menu item I'm not
going to just directly stick it in here
because I only wanted to show if we're
in productive or not in production
so we're gonna go down here and we're
going to say ad developer tools item if
not in production and we can do that by
saying if will say if process dot e NV
dot node underscore and V is not equal
not equal to production okay so if it's
not equal to production then we're going
to take our main menu template and we're
going to push on to it okay we're going
to push on another object okay so this
object is going to have a label remember
an object is just a menu item is just an
object okay so the label will be
developer tools and it's gonna have a
submenu which will be an array and let's
see inside the submenu we want our dev
tools which is you know that the same
dev tools that Chrome has so let's say
label label will say toggle dev tools
alright and then we'll have our click
now the this time we're going to have to
pass in here item and focused window now
the reason for this is because we want
the dev tools to show up on for instance
if we're if we're focused on the little
window the add item window we want the
dev tools to pop up on that one if we're
on the big main window we wanted to show
up on that one so we need to pass this
in and then we just need to call focused
window dot
toggle dev tools okay and that'll
actually toggle the dev tools for us all
right now I also want to add a shortcut
for this so I'm going to copy this
accelerator right here this line and
we're gonna put that right here and
let's see we want the the hotkey to be
can command I on a Mac and control I on
Windows or Linux alright so I also want
to have a reload item so let's go let's
see so we got our dev tools and let's so
in this submenu
I want to go under I want to go right
here and put a comma and then put
another object and then all we have to
do to get the reload option is say roll
reload like that okay and we'll save it
and let's try it out okay so there's our
dev tools let's say toggle dev tools and
there we go and we can also reload the
page and let's do control I that also
toggles the dev tools good so that's all
set close that up so now I think we're
ready to start the functionality of
actually adding an item to the list so
we're gonna start off with the add
window HTML that's where we're going to
be working for a little bit basically
we're gonna use some vanilla JavaScript
to catch the item okay when someone puts
in puts in some text we want to catch
that item and we're going to be using
something called IPC renderer which is
going to be used to basically send an
event with a payload from this file to
our main j/s all right we want to send
the item here and then we want to take
that item and send it to the main window
so that we can list it in the main
window alright so what we're going to do
is create some script tags down here
all right and we're gonna bring in
electron here so say Const electron
equals require electron and then we want
to pull out that IPC renderer object so
I'm gonna say Const some curly braces
don't forget the curly braces or it
won't work renderer okay make sure you
put render or not just render and we're
going to set that to electron okay and
now what we're going to do is we're
going to catch that item so we're going
to use a little bit of vanilla
JavaScript we're actually going to be
using quite a bit from what I went over
in the Dom crash course which was the
last the last series I did so we're
gonna use document dot query selector
and we want to select the form actually
you know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna put
this in a variable so let's say Const
form and then we're gonna take that form
and we're going to put it we're gonna
add an event listener and we want to
listen for a submit event alright so
once there's a submit then we're gonna
call a function called submit form okay
so let's create that function look
forgot to say submit form
and that's gonna get passed in an event
parameter now when we use a submit
function or when we whenever we submit a
form it's gonna automatically just try
to submit to a file as it would normally
so we need to stop that from happening
so we need to take that event parameter
our event object and call prevent
default like that all right and just to
test it out let's just say console dot
log will just log one two three all
right so let's go ahead and run our
application and let's go to add item
we'll go ahead and toggle the developer
tools and we'll click add item and we
get one two three all right so we know
that that's working now we want to grab
whatever is typed in the item ok
whatever is put in that input so what
we'll do is create a variable called
item set it to document dot query
selector okay and it has an ID of item
so we're gonna grab that and we want the
value so we need to do dot value all
right and if you don't understand this
stuff I would HIGHLY highly suggest
watching the Dom crash course that I
just did because we go over all this
stuff all right now this IPC render this
is what we're going to use to basically
send the item to main j/s alright so
we're gonna say IPC renderer dot send
and then we're gonna give this an ID
okay so we'll say add well actually
we'll do item :
add and then we're gonna send the
payload of the item okay so this works
kind of like socket IO if you have any
experience with that when you're sending
it from the client to the server you're
just kind of giving it a name and then
you're sending the data along with it
and then we're gonna catch it on the
main j/s side so let's go ahead and save
this and then we'll go to main J s and
now to catch this we need to bring in
something called IPC main so up here
where we're doing our destructuring
we're going to
in IPC mein okay and let's see where
we're gonna put this let's go under the
create ad window so right here right
above the menu template and we'll say
catch catch item ad alright so we'll say
IPC main dot on and then we want
whatever we gave that name which is item
ad alright so on that when that happens
then we want to call a function and this
function gets passed in an event and an
event and the item all right or whatever
we sent and then what we want to do is
send it to the main window okay it's
coming from the ad window but now we
want to send it to the main window
so we'll say main window and we can say
dot web contents dot send okay and then
we're gonna again name this we're gonna
say item add and we're gonna send the
item all right and then we just want to
close the ad window so ad window dot
close like that
alright and just a test just to make
sure that it's coming from the ad window
to the right here let's go ahead and
we'll do a console dot log and log the
item all right so now we'll clear this
out and whoops stop it first
okay so we'll run it and PM start now if
it gets sent correctly then when I type
when I put something in here and add it
it should log over here so we'll put
something in and add and there it is
alright good so it's getting logged here
and then we're sending it to the main
window so then we have to catch it in
the main window so let's go over there
and we're gonna go ahead and add our
script tags
here as well okay and we're going to
bring an electron okay and again we're
going to bring an IPC render up that
needs to be in curly braces all right
now I'm also going to add a ul up here
because what we're doing is we're taking
the items and we're going to put them
into a list item in this UL okay but
we're doing it dynamically through
JavaScript so let's create a variable
for that ul so we'll set it to document
dot query selector and we want to select
the UL all right so now what we want to
do is we want to catch that we want to
catch this right here okay main window
send item ad and we're sending the item
so we want to catch that using IPC
render so let's say IPC renderer dot on
item ad and then we have a function and
that function is going to take in E and
the item okay so we're now getting the
item being sent from from the main j/s
alright so what do we want to do with
this item we want to add it as an Li
into this ul so we're gonna have to do a
little Dom manipulation here so we're
going to create a variable called Li and
I'm going to set it to document dot
create element and we want to create a
list item
all right now this is just a blank list
item we want to add a text node to it
with the item that's being sent so let's
say Const item text and we'll set it to
document dot create text node and the
text we want inside the ally is going to
be the item ok the item that's being
sent then what we want to do is we want
to append the text the item text to that
li so we'll say Li dot append child and
we want to append the item text all
right so hopefully you understand that
we're creating the Li and then we're put
we're creating the text node and then
we're adding the text node to the Li and
then the next thing we want to do is add
the Li to the UL so ul dot append child
Li all right hopefully that makes sense
and like I said if you don't get this go
ahead and watch that Dom crash course so
let's actually test this out now so
we'll say add item we'll put some in
here click and there we go so we can now
add items to our shopping list awesome
so let's see what do we want to do next
let's do let's do the clear items so
clear items if we go to main J s that's
actually a menu item right so we need to
add a click for that and then what we're
gonna do is we're going to send we're
gonna take the main window and we're
gonna say dot web contents dot send and
we're gonna send an event called item
clear okay now we don't have to send
anything with it like we don't have to
say like that because we're just
clearing it we're not actually sending
data so we're just letting it know we
want to clear it so let's save that
let's go back to main window and let's
catch
that so just like we did I PC render on
item add we want to do item clear so I'm
gonna copy that
let's put some comments in here say
catch add item I'm sure we'll just say
add item and then here we'll say Claire
items
alright so instead of item add we're
going to do item clear and there was
nothing sent so we don't need these and
we're gonna get rid of everything in
here and then all we want to do is clear
that ul so we can just say you l dot
innerhtml equals nothing and that's it
so let's save let's go ahead and give it
a shot
so add item
ok so we'll say file clear items and now
everything's cleared so that's all set
now I want to take care of the
individual deletes I want to be able to
double click and have them delete so for
that we don't have to send anything back
and forth we can do that strictly with
vanilla JavaScript so let's go down here
and let's say remove items or remove
item so we're going to take that UL and
we're going to add an event listener
okay we're gonna listen for a double
click so dbl click and then we're going
to run a function called remove item
alright we're going to create that right
here function remove item and all we
have to do here is say we're gonna pass
in the event and we're gonna say e dot
target dot remove okay so basically what
this is doing is it's saying anything
any li inside the UL that we click we're
going to just remove from the Dom okay
I'll remove from our application so
let's save let's go back and we can
actually just reload
we'll add an item double-click and it
goes away
alright so our core functionality is now
done ok it just looks like crap so now
we're gonna start to style this so let's
go ahead and open up let's go to
materialise CSS and we're gonna grab
gonna go to getting started and grab the
CDN for the the CSS copy it and we're
gonna put this in the head of both
windows so main window and add window
alright and if we go when we reload we
should see a difference right away ok so
now we're gonna change some of the
markup add some classes and so on so
let's go to our main window first and
I'm going to replace this h1 here so
instead of just an h1 we're gonna have a
nav so let's say nav and let's see
inside here we're gonna have a div and
it's gonna have a class of nav wrapper
and don't worry this isn't going to be
long so nav wrapper and then we're just
gonna have an a tag with the class of
brand - logo and also a class of center
just like that no link and then here
we'll just say shopping list
alright let's save it let's go to our
app and reload and there we go
alright so let's the next thing I want
to do is style the UL and the Li is
because if we add an item here and
you'll see look the form has already
changed too but we want this to look
like a collection so a collection right
here so we wanted to look like this so
the UL needs a class of collection and
the Allies need a class of collection
item in order to look like this
so what I could do is I could just go to
the UL right here and I could say class
equals collection but if I do that and
if I reload you'll see there's this line
now because it's showing the collection
even even though there's no items in it
so it's just like this blank this line
and I don't want that so what I want to
do is I don't want this class applied
until there's actually an item added so
I'm going to remove it here and then
we're going to go down to where it's
actually added which is in here add item
and we're gonna we're gonna dynamically
add the class by just saying ul dot
class name equals collection all right
so now if we reload that lines gone but
if I add an item it's still it had now
has that collection class now the list
items also have to have that what was it
collection item they have to have that
class that's why this looks funny so
what we're gonna do is go right under
where we created the Li and say Li dot
class name equals collection item okay
so that'll add that class so now if we
reload okay so now it looks good all
right so notice that when we remove
everything that line is still there
because that that collection class is
still on that UL so what we're gonna do
is clear that out so if we go down to
remove item we're gonna basically say if
there's if there's no L eyes left then
clear out that collection class name so
that we don't have this line here so
we're going to say if and we can say u l
dot children okay because the Allies are
the U ELLs children right so we're going
to say ul children dot length
if it's equal to zero so if there's no
allies then set the UL class name to
nothing and then we want to do the same
thing when we clear the items this class
name nothing so right here we'll put
that in as well alright and this may not
be a big deal to you to have this line
here I just I just don't like it so now
if we go ahead and we add stuff and we
clear no line if we add and we double
click and remove no line alright so we
are getting there next thing I want to
do is the form okay so this right here I
want to add a container around it so
it's not right up against the edge and
then I want to style the button so let's
go to add window dot HTML we're going to
wrap the form in a div with a class of
container
okay so that'll push it into the middle
more and then for the button let's see
for the button we're gonna add a class
of BTN let's also add a waves effect
class and let's add waves - light look
sorry about that guys alright so let's
take a look now we'll save we'll reload
and let's go to add item and now that
looks pretty good so we'll say milk good
so I think our application is pretty
much done last thing I want to do before
we package it up is change the
environment to production so that we
don't have the dev tools option and to
do that I mean there's a lot of
different ways you can set to set that
I'm just going to put a line just one
line at the top here setting it so we'll
go right here and let's see we're just
gonna say it's a set environment process
dot e NV dot node underscore a and V and
we'll set it equal to production okay
and if that's set to production and we
run our application
there's no dev tools okay it's just the
file and that's what we want when we
actually publish it so now let's get
into publishing it so to do this just
pull this up there is another module we
have to install called
electron packager and this is a really
good tutorial this is Christian Engvall
dot SC slash electron packager tutorial
I'll put the link in the description but
it basically tells us we have to install
electron package R and then it gives us
each command to publish for each
platform this is for Mac this is for
Windows this is for Linux but
down here he actually puts it all into
scripts for us and in the NPM file so if
we just say npm run package Mac it'll
package for a Mac and so on so that's
what we're gonna do so let's first
install this so we're going to go over
here will clear this out and we'll say
NPM install - - save - dev electron -
packager and that'll get added to the
package JSON file as a dev dependency
alright and then what we're going to do
is we're going to go back to that blog
post and I'm just going to copy inside
the scripts object I'm going to grab all
three of these and copy and we're gonna
put this right under our start script so
we'll put a comma and then we'll paste
those in alright and then I'm gonna
change right here under package when it
says product name electron tutorial app
I'm going to change this to shopping
list
okay now this also points to some icons
or icon locations so we have assets
slash icon slash win we also have a Mac
folder and then a PNG folder so what I'm
gonna do here is I'm gonna change the
name of the PNG to icon dot PNG and I
think that should be all set for for
this file so let's save it and then
we're gonna create these icon fault
folders and I'm gonna add an icon now
the icon that I used I'm actually gonna
put a link in the description shit did I
close it
I keep closing it oh no it's right here
so it's this icon archive it's a free
icon but basically there's the ice ICO
version the icns version and the PNG
version so we want all of these so let's
go ahead and open up our folder for our
and we're gonna create a folder called
assets okay and inside assets we're
gonna have a folder called icons is it
icons let me check yeah
assets icons and then we want a separate
folder for when mac and PNG inside here
so let's say new folder when new folder
mac new folder PNG alright and then what
we'll do is we're going to download the
ICO I'm gonna save it as icon dot ICO
and I'm gonna put it inside assets icons
win ok the wind folder gets the ICO ok
then I'm going to download the icns and
I'm going to rename it to icon dot I see
what is it I see NS and we're gonna save
that one to the Mac folder okay and then
we'll download the PNG so I'll just say
save image and we'll save it as icon dot
PNG and we're gonna save that one to the
PNG folder obviously alright now we have
our icons if you want to use a different
icon that's absolutely fine
but I think everything should be all set
now so I think we should go on we could
we should try to build now since I'm on
Windows I'm gonna be running npm run
package win so let's go over here and
let's say npm run package - win
okay it's gonna go through some crap
okay so now what it did is it created a
folder called release build so let's go
navigate to that so release builds and I
have this shopping list win32 we have a
folder with a bunch of dll's but down
here you'll see there's a shopping list
Exe file with our icon we can open that
up and that's our application okay we're
not running npm start we're not running
any anything at all it this is a pure
desktop application just like if you
were to open atom or vs code okay so
let's try and add an item make sure
everything works alright so we can add
stuff let's double click we can remove
let's clear items that works good so
everything works I'm going to ctrl Q and
it works now if I were to do ctrl I it's
not going to open the dev tools because
remember that's only available if we're
in the for not in production mode and we
just published this in production mode
okay because of that one line that we
have right here if you change this to
development then you'll be able to use
the dev tools
alright so sorry I'm losing my voice
guys if you can notice but I think
that's it so hopefully you enjoyed this
tutorial
hopefully it shed some light on how
electron works how you can create menu
items and in multiple windows and I
encourage you guys to try and build your
own desktop applications alright so
thanks for watching and I will see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
