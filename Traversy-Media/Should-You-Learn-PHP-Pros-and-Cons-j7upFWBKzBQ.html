ready to create a PHP crash course on
YouTube but before I do that I just
wanted to put a video out there and talk
a little bit about the language and look
at some of the pros and cons to help you
decide if you should actually spend the
time to learn it or not so I do have a
video called web development in 2017 a
practical guide and it's my most
commented on video it has the most likes
on my channel but it also has the most
dislikes and that's because many web
developers are strongly opinionated when
it comes to this stuff so some web
developers really despise PHP and that's
fine everyone is different everyone is
entitled to their opinion I happen to
really like PHP for for small and medium
sized applications and websites as long
as the code is written correctly now
with that said what I want to do in this
video is not try and sway those people
into liking or using PHP but just to
take a look at the facts of what PHP is
and what it isn't and then you can make
that decision on your own and I'm not
here to say PHP is the best server-side
language out there because I don't think
that in fact I think it's stupid and
closed-minded to say anything is the
best or the worst everyone's different
and everyone has their own abilities and
their own opinions and they adapt a
certain syntax in a different way that's
why I can't stand when someone says this
is the best and that's the worst because
I said so that pisses me off it
just makes you look arrogant ignorant
but anyways I'm not going to go off into
a negative rant so most likely you're
here because you're probably wondering
what server-side language you should
learn first or second or third now if
you were to ask my opinion I would
narrow it down to either PHP nodejs or
Python
all right I'm actually very new to
Python I've been working with Django
recently and I do really like it if you
ask me a few months ago I would have
said rails instead of Python but rails
has really seen two level off recently
and I absolutely love nodejs
so node may be an attractive choice
because chances are you already know
some JavaScript so the logical choice
would be to go with node but I would
actually look
from a different angle and look at it as
choosing something that's not JavaScript
gives you a little bit of experience
with a secondary language so you can
kind of look at that look at what's
similar and what's different between the
two and then you can start to look at
other languages and compare those and
just start to get a better idea of how
programming works in general
so I don't really have a clear
recommendation aside from looking at
those three no PHP and Python I don't
know enough about most of these other
languages aside from just the basics
I wouldn't recommend Java or C++ or
anything like that for your first
language not because they're not good
they're extremely powerful but because
they're just too difficult and too
strict for a beginner alright now what I
actually did was just like I said I
learned HTML CSS and basic JavaScript
and then went to PHP I worked with that
for a long time I learned a bunch of
frameworks and then I went back to
JavaScript and learned nodejs
Express and a bunch of client-side
frameworks like angular and react then
rails and now Python so that's what I
did and I don't regret any of those
decisions I've done pretty well with
those and I can pick up languages very
quickly now all right so that those are
pretty much your choices so let's take a
look at some of the advantages of PHP so
I think one of the biggest reasons to
learn PHP is because it's absolutely
everywhere love it or hate it around 35
percent or so of the web sites on the
Internet use PHP in one form or another
it may even be higher than that I'm not
really sure WordPress is actually a big
chunk of that which is the most popular
content management system or blog
platform by far now with that said PHP
is a great language to learn if you're
looking for a job I'm not saying it's
the best but it is up there there's a
ton of web design and development firms
out there that use WordPress or even
Joomla or Drupal and these are the most
popular content management systems and
web design companies love these because
it enables their clients to update their
own content instead of bugging them to
do it
now of course you could create your own
content management system in any
language but you can roll out a
wordpress site in a week especially if
you're using pre-made plugins and
templates so PHP is also incredibly easy
to learn when you compare it to language
like Java or C++ this is a big advantage
but it can also be a disadvantage and
I'll tell you why in a little bit so
support is another big advantage PHP has
a huge community and if you get stuck
there's a really good chance you can
find a fix for your exact problem most
developers know PHP even if they don't
use it or even if they hate it a lot of
them still know it so support is a big
plus PHP also gives you a ton of freedom
and this is another example of something
that's both good and bad it's not a
typed language you don't have to define
your data types or anything like that
there's a million different ways to
create the same functionality so
integration is another good one you can
use PHP with just about any database
MySQL Postgres know what skew all
databases like MongoDB there's an
adapter for pretty much excuse me any
type of database or data store that you
want to use there's also a ton of
frameworks available for PHP and this
allows people that understand PHP but
our masters create pretty significant
applications frameworks do a lot of the
hard stuff for us laravel is very
popular they also have Symphony
CodeIgniter
there's a huge list of frameworks for
PHP you can also use multiple paradigms
this ties into the freedom aspect you
can use procedural or functional
programming with PHP as well as hard
core object-oriented code using classes
most people start with procedural
because it's much easier and then you
can gradually start to learn the
object-oriented stuff alright and PHP
can also be directly embedded into HTML
and that's also a huge plus and then
it's also pre-configured on most hosting
environments especially shared hosting
if you go to Hostgator or DreamHost or
any of those companies they usually have
pH
pre-installed on their servers and
there's even one-click installation for
things like wordpress and even ecommerce
platforms like Magento and so on and
there's a lot of good free PHP scripts
out there alright so those are the
reasons why you should learn PHP now
let's take a look at some disadvantages
so I said earlier that PHP was really
easy to learn and it offers you a lot of
freedom that can be a good advantage as
far as you being able to learn a
language but it can also be a huge
disadvantage too much freedom can mean a
poor language design PHP adapts its
syntax from many different other
languages Perl C C++ Java and so on so
it could be extremely inconsistent and
flaky it doesn't really have in some
sense it doesn't really have its own
identity okay so that leads us to the
next one which is that it's too easy to
write bad code there's a lot of bad
scripts out there written in PHP like I
said there's a million ways to write the
same functionality and this can make
things very difficult and just annoying
when you're working with someone else's
code I've had times where I just can't
figure out what the hell they were
thinking when they wrote it but PHP is
so flexible that it still works you know
if you visit the front-end of the
website of the app it still works it's
just a very poor and difficult design
and PHP is also weakly typed while that
makes things easier this can also lead
to bugs and issues okay so the next one
is scalability PHP isn't completely
suitable for really big applications
that use big data you can have problems
with scaling it's fine for small to
medium sized applications and websites
but when we start getting into apps with
millions of users and thousands of pages
it starts to get a little difficult to
manage because it's not highly modular I
think a big part of that is to because
it was designed to basically create
dynamic websites not so much high tech
applications
if you're building a really large
application with big data you're
probably better off going with something
like the mean stack all right now as far
as security every language has its flaws
PHP is completely open-source and it's
not compiled and this gives you gives it
some vulnerabilities although a lot of
the insecure PHP programs are due to bad
code not really the language itself all
right so these are pretty much the main
disadvantages I think the biggest that
the reason why is about some developers
really hate PHP is its poor design and
the code can really just be an ugly mess
and it's very inconsistent so I think
that's the main reason all right so the
conclusion is up to you to decide again
I'm not going to suggest PHP for your
first language I'm not going to do that
at all I will suggest PHP node or Python
but I won't go any further than that
without knowing what works for you and
how you code because everyone is
different and it's just stupid for me to
say that this is the language you should
learn because I don't know you but the
bottom line is all languages have good
and bad qualities web link web
technologies desktop programming
languages anything has it has good and
bad PHP is popular and widely used
that's a good enough reason for me to
want to learn it or to have wanted to
learn it but I would suggest that you
learn other languages as well don't
don't just stick with PHP for the rest
of your career all right and then most
of all most important to write good code
or in good coding practices stay
consistent make things very clean and
PHP will work out just fine for you all
right so hopefully you guys enjoyed this
and learned a little bit something from
it and hopefully I praised it enough for
you guys that like PHP and I bashed it
enough for you guys that hate it alright
so thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
