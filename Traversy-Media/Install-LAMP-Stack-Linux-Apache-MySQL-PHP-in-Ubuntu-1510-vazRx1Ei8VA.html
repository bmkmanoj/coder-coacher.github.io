you how to set up your own lamp stack
okay on your bun to server and if you
don't know what lamp is it stands for
Linux Apache MySQL and PHP and it's a
great stack to build PHP applications on
alright so you could use something like
zamp or WAMP server and get all that
stuff installed right on your local
machine but if you want to step it up a
notch and you want to actually create
your own server it's not that hard at
all alright so first thing we're going
to do here is we're going to update ok
we're going to say sudo apt-get update
keep putting your password and we're
just going to update everything alright
once that's done we're going to install
Apache okay so we'll say sudo apt-get
install apache2 ok we're going to say
yes all right so that's all set now just
to check it out I'm going to open up
Firefox ok and we're going to go to
localhost and there we go we have an
apache - default page now we can also
access this anywhere on our network okay
so I'll go to a Windows machine on the
same network open up a browser and I'm
going to go to the IP address of that
machine this will be different in your
case and there it is
alright so it's running over the network
so let's go back into bun 2 and we're
going to continue let's go ahead and
install PHP so we'll say sudo apt-get
install PHP 5 say yes
okay so let's go ahead and restart
Apache and we can do that with sudo sudo
slash etc' slash and knit dot d / Apache
to restart okay now what we'll do is
we'll test PHP out okay so let's do sudo
I'm going to use nano as my text editor
feel free to use whatever you'd like and
we want to go to var /ww slash HTML and
then whatever we want to call this file
let's say test dot PHP
alright and then here all I'm going to
do is say PHP echo it works okay and
then we'll do a control X yes save it
okay
so now let's go to localhost / test dot
PHP and we get it works so we know that
it's parsing PHP so now we want to move
on to MySQL so we're going to say sudo
apt-get install MySQL - server and I
think that's that should do it
okay we'll say yes
all right so now it's asking us for a
root password okay we want to create the
root password okay and then we get to
repeat it now to check this out let's
say I'm going to say MySQL u root P okay
just like that it's going to ask us for
our root password we just created all
right and now we're in MySQL so we could
do something like create database test
dB
okay whoops we gonna end that with a
semicolon say to get out of that okay
there we go okay we could say show
databases I keep forgetting that
semicolon okay so now you can see we
have our test DB right there so MySQL is
working let's get out of that control C
and last thing I want to do is install
PHP myadmin okay so we'll say sudo sudo
apt-get install PHP myadmin
it's going to ask what type of server we
have Apache two is set by default that's
what we want okay
now this configuration right here we're
going to just choose yes and then you
want to input a password for PHP myadmin
and then you want to provide your root
mysql password
all right so that should be all set now
if we try to go to it let's say local
host PHP myadmin we get a not found okay
so we have to actually edit a file all
right so we have to edit the PHP any
file that's located in the Apache 2
folder so let's say sudo nano and we
want to go to etc' slash PHP 5 slash
Apache 2 slash PHP dot ini' all right
now we need to uncomment an extension so
let me just see if I can find it I'm
just doing a page down it probably would
have been easier to use some kind of
text editor G editor something
right here okay so you can see right
here we have this extension equals mysql
dot s oh we just want to remove this
semicolon right here okay and then we
can just control X to save yes all right
so now we want to restart apache so sudo
ET c / in it dot d / Pachi to restart
okay so now let's go back here and
reload and it's still not working
hmm oh you know what I know what what it
is we need to add a line in the Apache
config file all right so let's do sudo
nano ET c / Pachi - slurps Pachi - slash
apache - conf all right and we're going
to go all the way down to the bottom
alright and we're going to sorry about
that I haven't I haven't done this in a
long time include ET c / PHP my admin /
Apache dot conf alright and that yeah
that should do it
so let's uh control X and yes we want to
save and we'll restart Apache and
hopefully it works there we go
awesome alright so use your name is
going to be root and then the password
you chose and there we go okay so we can
easily create a database you can see the
one we did create called test DB and
that's it alright and we should be able
to access this from anywhere on our
network so if we go to tent and wall for
me its 1000 seven nine but it's going to
be whatever IP address your a bun -
installation is on
but I should be able to go to PHP
myadmin alright so now we have a web
server up and running if I go to slash
test dot PHP we get that it works okay
so that's how you can set up a lamp
stack pretty easy it's not as daunting
as it may seem so yeah thanks for
watching if you can subscribe like
that'd be great and I'll see you next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
