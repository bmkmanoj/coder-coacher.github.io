front-to-back video in this video we're
going to be looking at PHP sessions so
sessions are a way to carry information
or data across multiple pages I'm sure
you know by now that if we set a
variable on one page it's not going to
be accessible on the next okay that's
where sessions come in now unlike
cookies session data is not stored on
the user's computer it's stored on the
server
okay we'll also be looking at cookies
later on so let's jump right in here I
have my PHP sandbox folder open here I'm
going to just create a new folder and
let's just call this website 4 and we're
going to have a few pages here I'm going
to create one and call it page 1 dot PHP
all right now you can set session
variables however you want but I'm just
going to put a form here that we can
submit and then we'll save the values to
a session ok so let's just put in some
standard HTML tags and put a form down
here I'm just going to grab it and paste
it in one second all right so we have a
form and as the method of post we've
gone over all this the action I set to
serve our PHP self so it's going to get
submitted to this file we have a name
field and an email field okay so let's
go up here and let's catch this form
submission ok so I'm just going to say
if is set and we want to look at post
submit because I gave the the submit
button a name so we can check for that
and then let's just test it out by just
saying echo one two three all right so
I'm going to go to local host PHP
sandbox slash website for splash page
one dot PHP okay so there's our form if
I submit it it's going to echo out one
two three so what we're going to do is
catch the values and put them into
session variables now in order to work
with
session variables you have to start a
session on every page every page that
you want to use that data you have to do
session start all right so let's
discussion underscore start and that
will start the session alright and then
we're going to just um set a session
variable using the session superglobal
and let's set name and then I'm going to
set it to our post name value alright
and just to make it a little more secure
we'll use HTML entities around that
alright and then we'll do the same thing
for the email so I'll just copy that
let's set that to email all right
so it's taking the post values and
putting them into session variables now
I also want to redirect to a new page
and I don't think we've gone over this
yet but there's a function called header
and that will allow us to redirect from
PHP ok so what we have to do is say
header and then in here we want to say
location colon and then whatever page or
link we want to go to so I'm going to
say page two dot PHP alright so let's
save that and then we're going to go and
create page two
and then I'm just going to put some HTML
tags in here and let's just put actually
we'll go up here first and put the PHP
in okay and then what I'm going to do is
again say session start and then we're
going to set name equal to the session
variable name and same with email okay
and then down here we'll do a little
message so let's just put an H five and
I'll say thank you and then we just want
to echo out the name and then we'll just
say you have so subscribed with the
email and then we'll echo out the email
alright so let's go ahead and save that
and just going to reset this page one
and let's just put something in here
we'll just put my name and for the email
I'm just going to say test at test comm
and let's submit and we get thank you
brad traversée or email or you have
subscribed with email test at test comm
so we carried the variables over to this
page and if we reload this without
making the post request you'll see it's
still there it's stored in the session
so what I'm going to do now is put a
link down here and let's set this to go
to page three dot PHP alright I'll just
say go to page three
okay and then we'll create page three
and in here let's again we'll set a name
variable I'll just grab it from here now
I want to show you what happens if we
don't use session start all right so
let's just put out we'll just put an h1
here and let's just say hello name all
right so let's save that and then if we
reload this we go to page three you see
we get this undefined variable session
okay it's doing that because we didn't
include session start so let's do that
up here and reload and now we get hello
Brad Traverse City okay so make sure
that you always put this at the top a
lot of times you could you put this in a
some kind of configuration file and then
you'll just include that at the top of
each page that you want the sessions now
we can change these anytime we want so
if we go to page two and right here we
say session name and we set that equal
to John Doe and then let's go back to
page two and you can see it says thank
you John Doe and if I go to page three
that that variable has been changed all
right so you can update it at any time
okay and if you want to see what's in
the session array you can simply use a
print our statement so let's go to page
three and then we're just going to let's
do print underscore R and let's take a
look at session
reload and you'll see that it gives us
the array with the values inside now if
you want to unset one of these you can
use session unset so let's go ahead and
create a page for and then in here put
our PHP tag and then we'll do a session
start and if we just want to unset one
value let's say the name then we use
unset just unset and pass in session
name
okay so let's save that and then we're
going to run page four okay no output
but let's go back to page three and now
you'll see that we get undefined index
name the email still there but we just
unset the name okay so if we wanted to
get rid of this error what we could do
is go to page three and right here let's
say is set wrap that we use a ternary
and we'll say session name okay if it's
if this is set then we want to put this
inside of the name variable and then if
not okay if not then I guess we'll just
say guest
alright so reload and now we get hello
guests because there's no session name
now if you want to completely destroy
the session you can do that with session
destroy' so let's go back to page four
comment that out and then let's say
session web session destroy' okay so
we'll go to page four and now if we go
back to page three you can see that we
now have undefined index email because
there's nothing in the session array and
again if we wanted to get rid of that
error we could do the same thing
and for this we just say something like
not subscribed
alright so reload and the air is gone
alright so that's going to do it for
sessions they're pretty easy just you
just need to remember to do this session
start and and do that on every page that
you want to use sessions on all right so
that's going to be it for this video
guys thanks for watching and I'll see
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
