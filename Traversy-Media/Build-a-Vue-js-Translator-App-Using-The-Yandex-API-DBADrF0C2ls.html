cool project for you today we're going
to be building a word translator
application using the view Jas
JavaScript framework so I discovered
this API while I was creating a react
native application in a new mobile dev
series that I have coming out and I
thought it was really cool so I wanted
to create a YouTube project for you guys
using this API all right now you can
implement this with react or angular or
any other framework if you want to do
you know use something else aside from
view I also deployed it on to my server
as you can see with the view CLI tool we
can simply we can build out the entire
thing in production in just one command
all right so this is very simple to use
you'll see we can just type in some text
here I have hello and I have Russian
selected now I only have four languages
here right now but the API it can handle
like pretty much any language I believe
so you can add more if you want so if we
click Submit it'll simply give us that
word in Russian if we want to choose
Spanish okay or French or whatever it
may be so very very simple we're using a
boots watch theme which is a just a
custom customized bootstrap theme all we
do is point to the link and we can get
this this nice styling all right now you
will need to sign up to use this API it
is it's completely free but you do need
to register so you want to go to tech
yen Dexcom slash translate and you have
to create an account you can see I'm
already logged in and then once you do
that you can click on get a free API key
and put some kind of description and
just check the box and submit and you
should get your key okay and then you
can go to this Mikey's page and you can
see I already have a valid key all right
so just get that set up before you move
on all right so let's go ahead and open
up a text editor I'm using Adam but you
can use whatever you'd like and then we
also want to open up a command line or
terminal I'm using windows for this
project and I'm using a tool called
commander which I made a video on it's
really cool it's a nice
replacement force for a PowerShell or
the Windows command line and what we
need to do first is install the view CLI
okay which is the command line interface
and that allows us to generate a boiler
type of oil and plate application so you
want to just stop npm install you need
to have no js' installed so if you don't
have that just go to node.js org and
download and install it alright and then
we want to add the dash G because we're
installing it globally and then view
- CLI and that'll get the command line
interface set up on your machine alright
I can pull up the github page for that
whoops that's not right okay so here it
is and you'll see that we're doing this
right now
and then when we want to create an
application we can do view in it and we
want to choose web pack for our template
and then my project whatever we want to
call the project alright so let's go
ahead and do that we'll say view init
web pack and let's call this word
translator and that will initialize a
new project we have to answer a couple
questions project name that's fine
description let's just say simple
translate with translator application
author that's fine
enter install view router we're not
going to use the router but I'm going to
just install it anyway
yes lint I'm not going to install that
so say no we're not doing any testing so
I don't want to install karma and to end
testing no and now it should be
generated so let's CD into word
translator and from here we need to
install our dependencies by doing NPM
install all right I'm just going to open
the folder up in atom
we want to go to projects where a
translator all right now if you're using
Adam you definitely want to install the
view j/s plugin because if you don't
you're not going to have the proper
highlighting so to do that you just want
to go to settings and just search go
down to install search for view and then
you just want to install this language -
view okay just go ahead and click
install and then you should have
highlighting and all that alright so
let's see what's going on here so now
that's generated and there's only one
other dependency that I want to install
and that's view resource we're going to
use that to make our HTTP requests so
you just want to do NPM install view -
resource and - - save and then we should
be all set to start up our application
alright so now we should be able to do
NPM run dev and that will run our
development server okay it's going to
start it on port 8080 I believe yep and
this is basically just the boilerplate
all right so let's go into our folder
our directory here and we're going to be
working in the source the SRC folder you
can see we have our main dot J's file
which brings in view and all that stuff
we also have our app dot view which is
the main component and then we have a
components folder where we'll put all of
our sub components by default there's
one called hello dot view now if you
haven't watched my view Jas and
60-minutes video I would suggest
watching that before this because I go
over pretty much you know everything
every line of code and this I'm not
going to this is going to be more of a
demo so I'm not going to explain every
single little thing so if you don't know
anything about view Jas I would
definitely suggest watching that video
first all right so let's create our
component files that we're going to need
we're basically going to have two
components one is going to be the
translate form which will have the the
text input and the language select and
then we'll also have a
owning called translate output which
will be the translated text so let's say
new file and we're going to say
translate form dot view and then we'll
create another file called translate
output dot view okay so those are the
two components we'll be using now we're
going to open up our app view which is
basically the the core component the
main app component and we're going to
get rid of these styles here okay and
let's get rid of this logo and also
we're not using the router so I'm going
to get rid of that as well and from now
let's just put an h1 here and we'll say
word translator all right and let's just
save that make sure it's still working
good and then actually will have a 5
underneath I'm not going to add the
styles until later the bootstrap and all
that all the classes and this is just
going to stay powered by view j/s ok and
then under that is where we're going to
have our two components so let's say
translate form and add closing tag ok
now we have to bring this in to be able
to use it we have to import it so we're
going to go right under the script tag
and say import import translate form and
that's going to be from so I'm not going
to use semicolon that's going to be from
dot slash components slash translate
form okay so that'll bring it in now we
also have to add it to our object down
here so right under the name let's put
in components and we're going to set
we're going to set this to an object and
we're going to add translate form
all right so let's save that and then
we'll go to our Translate form actually
what I'll do is copy everything in this
file and paste it in there okay we're
just going to change this ID to
translate form and for now let's just
put some text in here
okay and where you don't need this
import and we're going to change this
I'm sorry not that we're going to change
this right here to translate form okay
we can get rid of this components we
don't need that and get rid of this app
ID and save and we should be able to
output that okay you can see right here
now I'm going to open up my my dev tools
here let's just reload okay so we have
no errors so we're outputting the
component and what I want to do here is
just add in a form
okay so let's actually give this form an
ID and actually no we don't we don't
need an ID for that what we do need is
an event handler so basically when we
submit this form we want to call a
function called form submit so in view
what we need to do is add this V dash on
when we want to define an event handler
and the give the actual event type which
is going to be a submit and then we want
to set that to form submit which will be
a function that we create or method now
in here we're going to put our input so
this will be input type text and we're
going to give this an attribute of V -
model and what that will do is it'll
bind this input to one of our component
properties okay which is going to be Tek
the text to translate property so in
here we want to set this to text to
translate
all right and then we'll just add a
placeholder as well okay I will just say
translate oh no enter a word all right
so there's our text input now we're
going to need a select list for the
language but I'm not going to do that
just yet I want to do that after we can
we actually make it so that we can make
our requests and all that just to kind
of keep things simple all right so what
I'll do now is add the submit button so
I'm going to say input type and it's
going to be submit and see we're going
to just give it a value of submit all
right actually let's give it a value of
translate okay so if we save that we're
getting this error down here because we
haven't created form submit also text to
translate has not been defined if you're
going to use V model and bind to a
property you need to actually add that
property okay so what we'll do is we're
going to go right under name and save
data and this is where we can define our
component data or properties okay and
you have to actually return so it's a
return an object and we're going to add
text to translate okay and by default
that's going to be just nothing so we're
binding this this input to this by
adding the v-model okay if you're
familiar with angular and not view this
is similar to ng model and angular
alright so now we want to create this
form submit function and to do that we
have to go under data and define methods
okay and in methods we're going to have
one called form submit and a function
and a method is pretty much the same
thing in this case all right
now since we're submitting a form we're
going to pass along E and then say e dot
prevent
default because that's going to prevent
it from actually submitting to a webpage
all right and then what we want to do in
here first of all let's just test it out
by doing an alert so we'll say alert
submitted and let's go ahead and reload
this and then just put whatever
translate and we get submitted so we
know that that's calling the correct
method all right now since this input is
bound to this property we should be able
to access that
so let's actually alert that
so if we say alert this dot text to
translate then it should alert with
whatever we type in here okay and it's
doing that now we need to basically take
the text that we put in here in this
component and send it up to the app dot
view component okay so the way that we
can do that is by using emit okay we can
emit a value from this component if we
look in our app dot view file we can
emit something from this into our main
app component because that's where we
want to do the actual HTTP request and
all that we don't want to do that in the
in the form component so what we'll do
is get rid of this alert and we can say
this dot money sign emit and add some
parentheses and then we want to emit
form submit okay and you can you can
call email whatever you want you can
call it whatever you want but I think
that that makes sense so we'll do that
and then we also want to send along the
text to translate which is the input
text so right here we're going to say
this dot text to translate okay so
that'll emit that value so let's save
this and then we're going to go into app
dot view and then go to that component
the translate form component and we just
want to add in an attribute called V on
okay so we want to say V on and then
form submit because that's what we're
emitting and then when we emit that we
want to run
function called translate text whoops
okay so when form submit is emitted it's
going to run this function so let's
create this function down here or this
method whatever you want to call it so
we're going to go after components and
then add a method here okay and we want
translate text actually we're going to
do colon and then function okay and then
this here is going to take in a
parameter which we'll call text and that
pertains to this right here okay because
we're emitting it and then we're passing
along this value which we can catch
right here so let's just do an alert
here and make sure that that's not only
being called but that this value is
being passed so reload and let's just
say test click it and we get alert tests
so now this is running and it's passed
in that data so this is where we
actually want to make our HTTP request
to the Yandex
API all right let's see let's go to
let's see documentation all right so
these are all actually all the languages
that you can use along with the code you
need to use the language code and then
if we go down to translate text what we
have to do is make a request to this URL
okay then we had we have to add a couple
parameters we have to add a key
parameter where we'll put the API key
and then text which will be the text to
translate and then Lang which will be
the language we want to translate to all
right so that's what we're going to do
here is make that request now in order
to make the request we need to use view
resource which we installed a little
while ago and we need to actually bring
that in so so let's go to main dot j s
and we're just going to go right here
and say import
view resource from view - resource and
you don't have to use this you can use
Axios or just jQuery or anything that
can make requests and then we just need
to enable it or add it to the middleware
so we want to save you dot use and pass
in that view resource alright and if you
want to look at the documentation for
that okay so let's see basically what we
can do is say this dot money sign HTTP
dot and then whatever type a request in
our case it's going to be get and then
that URL okay and then it's going to
pass us back a promise and we're going
to access the response and do what we
want with the response so make sure this
is saved and then close that up alright
and then we're going to make our request
so we'll do this dot money sign HTTP dot
get and then we want to put in our
endpoint so I'm going to go back here
and grab this copy that paste that in
alright and then we need to add our
parameters so we're going to put a
question mark and then key equals and
then this is where we need to put the
API key so I'm going to grab that let's
see
right here API key and then my keys and
I'm going to grab this copy and then
we'll just paste it in here and actually
want to wrap this so you guys can see
it's a toggle soft wrap there we go
alright so we have the key parameter now
we need the language so we're going to
put an ampersand and then Lang equals
and for now I'm just going to hard code
this as Russian so we need ru which is
the code and then we need to do the
actual text we want translated so we're
going to do ampersand text equals and
then we want this value here so we'll
just concatenate on text and that should
make our request alright now this is
asynchronous and it's going to give us a
promise back so we need to go on to the
end here get rid of that semicolon and
I'm going to go on to a new line and say
dot then okay and then here we'll put in
an arrow function with the parameter of
response and then we should be able to
access that response so let's just do a
console log okay so let's save that and
hopefully this works so let's say I'm
just going to recently reload this and
let's put in the word hello and then
translate and there it is our response
okay so in this response we have a body
object if we look at that we have the
code of 200 which is means everything's
okay our language and then the language
we're translating and then text which
has an array now it returns an array
because I think that sometimes you can
get more than one result for one word
but I'm not going to get into that what
we're going to do is just grab the first
the first one as you can see there's
only one here and it has an index of
zero so if we say console.log response
dot body dot text and then use 0 as our
index let's try it again and there it is
there's the translation okay now what we
want to do with that translation is put
it into a property called translated
text so what I'll do is add right here
data no it's alright
data and then function and remember we
have to return and then we're going to
say translated text which will initially
be set to nothing okay but then once we
make the requests we're going to put our
response into that value so this dot
translated text equals that okay and
then what we want to do is take our
translate output component and have that
output text so let's go up here and
we've got we're going to need to import
that as well translate output and let's
see that's going to be from dot slash
component slash translate output okay we
also have to add it to our list of
components and then we're going to put
that right here translate output just
like that and we need to pass in the
translated text right here so we can do
that easily by using the V text
directive and just set that equal to
translated text and that should count
that along so let's go ahead and save
this and then we're going to create the
translate output component so what I'll
do is just copy what we have and
translate form and then paste it in
translate output all right and then
we're going to change up some things
here as far as the template all I want
it to be is an h2 so let's get rid of
that
and just put in an h2 and then we can
access the translated text that we
passed in by using a double double curly
brace and say translated text okay and
then let's see down here all we want is
a name which is going to be translate
output and in order to grab this
translated text that was passed in we
need to define it as a property so right
here we're going to say props props and
then set that to setup brackets and then
translated text and then we can get rid
of this stuff the data no data no
methods very very simple component okay
we'll save that and let's reload this
let's see what are we getting here oh
let's go back to app dot view this there
needs to be a comma right here there we
go so hello translate and there we go
okay so it's now translating to Russian
now what we want to do is have the
language selector because we want to be
able to select a couple different
languages so let's go back to translate
form go up to where we have our markup
and we're going to put a select right
here okay this select is going to be
bound to a property called language so
let's add that down here and the data so
we just want to do language and just set
that to nothing and then up here for the
Select we're going to add a V model and
set that to language okay and then we're
going to put in our options so let's say
option value
okay this one is going to be Russian and
that's going to have the code of are you
okay and I'm just going to copy this and
we'll put Spanish which I believe is ES
and French which is fr and then Chinese
you see I think I don't really I don't
remember that so I'm going to go to the
documentation overview and this is where
you can find all the different codes
let's see where's Chinese Chinese looks
like it's ch okay and you and you can
put all of these language if you want
but that's good for now so we want to
have Russian selected by default so what
we can do is we can create a life cycle
method which is basically just a method
that hooks into a certain point and runs
at that point so we want we want this to
run when the components created so we
can use the created lifecycle function
our life cycle method make sure you put
a comma there as well and then all we're
going to do is say this dot language
equals are you okay that's going to be
the default value and then it will
change whenever we make our selection
now we also need to pass the language
that we select here we have to pass that
to the the parent component just like we
did here with the text to translate so
what we'll do is just add another
parameter here and save this dot
language alright and that should do it
let's save it and then go back to our
app dot view and we need to add that
here as well
language and then we're going to replace
the hard-coded are you right here with
that language so let's just put in some
quotes and we're going to concatenate
language
and that should do it so let's save and
go back to our application
okay so we'll say hello and let's choose
Spanish translate and there we go so
that's working so the functionality is
now complete so what we're going to do
now is make this look a lot better
because it looks horrible right now so
I'm going to use boots watch which you
guys have see me use quite a bit I like
it because one it's easy to link we can
just add the link and then it's also
different looking than the standard
bootstrap so we're going to use this
paper one right here I'm going to click
download and then just grab this link
all right we'll put this in index.html
let's actually change this title to word
translator okay and then we're just
going to add a link rel equals
stylesheet a trap paste that in alright
and then we'll save that okay so that
looks a little better now we're going to
have to go around and add our classes
that we need so let's start in app view
I want these headings to be centered so
let's add a class to them called text
Center which is a bootstrap class
actually you know what let's just add it
to the div save that and now
everything's centered so now I just want
to go down to our Styles down here and
just change that to body and let's add
background which will be fe3 times
alright let's see so now we're going to
move on to the form so let's go to the
translate form component and go up to
where we have the HTML and we're going
to add let's see we're actually going to
add a class here called row what I want
to do is use the grid system and make
this into a six column row or a six
column div but also add an offset so
it's in the middle all right now this is
in the middle but I want to put a class
of well around the form to give it a
gray background and I'll show you what
happens if we do that so if we say class
equals well okay now and you can see it
goes all the way over I want it to be in
the middle here so what we'll do is put
another div right here and let's give it
a class of call MD column d6 and then
call MD offset and we want to offset it
three okay and we'll put that ending div
all right so now if we save you'll see
it's pushed into the middle okay now for
these inputs we're going to put a class
here of form control on that and also on
the select and then on the input the
submit button down here we're going to
give it a class of BTN and then BTN
primary save that wise it look like that
I'm not exactly sure why it looks
different from my other one but I don't
care that looks fine
you guys can style this however you want
I'm just going to put a line break above
the button alright and let's also make
this I want to give this a rounded edge
and also a water so let's go down here
and actually let's give the form have an
ID no it doesn't so let's give it an ID
of transform and then down here and
we're just going to give it a border
radius let's do 10 pixels and then
border we'll do 1 pixel array and solid
there we go oh you know what I didn't
make it in line that's why so let's give
the form a class also of form in line
there we go and I don't want it I don't
want that line break if you guys like
the other way by all means keep it okay
so the last thing we want to do is on
translate output we want to I want it to
be green so we're going to add class
texts - success which will make it green
so let's try it out there we go awesome
and then the last thing we're going to
want to do is build this out for
production so we're going to go back to
the command line here and let's see
we're going to stop the project ctrl C
and then we're just going to do NPM run
build and that'll actually build it out
for us okay let's go into the folder and
so you want to go to projects and we're
a translator and you should have a dist
folder and inside there you'll have a
folder called static and an index.html
now if you're putting this in a
subdomain or I'm sorry a subfolder on
your host what you're going to want to
do is just edit this real quick
and just take the slash the first slash
off of everywhere where it says static
all right I only see scrap this alright
so right here here because it's not
going to be able to find the files if
you leave that there and I think that's
it so let's save that and then what I'll
do is open up FileZilla okay and we just
connect real quick here and then I'm
going to go to demos word translator and
that's what you're seeing here which is
what I already had what I'll do is
delete this completely
and reload this and you can see there's
nothing there so now we'll take the
stuff that's in the disk folder and
bring it over let that upload okay and
then we'll go back and reload there it
is
say hello translate okay and we now have
a production view jss application
alright so hopefully you guys like this
now if you want to learn more about view
j/s I would definitely suggest looking
into my edge wanax view j/s course i'll
leave a link in the description if
you're not subscribed please do so if
you enjoyed this please leave a like and
