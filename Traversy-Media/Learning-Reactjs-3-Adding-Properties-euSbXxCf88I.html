and set up our HTML document for react
we included our react scripts and also
the Babel core script and then we
created a Jumbotron component so what I
want to do now is introduce you to props
or properties and this allows us to
basically use variables inside of our
HTML alright so we can pass in
properties down here we this is where
we're actually rendering the jumbotron
component and let's pass in a property
called title alright so we'll say title
equals and we'll say I don't know just
say this is the title okay and then what
we can do is up here in our h1 we're
going to remove this to just the text
here and we're going to go like this so
I'm going to say this dot props dot
title alright so then if we save and we
go and reload now you can see we're
getting this is the title alright so
while we're at it we can just take this
paragraph text let's cut that and put it
in here we'll say let's just call it
text so text and then we'll paste that
in and then let's just replace that will
put this dot props dot text all right
and that should now still look the same
all right and then let's see the link
let's take this and actually let's pass
it in down here we'll save link we can
make this a little better-looking
actually we'll keep that on that line
all right so link let's say HTTP and
we'll say ed you wanna calm and then up
here for our link we're going to remove
the quotes we don't want the quotes and
I'm going to say this dot props dot link
okay we'll save that and now if we hover
over it you can see it's going to go to
edge wanax comm if we click it and there
we go all right so we're dynamically
inserting these properties into our
component now what if you want to do
this you want your your your properties
up here but you don't want to add in all
these attributes here okay because it
looks a little sloppy especially if you
start to get more and more component on
more and more properties what you can do
is use the lifecycle method get default
props alright so up at the top here
right above render I'm going to say get
default props which will be a function
alright now we just want to put a comma
here two separate separate it from
render and then what we can do is just
that will define our default properties
so let's put in what we have to do is
return an object and we'll say title and
what we'll do is grab this down here
actually let's change it back to hello
world so we'll say title is hello world
alright and then we can remove that from
here okay we'll grab the text
we'll just add it like this okay we're
going to put a comma there and we'll
also have the link which will be this
and then we can get rid of all these and
that looks a lot better and we'll put
the link up here
so now let's save that and go ahead and
reload and there we go so we're getting
our default properties and setting them
now just because we set our default
properties doesn't mean you can't still
add them in alright so if we want to go
and change it from the default to
something else that's going to override
your defaults alright so if you see if
you want to override your properties you
can still pass them in okay now you can
also validate your properties or you can
set what's called prop type okay so to
do that we're going to go let's go right
let's go above the get default props and
we're going to set prop types okay and
that's going to be set to an object and
we want to make sure you put a comma
here and we'll put in title okay so our
title property let's say that we want it
to be look sorry about that we want it
to be a string alright because that's
what it is
so we'll say react dot prop types
actually that should be a uppercase
react prop types dot string all right
and we'll save that and if we reload
nothing happens it's fine
because it is a string if I go when I
change this to let's say false which is
a boolean and reload you can see that
now it's not showing and then down here
we're getting an error that says invalid
prop title of type boolean
Jumbotron expected string okay so it's
telling us that it needs to be a string
so we can put that back now we can also
set set it to be required so after the
string will do dot is required okay and
then what we can do is let's get rid of
it and save and then down here you can
see required prop title was not
specified so it's required and it's not
there so it's throwing an error okay if
we put it back and reload everything's
fine all right so that's it for
properties in the next video we're going
to take a look at events in how we can
add events to react component</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
