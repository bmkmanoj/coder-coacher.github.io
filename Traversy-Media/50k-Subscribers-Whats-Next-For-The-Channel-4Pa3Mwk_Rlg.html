special video travesty media recently
hit 50,000 subscribers and that may not
be a big deal to some people but it's
huge for me and very proud of that and
I'm grateful for that so I wanted to say
a big thank you to all my subscribers
all the people that take time out of the
day to listen to me when I started doing
this I didn't plan on it reaching even
this level in fact I didn't think anyone
would really listen to me at all but you
guys are stuck with me and you let me
know that you appreciate what I give you
and that keeps me going keeps me doing
this youtube can just be a cesspool of
negativity and people that love to hate
on other people and hate on content
creators but I somehow got the most
grateful intelligent subscribers on
youtube and much trying to butter you up
very rarely do I get any negative
comments you guys have helped my
confidence level as a developer and as a
content creator and in general I've had
issues with anxiety depression and self
confidence things like that all that
garbage my entire life so you guys
honestly have helped me with that so I
just want to give you guys a big thank
you and to the people that have donated
their hard-earned money to me I'm
eternally grateful for that you helped
me in my family and you show that even
though you can get this for free you
appreciate it enough to see the value in
it and support us anyways so that keeps
me going and keeps me able to make this
content free all right so enough with
the mushy stuff now I just want to talk
a little bit about where we're headed
but before we do that I want to give you
guys the opportunity to let me know what
you want to learn next so if you wanted
to leave a comment and just kind of let
me know what technologies languages
frameworks topics etc that you want to
learn about just let me know and I can't
promise i'll get to all of them but if I
see enough people want to learn a
certain technology then i'll make those
necessary changes in my plans all right
another question I wanted to ask is if
you guys like the long crash course
video
or if you would rather short broken up
clips because that's something that I
really have a hard time list because I
know some people like the long in-depth
videos but some people have a really
short attention span and they like the
short clips so if you guys want to just
let me know what you prefer I can kind
of take a vote all right so you can go
ahead and do that let's say so upcoming
crash courses we have PHP which is going
to be the next one I believe and the
rest of these aren't in any order or
anything like that it's just some ideas
that I had Python I want to create a
crash course on the Python language not
Django or anything just the basic
language itself laravel which is a PHP
cmf CMS the help it's a PHP framework I
was thinking about building a CMS with
it is what i meant but i do want to do a
crash course on that css3 would be a
crash course for basically beginners
learning HTML CSS material design which
is a UI framework that i want to get
into will do something with that socket
i/o Ajax and Jason and then I have a
list of PHP engine JavaScript frameworks
that I want to get into I'm just not
sure which one yet reddit's which is a
no SQL database and caching system it's
really cool I want to do a crash course
on that graph ql is something i want to
get into but i do need to do some more
research before i can do that and then
the ruby programming language so these
are just some ideas that I had for a
crash course so you guys can let me know
what you think so for basic tutorials I
want to get into electron which will
allow us to build desktop apps with
JavaScript turn j/s which is kind of
like typescript it allows us to use
types in Java Script firebase which is a
cloud no excu l database docker and then
other app deployment tools I want to get
into app deployment services Heroku
digitalocean i'll show you how to deploy
deploy no Jas apps and
angular apps things like that front end
stuff so I want to build some front-end
templates maybe use sass and lessen some
other tools like that let's see what
else Hadoop in big data is something I
want to get into that I do need to do a
little bit more research on and i also
want to get into higher level stuff like
Java C++ and dot net I'm definitely not
a pro at these languages so this would
be probably entry-level beginner stuff
and then again Jas javascript frameworks
I have a list of those that I want to
get into WordPress I want to do some
stuff with WordPress you know build a
basic website build a shopping cart
build some plugins templates and then
mobile development so we'll do stuff
like react native ionic what else meteor
a meteor is actually being used for
mobile apps now UI frameworks I want to
get into different newer UI frameworks
aside from bootstrap and foundation and
then video editing which is something
I've never done but I've been asked
recently quite a few times how I do my
tutorials and what I use what software
so we'll do some stuff with that and
then also the yarn package manager I
want to do a tutorial on that as well ok
so now let's look at some project ideas
so I've had a bunch of requests for Ruby
on Rails five and a couple requests for
a shopping cart so i think i'm going to
do that we're going to do a react native
mobile app I do have a react native
crash course but I don't have an actual
project UJS do have some view jas videos
but I want to do a full application with
that and then socket i/o I do have a
chat application video but I want to do
something different than chat ok laravel
like I said earlier I think I want to do
a content management system with laravel
and then I want to do some stuff with
api's you know I have to reuse the
github API and one of my videos a couple
couple of my videos as well as Spotify
but there's a bunch of nice ap is that
we can use and build some really cool
stuff with express nodejs and Express of
course
I want to build a social network
probably with just PHP but I might use a
framework i'm not sure but i do want to
build a social network django um recent
i recently got into django i really like
it so we'll do some projects and that
which is a Python framework and then I
want to build an app with no Jas and
Redis and use Redis as as our caching
system okay so some basic ideas that I
have for the future I want to do some
live streaming do some freestyle coding
live on YouTube but I do have an issue
with I can't really focus on anything
else when i'm coding I so it's going to
be hard to try to interact so there
might be limited chat and interaction
but i will do some live stuff and then i
want to create a series probably called
wet web tech spotlight or something like
that where I basically take something
new that just came out and talked about
it and use it for 5 10 minutes or so
just to keep you guys updated on you
know what's coming out in the industry
and then I want to do some stuff for for
career help I recently did a how to find
a web developer job with no experience
video and you guys really like that
stuff so I want to do some more stuff
with excuse me with careers and jobs and
so on giveaways so I recently did a home
office tour and you guys saw that I have
a bunch of stuff laying around and I
want to kind of do a giveaway with that
stuff as well as some new stuff and then
blogging is also something that I want
to get into maybe go to a couple
conventions or something and you know
take the camera along but that's
something that I just thought of I
haven't really planned out all right and
again if you guys have any other ideas
I'd like to hear them alright so now
it's pegging time I just created a
patreon account patrin whatever however
you say it and you guys can now provide
ongoing support to this channel so if we
can get enough people to donate just you
know a couple bucks per month like a
coffee per month I'll be able to do this
full time and give you guys free
education tutorials
full courses almost daily my goal is to
grow this channel to be the number one
web development channel we're growing at
about 500 subscribers per day which is
pretty good for a web development
channel we know we have kids on YouTube
playing Minecraft that has three million
subscribers and then the web dev and
educational channels get a fraction of
that so that's pretty sad unfortunately
you know there's not too many people
want to actually learn stuff anymore
they're more concerned with
entertainment and stuff like that so
it's just something to think about if
you guys you know I've watched my videos
one or two times and you find it
mediocre I wouldn't expect anything and
I'll expect anything anyways I'm just
saying that I do have some hardcore
followers and this gives you guys an
opportunity to support and get involved
with the channel all right and I haven't
worked out the details yet but patrons
will get things like private content
special live streaming what else coupons
and deals for courses things like that
all right so just something to think
about that's the link right there if
you're interested and we also can you
know except one time paypal donation so
so enough with that that's it and again
I just want to thank you guys and I want
to let you guys know that you know this
channel is not going anywhere in fact
they plan to just keep growing and give
you more videos more often and you're
going to learn as I learn I'm always you
know learning new technologies and
frameworks and languages and you know as
soon as I learn it I put it out there
for you guys so again thank you and I
will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
