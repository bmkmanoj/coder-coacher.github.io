tutorial on how to install joomla i'm
gonna be installing joomla 2.5 onto an
apache server which is ran by
zamp which is a local server so it's not
going to be accessible over the internet
but it's pretty much the same thing as
if you were putting it on a live server
so we're gonna go to jewel org and click
download now if this is going to be a
production site for you then I would
suggest doing some research because
depending on what type of site you have
you should download 2.5 or 3.0 they
actually just just recommended 3.0 now
for new sites most new sites I think
yesterday it was still 2.5 they just
changed it and what I suggest usually is
if it's a if you're building a new site
it's gonna be like a small business site
with pretty much just informational
pages and no ecommerce or anything like
that I would suggest installing 3.0 and
there was version if you plan on having
third-party extensions
maybe virtue might or so vPro stuff like
that then I would suggest 2.5 in this
tutorial we'll get it download 2.5 so
just I'm going to download the package
to my desktop
and depending on whether you're doing
this on a local machine or on a live
server you need an FTP account but I'm
just doing it on my on my zamp server
which is in my I Drive zamp
htdocs I'm going to delete that that's
so this is this is where we would put
any any files we want on our website
this is well gonna extract the Joomla
install I'm gonna create a new folder
called email a two-five
and this is where we're going to put the
all the joomla files and it's going to
be accessible at localhost
Joomla two five okay so you'll see we
have nothing there and Joomla is still
downloading you can take a while
depending on your internet connection
actually you know what I think I have a
version already downloaded yeah actually
I do right here
where is it yeah okay so here's the
joomla 2.5 point 9 package this is the
latest version as of now february 2013
so i'm gonna open that package and i'm
gonna extract all the files into the
into my website folder i can actually
stop this
okay
what
all right so all the Joomla files are
extracted and they're in my website root
which is the Joomla 2-5 folder so I'll
reload this and now we have the
Installer next next next
now here's will you put your database
information what I'm gonna do is create
a new database and you would probably if
you are on a live server you probably
need to go to cPanel and then click on
the MySQL database wizard but I'm one on
local machines so I'm gonna do local
host PHP my admin' now just click on
databases and we're gonna create a new
database called Jim one two five
okay so now we have an empty database so
now we want to put our credentials in my
database username is root in the
password and then the database name do
more to five and then click Next and I
would suggest you do not enable the FTP
layer because it can cause problems
sometimes give it a name and your email
and your admin username if it's going to
be a site we want it really secure I'd
suggest changing the name from admin
because hackers know that that's the
default name but I'm not going to do
then I'm going to install the sample
data
and click Next now you get to click this
to remove the installation folder and
then you should be able to clip here
click on administrator and it'll take
you to the the backend login
so now we're the back end we up here we
can click view site and this is the
front end so now we have a brand new
default joomla 2.5 installation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
