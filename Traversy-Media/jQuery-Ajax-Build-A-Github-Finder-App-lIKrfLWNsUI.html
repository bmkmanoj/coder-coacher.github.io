project build video for you we're going
to be building a github profile search
application using jQuery and GRC
JavaScript it's going to use the github
API we're going to make an AJAX request
using jQuery to the API and we're going
to fetch the user profile information
we're going to fetch the user's
repositories and we're going to display
them nicely using bootstrap ok we're
actually using boots watch which is a
custom theme service for a bootstrap
alright so this is the application here
now I do have a similar video on a
similar video but a similar project
using angular 2 on my channel I wanted
to do something a little more simple for
people that aren't really into
frameworks and all that just starting to
learn JavaScript and jQuery so we're
just going to use jQuery for this ok
it's going to be pretty simple it's
under 100 lines of code of JavaScript so
how it works is we just have the search
form here and as soon as we type
something into it for instance I'll just
put a B in there it's going to go and
fetch whatever user profile' comes back
for B all right so which is this
Benjamin black now if I go when I keep
typing for instance BR it's going to get
whatever is in BR okay I'll keep typing
that's what's in BR a that's what comes
back for Brad and then as I type you'll
see that nothing's coming back because
there is no profile with this name but
once I get to my name it go it will
fetch that profile all right now you can
see we're getting the avatar the button
to visit the profile we have some labels
up here the repos the gist's followers
company website location member cents
and then down here we're getting the
latest repos okay these are the latest
five repos and you can easily change
that number if you want and this
displays the description the forks watch
our stars and then a link to the repo
page
alright so that's what we'll be building
guys hopefully you enjoy it let's get
started alright guys so before we get
started on our application we need to
to register it with github now you don't
need to do this to work with the API but
if you don't your application will only
get about 50 requests per hour so it
will eventually stop working and you
don't want that this is really simple
just go to github.com slash settings /
applications slash new give it a name so
something like github or an o'clock
github finder homepage and just use your
localhost put an app description
something like a simple github profile
finder and then authorization URL you
can use localhost as well now I already
have I already have one created so I'm
not going to push this but you want to
go ahead and save register application
alright and once you do that you should
have that listed here in your
applications alright now this I have
I've had this from a while ago I think
from the angular 2 version and you just
want your client ID and your client
secret so we're going to keep this open
so we can plug that in later on alright
next thing we're going to do is actually
let's go ahead and create our folder now
I'm not going to even use the server I'm
just going to do this right on my
desktop
alright so it's a github finder alright
and then inside there we're going to
create our index.html file ok let's
create a CSS folder we're actually going
to use the bootstrap CDN so we're not
going to include bootstrap here are you
kind of you want but we're actually
going to use a custom boot swatch theme
but right here what I want to do is just
have a regular or standard style CSS in
case you want to add any extra styles
and then we'll create a jf folder looks
not a jf shortcut folder jf and then
we're only going to have one JavaScript
file ok so that's going to be main dot
gif
okay so that's pretty much our file
structure now I'm going to open this in
my editor and I'm using atom which you
can get at atom do really nice text
editor has a lot of features but what
we're going to do is open up project
folder and I have this on my desktop
github finder okay let's open up
index.html okay so now what we're going
to do is we're going to go to get
bootstrap comm and I'm going to just get
some default HTML stuff from if we go to
getting started and then examples we're
going to grab this starter template
right here and do a control you okay I'm
going to copy everything here all the
source code and paste it in index.html
alright so what we're going to do is
just kind of take out what we don't need
so this comment here down to here you
don't need that stuff title let's change
that to github finder okay we'll leave
this here and then get rid of everything
else in the head all right now like I
said we're using a boots watch so we're
going to go to is it I think it's boots
watch comm and you see that there's all
these different styles that we can use
so we're going to grab this simplex guy
so if we click download' it'll take us
to the actual file and what I'm going to
do is just copy this link here and throw
that throw that in right here
okay we're also going to want to include
our style dot CSS
okay so that's going to be CSS slash
style dot CSS alright and then we're
going to get rid of let's see we're
going to keep the navbar actually we're
going to keep all that and down here we
don't want actually we'll just get rid
of all these scripts right here alright
now for the bootstrap javascript file
we're going to use bootstrap CDN and
it's bootstrap CDN comm and we're just
going to grab this JavaScript link right
here okay we don't need to CSS because
that's coming from the boot swatch but
let's go ahead and stick that down here
okay so we'll paste that link in now
we're also going to need our main jf
that we created so that's in the JX
folder
okay now we're also going to need jQuery
obviously so let's say jQuery CDN and
then we're going to use jQuery 3x
uncompressed grab that script tag and
we're going to put that right at the top
here okay make sure that that's above
the other ones and that should do it so
let's save and then let's open up
index.html okay so it should look like
that now the content is under the navbar
so to fix that we're just going to
remove this navbar fix top class save
that and there we go so we have our
basic styling and we can close up these
other tabs here
okay we'll leave the oauth open well
I'll probably also need get bootstrap at
some point so let's go ahead and go back
to our index file and we're going to so
you go to the navbar and let's change
the project name to github finder now
this is a single page app we don't need
any of these links so we'll get rid of
all the allies right and then down here
I'll exchange this dotted template class
I'll just change that to search
container and then then the h1 will say
starch github users and let's change
this paragraph I'm just going to make
this bigger alright so in the power
graph let's say enter a username to
fetch a user's profile profile info and
repose okay then under that we're going
to put an input give it a type of text
I'm going to give it an ID so that we
can latch on to it later we'll call it
search user okay let's give it a boost
wrap class of form control and
placeholder and we'll just say github
username all right and then we're going
to put a line break under that search
container and then we're going to have a
div with the ID of profile okay so this
is where the results of our Ajax request
will go our formatted HTML so let's save
that okay look at that and that should
be what you have so far all right and
that's pretty much it as far as the HTML
file the rest we're going to do all in
our JavaScript file
all right so let's go to Maine Jas all
right now we're using jQuery so what
we're going to have to do first is just
say document dot ready now if you don't
know
jQuery I would suggest watching my
jQuery series I think there's seven or
eight videos that I have all the basics
all the fundamentals of jQuery because
I'm not going to go through every single
thing here all right so let's say ready
then we're going to put in a callback
here and what this does is just that it
lets us know when the documents ready
when it's finished loading and we can
proceed so let's just do a console dot
log and we'll just say ready save that
okay let's go back let's hit f12 to open
up the chrome tools console it should
also if you're using Firefox it should
also open up the tools there as well all
right so now you can see down here it
says ready that means we're connected
everything is ready to go all right so
what we want to happen is when we start
to type we want to make an AJAX request
to the github API all right so let me
just show you in heat in another window
here if we say API github.com slash
users slash and then a username it gives
us all this profile information so we
want to make a request to this URL all
right but we want to do it with the user
and whatever is typed in here so we need
an event for when we start to type to
catch what we're typing all right so to
do that
remember that input has an ID of search
user so we're going to use jQuery and
we're going to say the ID of search user
okay so we want an event handler here
and we want to use the key up event okay
because when we start to type so we're
going to say on and then here the event
name which is key up
okay and then second parameter is going
to be a callback function all right so
let's say console dot log key pressed
okay so let's go ahead and reload and
now if I hit something we get key
pressed I keep typing you'll see it'll
keep doing it alright so what we want to
do is get whatever we're typing in and
we can do that by passing in this event
parameter and then let's do console dot
log D dot target dot value okay that'll
give us the value of what we type in so
let's reload and we'll just say test and
you can see every time I type it's going
to go ahead and log that all right so
that's what we want so what I'm going to
do is create a variable and put that in
it alright so we'll say let's call this
user name and that's going to be set to
whatever we pass in all right so now
what we want to do is make our Ajax
request all right so let's say make
requests to github
now with jQuery I makes it a lot easier
than if we were just using standard
JavaScript there's a lot of different
functions we could use we're going to
use the Ajax function so to do that we
do money sign dot Ajax all right and
then that's going to take in an object
with our parameters or our values so we
want to put in our URL now the URL is
going to be this here so let's grab that
and it will paste that in now obviously
we don't always want to get my profile
we want to get whatever is typed in so
we're going to get rid of this brad
travesti here and then we're just going
to concatenate the username ok that's
being typed in
all right now as I said if you don't
register your application and use your
client ID and client secret you only get
about 50 requests I believe per hour so
we want to make sure we add that so
we're going to send data along with this
all right and we want to send the client
ID okay we also want the client secret
okay so let's go back to that o auth to
that github page here and let's grab
client ID
okay let's also grab the secret put that
in there as well and that should do it
all right so now we want to do is we
want to go to the end of this Ajax
function here and we want to say dot
done okay because it returns a promise
and then that's going to take a callback
function okay and then that's going to
pass our data back all right now I'm
just I'm not going to call this data I'm
going to call this user because that's
that's what the data is all right now
what I'm going to do is just console dot
log user all right so it makes the
request to this URL sending along our
credentials and then it gives us back
this user object so let's go ahead and
save that and now if we go when I type
in B you'll see we get this object back
and if we look at it it has all that
profile information for B for Benjamin
black alright and every time I type you
can't see it but it's making requests
okay the last one you'll see is the last
thing I typed in which is my profile
alright so it gives us all this stuff so
what we want to do now is we want to
take all that stuff and put it into our
HTML okay so we have we have an ID of
profile so that's where we want to stick
everything
so let's get rid of this console.log and
we're going to say ID profile and we're
going to use jQuery function HTML all
right now I'm going to use template
literals which are part of the the es6
syntax and what it allows us to do is we
can use multiple lines we can insert
variables instead of having to
concatenate everything with using quotes
so I'm going to put in back text instead
okay that way we can kind of treat this
like except like a regular HTML file and
we can actually use variables so we can
say money sign and then some curly
braces take that user and let's get the
name value from it okay because if we
look at the response we get you can see
right here it gives us the name all
right so let's try that so let's put in
B and you can see we get Benjamin black
and as I type it changes okay so we can
get all that information using this user
object all right but I want to format
this nicely using bootstrap panels so if
we go to get bootstrap comm and then go
to components and then panels I'm going
to grab this right here which is the
panel with a header and we'll just paste
that in paste that in right there and
then I want to put the name up here in
the header so we'll get rid of that and
let's go ahead and say user dot name all
right so let's save it now if we go and
we type in something here you can see we
get a panel with the name and the header
okay so now we just want to put the rest
of the content in the body let's get rid
of that now we're going to use the grid
system here so let's
dude is class row okay and then we're
going to have give class say call MD
three so three column divs and let's do
call MD nine all right so on the three
column that's where our images our
avatars going to go so let's put image
source and we can get the the image
location from user dot avatar underscore
URL all right and I'm going to add the
bootstrap class of thumbnail so let's
try that and then if I go ahead and I
put in a B you'll see we'll get his
profile picture which is very very
strange now I want this image contained
in the three column you'll see it's a
lot bigger than it should be so I'm just
going to add style right here and let's
say with 100% okay so now it's smaller
now you could just put this in your
style CSS actually you know what let's
do that that's a cleaner way to do it so
this is a class of thumbnail will also
give it a class of Avatar avatar
all right
I just I wasn't going to do it because I
said pretty sure this is the only style
we're going to have in that in that file
alright so under that under the image
we're going to have a link to the actual
profile alright so we can get that link
with user dot HTML underscore URL say
let's give it a class of BTN BTN primary
and BTN block which will make it a block
element and we're also going to give it
a target of underscore blank because we
want it to open in another page all
right so if we look at that
please didn't write you even put any
text say view profile there we go
click that brings us to the profile
alright so that's it for this side now
over here we're going to put some other
data some other info I want to get a
bunch of labels bootstrap labels so if
we go and click on labels and I'm going
to grab these four right here copy those
paste it in
okay so this first one is going to be
the public repos so let's say public
repos : and then user dot public
underscore repos okay next we'll have
the public gist user dot public gist
okay let's do followers use your dot
followers and following alright so let's
do that and then we're going to put two
line breaks under it and let's just make
sure that that works correctly okay so
there we go
repos just followers and following and
then underneath it we're going to put a
list group so you will give it a class
of list group I'm going to say Li class
list group item all right so let's say
we want the company okay now all this
information I'm getting from here okay
from this request you can from this
response you can see we have all this
available to us alright so company let's
copy that so let's say website slash
blog and this is user dot blog let's do
location
and let's do member since and that's
going to be created underscore at okay
so let's take a look at that there we go
there's the top part of our application
so that's that's all the profile info if
you want to include any other thing here
you can do that but we're going to move
on and we want to list all the
repositories down here alright and of
course as I type this will change okay
so for the repositories we're going to
need to make an additional request we're
going to make a request and then we're
going to stick it down here under the
profile info so under here let's put in
an h3 will say page header and let's say
latest repose okay then we need a
placeholder for it so I'm going to
create a div with the ID of repose just
like we did with the users and then
let's go up here and we're going to make
another request okay so we're going to
make this request inside of this done
okay so it's a Ajax
okay then we'll have dot done okay
that's going to give us back repose all
right now in the Ajax let's put the URL
URL is actually going to be this so we
can copy that
all right so it's going to be that and
then slash repose so we just want to go
slash repose okay still want the
username there and then we still want to
send the data to client ID stuff so
let's do that all right and then we
should get back to repose
so the repose we want to basically we
want to loop through them and put them
into that repos div now we're going to
use in each loop actually before we do
that let me just make sure it works
so we'll just console.log repos okay
go ahead and do that and you can see
we're getting an array with all the
different repos and if we look over here
to see what we get back it gives us back
all this information on every repository
okay so the ID the named full name all
the owner information and then all this
stuff so you can actually make this
application much more in-depth in terms
of the data that you include in it but I
don't want to take too much time so
we're just going to do kind of the
basics alright but feel free to add to
it all right so let's get rid of the
console log and we're going to want to
loop through that because it's an array
so let's say each we're going to use a
jQuery each loop oops and this will take
in array and call back
and then this takes index and then value
instead of value though I'm actually
going to use repo okay now we want that
repos div that we created so it has an
ID of repos and I'm going to say dot
HTML or no not dot HTML if we do HTML
it's going to overwrite it with every
iteration of the loop so we want to do
append because we want to keep adding to
it all right so let's put in some back
ticks here okay and then let's see we're
going to put all of it put every repo in
a class of well which will give it that
gray background and then we're going to
have these the grid system and this is
actually going to have three columns so
the first one will be call em d7 I'm
just going to copy that so we'll have
seven then three then two okay so this
first one is going to have the repo name
and description so I'm going to put the
name inside of strong tags
so it's going to be repo dot name and I
guess we can test that out up to this
point okay so now you can see we get all
the repos with their name now by default
it's going to return all of them I
actually want to just set it to five
I also want to sort it by date you can
see it's sorted by alphabetical order so
what we can do is add to the request up
here to the data and this APL this API
allows us to send the parameter of sort
so we want to sort by created and we
want that to be a sending okay and then
we also want to send per underscore page
five that will give us five back okay so
let's check that out now you can see
it's by date it's not alphabetical and
it's only five so let's go back down
here and let's put in the description
repo dot description all right now the
second column here is going to have the
forks Watchers and stars and that's
going to be in labels so I'm going to go
and copy three of these labels that we
have pasted that in there okay we'll
change this to repo this is going to be
forks on the score of count change this
to forks so the Watchers
and stars so repo and it's actually star
gazers count owned this should be
watches comp alright and then in this
last one we'll have a link look pate ref
and we can say repo dot HTML URL say
target blank class BTN VTN default and
let's say repo page alright let's save
that three load and there we go so you
can see the forks the Watchers the stars
repo page that'll open it up look
something's wrong there oh I forgot the
money son
there we go all right so I think that's
it guys so we have a pretty useful
application if you want to look up I
show my own name wrong if you want to
look up github users all right so
hopefully this taught you a little bit
about jQuery as well as Ajax and that's
it so if you like this please subscribe
videos like this all the time give it a
like if you liked it and I will see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
