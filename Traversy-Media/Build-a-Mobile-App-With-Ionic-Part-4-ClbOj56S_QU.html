series in the last video we made it so
that we could add it to do in our form
here in the application and it then got
sent to firebase so this doesn't do us
much good because we can't actually see
them so that's what we're going to do
now what we'll go what we'll do is go to
our - duze controller and we're going to
say scope dot - dues is going to equal
to do service dot all alright and that's
all there is to it now we have our -
dues inside of this scope variable so
what we'll do is go to our index and go
to our template here and what we need to
do is we need to loop through our - dues
and then output them as a list item so
let's go let's see we're going to go
right here and we're going to say iein
list all right and then we'll end that
okay now we need to loop through these
so we're going to say I an item and
we're going to use a directive called
ng-repeat okay that's an angular
directive that's used for looping
through stuff alright so remember we put
scope dot - dues as our variables so we
can say to do in - dues
okay just like that and then let's see
we're going to have a div and let's give
this a class of item all right and then
inside of it we're going to have some
double curly braces and let's see we
should be able to just say name actually
now not just name it should be to do to
do dot name yeah
okay so let's save it and there we go
actually you know what let's take out
this item div that makes it look a
little weird there we go awesome so now
if we add another to do let's say go
shopping and save and there we go
actually it looks like it's putting in a
blank to do here let's check out
firebase let's see
okay so it is actually putting in an
empty to do so let's go back to save to
do which is right here and this is where
we're saving it
let me try getting rid of this alright
and I'm actually going to delete that
from firebase
all right so we'll reload say test item
all right so that was the issue I'm not
sure why but whatever it's it's fixed
now so what we want to do now is I want
to be able to delete these or set them
as checked or whatever you want to call
it so what we'll do is add an event
handler so that we can click on these to
get rid of them alright I'm not going to
go into editing them and updating them
maybe that's something that you could
try to figure out on your own it's not
too difficult to do but I mean it's only
one field so I don't really see a need
to edit them it'd be quicker just to
click on it delete it and then re-add it
alright so let's go into our HTML and
we're going to just add a div right here
and this is going to get a directive
called ng-click
and we're going to set that to remove to
do
all right now we'll go to our controller
and let's go right under save to do and
we're going to call this remove to do
all right that's going to equal a
function oops okay and that's going to
take in an ID so actually we have to put
that in here as well so this is going to
be to do dot dollar sign ID all right
and then in the controller let's just
test it out we'll say console dot log ID
all right now if I click one you can see
down there we're getting its ID all
right so I want to use something called
I an ionic action sheet and it'll make
it so that when we click on this we'll
get a nice little pop-up here that'll
ask us if we're sure we want to delete
all right now to use that we actually
have to include it up here in our
dependencies so it's going to be ionic
action sheet all right and then down
here I'm going to say ionic action sheet
show yeah dot show and then we'll pass
in our curly braces we have a couple
different options here
first one is destructive text all right
and that's going to be we'll say remove
to do next one will be the title text so
for that we'll say are you sure and then
we're going to have the cancel text
which will just be canceled all right
and then we're going to have a function
called destructive button clicked all
right and that's going to be a function
all right now in here we need the ID of
the remove that the to do that we want
to remove so we can say scope dot - dues
dot dollar sign get record and then just
pass in the ID all right and then we're
going to say scope dot - dues dot dollar
sign remove and then we'll pass in that
REM variable all right and then we just
need to return or return true so let's
save that and if I click one of these
get this nice little pop-up remove to do
and it's gone alright so we can now add
- dues and remove them awesome so in the
next part the last part I'm going to
show you how we can go ahead and run
this on the virtual device that Android
studio gives us and also how to publish
an apk file so that you can actually
install it on your physical device</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
