about the hosts file all right Windows
Linux Mac all have some kind of hosts
file and what it does is basically it's
a way to resolve a domain name without
using DNS alright and you can basically
assign any domain name you want to any
IP address which will of course only
work on your machine you could actually
point google.com to a Yahoo IP address
and then if you go in your browser and
type in google.com it'll go right to
Yahoo all right so it's it's an
alternative to for mostly for web
developers that don't want to actually
connect a domain to a to a website
they're developing yet but it's a way to
kind of allow you to use a domain and
not this this junk we have up here now
all right so as an example I have a site
called June digi and I've just moved all
the files i'll copied all the files to
my new VPS server and i haven't I don't
have a domain name connected to it yet
so to access it I'm using the IP address
and then I'm using the user name and
that brings you to your to your your
website I do have the original site
right here which is June digi calm and
actually has the domain name connected
to it and the difference here just so we
could differentiate these sites is that
on the new server I have the menus all
squished up with no search bar alright
so that's how we're going to tell the
difference here but my goal is to
connect the June digicomp domain to my
new server to my new site obviously with
just the machine Amon
and one of the reasons for this is if
you just use this here the IP address
and we go ahead and click on blog you
can see we're getting an error here and
not found error and this is due to not
having an actual domain name but using
this this crap here alright so if we go
to the regular site the live site and
click on blog everything's fine
alright so I want to be able to use June
digi calm for this site right here
alright so we need to go to our hosts
file and it's right here let me just
close this I want to show you exactly
where it is on a window system alright
so you want to go to your C Drive or
whatever your main software drive is and
go to windows and then system32 ok and
then to drivers and then to etc' alright
you can see the full path right here
it's kind of hidden all right
so let's click on this host file and you
want to open it with a text editor you
could use notepad I'm going to use
notepad plus plus and if you haven't
messed with it at all it should look
something like this
all right so basically we want to put
the IP address and then the domain name
or the local host name resolution that
we want to be assigned to that IP
address right now these here if you have
this this hashtag or pound symbol it
works as a comment
all right so none of these are actually
doing anything these are just comments
and examples you can actually remove
this and then you'll be able to use
local host which will ping back to your
loopback address which is your own the
computer you're on which is 127.0.0.1
all right but I'm gonna leave that and
what I want to do here is I want the IP
address for my new server for my June
digi site which is right here so I'm
gonna just copy this alright we don't
want the slashes and we don't want the
HTTP we just want the IP address all
right then we need to do one space
actually I'm not sure if it has to be
one but it has to be at least one and
then I'm just gonna put in June digi
calm okay I'm gonna save this and now go
back and now we should be able to use
June digi comm to access this which is
the new site on the new server
actually I'll do it over here and you
again you'll know the difference because
the searchbar will be gone
all right so you can see now this domain
is actually leading to this to the new
site and now if I click on blog or any
other link it's gonna work okay because
you don't have that jibber jabber up in
this up in the the URL
all right so very handy for web
development if you need to actually use
the site with a domain but you don't
actually want to point a live domain to
to the live site and all we have to do
to reverse this is just delete this save
and now if I go back to June digi calm
it brings us back to the live site to
the to the old server alright so just
wanted to share that with you
all right thanks please subscribe and to
keep watching my videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
