management tool that allows you to
implement infrastructure as code it can
also be called as infrastructure as code
automation engine that helps you
automate provisioning software applying
configurations managing configurations
deploying applications this had been
included in fedora distribution of Linux
and now is available for Red Hat
Enterprise Linux CentOS and scientific
Linux we are extra packages for
Enterprise Linux redhead acquired
ansible in the year 2015
October anti became deployed to various
virtualization and cloud environments
including your Amazon Web Services
atomic centurylink cloud scale cloud
stack digital ocean dimension data are
darker Google cloud platform KBM Linode
LX c LX d Microsoft Azure OpenStack OVH
overt packet profit breaks PubNub
Rackspace smart OS soft layer you know
vention vmware webfaction and XenServer
and of course your bare metal hosts the
design goals of ansible are as a
software configuration management tool
should be minimal in nature should be
consistent every time you want to deploy
a software or manage configuration of
your server or your hardware of course
it has to be highly secure and certainly
it has to be reliable it has to work
whenever you want the way you want it to
work it should be easy to learn there
shouldn't be a huge learning curve
learning a software that manages your
configure
and it should use OpenSSH it should not
deploy agents to nodes and ansible
playbook can be unchanged to prevent
unexpected side effects on the various
managed systems the ansible playbooks
use an easy and descriptive language
based on primal and ginger templates the
management system should not impose
additional dependencies on the
environment now let's take a look at the
architecture of fanciful ansible can
have two different types of servers your
controlling machines and your loads your
controlling machines have to be a linux
or a unix hosted environment and should
have Python 2.6 or 2.7 on that and your
managed nodes which are like Unix must
have version 2.4 of Python or later all
you manage nodes with Python 2 or 4 or
earlier versions of Python simple Jason
package is also required for those to
work with ansible since the version 1.7
of ansible you can also manage various
windows nodes and in this case your
powershell remoting is used instead of
SSH which you would use in case of Linux
ansible uses an agentless architecture
and with the agent based architectures
nodes must run as background processes
as demons installed locally on various
nodes that continuously communicate with
a controlling machine and in case of an
agentless architectures node do not need
to run as background daemons all the
time to connect with a controlling
machine which is what ansible uses this
inner way reduces the overhead on the
network by preventing the nodes from
continuously polling the controlling
machine all the time here is a diagram
showing the architecture of an supports
in this case the orchestration begins
with a single controlling machine
and you can see various nodes on your
right-hand side that are managed by a
controlling machine
the provisional machine that you see in
the middle and all the connections are
being made over SSH to your application
servers to your database servers to your
wave servers to orchestrate the nodes
ansible deploys modules to nodes over
SSH and modules are stored in nodes and
communicate with the controlling machine
through JSON protocol so your various
nodes do not keep checking with the
controlling machine if there is an
update instead the controlling machine
whenever there is an update pushes these
updates to all the nodes that are
connected to it hey once you become an
