to find out what this actual term means
DevOps is short for development
operations it focuses on a collaboration
between developers and other roles
developers typically work in isolation
they can't do this anymore we need to
work in conjunction with the operations
people and the QA people we need to find
out how to develop an application from
start to end from me inception all the
way through to production and production
support it's about thinking about how
things are going to work in the future
when we're in the very beginning stages
of the operations and they also of the
great importance is an automation the
process we don't want to do things man
who anymore we want everything to be
fast totally automated and reliable now
the whole process of DevOps is to use
automation and use different tools to do
the operations the number of different
categories of tools each of the
categories has got its own range of
tools which each do something similar
but in a slightly different way so for
example we've got tools for monitoring
we've got tools for releasing into
production configuration management
packaging the application all sorts of
testing integration and performance
testing building the application and
initially starting with the code
development and unit testing the whole
range of tools and we'll be looking at
the whole range of these tools from one
end to the other so what are the goals
of DevOps it's about thinking about the
whole system the whole process from
start to end this involves coordinating
with the teams and involves having
feedback loops from one position to
another it's also about continuous
improvement we need to improve the way
we work by working belt well together
and using the tools correctly so that we
have fewer incidents in production which
have costly repercussions we also want
to improve the process efficiency so
that the team learns and is better and
better each time so some important
improvements are these reducing testing
time
that doesn't mean reducing testing it
means reducing the time that the test
she run try to reduce the amount of
changes required when the lab
requirements are conflicting or
incomplete we need to resolve those
conflicts early on we need to find the
simplest solution to meet the
requirements he's not necessarily the
optimal solution but a best solution
that works well we need to use standard
tools across the organization which
integrate well together we need to have
really robust production systems which
have very low maintenance costs and are
very very reliable we also need to
produce software to the highest possible
quality and B to achieve this we need to
improve the performance of the
individuals and the teams and how they
work together now part of the process of
improvement is changing the way people
work we need to be strive for clarity
we'd want to challenge any uncertainties
in requirements we don't want to fill in
the gap which many people attempted to
do ask somebody who knows what the
answer is before making any assumptions
assumptions themselves are particularly
difficult to deal with we need to be
sure that they are valid assumptions and
that they haven't been put there for
some reason which hasn't been justified
we want simplicity and reliability the
optimal design is almost impossible but
the best design is what we'd strive for
we also want to reduce risk we need to
be able to meet the requirements with
the least risk path an important thing
is to avoid gold plating don't put extra
code in there just for the sake of it or
for some potential future change which
may never happen do the minimum to get
the thing to work and women's an issue
find the root cause of the issue don't
just try and fix the symptoms because
the root cause is going to come back and
bite you later on so the working
practice should be constantly evolving
and very iterative so you learn
something some new technology some no
tool you try it out work with it then
you think about it okay
do you not do a good job at this could
do a better job of this how could I do a
better job of this and then you learn
some more to improve yourself and go
round around the loop as you improve as
time goes on
