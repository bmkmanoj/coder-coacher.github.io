tutorial in this tutorial we are going
to talk about multi processing in Python
now if you have not already watched my
video on multi processing versus multi
threading then I would highly recommend
watching that also watch my tutorial on
multi threading once you watch these two
then you can continue with the tutorial
multi processing all right so here in
this code what I'm going to do is I have
an array of numbers and I am going to
create two different processes which
will work on these numbers so the first
process will calculate the square of
these numbers and the second one will
calculate the cube of these numbers all
right fairly simple okay so let me
create my first process so I will say p1
equal to multi-processing dot process
okay and here in the target you need to
mention the function which is going to
be executed as part of this process okay
so my first function will be calculate
square and I am going to write them
permutation of this function in a minute
and then the second argument is the arts
which is your array okay and since it is
a topple you need to put a comma here
okay now let's implement calculate
square function okay so the input to
this function is a numbers list and you
are iterating through these numbers
and all you are doing is just printing
the square of these numbers okay so I'm
just printing and star an and I will
create another function which will
calculate the cube okay so it will be
called calculate Q and it will just
calculate the cube okay
so my second function I am going to
create a second process call it a p2 and
in the target I will mention calculate Q
okay
now you need to start this processes so
when you create a process using this
instruction it doesn't get started
automatically you need to call the start
function on these two processes all
right so after this only both of these
processes will start execution one more
thing you need to do is join so what
join will do is it will wait until the
execution of these processes is or and
after that you are printing a done
statement okay so that you know that you
are done with both of these processes
okay now if you notice this syntax it's
quite similar to multi-threading
so in multi-threading you import a
multi-threading module and you created
thread and even threads have start and
join call so if you are already familiar
with are threading multi-threading
Python then learning multi processing
will be very easy in terms of syntax
core syntax at least okay so let's
execute this program
excellent so it printed square and cube
of these numbers all right now all of
these activities happen under two
different processes okay now if you want
to see these processes into your windows
task manager then you need to introduce
some delay here so that we can see those
processes while they are still executing
so I am going to just add some delay to
make these functions execute little
slower and then we'll open windows task
manager okay so I just started the
execution and you will see this thing
being printed here so while it is
printing open the windows task manager
go to details tab and search for Python
so here you see these three processes
one two three one is for the parent
program which is the main program and
then there are two processes for p1 and
p2 now they went away because the
execution is complete when you are doing
multi-threading you don't see the
processes like this okay so that's the
difference okay so far so good now
instead of printing the result let's
store the result in a global variable
okay so Square result and to keep things
simple I am going to create only one
process okay so let me remove the second
process here
all right so I'm reviewing second
process so I have now only one process
and I am now going to store the result
into this global variable and I'm going
to call okay so I am and star an okay
and I need to define this as a global so
that it recognizes that it's a global
variable and once this is done I'm going
to print the result here okay
so let's execute this and see what
happens okay I need to remove delay all
right executing it all right interesting
so result it says it has no elements
into the array now we already see it
calculated the square number so why is
this blank just think for a moment why
is it blank
shouldn't it be all these numbers for
960 481 no it won't be like that because
our when you create a new process what
happens is it will create a new copy of
square result global variable every
process has their own address space so
this process p1 here will copy the
global state and create its own address
space so that the cop the copy of square
result is different and the result
doesn't flow back to this clickable
variable basically so if you print the
same thing within a process then it will
work so here I am going to say
within a process result so you can see
that within a process it has the result
or side process it doesn't have a result
alright so this is the key difference
between multi processing and multi
threading if you were using multi
threading you will see the square result
being filled with all the square numbers
here okay so that's the main difference
okay so in this tutorial we just covered
very very basic concepts about multi
processing we have lot more to cover
like logs mutex inter process
communication methods such as queue and
pipe all of those will be covered in the
future tutorial all right
until then please don't forget to
subscribe share and comment on this
tutorial alright thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
