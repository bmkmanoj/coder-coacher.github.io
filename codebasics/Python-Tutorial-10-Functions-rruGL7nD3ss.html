session of learn Python language today
we are going to talk about functions in
Python and here is the list of topics
that we are going to cover in this video
okay so let's begin with function
introduction functions are nothing but a
block of code that performs a specific
task think about them as being a
dishwasher so the way this washer works
is you give dirty dishes as an input to
the dishwasher when you press the button
internally it will perform some tasks
such as adding detergent and water
cleaning the dishes and then drying them
out in the end what you get is clean
dishes as an output so functions are
also similar they take something as an
input then depending on what kind of
code you write within a function it will
perform some tasks and in the end you
get something else back as an output now
why functions are needed functions makes
your code more modular and more readable
let me explain this by giving a
real-life example so if you have two
lists and you want to perform summation
of these two individual lists how do you
do that if you are not using functions I
am going to initialize or these two
lists and I'm just going to call these
two lists as Tom's expense lists and
Joe's expense lists so these are the
expense lists from two different people
and what we are trying to do here is
find the total of each individual list
ok so without using the functions what
you will do is you will create a
variable called total and then you will
write a for loop
to go or each of these items and in the
end your will print a total I'm just
copying and pasting the code from a
different document just to save time on
recording so here what you just did is
you went over each of the items from
Tom's expense list and you added it to
this variable okay now to find our total
of Jews expense list you will do the
same thing so I will just copy paste
this code and I will replace this guy
with Joe's expense list because the
second thing you are doing is printing
the at list of total list total expense
of Joe's list and you will say these are
total expenses incurred by Joe okay
let's run the program
excellent so when you ran it you got the
total expenses from for both the people
the problem with this code is that you
are repeating these three lines of code
at two places imagine if you had 100
such list you will have to repeat these
three lines 100 times and that's very
cumbersome we can encapsulate this
particular code into a function so now
let me write the same code using a
function so I am going to remove this
thing here we will still keep our list
and I will start writing a function so
the way you write the function is first
you type de f li f is a special keyword
that tells python that i am going to
write a function so calculate total is
the function name and exp is
in put here you will create local
variable called total and you will I
trip through the items in exp and by the
way these lists we are when we call this
function we are going to pass these two
lists as an input so exp variable will
have a list here you will say total
equal to total of items in the end you
will return a total okay at the way you
call this function is you create another
variable called Tom's total and you call
this function with Tom's list as an
input then for juice total you create
one more variable called juice total and
your game call this function calculate
total and you pass juice expense list as
an input now it's the time to print the
total
so Tom's total X this is Tom's total and
I can just copy paste this code and I
can say juice total expenses is juice
total okay let me run it and see what
happens excellent I got the same result
okay now let me explain the way this
worked is when you call calculate total
here by passing this list as an input
what happens is this list gets past or
into exp exp is a local variable for
this function okay and this much is a
function body and the body of the
function is defined by this indentation
you see this extra tab here so whenever
that ends or whenever you to turn the
function Borak body will end here you
will perform some operations you will
create a local variable you will write
it to the items and in the end you will
return so this thing total here is
called a return value and you return a
value from a function by using using
this return keyword okay so these are
the basic components to remember number
one is a function argument number two is
a function a return value and this whole
thing is called function okay so if you
compare with this again with a
dishwasher example just imagine this is
a dishwasher then this is an input to
the dishwasher visit which is your dirty
dishes and these three lines is the set
of steps that dishwasher is performing
why adding water and detergent watching
this is trying them out trying them out
etcetera in the end this return
statement returns you the clean dishes
which is an output okay
so that was a quick comparison with a
dishwasher now let's work on another
example and this one is going to be very
very simple lesson you want to do sum of
two numbers you can do it using a
function so I can write a function let
me erase the score I can write one more
function call sum and a comma B so a and
B are the arguments to this function
here you create a local variable total
equal to zero
and a rather total equal to a plus B and
you can just return return total okay
and you can say is some five and six
okay now tell me what will be the output
of this program so when I run it as you
all expect I am going to get 11 because
5 plus 6 is 11 what happened here is let
me debug the program and let and then
I'll explain how it worked I will put a
breakpoint and do these two places I
will say debug okay and I will say okay
next so it first define a function it we
have not called the function yet that's
why it didn't go here okay we are
calling function here so when you say go
inside the function let me see which one
this one is tap into so stab into next
as you see here a has value Phi and B
has value 6
whatever you pass from here this guy
will get those values and when you say
next
total is 11 and now we are returning
this total so this total will now get
placed into this and variable next so as
you see and still doesn't have any value
when you said next at that time n gets
11
okay if you check console we got total
11 now the way we are passing function
arguments here is by order so if you
want to pass something in a you put that
value here as a first value and B you
put that as a second value let me print
those values here I will say print a is
a let me just copy a couple of time B is
my B also total before returning so my
total is total okay let me run it so if
I run it is 5 is 6 total is 11 and total
inside function inside function this is
total outside okay now what if I want to
pass B first and then yes second so you
can use something as something called
named arguments so if you say D
explicitly say B equal to 5 and equal to
6 what's gonna happen is then it will
not go by order these are called named
arguments and the other ones were not
they're not named arguments they were
basically using the order lets on this
voila
so a a 6 B is 5 if you have long list of
arguments and you want to be specific
about which argument has which value you
can use these named arguments otherwise
you can just use plain order cool okay
next item is global versus local
variables so until now all these
variables that we created here a
total these are local to this function
if you try to access this variable here
for example let me print total so we
have defined total variable here and all
I'm trying to do is print total but you
see this red line it says okay let me
run it it says name error name total is
not defined which means total is not
visible outside the function body total
is only visible inside the function body
and my function body is this much okay
so what happens if I have one more
variable called total outside if I have
total equal to zero and if I say total
outside the function is total okay let's
see what happens total zero here and
here we assigned a plus B value we are
printing total inside the function and
then also at the function let's run it
great so total inside the function was
11 but outside it is zero so you see
this variable and this variable although
their names are different their names
are same their values are different
because do variables essentially are
different this one is called a global
variable because it is outside any
function it can be accessed anywhere
this one we created locally so it is a
local variable okay let's now talk about
default arguments I will just revert
this back to what it was originally here
we are passing two arguments to the
function what if I don't want to pass
the second argument if you don't want to
pass the second argument and if you run
the program it won't run because it will
say it is missing the argument okay but
sometimes you may have a default value
for the second argument so I'm making an
assumption in my code that if my
function caller doesn't pass me an
argument
assume it to be zero so when you say
this inside elephants function argument
when you assign a specific argument of
value that becomes a default value for
that argument so now if you run it it
will work fine what this is saying is if
you don't pass me the second argument
then I'm going to assume it to be zero
but hey you are free to pass the second
argument if you pass this imagine what's
gonna happen it's not gonna make that
zero let me run it and prove it
excellent so you see here B is 8 and
this didn't have any effect so this will
have any effect only if you don't pass
the argument okay we want to conclude
our session by covering document strings
a real fast document listen strings are
nothing but a way to document your
function this function was very simple
it was just doing a sum of two numbers
but you might have a big complicated
function in that case you want to write
some documentation to explain the color
of that function on what that function
is doing what does it expect as an input
and what does it expect as an output so
the way you write documentation string
is you use triple quotes like this and
by default py charm is giving these
default documentation but if you're not
using py charm if you have is an either
or something you have to manually type
all these things in okay so let me just
remove these things and manually type it
in so this function takes two arguments
which are integer numbers
and it will return some of them as an
output so when you do this if someone is
calling your function if he reads these
lines he will he will get an idea on
what this function is doing so this is
called a documentation strings and it is
a multi-line strings started and ended
with triple quotes all right we cover
pretty much everything about functions
don't forget to work on these sample
exercises at the end of my every video I
give these sample exercises too for you
to work upon and these are extremely
useful and it will help you a lot in
your learning thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
