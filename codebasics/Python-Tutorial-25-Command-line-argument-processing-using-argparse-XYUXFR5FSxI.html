doing great and you're having fun
learning Python programming you might
have realized at this point that
white-owned programming is extremely
easy to learn so anyone can call it's
not a rocket science at all in today's
tutorial we are going to see how you can
process command-line arguments using arc
pass module now processing command-line
arguments in any programming language is
considered of as very very basic thing
so you need to have a knowledge on how
to process command lines okay so let's
start tutorial I'm going to import the
arc path module and here I am going to
say parser is equal to our past dot
argument parcel and is equal to parcel
dot parse arcs now if you run this
program so I just am going to save this
and I'm in the same directory where this
pattern file resides and if I run this
program Python and by the way this is
how you run your Python program use a
Python space the name of your lot py
file which is your Python file when you
run this nothing happens because the
program has nothing it it it is just
initializing the parser and it is trying
to pass the arguments now by default you
get minus H argument minus H means help
so when you do this this thing is coming
from our bars module from here so by
default you get this H come on and it is
saying that you're having optional
argument for help
now let's pass some real arguments there
are two kinds of arguments that are
passed support positional argument and
optional arguments we are going to first
look at positional arguments so what you
do here is you have initialized the
object of this parser class argument
parser class and using this parcel as
you are going to add an argument now
what argument is this API is going to do
is it's going to add that argument to
your program when you run it using a
command line okay so this is how you do
it so you will say air argument first
parameter is the name of the argument
and the second parameter is the help
so this is like first number and the
program that we are writing is basically
you want to have a program that takes
two numbers as an input and an operation
so the operation could be either
addition subtraction or multiplication
or you need to give two numbers and the
type of operation that you want to
perform and the program should return
the result based on your inputs okay so
that's what we are doing so we are
having first number we are having a
second number post number second number
number two and then we will have parser
dog all right
argument for operation so this is the
type of operation that you want to
supply okay now once this is how you add
arguments to your parcel and once you
pass the arguments you get this object
back which has the value of arguments
which user has passed a using command
line so now you can actually access arch
number one so I'm going to just print
our best actor number one and then I
will print arcs dot number two and then
I will print arcs dot operation okay
let's see what happens when we run this
program so here let me uh so let me open
this on the side
okay
all right so here when I run this
program you see in the help now it is
showing me this nice help on how a user
can run this program okay so number one
number two on operation so it is just
showing me the format in which I should
run this our pass tutorial dot P Y file
ok so now I know that I have to pass
number one number two and operation so
what I will do is now I will actually
execute this program so my number one is
listed for my number two is less than 5
and my operation is this ad when I do
that you see that this four went into
basket number one 500 number two and
operation is in here that's what it
printed ok ok now we are going to
actually perform the operation so I will
say if AG start operation is equal to ad
then now before we do that remember that
whenever you pass an input using command
line it always comes back to program as
a string so you need to convert it into
integer integer is basically number so
our code number one is a string so
whatever for you are passing here will
be a string and I am going to converting
it to a number okay and same thing for
our second number and here I am going to
initialize our result object to none now
if the operation is ahead obviously you
use + operator to perform your operation
and if operation is equal to subtract
then you will do N 1 minus n 2 if
operation is multiplied then you will do
1 in 2 and 2 and in the end you're
printing a result ok so I think it's
pretty straight for here you are
checking what type of operation user has
requested and based on that you are
performing the operation and printing
the result so now let's run the program
so you see like 4 and 5 input ad is your
operation and 9 is your result you can
make it more clear by the same
that result is result so it will be
little bit more clear okay you can also
say subtract suspect and the result is
minus 1 you can also try multiply so the
benefit of using command-line argument
is that using these arguments program
can process any kind of input now let's
see what if you don't supply all the
arguments let's say I am supplying
number 1 and number 2 but I am not
supplying your operation when you do
that it will show you this adder so you
must supply all the three arguments so
whenever using positional arguments they
are mandatory you cannot skip it so what
if I want to skip some arguments and I
want to get some more clarity when onto
arguments like how to pass the arguments
or in order to do that you have to use
optional argument now the way you pass
optional argument is this are you will
here instead of just typing in a number
you will say - - number - my upgrade
number - that's it once you do this it
will make all the all of these three are
the optional arguments so let's see what
happens now
so here before I do anything let me add
one more statement if less a user does
not supply add subtract or multiply and
he let's say he supply something else
you want to print unsupported on the
portal operation right okay cool
now we just don't converted these to
optional argument by putting our two
hyphens here and let's see what happens
now if you don't supply third argument
so I have first second and third when
you do that first of all it is look at
the usage in the usage it is saying that
this is how you should pass your
arguments okay so the correct way now
for passing the arguments will be this -
- number one - - number two - -
operation equal
using optional arguments one benefit you
get is you get a clarity on which
argument you're passing fight so here
it's sort of like key value pair so this
is your key this is your bad look this
is your key this is a your value and
these are now not fixed arguments you
can change the order for example I can
pass number two towards the end and will
still work so if I say number two is
five
it still works so it doesn't it doesn't
have any fixed position now that's one
benefit second benefit is of course you
have a key so if someone is running your
program you know what you're passing for
example here in the positional argument
I just pass four and five but I don't
really know what is four what is five
verses here I know four will be treated
as number one five will be treated as
number two and add is actually an
operation okay all right now let's look
at the help how the help looks so when
it's minus H it shows this help and
these are all optional arguments
previously when we printed help
there were positional arguments so with
optional argument now first let me clear
this with optional argument you can
actually skip your arguments so if you
skip let's say operation I'm supplying
only number one and number two I know
I'm not supplying operation it will
still work so our paths module will now
stop you but it will eventually come
here it will charge check for the
operation and operation is none actually
this is not here so that's why it is
going into this tray what if if you like
the format this format of passing
arguments and you still want to restrict
user to certain kind of operation in our
program we only support ad
direct and multiplication three
operations so I want to now restrict
user from on not entering any values
other than add subtract and multiply
right now he can enter any value that he
likes for example he can say Oh - -
operation is super - division now we
don't support division so I made a
mistake so okay so here it says
unsupported operation which is fine but
we are handling that in our code what if
you want to restrict user from here
itself you don't want to go through the
core because now here if I have to
handle that condition right so if I
better don't handle this condition for
example then it's gonna print result
none and I will have no idea why result
is none I ask the program to do division
right so our past modules have a
facility to restrict the choices of
command line input and the way you do it
is by typing comma and here you will
specify your choices I'm going to
specify my choices
and my choices is going to be add
subtract and
multiply okay so now for my third
argument which is operation user can
only enter these three if he doesn't
enter these three it will just fail
right here okay it won't go beyond this
point so let's see okay now again I am
supplying division and when I hit enter
see here right at the time of passing it
fail it says invalid choice division
choose from add subtract or multiply
okay so this is what you should use
whenever you want to you eristic user
form or and not enter in any specific
argument okay
now until now we were running the
program from this Windows command prompt
or what if you want to run program from
here from py charm P which in division
when you execute a program you can
actually model specifies the arguments
so for that click on run go to edit
configuration here it is saying I am
executing this py file and here I can
specify my arguments but here I can say
number one is ten number two is the set
by operation is add okay when I do that
and when I run the program it works see
it took ten and files and input address
operation and the result is 15 so this
is how you pass the argument just in
case if you want to let's say debug the
program so for example I just quickly
show you
how dude about this so here yeah just
put in a break point as usual click on
this bug icon and it will start
debugging and once you have that you see
like args name space is this and then
you go to next next statement and if you
look at your args parameter here you see
number one is ten five and operation and
you see like number 10 is actually
integer type and that's the reason why
we were doing this integer conversion
right here so next next and n1 and n2 is
10 10 and 5 and you see so 10 + 5 + 1 +
2 and since operation is add it went to
here and it printed the result okay so
in the console here you have the result
so this is how you debug your
command-line argument program using py
jump ok friends that was all about
argument parsing I hope this was useful
remember I pass is a most common way of
paths passing arguments there are other
ways but I recommend using this way ok
