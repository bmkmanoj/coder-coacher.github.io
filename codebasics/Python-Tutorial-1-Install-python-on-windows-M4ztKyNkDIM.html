Python 3.5 on Windows for this go to
python.org website on that click on
downloads button now we are going to
install python 3.5 if you are interested
in installing previous version so just
two point seven point eleven or any of
the previous version which are listed
here you can click on the corresponding
download button but will install python
3.5 click here it will download the
setup file if you are using Firefox or
Internet Explorer it will show it in a
different location but you will figure
it out so click on setup file on this
click add python 3.5 to path this check
box it's very important I will tell you
why customized installation I am going
to install it for all users which will
install it to this location stall will
take few minutes this Python got
installed successfully you can verify it
by running idle and Windows command
prompt
so here I have Windows 10 if you are
Windows 8 or 7 user then click on start
button and there will be edit box here
it says search program and files but I
have the same thing here so type in I D
L II click on this this shows you the
Python shell which allows you to write
Python programs now if your phones are
very small here you can increase the
font size by going to options configure
idle and increase the font size whatever
is your preference to select the size
and say ok
now let's start writing our first Python
program so we can use Python as a simple
calculator as you see it here or you can
just print any statement so I will just
say yay I installed Python today and it
will print that so for beginners it's
Idol is pretty useful it allows you to
write simple Python programs we will
learn how to use another sophisticated
editor for writing big Python programs
but idle is good for now you can also
verify Python installation by going to
Windows command prompt so type in CMD
and here type Python so this is showing
you the same shell as idle so for
example you can do the same thing that
you are able to do it in idle but idle
is much better because it does the
syntax highlighting you see like print
is highlighted in a different color
because print is a spatial keyword in
Python it also has some other cool
features so always use idle now on
Windows sometimes if you are typing
Python and if it doesn't recognize the
command then it means it is not present
in your system path so for example when
I typing path here you see like python
installation directory is present here
if it is not present in your case then
go to environment variables and choose
added the system environment variables
and here click on environment variables
and after that locate path click add it
and here you can manually at the
beginning let's say if I didn't have
this directory then I would just add it
at the beginning followed by a semicolon
and
okay after that this should be able to
recognize the Python come on
okay thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
