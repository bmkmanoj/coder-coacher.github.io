session of core basics coding tutorial
today we are going to talk about modules
in Python and here are the list of
topics we are covering today okay let's
begin with the introduction on modules
in our day to day life we use many
devices and tools created by other
people for example computer car and
calculator these are the devices created
or invented by other people but once
they are invented we can use it this
whole idea about reusing something
applies to programming world as well in
Python modules is a way to reuse a code
returned by someone else think about a
calculator if you want to write a code
that does basic mathematical operation
you can write little functions to find
out those operations for example if you
want to find out a square root of a
function square root of a number or
power etc you can write your own little
functions but if someone else has
already done that
why bother and the best part about
Python is you can use those modules for
free you don't have to pay anything let
me give you an example of math module if
you want to use math module you will
have to import it using import command
so you say import math this imports this
math module which is written by someone
else
local into your code now if you want to
call a function call square root so
let's say you're finding a square root
of number 16 you
do this similarly now you want to find
out do this to power of four how do I
know all the functions which are present
in math module you can use dir command
for this dir bracket math this is giving
you all the functions which are
available in math module another way of
finding all this function is just to
simply google it so if you have your
browser open you can just type in Python
3 Matt module I'm using Python 3 wasn't
that's why I said Python 3 and the first
link that opens is providing you help on
math module you can see the description
here and below it is listing all the
functions which are available in this
module so you can read through this help
and you can use any of these functions
we just use math dot power functions ok
let let's cover some a few more
functions in math model if you want to
look at the value of pi and you can just
see math dot pi let's find out the log
of number 102 the base 10 and that's two
nice how about thousand and guess yep
let's see
you can also find floor and ceiling of
numbers using math dot floor
and for the same thing if you say mantle
sailing it will give you three okay
now let's cover another module called
calendar again to import any module you
have to type in import command followed
by module name I just imported calendar
module now I want to print calendar of
2016 a month of January so you will say
Cal equal to calendar 2016 is the year
one is a month enter this is saying
module object is not callable okay I
made a mistake what I should have said
is calendar dot month because I am
printing a calendar of a month and when
you slip current Cal nice so it just
printed the calendar of January 2016 now
I'm not sure if this year is a leap year
or not
well calendar can give you the answer
you can use ease lift come on and say
2016 it is saying true if
and now let me see if last year was a
leap year or not
it wasn't again you can use dir command
to look at all the functions which are
available in calendar module as you
notice we used these live function and
that function should be here somewhere
here it is okay now how do you find a
list of all the Python modules available
for use again Google is your friend
you'll just say Python 3.5 modules list
and the first link that opens if you
click on it this is giving you all the
models available for use in alphabetical
order so you can look at em and here is
the math one that we used so there are
tons of modules and these are by the way
all the standard modules that comes with
us standard Python installation other
than these modules there are many more
third-party modules available for use
but for for to use them you have to
import and you have to download those
modules okay but what if I have a custom
need and I want to ride my own module
well that's possible I will demonstrate
that using py charm editor here so let
me just bring in my py charm okay here
what I have done is I have returned a
simple Python functions dot py file with
two simple functions so let's say I am
creating a Python model which calculates
an area of a triangle and a square I
wrote all these two functions now I have
my main program here which is my my
program dot py and from in this file I
want to import functions not py as
a module you can just simply say import
functions
the reason it is importing it is because
it is at the same level it is in the
same code directory you see here C code
lon Python these two files are in the
same directory that's why you can easily
import here and you can just say
functions dot and it is in the
autocomplete is showing me those two
functions so let's say I want to
calculate the area of a square whose
length is 5 if I run this I didn't see
anything because I didn't printed it so
I will say area print media okay if I
run it I see 25 okay you can also import
there's another way of importing model
basically you can say import functions
as something right so you can say import
functions as f and then you can use F
dot calculate area if you don't want to
type functions every time and it will
still work
now what if this functions dot py file
is not in the same directory so let's go
here this is my code directory where i
have my files functions and my program
right now they are in the same directory
that's why it's easy to import if I put
functions into a subdirectory which is a
modules so what I just did is I moved
that file to a subdirectory on the same
level which is modules and if I look at
here now you see like there is a modules
subdirectory and functions is inside it
and that's why now it is not recognizing
functions if I try to run it it will say
no more dual name functions because it
is looking in the same directory and it
is it is not finding anything with a
name function so what you have to do is
you have to provide a subdirectory name
so you say ma Douce dot functions so
module start functions as f and if you
run that this is now going to work all
right what if this functions not py is
not in a subdirectory it is just totally
somewhere else ok so let me move
functions will provide from here to
co-direct ok
so now this thing is gone alright if you
want this to work then you will have to
use a system bath so in your system part
you have to add a path of your C code
directory and in order to do that you
use a system or do you will say import
sis and sis dot bath dot append what
this is doing is it is taking a system
part and it is appending appending a new
directory location that you're just
going to type here so what I'm saying is
add C code directory to my system path
because my functions not py is in C code
directory here okay after doing that you
can say import functions as F now let me
run it okay it is working you can change
the number here and it will just work
okay you can even calculate an area of a
triangle but you can just say F dot
calculate the area of a triangle was
this calculate Triangle area you provide
your base and hide and you run it and
it's going to say 25 okay so just to
summarize we looked at three different
ways of importing function modules where
the function model that you're importing
is at different locations okay that was
all about models in Python thanks for
