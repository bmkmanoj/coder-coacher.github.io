coding tutorial in this tutorial I am
going to show you how to share data
between two processes using multi
processing queue in Python now before we
go into details about queue let's first
understand what kind of problem it tries
to solve if you know the fundamentals of
multi processing then you are already
aware that multiple processes have their
own address space they don't share the
address space that results into a
problem like this here in my main
program I am creating another process
which just goes through this list of
numbers here you can see that and it is
it is calculating the square of those
numbers and appending it to this global
variable called result after that it
print the result inside this function
which is process number two and process
number one is this which is a parent
process once I am done printing it Here
I am going to print the result outside
when I run this program what happens is
inside the process if the result looks
good but outside the process the same
global variable is blank
now if you have already watched my
tutorial on multi processing then you
only know that when result global
variable gets copied to this another
process address space it creates its own
copy hence the result is separate so
whenever you want to communicate between
two processes or shared data you need to
use one of the technique shown in this
diagram as you can see in this diagram
process one process to have their own
address spaces and whenever they want
reaction data they use either common
file or shared memory or a message pipe
queue is basically shared memory okay
I'm going to now use queue or to store
the result
of calculate square function first let's
create a queue variable using Perl
multi-processing queue class so you will
import multi-processing module first and
then you will say multi processing dot Q
now queue will be passed to calculate
square function here I get Q and let me
remove a result because we are not going
to use it its anyway not working for us
Q has a method called put now if you
have studied data structures this is the
queue data structure which is first in
first out data structure where you
insert data at the end of the queue and
you pull the data from the front of the
queue here I am just inserting data at
the end of the queue right let me remove
this and here after my process is done
I'm going to check while Q dot empty
queue dot empty is a method which will
tell you if queue is empty or not is not
false while Q dot empty is not false
print Q dot gap what I am doing here is
I am just iterating through queue and I
am getting elements one by one from the
front of the queue and printing them
let's execute this program
hmm it didn't print anything looks like
a hernia
oh I see this should not be is not false
is false because as long as Q dot empty
is false you want to I trait and you
want to print the result
excellent I get my result so I have 235
and that square numbers are for 925 okay
so this is working as you can see here Q
is used to share the data between two
processes process number one is your
parent process process number two is
your child process which is essentially
your calculate square function Q is
extremely useful whenever it comes to
multi processing in Python or any other
programming language one thing you need
to keep in mind in Python is that python
has a module called q and q module is
different than multi processing Q so
here I have the difference between the
two multiprocessing Q in order to use
that you will say multi processing dot Q
versus for the Q module you will import
Q module and then you will say Q dot Q
other difference is multi processing Q
is used to share data between processes
where whereas Q module is used to share
data between the threats so these are
the two key differences okay that was
all about pew and Python I hope you guys
are having fun learning multi processing
in Python or Python in general if you
have any questions commands please feel
