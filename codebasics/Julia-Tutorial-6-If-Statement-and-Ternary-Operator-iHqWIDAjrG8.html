tutorial
today's topic is if statement and
ternary operator in julia if you some
programming experience you are already
familiar with if statement what it does
is it evaluates the condition then
executes a certain block of code so for
example here i have this variable which
i have initialized with a - value
negative value and i want to know if
this number is a positive number or
negative number in order to figure out
that i will use if statements I will say
if X is less than 0 then print it is
negative else print that is it is
positive
remember in julia to end the if-else you
have to put and keyword here okay if i
execute this this is saying negative it
gave me this deprecation warning because
of this extra space if i executed clean
using this play better it will tell me
that the number x is negative now if i
change this number to a positive number
and again execute using the play button
and again execute this guy now it is
saying it is a positive number
here we are using if and else which
means if it satisfies this condition
then it will execute this particular
code block otherwise it will execute
this line sometimes you might have
multiple if condition for example this
code is not complete you want to check
for zero as well in that case you will
say else if X greater than zero then
print positive so this one is positive
number and the last one is else then
print zero okay and let me make this one
zero so if I execute this again and
again this will be zero okay if I make
it positive it's gonna be positive and
make it negative it's gonna be negative
that's quite simple
okay now you can do the same thing using
our ternary operator as well if
condition is typically used when you
have bigger block of code to execute
here our code is very simple we are
checking some condition we're just
printing a statement so the same thing I
can do using ternary operator so I can
say print
X less than zero question mark so here
the first thing is your condition the
second thing is a question mark which
means is X less than 0 if it is then it
means it's a negative number and the
else condition will be separated using a
column column you're saved positive and
if you execute this it says it's a
negative number if you make it positive
it's gonna say it's positive in ternary
operator you can write next a ternary
operator so you can enclose this
particular condition in a bracket and
you can check for 0 as well so you will
say X is greater than if X is greater
than 0 then it is positive otherwise it
is 0
so you can do this thing and if you
execute right now it is saying positive
because my X is a positive number if I
make it 0 it is going to say it is 0 so
there was a nice quick introduction on F
and ternary operator thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
