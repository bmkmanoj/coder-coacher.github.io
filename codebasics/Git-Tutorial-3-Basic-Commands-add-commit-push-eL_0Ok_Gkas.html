going to learn some basic gate commands
so if you have already taken my gate
tutorial on what is version control
system and what is github you should
already be familiar with some of the
basic concept of version control system
in this tutorial we are going to create
a new github repository and we are going
to add some code or while learning the
basic git commands so to create a github
repository first of all you need to go
to github.com and you need to create an
account I already have an account so I
am law already logged in as a loan P
user into github comm so I already have
one repository called py I am going to
create a new repository I am just going
to call it test taste repository and by
default with a free account your
repository need to be a public if you
want to make a private repo so that no
one else can see it then that option
comes under a paid account so I'm just
going to make a public repository which
anyone can see I'm also going to
initialize it with a readme file
typically when you write any code you
always have readme file explaining what
that code is about so I'm just going to
add that when I click on create
repository button it is creating an
empty repository me a repository or with
a readme dot MD file so if you open this
file it just tastes repo if you want to
edit it you can edit it in say test repo
for git commands demonstration and if
you commit
it will come at it okay now github.com
is a cloud storage it is a remote server
so I already created a new repository
how do I sync that up to my local
computer for this you need to have a git
bash installed so if you type in and get
bash here if you click on it you will
get this now I already have a tutorial
on how to install git so when installed
basically a good you get this get best
installed so you can open it up on now I
am in C code directory here what I'm
going to do is are just clone this
repository cloning the repository me
means copying repository from github to
your local computer so for cloning you
go here clone and just copy this link so
if you click here it's going to copy
this link and then the first command
that we are going to type is git clone
and then you will copy paste the
repository URL when you do that it is
just cloning it on your local computer
so when I do now LS I will see that now
I have this taste directory here so I
will go into test directory let me just
clear this out and when I do LS I got a
readme file so that's the only file we
have okay now the command that you will
use often with git is git status when
you do git status it is showing that you
don't have any changes in your
repository it's totally empty and clean
okay now we are going to add our first
python file so let's open py charm
editor here and here I have
ah see code test directory open so I'm
adding a new Python file and we are
going to make a program called hungry so
here in this program you are basically
asking if you are hungry or not and you
get some responses so just a simple fun
program so the first line I will write
here is I am hungry okay and usually
when you write code you create a new
file you write code you execute it you
make sure it works okay yes it is me
working okay it is printing whatever it
is supposed to print and then you add
your file to your version control system
so now I have my code ready let me go
back to git bash here and here I'm going
to say get status when I do get status I
get these two file dot ID or hungry dot
idea is a directory that is created by
py chump so you can just ignore it but
here it says that git add file name to
include what will be committed
so in get whenever you are adding a new
file you need to add it to something
called a staging area staging area is
the area or which contains the files
that you are ready to commit commit
means ready to push to your version
control system okay so I will say my
second command is git add hungry dot py
so when you run this command what
happens is now if you run git status
this file now shows as green which means
it is in my staging area now whenever I
I've earned the next c'mon called git
commit so git commit is now taking the
files from staging area which means
these files it will not take this file
this directory and it will just commit
it locally
okay so now git commit command takes
minus M as an option and M means a
message so I'm just saying first version
of hungry code okay so when you say get
commit now you have committed your
change into your local version control
system
remember when you run git commit comma
command R you are not still pushing it
to github which is your remote cloud the
core still resides on your local
computer git status okay so okay so it
is in local version control database it
is not still on a remote server server
so if you run now the next command that
you want to learn is git log git log
will show you the log of all your commit
history
so when you say git log you'll see first
version of hungry code and this is the
commit ID oh and these are the two
initial commits okay now let me clear
the console so when Evan get status here
now I don't have anything in my staging
area whatever changes I made they are
committed okay so the first just to
revise the points are the first thing
was git add that adds files to staging
area next thing is git commit that
commits your code to local version
control database okay now the third
command is now I'm ready to push my code
to github so you just run git push o so
git push will now push my code to my
github so let me check what happened on
github so this is my github repo I only
see readme dot MD file now let me just
refresh it so once i refresh it
ah-ha here I see the new file hungry dot
py so if you open it to see what our
code I wrote now it is on the cloud so
that now if I log in from some other
machine
or some remote place I can still get
this code back I don't have to rely on
my local computer to access this code
alright or so now here in the if you
click on this it will show you the
commit log so our history is we
basically created the empty repository
then we added read me dot MD file and
then we added our first of Python file
hungry dot py ok so uh now what I'm
going to do is I'm going to make some
more changes into my Python file ok so I
will say my hungry flag is are you
hungry
so my program is now asking question if
you are hungry or not and if you are
hungry I will say and eat samosa samosa
is a very delicious Indian food it's
fired it's not healthy but you can't
resist to eat that because of its taste
now if you only ate some also if you are
not hungry then do your homework ok I'm
going to run this program just to make
sure it works ok ok when you say yes it
is saying eat samosa when you say no it
is saying do your homework alright my
code is now ready ah
so the next thing you do is you already
have a file so again you'll be running
git status come on a lot so I'm seeing
again hungry dot py is modified so I
need to add
to my staging area okay
and when I do get status it says it is
in the staging area
green means it is in the staging area
now I will run git diff tool so git diff
tool is a command that allows you to see
the difference between whatever code you
have previously versus whatever code you
have right now okay so you would say git
diff tool head will go or a concept of
head later on but just for the
simplicity you just run this command and
it allows you to see the difference
between your previous version of the
file and the current version when I do
this it's going to open this diff so
here previously I had this is my
previous file this is my new file so
previously I had just one print
statement and now I have this whole core
okay so you just see the difference you
make sure things looks okay and then
what you do is you are going to get push
oh sorry we missed git commit actually
so we'll say git commit are added hungry
prompt so you write a meaningful message
or to mention what that change is about
okay so once you committed you are ready
to push and when you push it it will go
again
upstream so again let me refresh so I
click on refresh button now instead of
three commits I have four commits if I
click here it will show my latest commit
you know it says committed 20 seconds
ago okay now it if on the github or
website if I want to see the difference
you just click on this commit ID and
when you do that it will show you the
difference see red means you remove this
line green means you added this line
okay so that was a quick demonstration
of our three basic commands get add git
commit git push now let me show you in a
picture how that actually worked so if
you look at this picture here what
happened is our locally on my computer I
had this working copy which is my local
code and whenever I do git add it moves
that code into a thing called a staging
area staging area means whenever you do
git commit whatever is in staging area
will be committed and whatever is not in
the staging area will not be committed
so if you recall we had a directory
called dot idea
I never added that using git add come on
that's why it never got pushed to github
okay so remember you have to always do
git add so when you do get add you are
adding into a staging area next step is
once you are sure you are ready to
commit
you should get commit come on when you
do that it pushes those changes into a
version database now this version
database is present on local computer or
this whole box is your local computer so
or you are still not pushing it to
remote okay so that's that benefit of
using git it is a distributed version
control system which means it allows you
to track changes locally in your
computer as well as on remote okay so
once you have once you do get commit it
will create version one then you will
again make changes do git add git commit
it will create another version version
to again make changes look it add git
commit version three so you will just
keep on accumulating your changes in
your local version database okay and
whenever you are ready to push the
changes to remove
github repository you will issue get
push command and once you do that as you
have your code in the remote now once it
is in the cloud you can you don't need
to rely on your local computer you can
access that code from any area of the
world as long as you have internet
connection okay so the basic difference
between gate and other version control
systems such as SVN is that SVN doesn't
have this particular box in s3 and all
you do is you make your changes and
directly push to remote versus having
this allows you to track your changes
locally you know it's very powerful
actually and that's the reason why I get
is very popular nowadays alright so that
was all about these three basic commands
now the reason why I'm using command
prompt is that command prompt allows you
are greater flexibility there are many
tools or many IDE is available from
where you can push get come on get cold
you can basically push code to get and
do whatever things we did here you can
do the similar things from that
graphical user interface but I
personally like a command-line interface
because it is very very powerful very
very flex flexible as well okay so in
the beginning you may feel like you're
to type lot of command but it's not that
hard so just stay patient and it should
just work out okay so always use command
prompt I highly recommend it okay so
that was all about gets basic commands
or will learn a few more commands in the
next tutorial thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
