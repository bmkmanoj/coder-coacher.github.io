tutorial in today's session we are going
to learn what is bug and what is
debugging first let's see what is bug
when it comes to software programming or
writing code bug means you wrote a
program or a piece of score that doesn't
behave the way you expected meaning the
program has some kind of fault or error
this is called program having a bug for
example take a look at this example here
you are taking two numbers as an input
and you are just doing sum of these two
numbers and printing it now this program
is written in Python using py charm
editor but really the concept applies to
any program it could be in C++ Java or
any programming language right so if I
run this program here it will first ask
me to enter two number so I enter two
and three and it is saying sum is 23 now
if you just look at the program what it
is doing is it is adding two numbers n1
n2 and in this function all I am doing
is a plus B I am returning that and
that's what we are printing here so if
you just read the program it everything
looks okay so you will wonder what's
wrong with this right so this means this
program has a bug it doesn't behave the
way you expect it to behave so the
process of finding bug and fixing it is
called debugging debug means debug
meaning you are removing bugs from your
program this is similar to fixing
problem with let's say your car you are
driving your car and car has problem and
it's not working or it is making some
weird sound you will take it to a
mechanic and in the garage the mechanic
will open the car he will examine
different parts and do different tests
and he will figure out what is wrong
similarly this programming not behaving
well so I have to
to kind of dig into it analyze the step
of execution and watch all the variables
and all kind of programming states that
are corresponding to that execution and
then eventually figure out what's going
wrong
another real-life example of debugging
is called
let's say you are sick you go to the
doctor and doctor will ask you to do a
blood test so they will take your blood
sample and the blood sample will go to a
laboratory in the laboratory the
technician will examine the blood under
Microsoft microscope he will do various
tests and he will figure out whether you
have a sugar level problem or
cholesterol problem etc so debugging is
similar it's basically using a debugger
you are trying to find a problem or
within a program that is not behaving
well ok so let's examine this program
and find out why it is not behaving the
way you expect it to behave now right
now I am using py charm editor or you
can use microsoft visual studio or
eclipse whatever editor you're familiar
with these are each a circle also called
IDE meanings integrated development
environment which allows you to write
the code as well as debug it ok so here
in py charm I will click on this icon
you see there is a bug icon here so this
means I'm debugging it now before I do
bug it um I have set a breakpoint here
see normally what happens is if you
don't click on this bug and if you
directly run the program it will ask you
for input and it was straight of
executed right so it will just pass
through this line and you will not find
a chance to examine the state of program
carefully so what you want to say
program is you want to say ok when you
come here at this point so these two
things are fine you are just taking
input right so I want to I want program
to stop here so this means break
so this red circle when I click here or
when I press f9 in many of the editors
f9 is a shortcut for setting a
breakpoint breakpoint means when program
reaches here it will stop it will not go
further so let me click on bug icon here
and see what happens okay now here as
you can see the program wait a minute
yes
so the programmed R is asking me to
enter first number so 2 and then at ur
enter 3 ok I have to use their - concept
here like step over and step into
meaning go to the next line or go inside
the function I want to go inside this
add number function and see what's going
on so you use this option
f11 or step in - when you do that it
goes inside the add number function now
here one thing you notice is a and B are
in course meaning their strings okay
also if you go here let me find out the
variable ok I'm going to move this back
to the down because that's more
convenient ok so if you look at the span
here here it says variable a and B so
this panel is variables panel it shows
all the local variables in your function
and 2 &amp;amp; 3 are strings actually now when
I say next you see s is 23 because what
it is doing is it is just adding two
strings together right so that's what
the problem is the problem is that you
are adding two strings instead of adding
two numbers so now what you need to do
is so I'll so now I know what is the
problem the problem is we are not adding
two numbers we are adding two strings
okay so when you say next nature later
spin printing as 23
okay cool so that's why you got the
output of 23 here okay so what I need to
do is I need to convert these two
numbers into integer so when I took it
from the console it they were strings
when I do N 1 is equal to int and 1 what
it is doing is converting a string into
integer then n 2 is equal to int n 2
okay so now so let me again set up a
breakpoint here and see what happens
when I D bug it once I can is asking for
the number 2 so when I enter 2 and 1 you
can see here it is straight still a
string okay until this point N 1 now
good thing about pH I'm debugger is in
the comment section it will show you the
value of that variable when I go to next
now see you see that those quotes are
gone now so now this became a true
number okay now it is asking me for the
second number so now second number is
also string because there is a quote
here when I say next it becomes 3
because of this line okay
integer now when I go inside the
function a and B as you can see here are
integer numbers and when I say next now
s is 5 so when I run it now the sum is 5
so now it's behaving the way I expect it
to behave so I just found a bug in the
code and fixed it
ok that was all about what is bug and
debugging thank you very much for watch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
