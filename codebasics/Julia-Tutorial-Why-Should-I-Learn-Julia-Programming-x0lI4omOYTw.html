tutorial today we are going to talk
about this new programming language
called Julia it's a new language that's
making a lot of buzz nowadays and it is
invented by some of the brilliant people
at MIT so the first question that comes
to anyone's - there are so many
languages out there in the world why do
I need to learn yet another programming
language well that's a good question and
one line answer to that question is
Julia combines pythons convenience with
this performance and I don't mean Python
and see literally what I really mean is
it combines convenience of dynamic
languages with the performance of
statically linked languages now what
people have been doing is whenever they
need execution speed or performance they
will use C because it C code runs crazy
fast but the problem is the code
development time is significantly higher
I have done software development for
last 15 years using C and Python and I
have always found that C code
development is very very slow compared
to that if you are writing code in
Python you are minimum five times faster
so it gives it Python have an age there
whenever whenever it comes to
productivity but the problem is it
suffers from the performance now don't
get me wrong it works reasonably well on
most of the projects but whenever you
want our super fast performance it
sometimes fails
in this kind of situation what people do
is they write their goal initially they
build their building blocks are using a
dynamic language such as Python and
using dynamic language you can always do
fast prototyping now once you have your
code running you identify the slow
running parts of your code and you move
them into compiled language such as C
and Fortran if you are still concerned
about performance you move the slow
running part of your compiled language
code into an assembly language now this
works great but the problem here is the
transition between these layers is
extremely tough the barrier is high you
have to write C extension if you are
writing a code in Python and that takes
considerable amount of time not only
that or you need a programmer who knows
both Python and C in order to work on
this project so this is a big problem it
consumes so much time and it will
increase your budget on your project
Julia breaks this resistance here is the
sample code the first one is a function
written in Julia and you can learn code
underscore native call on it to examine
how the native code looks like and based
on that you can optimize the performance
now all of these you can do within Julia
in a single environment and that's
pretty awesome
Julia comes with all these features I
have listed only few it has many more
features into it but just to quickly go
all these features number one a selling
point for Julia is the performance
similar to see it has a very
sophisticated dynamic type system as
well so your productivity is still high
as high as Python it uses GID
compliation using LLVM compiler
framework and that's one of the reason
why it is very fast other than that it
supports multiple dispatch and it is
designed for parallelism and cloud
computing here are some of the
benchmarking results are taken from our
Julia lang
org website they ran these Bank
benchmarks on some of the basic
functions so just look at this quick
shot so if you're running quick short
here the number 1 means the performance
of C so Julia gives one point one five
which is very similar to see if you
compare that with nap in MATLAB it is
super slow to 64 Python is also slow and
JavaScript and Java are reasonably
faster but still julia clearly wins here
you can go to Judea Len Len Julia Lang
or website and look at the complete
chart for all the benchmarking results
here is the code that I took from Yvonne
Mira's website I like this very much it
says it's poised to do for technical
computing what no dot J's is doing for
web development getting disparate groups
of programmers to go in the same
language with a node dot Cheers
it was the front end designers and the
back end developers with Julia it is the
domain experts and the speed frisch's
that is a major accomplishment
Julia lang all is an official website so
if you are the technical computing
enthusiast who is interested in faster
typing as well as performance then Julia
is definitely a language that you should
check out Thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
