coding tutorial in this tutorial we are
going to see what is get when you ask
this question to anyone the usual answer
you get is get is a version control
system but hey what is version control
system let's look at the problems that
we encounter when you don't use version
control system so let's say you have a
computer and you're writing code on that
computer so the code files are saved
locally on that computer's hard disk but
what if your hard disk crashes or your
computer has some kind of problem in
that case whatever code you have written
is lost second problem is if multiple
people want to contribute to that core
then they cannot do it if it is on one
computer even if it is let's say this
two people have their own computers and
if they want to work on the same code
how do they do that they have to
transfer files using a pen drive from
one computer to another and they have to
do colemar's manually which is quite
cumbersome third problem you have is
there is no tracking of versions so
let's say you have your code it is
working fine and you are making one more
enhancements or you are fixing some bugs
so you made some changes and let's say
it doesn't look good so you want to go
to previous good version of your code
but there is no way if you have your
port on your computer because the simple
file system doesn't give you a version
tracking so you have all these different
issues especially when you are working
on a bigger codebase or a sample project
you will encounter this issues again and
again version control systems sauce all
these problems let's look at all this
problems one by one and see how VCS or
was in control system solves these
issues so first problem was hard disk
failure
in version control system the code is
saved on cloud cloud is basically some
remote machine which is much more stable
than your local computer and it is
guarantees that you will never lose your
core from cloud so you store your code
on the cloud and then you sync the files
to your local computer that way if you
have Hardware problem or some computer
breakdown you can always get your core
back from the cloud so problem number
one fixed problem number two multiple
people contributing to the same codebase
again you have your golden copy of your
4 on the cloud so that these two people
can work on their individual computers
and then whenever they're ready are to
push the changes they will push it to a
cloud now let's say if they are working
on the same function let's say here
there is a function python function left
some and if there they both are making
changes to the same function then there
are more tools available which can help
you resolve the conflict so merging is
pretty easy these two people can work on
their own without worrying about
anything so it's it's very beautiful how
a VCS solves these issues or of
collaboration problem no thiw 3 was
version tracking in version control
system or you have all of your changes
tracked down through different versions
of the same file so let's say you have
this file called food or py which has
some a function calls some and let's say
right now the function looks like this
it just returns a plus B but if you make
some changes later on and if you save it
it will be saved as version number 2 I
was number 3 and so on
so at any given point of time you feel
like I I want to go back to the previous
old version which was
working okay you can do it very easily
now there are different version control
systems available in the market for
example get mercurial subversion etc but
get is by far the best version control
system I will tell you two reasons
number one is it is a distributed
version control system where the version
history is maintained on your local
computer as well as it is maintained on
the cloud so let's say you are in some
area where you don't have internet
internet connection you still have an
ability to try to track the versions are
and whenever you have inter connect
internet connection you can sync it up
with your remote which is your copy in
the cloud the second biggest benefit of
using git is github the most popular
website to host goal is powered by get I
will all about git thank you for
