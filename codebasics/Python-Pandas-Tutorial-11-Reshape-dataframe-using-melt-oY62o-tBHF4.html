about pandas malfunction similar to
PivotTable melt is used to transform or
reshape data I have this excel file here
which contains the weather data of three
different cities each of the columns
here represents the temperature in that
particular city now for your data
analysis purpose you might want to
transform this into this other format
where each of the row is de city and
temperature and this could be useful
based on what kind of analysis you want
to do with your data so I have launched
a Jupiter not book here by running
Jupiter not book command in my terminal
you don't need to necessarily use
Jupiter not book you can use IDE of your
choice you can use idle or pure charm
whatever you like it ok so I launched in
not book and I imported my CSV into a
data frame so my data frame looks like
this and you guys are already familiar
about this core so I don't need to
probably talk about it now I'm going to
jump straight into math functions so the
way you call melt is by using pandas
model so you say PD dot melt and the
argument that it takes is the first
argument is your data frame
now the second argument will be your ID
variables so ID variables is basically
the thing that you want on your x-axis
so here I want day to be there basically
the column that you want to keep intact
you don't want to transform that
particular column that you will keep in
I reverse ok
and then this will return another data
frame ok so I will just call it DF 1
and when I execute it I get my result
you can see that now it transformed this
particular data frame into a format
where my cities are now actually inside
my rows you can see that okay and once
you have this data frame you can now do
a bunch of things you can do like filter
on top of it so you can do for example
df1 let's say variable is equal to
Chicago if you do that you will only get
sick agos weather so let's say if you
want you feel have a huge data file and
you want to filter down your information
base based on particular city then you
can do it easily
once you perform the transformation
using melt okay all right now let me go
back to our original data frame so here
you can see that I have all the cities
now one thing you might have noticed is
the name of the columns are variable in
value and these are like pretty boring
column names actually this should be
City and temperature and you can do that
using another argument right now if you
want to know all the arguments of math
function then just do ponders melt and
that will take you to the documentation
here now you can see that in math one of
the arguments is variable name so
variable name and value name are the two
arguments that we are going to use here
so I will come here and as a variable
name equal to so variable name is
basically this guy here like what's the
name of the variable and what's a value
name alright so I will say city and when
I run it you can see that now instead of
variable I have city here now instead of
value hot here I want to help
temperature for that I will use value
name equal to
temperature and there you go alright
that was all I had about math tutorial
today I have the Jupiter notebook used
in this tutorial in the video
description below so you can always copy
it and play with it I highly recommend
that whenever you are watching tutorial
you also play with this course because
doing coding is the best way to learn it
actually just by watching it you are not
probably going to gain that much so I
highly recommend you use this not book
that I have and just play with it try it
with some different CSV and Excel or
whatever whatever data file you have
with you alright so thank you very much
for watching and I will see you in next
tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
