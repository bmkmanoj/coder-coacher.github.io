what is anaconda and how to install it
anaconda is nothing but a bunch of
Python packages plus a package manager
called Conda now these Python packages
are very popular in data science
communities some of these packages are
numb by Sai pi NL DK scikit-learn
Jupiter etc so if you are having a plain
Python installed on your machine then in
order to install all these packages you
have to run pip and in usually install
these packages versus if you install
anaconda you get all of these in one
shot so it's just a convenience that
anaconda gives you a so I am going to
now install anaconda on Windows you can
go to google and type in download
anaconda and the first link will be from
continuum dot IO which is a company
behind anaconda so you click on it and
then you click on the appropriate OS so
I am going to install it on with those
times clicking on this icon here and
then I will choose files on 3.5 version
they also have Python 2.7 so it's up to
you which one you want to install
I have 64-bit system so I will click
here now this package is pretty big 391
megabyte
so it's going to take few minutes - yo -
wait but I would say it's worth
installing or this big package because
you'll get variety of packages of for
free ok my installation process is about
to begin
as my download just got finished so I
have this downloaded executable the
Installer I will double click on it and
it's pretty straightforward you will
just follow the steps I will install it
for all the users and so on ok so you
will specify your path it's going to
consume one point eight gigabytes and
you
say nationís Nexus and it will install
it Adam okay it got installed
successfully I am going to verify the
installation by opening the command
prompt and here type the command
Kondylis now panda is a package manager
similar to pip that comes with anaconda
now why do we need Conda if you have a
pip which allows you to install Python
modules
well Conda allows you to install non
Python dependencies so with pip you can
only install Python dependencies with
Conda you can install non vitamin
dependencies such as ll v n ok so that's
the benefit of using Conda as a package
manager so quando list will list on all
the packages that we got with our
anaconda installation and you will see
many useful packages so the first one
here is flask it's a wave framework
which is pretty good then you have to
Peter ipython so you hear running
Jupiter not book you get that from there
you have n ldk for national natural
language processing knows for unit
testing you have number over the efecto
useful library for data science numpy
and pandas these two extremely popular
and powerful then you have some of the
sci-fi scikit-learn psychic bond is used
for machine learning sci-fi foresight
diffic community computing SQL alchemy
and so on alright so you got all these
libraries installed now I am going to
quickly verify it by importing them so I
imported Python and I'm going to enforce
I pi ok it did not work here because
looks like I am running an older version
of pythons in my path I have this Python
version which is pointing to I have this
Python command which is pointing to
older version
so I'm going to just directly run from
okay so see Program Files I have an upon
that install here and from here I will
directly run Python exe and I will
enforce side by and you see that you can
stop it importantly successfully so now
you can go ahead and use all of these
awesome libraries and do amazing stuff
with Python alright so that was all
about arakata in stock and upon the
installation and some brief introduction
of keep on watching my tutorials I have
an exciting series coming in for pandas
and if you like the tutorial then please
give it a thumbs up subscribe and
comment below thank you for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
