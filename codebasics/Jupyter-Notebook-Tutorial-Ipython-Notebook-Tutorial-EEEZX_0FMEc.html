going to learn how to build a to Peter
not book now this tutorial is for those
who doesn't have any understanding on
what is you could not book I promise
that by the end of this tutorial you
will be able to build a notebook that
looks like this
okay now let's first begin by
understanding what is tip it in not book
a notebook is a web application that
allows you to combine live code
visualizations and explanatory text all
in one place I have this sample notebook
here where you can see that I have a
live course by live code I mean if I
change my code here for example I want
to change the color of this plot from
red to green and when I run this I see
that it is changing so this is live
sort of like Idol or Python command
prompt where you change your code and
you can see your result interactively
second aspect of jupiter notebook is
visualization so here I can see chart a
table and a YouTube video link alright
the third aspect is the explanatory text
so you can see the rich text here with
different fonts and colors the short of
looks like a web page and HTML style
rich text okay so if you have all of
these three combined in one place then
it's really awesome because you can
share your research or many times data
scientists want to prove that point and
they want to share the results with
other people and this is a great way for
doing it I have a separate video where I
go into details of explaining what is
Cupit in not books so you can go ahead
and watch that first now assuming that
you know at least what is not book we
are already set to build over force not
book okay so the first step in building
our book is to install it so in order to
install it
you can just go to google and type in
installs Jupiter not book and click on
this links now here there are two ways
of installing Jupiter not booked one is
by installing anaconda Jupiter is part
of anaconda so once install anaconda you
will automatically get it second way is
to install it using pit where you can
just run this install Jupiter installing
anaconda is highly recommended so I
would go ahead and install anaconda and
get some other goodies for free I have a
separate video on how to install
anaconda
so you can just follow that and assuming
that now you have followed all the steps
and you have install anaconda to launch
Jupiter not booked here is what you need
to do so you can go to your command
prompt and just type in Q Peter not
booked okay
now whenever you type this command make
sure right so I have my working
directory here C code py so it's gonna
launch the Jupiter not book from that
working directory alright so whatever
you save you can save into that
directory so just run Jupiter not book
and when you do that it is going to
launch the notebook okay now in the
notebook there are few things here so
first of all you have this front end or
a UI which is running in a web browser
okay the second part is your server so
here I have my server running okay and
when I do things like when I build a
Jupiter not book here it's going to
communicate with this server so let me
go ahead and open the Jupiter
architecture diagram so I have this
diagram here so this is how it works so
your browser is basically here so this
is your front-end for the notebook then
you have not book server
which is running here okay when you type
in Jupiter not book and what happens is
every notebook server will have its
kernel so kernel is a an entity which is
running your core okay so when when in
Jupiter notebook when you type in
different commands it will send a JSON
messages to not book server and not book
server will eventually use kernels to
run your code and supply the output back
to your browser so now I'm going to
create my first notebook so you can go
here new and click on this one alright
Python now Jupiter suppose many other
programming languages is not just Python
we are in this tutorial covering only
Python okay our goal here is to build a
notebook that will use pandas Python
module to retrieve the live stock price
and plot it it as a chart and also in
terms of a table and it will also help
some ex-military
text on what is talked at sets are for
the people who don't know anything about
stock okay so I have this code snippet
here and just to save time I am just
going to copy paste so first of all you
have this particular cell here or which
whose type is called so if you go here
you have code and markdown and couple of
other types so by default your line is a
code here and when you type your code
here and when you click on this button
what it is going to do is it's going to
execute it okay now it is giving some
warning on the applicated uses of this
library so i'm not not going to worry
about it really so i will execute it one
more time and here you will notice that
it used font pandas library to pull
Apple's stock price and when I say
yes yes which means a data frame pandas
dataframe and when I print D F dot head
it is printing the table now this is
kind of nice because now I can see my
live data interactively even even when
I'm in a middle of writing my code okay
here you will notice this Ln two three
etcetera so two means this is the second
line that was executed you will also see
sometimes that little stars if you
notice here you will see star when it's
a sty means it is executing that course
all right so it's in middle of execution
that's what it means okay now I have the
stock prices displayed as a table
but I want to let's draw a chart so for
that what you will do is you will use
data frames plot function okay so you
can use plot function and you can
mention what you want to plot on your
y-axis so out of all these columns I am
interested in plotting a closing price
of stock every day on y-axis and let's
say for color I want my chart to be in
green color now to run specific a cell
or specific line you can either use this
button or you can use alter enter
shortcut okay now it did not plot chart
here because I need something called a
line magic so the line magic that I need
to use here is Matt Matt plot live in
line so in line will plot the chart as
soon as it is done executing this line
so again executed using this button or
alter enter and you will see that it has
plotted the chart now now I will go in
detail on what is this thing doing and
what is line magic but first let me
cover this Manoir option so
here I have couple of buttons so for
example if I want to let's say I have
this extra cell and if I want to remove
it you can use this option so it will
just remove the line okay
also if you want to let's say insert a
cell above this line then you can say
insert cell a bow and below also here in
I have a short keyboard shortcut so I am
looking for a shortcut for insert cell a
bow and you will see that you can use a
or B as a shortcut to insert cell above
so I will type in a here I have to be
out of that now you see I type in a and
in a conservative cell here and if I
have this cell selected if i type in b
it will insert the cell here alright now
let me see what is the command to cut
the cell so to cut the cell you can
press x key so here I don't need this
cell so I replace X and it will get rid
of it so you can learn some of these
shortcuts and it will increase your
productivity if you don't know to use
shortcuts then obviously you have these
buttons so this button right here is
used to save your chip it is not book 5
so now now that we have some code let's
go ahead and save the file so here I
will say save now it saved the file as
untitled so I can go here and click
there to give a name to your file so you
can take python on does not soak ok and
it saved my not so now let's go back to
this particular sign and understand what
it is doing so whenever you see things
like percentage and some text after it
it is usually a line magic or cell magic
ok so I'm going to insert some cell here
and play with line magic so the command
that you need to run to see all the
magic commands
is percentage LS magic okay are going to
execute it hit alt enter and you will
see all the available magic commands
that you have you have line magics and
you have cell magic so let's look at
some of them and see what they are doing
exactly okay
so I am interested in for example this
percentage time magic now if you don't
know what it is doing then there is this
command there is a way where you can
type in question mark and execute that
and it will show you the help on that
particular magic okay
so here it is saying that it is being
used to measure the performance of a
Python statement execution okay so for
example here if you say percentage print
HelloWorld then it will tell you how
much time print HelloWorld takes to
execute okay so let's try this out so
I'm going to measure a performance of a
for loop so let's say I have this big
for loop where I am just doing some
dummy operation okay and when you run
this it will tell you that this for loop
in total took 8.51 milliseconds so this
is pretty powerful this can help you in
identifying the bottleneck in your code
okay another mam magic command is
percentage system so percentage
percentage system will allow you to run
any UNIX command so here if I say
percentage system PWD then it will show
me my present working directory which is
this okay you can also run LS to list
down all the files so these these are
the files that I have in my current
working directory
pretty much you can run any command
using this there is even a better way
like a shortcut of doing the same thing
so if you want to do the exactly same
thing then you can use explanation
exclamation mark followed by your
command
and it will do the same thing right
same here PWD shows you present working
directory now second thing I want to do
is in my data frame here I have a volume
on stock price also okay so I want to
plot this volume as a bar chart now Max
or Lib has a support for the bar chart
so I will use this particular cell so
let me remove this guy here and just use
that to plot a bar chart so you say your
data frame dot plot dot bar and you will
mention your y-axis okay so you can see
that it plotted the bar chart for my
volume data okay now one thing you will
notice here is this number so this
number is 13 here versus here is 10 so
this shows the order of execution so I
executed this slide 4 so that was like
order 10 then I executed something else
which I removed and then executed this
one so 11 10 11 12 13 and so on so if
you ever wonder what these numbers means
then the answer is there it shows the
order of execution of your code okay now
for this tutorial of if I'm sharing this
with someone who doesn't have any
understanding on stock prices then I
want to explain that person what is talk
so for that I prefer having a youtube
video link explaining poly stock so for
that what I will do is I will go to
youtube and type in what is talk what is
basically okay so here I see this
particular video so it's open that video
and just say share and M based so this
is an HTML line to embed that particular
video link now I want to insert that
above this so you can click on insert
sellable or using a shortcut and copy
paste all right so let's run this so now
you can see the YouTube video link here
and you can run this link here and this
way when a postman is looking at this
notebook here will play the video and he
will gain understanding on what is talk
next thing I want to do is I want to
have some explanatory text to kind of
explain the purpose of this tutorial so
again I will go insert cell above and
this particular cell I will insert some
explanatory text so I will say this
copying pasting to save time okay now
this the type of this cells will be
marked down okay so now let me run this
okay so this is markdown cell and you
can use some of the markdown properties
for example let's say I want to
highlight or make this text bold for
that you can use star star then you do
star stars it will make that bold see
that it is bold now also when you say 1
dot 2 dot this is showing it as a list
okay so if you want to look at more
markdown properties then you can go to
help and look at markdown health here
formatting index for example you can see
that if you want to make something as a
header then you can use
hacchyan like this okay so I will just
see how this guy looks so I'm just going
to copy okay and then here and there is
a double star double hash okay so if you
put double hash then it will make it
like a header text if you so these are
like various levels if you have one hash
it's even is heading 1 heading 2 heading
3 and so on okay so just to get this
help it has some few other things such
as italic so if you want to make your
text italy italic you can just use star
so here if i put this whole thing into
star you you can see that it is now
italic so go through this help and i
look at all the mod non-text to make
your visualization or your explanatory
text more appealing next thing i want to
do is since this is pandas tutorial i
want to put pandas logo here so you will
again insert a cell about this one
change the type to be markdown and just
Google small Ponder's here and copy
image address okay so the when I say
copy image address it is like this so
you have the PNG file so I will go
through here and just put a
image tag so I have image tag where the
image location is whatever I copy from
pandas website and I have some styling
on that and I have again the same
heading okay so when you run this so
this particular thing is not needed now
okay so this is how it looks and another
important thing to notice is if you want
to add it any cell just double click on
it so when you double click on it you
will see a little pencil icon here also
you will see of course over here so
that's when you can type it in and when
you execute using this cell or alter
enter it will show the final output okay
I have this extra cell which I can do
more using this or X shortcut okay
excellent so I have this ponders
tutorial not book ready now it has
experience attacked YouTube video link
and life hold running so this is awesome
now I want to share this with a friend
of mine okay so in pandas in sorry in
notebook in Jupiter notebook you can
export it too so here if you go to find
file download as notebook you can export
it as an HTML so when you export it as
an HTML let's see what's going to happen
so it so that dump the output into HTML
file and if I open the HTML file you
will see this is how it looks so you can
see that well this is an HTML file so I
can give this HTML file to anyone who
wants to learn it okay
you can also output your Jupiter
notebook as a Python file so for example
you have bunch of Python code here and
you want to output it in Python file
then you just use download as Python
command here
and then you open this particular file
into not bad this is how it's looking so
it has all this Python code so you can
run this py file as it is alright let's
go back to a notebook it has a bunch of
other formats where you can output it as
a PDF and MD and so on if you want to
look at some of the interesting Jupiter
notebooks that other people have built
then just go to google and type in
Jupiter notebook gallery and it will
show you a couple of links here so if I
click on the first one I will see some
of the interesting not books of for
example this one is on data analysis is
showing the HTML page but you can see
he's doing various things with pandas
and some other odd data science
libraries okay you can also look at some
of the notebooks for the neural networks
so here is explaining what is neural
network this one here and it has some
code as well
okay so just explore all these different
notebooks and yeah I forgot to mention
that the format for the notebook is IP
Y&amp;amp;B
so IP u NV is your basically ipython
notebook or so whenever you see any file
which has this extension IP o and B it
is basically your Jupiter not book okay
so that was all about Jupiter tutorial
there are many other interesting
features but we are not able to cover
them in this video but at least I hope
that this tutorial will get you started
and you will be able to build the not
books on your own if you like this
tutorial please give it a thumbs up
