going to look into how you can act rate
through numpy array as usual I have
launched Jupiter not book by running
this command in my command prompt and
created a ipython notebook and imported
my numpy module as NP first thing we are
going to do is create and alright so I
will use a range function and let's say
I have 12 elements and we can reshape it
into 3 by 4 so now I got this numpy
array which is 2 dimensional array the
simple way of iterating through this
array is just to run fold upon it I can
say for row in a print row and that will
print all the rows if you are interested
in uttering or each of these elements
one by one then you can introduce one
more for loop ends you can say for cell
in raw / in cell and that will print all
individual elements now if you just want
to flatten the list flatten this array
into a listers then you can simply call
flatten function this way you don't have
to write to for loops you can just write
one single for loop and be done with it
now numpy offers a function called nd
ITER which allows you to do a more
sophisticated way of iteration for
example I can I can achieve the same
thing as flatten by using ndit function
I can say for X n n P dot nd ITER the
first argument is the array itself and
the second argument is order
so if you go by C order and print each
of these elements it will have same
effect as flatten essentially you are
going row by row and then printing
values in each of these columns so here
0 1 2 3 4 you can see it is printing it
in this order here but let's say if you
are a Fortran programmer and you want to
go column by column instead of row by
row so instead of printing 0 1 2 3 4 you
want to print 0 4 8 1 5 9 then you can
just change your order to be Fulton
order and you will see that you are now
printing it into for turn order so
that's a benefit of nd either function
it allows you to do iteration in a
variety of ways if you check the
documentation of nd ITER you will see a
lot of options here
I have flags and in the Flags one of the
option is external loop
this causes the values given to be
one-dimensional arrays with multiple
values instead of 0 dimensional arrays
what this means is let's say I want to
go in for an order but instead of going
element by element I want to print an
entire column so I want to first print 0
for 8 then 1 5 9 2 6 10 3 7 11 basically
print entire column on each iteration
you can do this by supplying flags here
the value you want to provide is
external loop and when you do that you
see that each iteration is now printing
the entire column if you check some
other flags then one of the flags in Opa
Flags is rewrite which means the operand
will be read from and returned to what
this means is let's say you are
iterating through the array and you want
to modify the elements you can do that
using that particular flag
so the way you write that is 4x in NP
dot nd ITER and then in off no flags you
will say read right and then the
convention that you have to follow is
you have to say X dot dot dot equal to X
cross X so let's say I want to create
square of each of these elements in an
array and I want to modify the original
array okay if something went wrong Oh P
okay it is o P Flags actually so when I
run this and now I print my array you
will notice that my original array is
modified and each of these elements is
actually the square of the original
element so 3 square is 9 4 squared is 16
and so on now how do you I trade through
two numpy arrays simultaneously so
sometimes based on what kind of problem
you are solving you might have to
iterate through two arrays at the same
time okay so let's create a new array
call it n P dot arrange and this time
I'm going to create an array with a
different dimension so I will create
let's say three by one array okay and it
has these elements in my original array
is like this I mean I modified it but
now it looks like this so is this B is
this now I want to I trait through these
two arrays simultaneously now when I add
it through it what I want to do is I
want to I trip to the first row and at
that time the element from the second
array should also be the first row which
is three okay so you can use for XY in
and P dot nd ITER in the bracket you can
supply two arrays that you want to title
it through and then print both of these
you will notice what happened is when it
goes through the first array the first
row in the array okay zero one four nine
at that time it is keeping this element
constant three so you can see that now
you can I trip through two arrays
simultaneously now notice that in order
to do this your arrays should be
broadcast table which means either their
shape should be same or one of the
dimensions in one of the errors should
be one okay so if you read the general
broadcasting rules on number arrays it
will say that two dimensions are
compatible when they are either equal or
one of them is one okay so for example
let's say if I had different kind of
right here five and this right let's see
if I add this kind of case then I won't
be able to write through it because
there would be a branch could not be
broadcast together because the shapes of
these two arrays are not compatible with
each other okay that's all we had for
this tutorial I have provided the link
of this Jupiter notebook in the video
description below so make sure you play
with it and let me know if you have any
question please post your comment and
feedback below in the comment section
