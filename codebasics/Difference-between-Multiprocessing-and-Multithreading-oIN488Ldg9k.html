coding tutorial in this computer science
concepts tutorial we are going to see
the difference between multi processing
and multi threading both of these are
ways to achieve multitasking now what is
multi tasking when you are doing
multiple tasks at the same time it is
called multitasking for example this mom
she is taking care of baby picking up
the phone call and at the same time
cooking food Sosa's doing all these
multiple things at the same time that's
why it's called she called to be doing
multi tasking of a computer in similar
fashion does multiple tasks for example
on my computer I have PowerPoint running
I have a browser running I might have
calculator couple of other programs
running so all these different programs
are basically different processes and if
you want to see those processes you can
see it here in windows task manager if
you go to details tab all these entities
which are listed here they are all
different processes so for example for
Chrome I have all this processes and for
PowerPoint I have this guy here and
there is a PID PID means process ID so
they have that own different process IDs
so understanding processes is pretty
easy
basically there are different programs
running on your computer then what is
actually multiple threads okay so let me
go back to my presentation so multiple
threads basically lives within the same
process so in this diagram here this
outer block is a process which has its
own virtual memory or an address space
now it can create multiple threads
inside it now the difference between
process and thread is that threads will
share this address space now they will
have their own instruction sets they
will be doing each of these threads will
be doing
specific tasks and they will be
exhibiting their own core they have
their own stack memory own instruction
pointer but the only thing that they
share is the address space which means
if you have any global variables to
define in your program they can be
accessed by these threads and heap
memory can be accessed by this Thresh
okay whereas if you look at the
processes this is process one and
process two they have their own address
paste okay and if they ever want to
communicate with each other they can use
a inter process communication techniques
such as a file on the disk or a shared
memory or a message pipe okay so from
these two pictures you can at least
guess what is the key difference between
process and a thread so the key
difference is trails are lightweight vs.
processes are heavyweight okay that's
the key difference
now if thread is a lightweight why do
you even care to create a new process
well first of all these processes are
different programs written by different
companies so they have to run separately
as separate process and another thing is
if you have any error or a memory leak
in one program or or one process it will
not impact another process versus if you
have that problem in a one thread then
since it is running under as in the
diagram if this thread has a memory leak
then it can potentially impact the
entire process and it can have harmful
effects on these threads and the parent
process alright so that was all about
multi processing and multi-threading
