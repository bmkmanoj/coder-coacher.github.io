going to look into what is pandas and
how to install it
panels has become a buzzword in Python
community nowadays especially it is very
popular in data science community now
what is data science data science or
data analytics is a process of analyzing
large set of data points and to get
answers on questions related to that
data set and pandas is a Python module
that makes data science extremely easy
and effective now let's look at the real
life example to understand what I mean
by that I have this excel file which
contains our data on New York City's
weather in the month of January I
downloaded this CSV from internet from a
waiter web site and you can see that it
has information such as the temperature
on each of these dates the wind speed
the events whether it rained is snowed
etc and when you're looking at this kind
of data set you might have questions
such as what was the maximum temperature
in the month of January on which days
did it rain what was an average speed of
wind during the month now one obvious
tool that you can use to get these
answers is Excel itself so in Excel if I
use this filter I can easily know on
which days it rained 9 10 16 and 27 but
the problem with Excel is that when your
data size grows beyond some point for
example if you are dealing with millions
and billions of data points then it
becomes harder to do data analysis in
Excel because it becomes slow first of
all and it doesn't have necessary
features of
optionality that you will need while
dealing the data at the size of data at
that scale so then your next choice for
doing data analysis will be Python so I
have this Python program of which I
wrote to pass that same CSV file so you
can see that I am using CSV module to
pass this CSV and once it is passed I
have written three different functions
to get the answers on my questions and
when I run this program it will get me
those answers it's saying that maximum
temperatures 50 and I have answers on
other questions also but I have to spend
quite a lot of time to write this code
and also it it's not very convenient
basically you have to test it it might
have bugs and so on and whenever you
want to do some different kinds or the
kind of analytics you have to again
write your code and you can see it's
like 72 line of code with pandas
framework which we can do the same thing
of pretty easily and by writing only few
lines of code now I'm going to do the
same thing using pandas so here I have a
Jupiter not book and I'm going to import
pandas SPD so PD here is my pandas
module then I am reading this CSV file
here and it is returning me the data
frame object data from frame object is
at the core of pandas okay and if you
print data frame you will see it shot up
looks like a table with rows and columns
okay now to get the answer on my first
question which was what is the maximum
temperature okay so to do that you will
just call max and you will get an answer
so you can see it is 50
- no on which days it rained you can do
the F est now est here as you see is the
date column so first of all you want to
retrieve dates the date on which it's
rain so now the second condition is give
me all the dates when the events was
rain
okay then you execute it you you get the
answer that it rained on nine ten
sixteen and twenty seven so pretty easy
only one line the third question that we
had was what is my average wind speed
okay and when you do mean you get
answered
now let's compare these answers with our
Python programs so if I compare these
answers here temperatures of fifteen
nine ten sixteen twenty seven so 50 this
is good but you see that this answer is
different six point eighty nine and six
point twenty two this is happening
because if you look at our data the wind
speed on certain days was na now this
happened because our excel file had some
missing data points you can see that on
these days it has a blank blank beta
basically it doesn't have any data so we
got data in little bit of massive format
if this wasn't very clean okay so the
process of cleaning the data is called
data munging or data wrangling basically
whenever you are scrapping data or doing
data analytics or you have to properly
polish it or kind of make it ready for
your next step and that process is
called data munging or data wrangling
it's funny that when I was doing what is
data munging of a Google search I found
this answer and I found a pretty
interesting so that is this guy called
Nissan neeraj he posted this
picture saying that your raw data looks
like this see how messy it is okay and
after you do data munging it will look
like this so now it is ready to be
processed so this is a nice way to
explain what is data munging but Python
allows you to do data munging quite
easily so here the problem is I have
this any values and pop in in Python
bundles you have this method called of
fill any so what you want to do is
whenever I see any for my wind speed I
want to fill that with a zero value so I
will do this here and then you have to
do in place equal to true to chain the
same data send and when you execute this
you will get 6.22 which is same as this
answer okay so that was a little
introduction on just a simple demo on
showing the pandas capabilities now
pandas can do much more than this if you
look at the pandas documentation you
will find a rich set of functionality
that you cannot you cannot find anywhere
else in any other libraries okay so it's
extremely powerful but this was just to
kind of give you an idea Zaun
what is pandas and what it can do and so
on ok now the second part is how do you
install it so pandas comes with an upon
the distribution I have a separate video
on how to install anaconda so once you
install anaconda you will automatically
get pandas for free if you don't want to
do that then you can simply run a fifth
install pandas command so if you just
run something like paste install pandas
on your command prompt and if you have
pip install then you will get pandas
modules and once you have pandas module
you can go to your
our Idol shell and type in import pandas
just yeah just import pandas and if that
works
it means that you have now upon panda
installed okay so and that was all that
I had for this tutorial I have an
exciting panda series coming in so stay
tuned and we'll have our quite a bit of
interesting tutorials on pandas itself
alright thank you very much for watching
and if you liked this tutorial
give me a thumbs up share and comment
