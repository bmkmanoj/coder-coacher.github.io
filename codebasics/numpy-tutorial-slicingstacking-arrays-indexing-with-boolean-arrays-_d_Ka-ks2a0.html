our numpy tutorials if you have not seen
my first two tutorials then I would say
pause right now go watch them first and
then you can continue on this one here's
the list of topics that we are going to
cover in this tutorial ok let's first
begin by indexing and slicing now you
all know that when you have a normal
Python list like this you can use the
index range like this to get the list of
elements so when you do n 0 to 2 what it
will do is it will go from 0 to 1 so
this is 0 1 2 it will not cover 2 but it
will cover these two so that's what it
does it also supports minus 1 index
minus 1 means start from the end so it
will print the very last element ok now
num py array support similar kind of a
slicing so here I'm going to create num
py array I will initialize it with same
elements and if you do 0 to 2 here you
see you get the same result as what you
got with a normal Python list ok it also
supports reverse index so this is the
syntax is pretty similar to lists how
you slice the list so if you know list
slicing then you can use the same
concept for num py array as well now
let's go through a multi-dimensional
array so here let's say I have a
multi-dimensional array so if you print
it it looks like this now here when you
do a 1/2 what will happen is you are
going through the so here this is a row
this is a column
so this is zero through one row so you
are going through this first row and you
are looking at the second element so 0 1
2 so which is 3 okay so that's what it
is printing when you do something like
this what will happen is it will go
through 0 2 second row ok
now always when you are doing slicing
the this particular index is not
included so it will actually go from 0
to 1 so 0 through fostro and then it
will print 2nd element so in these 2
rows the second element is 8 and 3 so
that's what it is printing here you can
also do a minus 1 oops
so a minus 1 is the last element the
last element here is this last row so
that's what it is printing and in that
last row so always remember this is your
row and after row you have called
so let's second column you want to print
column 0 to 2 so 0 to 2 means 0 &amp;amp; 1 so
it's in the last row it's printing 9 &amp;amp; 3
now let's say if you want to go through
all the rows and print these two columns
let's say you want to print 7 2 3 &amp;amp; 8 3
2 how will you do that so the syntax for
going through all the rows is just a
column so if you have just a column it
will go through all the rows and then
now you want to go through first row and
second row so to include first you will
say first now if I say second it will
not include this guy here okay
so I have to sit three here cook
now let's see how you would I trade
through an array so I'm going to
initialize the same error here and if
you look at this array it's sort of like
a table you have rows in your columns
now if you want to it--it through rows
you will just say for row in e print row
pretty straightforward okay and if you
want to print in use your cells then
again row is also short of like a list
so you can actor through it and you can
induce printing usual numbers okay now
sometimes you want to flatten the list
and print every cell so numpy why has
this matter call flat you can do for
cell in a dot flat print cell what this
is doing is it is just flattening this
as as if it's a single dimensional array
and you can now I click through the
entire array next item is stacking two
errors together so for example let's say
you have these two arrays so I am what
I'm doing is I'm initializing array with
numbers 0 to 5 and I'm reshaping it by 3
by 2 shape okay and then I have my B
which is like this so if you print the
NB it looks like this okay so you have
got let's say two two-dimensional arrays
now if you want to vertically stack them
together just imagine you have put this
array as if it's a box and you're
putting this over another box okay so
num py supports that so enum py you will
do NP dot V stack a and B okay I had a
problem with the syntax you the argument
is topple actually okay so you can see
that it kind of stacked them together as
if
there were like two boxes and you just
put one box over the other okay you can
do same thing with horizontal stacking
as well so let's say let's say these are
two boxes and you want to horizontally
put them side-by-side you can do the
same thing with H stack command which is
horizontal stacking so you can see 0 1 3
so this was my first array and this is
my second array this could be pretty
useful feature based on what kind of
requirement you have all right now what
we are going to look at is the
horizontal spread split so I am again
initializing one more array and this
array is having two rows and 15 columns
now if you want to split this array into
let's say three different arrays so I
want to just imagine I am vertically
slicing them into three different equal
sized arrays you can do that using at
split command as split command is at
numpy module it is not at a given user
array if you do that you can see that it
kind of split into three different
arrays now it's kind of hard to
visualize this so what I'm going to do
is I'm going to store the result into a
variable which is a list and just print
those things one by one
so you can see that now I kind of
vertically slice these big array into
three different arrays by doing at split
so three means divided into three
different equal sized arrays okay now
you can do the same thing with a
vertical split here I can do a vertical
split which is let's say I have only two
rows so I could just divide it into two
I can do make only two divisions out of
it so if you do result 0 and result one
they look like this so what I did is
vertically I kind of cut them into two
arrays so this the second argument tells
you like how many partitions you want to
make out of your original array which is
here okay now another topic we want to
cover is indexing with boolean arrays
this is pretty powerful it's kind of
like non-intuitive if you have just used
list then a you will not never think
that this kind of awesome feature exists
in numpy why so I'm going to initialize
one array and kind of reshape it two
three four by the way this practice is
quite popular whenever you want to
initialize array with fixed set of
numbers and then you want to kind of
reshape it this is what you do this is
better than kind of typing all these
elements by hand you know so it's I kind
of like it
okay now I have got this numpy array all
right now let's say I have this B
variable and if I do a greater than four
what's going to happen is it's going to
create another numpy array and it's
going to store the result of this
expression into individual elements so
here 0 is less than 0 is not greater
than 4 so it's false vs. 11 is greater
than 4 so at that location it is true ok
so pretty cool I got now two arrays this
one is numbers and this one is boolean
now what you can do is something like
this
now you might not have seen this before
okay so here this is array and the index
of that array is array itself now let's
see what's going to happen when you do
this okay cool so what it there is it
looked at B array and then wherever it
found true it returned those elements
from this original array so you can see
that 5 to 11 where true that's why you
got 5 to 11 this is a cool way of
extracting all the elements which are
greater than 4 from your original array
this is also useful if you want to
replace those elements with a certain
number so for example I can say e of B
is equal to minus 1 and what will happen
is any element that was greater than 4
you wanted to replace it with minus 1
and that's what it did so be it looks at
all the true elements it returns those
elements and all those elements are set
to be minus 1 this is this could be
really powerful based on what kind of
application you are right ok so that was
all about number Y or a functions I hope
you're having fun time learning numpy
why it's pretty powerful number y arrays
are very fast and memory efficient so if
you are doing a lot of data manipulation
and if you are looking for performance
please use numpy why it's very popular
in data science and scientific community
overall alright thank you for watching
