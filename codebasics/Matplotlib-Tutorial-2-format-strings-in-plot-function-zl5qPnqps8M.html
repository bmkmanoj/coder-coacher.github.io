matplotlib format strings today which
can be used to control visual aspects of
your 2d plot such as color marker style
line style etc I have launched a Jupiter
notebook by running this command here
and I created a sample notebook by
clicking on new button here and as usual
I will import matplotlib py plot as PLT
this is our main plotting object that
will be used to plot any kind of chart
now I am going to use some static data
to plot my chart so here I have X list
and vilest X contains number of days
weekdays Monday to Sunday and Y contains
the temperature that was recorded on
that particular day and a simple way to
plot a 2d chart is call to call PLT dot
plot functions and supply x and y as an
argument now you can control visual
properties of this chart by specifying
format strings as a third argument right
now the line color is blue let's say I
want to change the color to be green and
I want the marker to be plus so I can
specify G+ here and what does gonna do
is G means screen plus means + marker
okay if you look at the documentation
for plot function you will see a list of
format strings that are supported so for
example if I want my line style to be
dashed line then I can specify - - so I
can just append - - here and that's
gonna make it - - you can do - dot also
now it doesn't matter in which order you
specify this form is string it will work
anyway
so if for example if I do - - let's say
R for red and star that is also going to
work so the order doesn't matter you can
specify - - at the end also and it has
the same effect you can look at all the
markers which are supported so I have
like Star Plus D for diamonds so let's
try diamond here so instead of star
I want to D do D as a diamond and you
can see the diamond here C so you can
specify it in variety of ways now if you
don't like for my strings and if you
want to explicitly specify as a keyword
argument then you can achieve the same
thing by providing individual argument
so I'm going to do the same plot but
using the keyword argument so I can say
color is equal to red marker is D and
line style is blank so you'll see that I
can get the same exact plot so basically
specifying these three arguments and
this one format string has the same
exact effect for the color you can also
specify hexadecimal string so if you
want color other than red green blue one
of those predefined colors then you can
specify any hexadecimal combination and
it should work okay so you know how RGB
color works right this is red this is
green and this is blue
so you can just try out different
combinations here now if you want to
control the marker size then there is a
marker size argument that you can use so
let's say I want my marker to be really
big so now you see that it became like
really big okay so yeah use marker size
to increase the size of your marker one
more property that plot has is called
alpha so okay let me specify alpha here
alpha will basically control the
transparency so the scale of alpha is
between 0 &amp;amp; 1 1 is completely opaque and
if you want to make it let's say 1/2
semi-transparent then you can say 0.5
you can see now it became
semi-transparent so the scale is 0 to 1
0 is not visible at all and 0.2 is like
hardly visible and so on so we covered
some important properties in plot
function there are many other properties
as well such as animated clip box color
contains if this is the entire list of
properties that plot API supports so
just go ahead play with it one thing I
want to tell you is you're not going to
learn programming just by watching the
video by sitting in your sofa you have
to play with it so I have provided the
Jupiter not book used in this tutorial
in the video description below I
recommend you download it you play with
it try to use matplotlib in one of your
sample projects and that is the best way
to become expert at it alright that's
all I had for this tutorial thank you
very much goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
