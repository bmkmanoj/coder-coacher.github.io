tutorial today we are covering complex
and rational numbers in Giulia
programming language we are doing a
little different thing today
until now we were using Giulia terminal
like this one but today we will use the
Giulia box or all which is basically a
Python Giulia not book how what this
does is it allows you to do the same
thing that you are able to do here but
within a browser so go to julia box.org
website and from here click on new and
you can use the latest version there is
this version which is still in
development so I'm going to use Julia
zero point four point three this is
going to open a Julia not book I will
show you what an odd book means so when
you come here here you can type in your
Julia command for example I will just do
simple math and to get the result like
let's compare this side by side so here
when you do two plus three and enter it
gives you the result here you can do the
same thing but you have to hit alt enter
that's a keystroke so you see it gives
the same result or you can click on this
button which is a execute the cell
so they're both are same depends which
one is convenient for you okay now let's
start talking about complex number I
will first delete all these cells so
that it is clear
so if you have a study complex number in
your math class during the school days
you might recall that complex number is
a number that can be expressed in the
form of a plus bi where a and B are real
numbers and I is an imaginary unit the
value of I is square root of -1
let's first be our first complex number
the way you do it is by doing this so
you say X equal to 3 plus 4i n alt-enter
and when I do type of X it will tell me
it's a complex number here 3 is a real
unit and 4 is an imaginary unit and to
get that you can use this inbuilt
function called for you when you do real
x alt-enter it says 3 same way to get
imaginary number you can see image X and
it gives you the imaginary unit so just
imagine a unit is here whatever is with
I am and the real number is 3 now one
question you might have is why don't we
do why didn't do Leah creators decided
to do in a way that we do it in our
standard mathematics class well which is
use I
three plus four I instead of I I am well
the reason is I is such a common
variable name that we use in our four
loops all the time so if you have a
variable called I like this and if you
do that's the two plus three I imagine
what's going to happen if you remember
Julia suppose a mathematical coefficient
which means to multiply three with I you
don't need to write multiplication in
between you can just write it like this
and it will multiply so what it did here
is 3 into 5 which is 15 plus 2 17 that's
the main reason why Julia fate has
decided not to use I now if you have a
variable with a name I am then it's
gonna do the same thing but I am is not
a very common variable name this way
they thought we'll just do I am it
really means imaginary the first two
letters of your imaginary okay let's go
through a couple of more functions the
third function that you want to call it
angle when you say angle X it gives you
the angle created by the complex number
in the complex plane okay
fourth function is absolute it gives you
the absolute value of a complex number
if you remember the formula of an
absolute for AB absolute value of a
complex number then it is the square of
real number plus square of imaginary
number and you just take the square root
of the entire thing so here it is 3 &amp;amp; 4
so you will do 3 square plus 4 square
which is really 9 plus 16 which is 25
and the square root of 25 is 5 if you
want to look at the list of functions
all the list of functions that you can
use on complex numbers go to Julia the
Wrangell dot or website this one right
here if you go to documentation here you
should be able to find all the entire
list of functions so these are operators
you will find all the functions
at the bottom check out check this list
there's a whole long list of all kind of
functions so they're not going to cover
all of these we just cover a few basic
of them okay
next thing we want to talk about is the
standard asthmatic operations complex
numbers as like any other number you can
do standard mathematical operation you
can do something like this and it's
cannot multiply it you can also add two
numbers this is my first complex number
and I want to add with this number and
you can guess what will be the result
you can also do multiplication plus two
I am three plus four I am
let's say you call has no matter
matching this okay let's see what
happened okay so we forgot to write
multiplication operator that's why I
gave this error if you recall the
formula of this then you should be able
to figure out why it gave you this
result you can also do division again
the same number let's do the division
you can do square of a complex number
and for that you will use this
particular character okay what if I have
two real numbers and from that I want to
create generate a complex two numbers
like this complex number you can use a
function complex so use complex a comma
B a the first parameter in this function
is the real unit the second parameter is
the imaginary unit so it is giving you 2
plus Phi I am okay that was all about
complex numbers next topic we want to
cover is rational number again if we go
back to our high school days and try to
recall the definition of a rational
number then that number is a number that
can be expressed as fraction P divided
by Q of two integers for example if you
do y equal to 2 this is how you write a
rational number in julia using two
slashes okay so it says 2/3 and if you
do it it is telling me that it is a
rational number contrast this thing with
a normal division if you are normal
division it gives you a float result so
here this one is a float this one is a
rational number and this is an exact
ratio sometimes in decimal or the some
ratios cannot be represented in decimal
accurately for example this one even one
by 3 when you say this is not the
correct answer there are like three
all the way under infinity that's why
you how to use rational numbers
sometimes as is without converting them
to a decibel number so here I will use
just 1/3 okay now if you want to figure
out the numerator and denominator of
this complex numbers the way you do it
is a new amp function will return you
numerator of a rational number
so here numerator is 4 and denominator
is 5 denominator you can figure out
using functions de and all these are
built-in functions available in Julia ok
how about we go over some operators now
when you do to flesh this 3 equal double
equal to is a comparison operator and
let's do this
and see what happens interesting here it
is saying these both of these numbers
are true why is that
ok let's figure out so if I do force
less than 6 here you see what just
happened whenever you are creating a
rational number it will give you the
fraction it will do all the
normalization and it will give you the
basic number so here for there by 6 is 2
by 3 similarly if you do Kate stress
less 12 this is also 2 by 3 so if
know the logic of rational numbers here
what happened is it was 8 and 12 so it
can be so 2 into 4 is 8 and 3 into 4 is
12 so you just cut down the 4 and you
get 2/3 ok what if I want to convert
this number which is a rational number
into Froude number well that is an easy
operator there's an is a function called
float it will yield the floor number
this is how you do a conversion from a
rational number to a float number okay
that was all about complex and real
numbers thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
