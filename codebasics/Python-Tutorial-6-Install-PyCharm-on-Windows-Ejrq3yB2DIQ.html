to install py charm py charm is a tool
that allows you to write Python programs
until now we have been using Idol to
write simple Python programs but once
you are through your few days of
learning you should switch to a better
tool that allows you to write Python
program debug it does the syntax
highlighting and it is a bunch of other
cool features that you will find very
useful so to install it just go to
google.com and type in download py charm
and the first link will be this so just
click on that and it will be jetbrains
coms less py charms less download so
JetBrains is the company that makes this
py charm too or now it has two versions
professional and community this is a
prep paid version or the community
version this one is a free version we
will install free version because it is
sufficient for our needs so just click
on download and it will begin
downloading in my case it is google
chrome so the download thing is
happening here if you have internet
explorer or firefox as a browser then
there will be a different location but
you should be able to figure it out
where it is downloading okay and once
the download so will wait until the
download is complete so I skip the part
of the whole dollar downloading process
so eventually it will get completed and
once it is complete you can just click
on the executable and it will begin
downloading so what you just learned it
was a setup file to install py charm and
now you are running that set of file to
install the software on your local
machine
just say yes next next you can say you
should just click these two so it will
create a desktop and all the dot P Y
which is a Python program file will be
open in py charm by default install ok
so the installation is complete you can
click on this and finish and it will
just start your py charm you can say I
do not have a previous version of pure
charm just ok hit OK okay if you if you
want to start it from your Windows
desktop then you can start it by double
begging this icon so just hit OK and say
create a new project so all my projects
now you need to give a location about
like where to have a projects so I will
just have my projects in C code
directory so I will just create a
directory in my C folder and I will just
name it code
okay so C code and the name of my
project is hello
okay so now the first thing we are going
to do is we will increase the font size
okay so let's see where can I increase
the font size so go to settings and here
type in font so you see like in editor
you see colors and font so click on fold
now in order to increase the font size
you is you see like you you probably
won't be able to edit this thing so just
say save as and just say my settings and
now you can increase the font size so I
really like like bigger fonts so I will
just say 18 okay okay now it increase
the font size of our editor but if you
want to increase font size size of these
other things then again go to settings
and let's see where we can increase the
font size for that so just type in font
font is here
so you to go to appeal opinions and here
you can again increase the font size so
in here the font size at two places and
as you see like it increase the font
size of this UI ok so right click now on
this one and create a Python file so it
will create your first python file and
you can just say hello hello is the name
of your python file so as you see the
way it works is you created a project
with a name hello within that project
now you have python file called hello
that py Python files have dot P UI
extension here you can start writing
your Python program so we'll just write
print HelloWorld
you
okay so this is my Python program so you
can you can have like as many lines as
you want and in order to run it click on
Run Run button and click on hello when
you do that you see like here in this
area it executed that and it printed
hello world so py charm will be pretty
useful when you're writing big programs
it has so many cool features that I
highly recommend using this awesome IDE
developed by JetBrains kudos to those
people who came up with such a nice and
awesome or tool and it's free as well
the commentary ssin is free okay so that
was all about how to install py charm
for writing better Python programs
