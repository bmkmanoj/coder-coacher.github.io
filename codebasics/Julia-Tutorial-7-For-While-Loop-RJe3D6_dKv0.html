tutorial today's topic is for and while
loop in Giulia and here is a list of
items we are covering in this video ok
let's begin with the for loop we are
going to cover two use cases of the for
loop the first one is I trading through
an array you can do that by saying for I
and your array println I'm just printing
all the elements in this array and you
have to end a for loop and keyword and
you executed it will just ight it
through each of these individual
elements one by one and at each stage I
will contain elements and it will print
it here you can do the same thing with a
string a and I had this beautiful string
array consisting of yummy Indian dishes
and at each stage I am printing each of
those items I hit alt enter by mistake
so let me type this in again remember
you have to put an otherwise you will
get this error then executed it shows me
this output ok the second use case is
iterating using a range so let's say I
want to brain number 1 to 5 you can do
that by
typing in range like this here
your starting index is 1 here and X is
ending index is 1 they're separated by a
colon and I will just print I every
stage when I do that I get this output
okay let's talk about why I look now I
will print the same output using a while
loop now now in case of I look you need
to initialize your variable in advance
you can't do it in within a loop like
this okay and then comes my while
condition that is a while I less than
equal to 5 because I want to print
numbered from 1 to 5 friend Alan
I and I have to increment I if you
forget increment this then you will end
up in an infinite loop so make sure you
don't forget this excellent so it
printed what I was expecting it to print
alright let's cover continued state man
continued statement is used when you
want to skip the execution of your main
loop body for when certain condition is
Matt for example I want to print a
square of all numbers between one to
five except even numbers so I'm going to
skip even numbers and four remaining
numbers I want to print the square for
that I can do something like this I'm
using our range equation here and the
first thing I am going to do is check if
the number is even as you know you can
use percentage operator here to find out
the remainder after dividing it by two
and if it is zero as we all know from
our school mathematics class that this
number is ever if it can be divided by
two and you have n if loop with and
now print the remaining numbers okay so
what it will do is if the number is even
it will continue so it will continue
means it will not come here it will just
continue from this point and it will go
into next iteration okay let's execute
this excellent so I got the square of
one three and five and I skipped two and
four because they were given numbers
okay our last quickly cover break
statement
now break statement is used when you
want to terminate the execution of your
loop when certain condition is met for
example you lost your key in a home now
you have certain locations to find your
keys for example garage in living room
chair close that etcetera once you find
your key at one location you don't go to
remaining locations searching for it
because your objective is met okay so
for that I will just quickly write a
program to demonstrate the same thing
and I will show you how to use break
here
so for example let's say my key location
is jet and my possible locations in my
home all these locations okay well if I
is the quality location I'm searching
through my home looking for my key and
if I find my tea I'm going to say that
II found at this particular location
okay and I will break okay so from here
on I don't want to execute the remaining
part otherwise I will say print parent
so first of all you have to end this
I mean I thought through it I didn't
find the key here and you have to put
one more end to end your full loop here
so let's see what happens
excellent so here I just won space I'll
executed here it search through garage
it didn't find the key that's why I say
not fun living room not forum but
eliminate from the th chair so it found
it and then it breaks so it doesn't go
through this last piece which is close
it okay that was a quick demonstration
of for and while loop thank you for
