Excel file or a table as shown here but
when it comes to knowing how much
percentage or a PI individual item is
taking out of my total expense having a
pie chart is definitely going to be a
big help because here I can see the
biggest pie or biggest person that goes
into home rent which is forty seven
percent and the second biggest one is
food which is twenty percent we are
going to plot this chart in matplotlib
today as usual I have launched a Jupiter
notebook by running Jupiter notebook in
my command prompt and I have imported
matplotlib and I have these two Python
lists the first one is the expense value
and the second one is the category or
the expense label to plot a pie chart
you can simply call PLT dot pi in the
argument you first supply your expense
values and there is a keyword argument
called labels where you supply the
labels when you run this you get this
nice beautiful looking pie chart now
this looks like an oval or ellipse
because although the data units for x
and y coordinates are same in terms of
pixels they are different so you have to
use PLT dot axis to be equal so let me
do that here and now you can see that it
looks like a perfect circle to get rid
of these extra label what I will do is I
will just call TLT dot show so that it
doesn't print all this text if you want
to increase the size of your pie chart
you can use the radius argument so if
you look at py plot dot pies
documentation
we have this radius argument by default
it is one if let's say I want the chart
to be double the size that it has by
default then I can do this I'll keep it
at 1.5 okay
now how do I see those percentages
because this pie chart is useful but I
don't know how much percentage of my
total expenses is going into home rent
there is an argument called Auto PCT so
if you look at again these arguments
here is the argument that you want to
use the value you will supply will have
percentage F percentage percentage so
this is a formal string okay and here
you specify what kind of decimal format
you want in percentage let's say I want
two decimal points I want two decimal
points after the after dot so when I do
that I get this if you don't want any
decimal and just the plane percentage
then you can do this if you want one you
can do this okay so now my chart looks a
little better it has one more argument
called shadow so if you have shadow in a
book you will barely notice it but there
is a little bit of shadow visible here
now if you want to take out these PI's
then there is another argument called
explore so let's find that argument here
in the list explore yeah so this is the
argument so when you specify explored
array it is going to explore that
specific PI by that specific amount so
the way it will work is in Explorer you
will specify a number of values here the
number of values will be equal to number
of PI's that you have you have 4 + 1 5
PI's okay it starts with home R and so
let's say if I specify
all zeroes then nothing is gonna happen
but let's say I want this food pie to
come out so the food pie is here when I
say zero point to what was gonna happen
is it's gonna come out by that much
amount if you this specific bigger value
it's gonna come out even more okay so
you can do something like this now by
default the pie starts at this angle and
it will start with the first one which
is home rent and it will go in
counterclockwise direction if you want
to start your pie at a different angle
let's say I want to start my home ran at
an angle of 45 degree then you can do
that by specifying start angle argument
so if I say start angle you can see that
now my home rent started at 45 degree
angle if you want your home button to
start at let's say 180 degree angle then
you just say 180 and it will start that
way this way you can kind of rotate your
pie chart and the positions of different
pies that you have you can further
explore the documentation for pie and
try out these different properties I
just wanted to show you quickly how you
can plot a basic pie chart okay now I am
supplying lists here you can use panda's
data frame or in numpy array okay most
of the time your data will be in csv
file or excel file so you can just
import it into panda's data frame or
numpy array and supply that into plot or
pie argument and it should work okay all
right that's all I had for this tutorial
I have provided a link of this 2p2 not
booked in the description below you can
download it play with it try out
different pie charts and let me know how
it goes
