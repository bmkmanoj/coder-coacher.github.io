reached a mark of 5000 subscriber and I
want to use this moment to say thank you
very much to all of you for your support
we are going to do quick recap on what
happened
since I started this channel in November
2015 and also we look into some of my
future plans I'm here on my YouTube
channels homepage you can see 5,000 plus
subscribers here initially when I
started this channel back in November 7
2015 I started working on basic Python
programming tutorials so if you have
followed my Python programming tutorial
list you will see I started with like
how to install Python and variables and
numbers and so on and then later on the
tutorials grew to cover more advanced
topics so now I have about 41 videos so
if you are just starting Python
programming you can just start from this
first video and you can follow it all
the way through or to go through some of
the advanced topics on my channel here
you will see a different topics so once
I was done with Python programming
tutorials I started covering some of the
get github stop some cool debugging
techniques then I started covering a new
programming language that is making a
buzz Julia then I have some computer
science tutorials and recently I have
been working on a Python or pandas for
data science I should be done with
pandas tutorials in next few weeks I
would say after that I am planning to
cover some of the machine learning stuff
in Python and then I want to go on to a
different topic all the altogether and
covers of the web and mobile
app development topics so if you have
any suggestion on which topic should I
cover next for my future tutorials
please post it in the comment below in
this video I highly appreciate your
suggestions in past one and half year I
have been continuously working on
improving my tutorials so if you see my
first tutorial which was on installing
Python on Windows this was the very
first tutorial on my channel you will
see my voice was little down so I'm
trying to improve the the energy level
or in my recording the second thing I am
trying to improve is my pronunciation I
am NOT a native English speaker so some
of the pronunciations are not that clear
and it confuses that native English
speakers sometimes so I that's something
that's another area which I have been
working on improving the third thing is
in my initial tutorials I used to put
some background music in the videos
while some people found it to be useful
majority of the people did not like it
so I have started removing that music so
now nowadays in my tutorials you will
not see any background music now let me
show you my subscriber growth so when so
this is showing me the entire graph for
the subscriber growth so initially you
can see I was hardly getting any
subscriber a day and then it started
growing and I'm seeing a continuous
growth so nowadays I'm getting like
sometimes like 40 subscriber a day which
shows that people are liking my content
and it gives me motivated and gives me
going on my work that's all I had for
today please stay subscribed because I
have so many new and exciting tutorials
coming also if you like my content

up helps me with the YouTube ranking so
I would highly recommend doing that if
you like my tutorials all right thanks
