going to learn what is head in gate head
is a reference to the most recent commit
in the current branch in most of the
cases the reason I said most of the
cases is because there are some cases
where uh this is not the case and we
will cover them later on I have this
gate repository where I have a bunch of
commits which I can list using git log
ok so I have these 3 commits now head is
nothing but a reference to this commit I
can verify by running this command
called git show head this will show me
the head commit this is same as doing
good show this particular commit
okay so they produce the same output so
I can say head is just a short form of
writing this committee okay now let me
make one more commit and see what
happens to get so I'm going to add one
more line here and I will commit that
change so I added this and I will now
commit this it's a kit can make minus M
burger okay when I do that ah and if I
run git log I see this commit and when I
do get show head it will now show me
Burger commit so as you can see in the
diagram the head pointer keeps on moving
and it always not always but in majority
of the cases it refers to the most
recent commit okay now let me show you
another another case where head head
could be useful and that is to do the
diff now we have been running this get
diff to command in our previous tutorial
so this our command is useful to show
the difference between two commits okay
so I'm going to run gift get diff to GaN
to commit so for example our from this
commit to this commit this Pisa line was
a day okay and I want to see the
difference between the snapshot of this
and this so the way you do it is by
running you get lift to the older commit
which is this so I'm just going to copy
pasted that commit and the newer commit
which is this so again I will be copying
and pasting when I do that or the MELD
diff tool will open and it will show me
the difference from left and right you
see this Pisa line was added between
those two commits so this is my old code
this is my new code okay now the same
thing you can do by using
ahead so I can say head now
remember head is here so this commit
will be head tilde one and this comment
will be head tilde - so you always put
the older commits first so I will do
head tilde - and he'll a tilde one you
can just say like head - - you know this
is one and this is this is head this is
head - one head - two so head - - and
her - one okay and when you do that you
will get the same output you will see
that in this particular commit Pisa line
was added okay so this command is just a
short form of running this but the
benefit here is that you don't have to
remember the commit or copy-paste this
long commit ID you can just use this
short form so head at GED it refers to
this head my head tilde one refers to
this head tailor - refers to this
particular commit ID okay now let's see
how good internally manages this head
pointer if you have your code repository
open and if you have if you are showing
are the hidden hidden directories then
there is always a dot get directory in
your current code directly if this is
not visible you can go to Windows
Explorer option and choose the option to
show hidden files okay but once you have
dot get directory open you see bunch of
files here and head is one of the files
now when I open this head file I will
say this so it is referring to a master
branch now if I have two branches for
example
when I do get brunch I have second
branch called
thirsty now when I check out the second
branch my head pointer will actually
move to thirsty so see now it updated
this five and now I have thirsty ah in
my head okay now let me discuss the
scenario where head doesn't point to the
most recent commit that scenario is
called detached head
so sometimes ah when you do get log you
want to go to this previous comment okay
and based on that previous commit you
want to make some changes so you want to
make this particular commit your base
and then want to add further changes
because you want to ignore this in that
case you will do get check out this
commit okay let's see what happens when
we run this command okay
it is showing me this message that you
are in detached head state meaning head
is not pointing to the most recent
commit it is add some older commits okay
and you can see that reflected here as
well usually it's a branch name but now
it is this particular thing okay so now
your head is in a detached state and
when I open my head file head is having
this commit ID for BC etcetera and that
was this commit ID for BC etc so you can
see how it manages all of these things
by using a simple text file okay
all right so now I want to come out of
the detached head state in that case you
can do it check out master and now you
are at master the PISA is the most
recent commit and when you do that you
will come out of the detached head state
all right okay so that was all about
head thank you for watching this video
we'll see you guys in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
