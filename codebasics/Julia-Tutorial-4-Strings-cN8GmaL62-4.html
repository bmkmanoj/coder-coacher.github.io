tutorial let's cover strings in Giulia
today before we talk about strings we
need to talk about characters when you
talk about characters think about
English alphabet letters ABCD etcetera
those letters along with punctuation
mark formed something called an ASCII
standard in early days of computer
revolution if you go to ASCII table comm
website you can see the complete set of
ASCII characters from 0 to 127 here 65
is capital a and this represents a to
see characters in upper case we have
lowercase characters here which you can
see here and all these are repeat all
all these letters corresponds to some
ASCII number for example capital a is 65
ok let's start playing with these
characters in Julia what I have open
here is Julia box dot or website this
allows you to run Julia or terminal or
Julia not book that way you don't have
to install anything on your local
computer you can just run it all from
your browser I'm going to create a Julia
Notebook based on the latest version and
first thing I will do is type in capital
a or to represent a character you need
to use a single quote here okay so this
one is a character in Julia when you say
type off that character
it will say care so care is the datatype
corresponding to this later a what
happened later on after the computer
revolution and ask is standard is that
computers later on started supporting
different languages for example Chinese
Korean Hindi etc and for that they came
up with a new standard called a Unicode
standard in Unicode standard you can get
much more large range of characters for
example if I want to type in any Unicode
character let's say I am going to type
in something in Hindi you have to do
slash u and type in the corresponding
later corresponding number for that
particular character when I say this I
get this particular letter which is ko
that's a Hindi character okay if you
want to print heart symbol and you will
do something like two six six five okay
if you want to take a look at all this
character you can just google unicode
characters and it will take you to this
website which lists all the unicode
character so for example a here
corresponds to zero zero four two
okay similarly the whole bunch of
characters here okay so that was about
characters let's look at how you can war
those characters into integer
and you can use this function int do
convert a character into an individual
number here it converted eight into this
number 65 if you notice before on ASCII
table that corresponding number for
later a was 65 and that's what it is
giving me here
okay you can do a reverse conversion as
well so from number 65 if you want to
get a corresponding letter you can use
this function CH ER when you do that you
get your capital A back you can also do
basic arithmetic operations such as less
than operator for example a is less than
B in terms of sequence so it will say
true but if you say a is greater than B
it's gonna say false because is in terms
of sequence a is less than B you can
compare multiple characters in one shot
like this so this statement holds true
but if you say this then C yeah this is
true but and C is not less than B but
this is going to give me false okay
let's talk about strings now strings are
nothing but a list of characters stored
in a sequence strings characters and
numbers are the most basic type of data
in any programming language so if you
want to create a string in Julia you use
double quote
I'm going to say ice cream somewhere is
coming and I'm craving for an ice cream
so this is how you store ice cream
string in a character called text as you
can see in the diagram internally within
a computer memory the string is stored
as a sequence of characters and these
are stored contiguously in your memory
addresses so if you want to access a
particular character from a string you
can use the index to or get that
character for example to get the first
character I can use text in square
bracket 1 and that will give me the
first character which is I now if you
have any sort of experience with other
programming languages you will see a
huge difference here which is you know
the languages index always starts from 0
versus in julia the string index always
starts from 1 and that's a big
difference in all other programming
languages that the index always starts
from 0 ok if you make up all of other
examples of indexes so text too is
giving me C because just at the second
location I have C store if you want to
get the character at the very end then
you can use this specific constant
called en D and that will give you
in the end character which is M in ice
cream you can also do text to get the
second last character in the string you
can do and minus one that was about
extracting a single character out of a
string how about if I want to extract a
substring from within a string for
example for my screen I want to retrieve
ice for that you can use range indexing
and the way it works is you specify your
first index so for example for ice my
first index is 1 and then you type Colin
and the end index which in this case
will be 3 when I do that I will get ice
back so this is the one is my start
index and 3 is my end index and it will
give me substring from that particular
string how about if I want to get our
remaining string for example I don't
want to get ice but the remaining part
of the string so my starting index with
before and my index index ending index
will be e and the end so that will give
me space screen ok cool so now how about
if I have Unicode characters in my
string for example what if my string is
Chinese so let's do so I'm going to just
copy paste a Chinese character I just
did Google and I just copy pasted it ok
so if you do this this is my string with
a Chinese character and if you do type
off on that one it will tell me it is a
UTF string now compare that with type up
a simple English string so for in simple
English string it can use this ASCII
table ASCII or standard and that's why
it is saying it is an ASCII string
whereas for other languages it needs to
use Unicode and for Unicode it uses
utf-8 encoding and that's why it is
saying utf-8 string here ok if I want to
say I love you and you want to just
replace lo with specific hard character
then this is how we do it here I know
that the unicode character for heart is
you - 6 6 5 that's why I'm using that
here MLS hit Enter alter enter it says I
love you ok
now let's cover some basic operations on
string the most basic operation that one
can perform on strings is concatenation
when you're doing programming often you
will have a need of concatenating
two strings concatenating meaning
joining two strings together for that
you can use the function string
here in string I can help my foster
string and then I can have my second
string when I do that I will get this
okay it will join those strings together
and it will give that as an output now
in Python or in many other languages the
plus operators work so if you do a plus
B it will walk but not that that will
not work in Julia
it will give this error so you have to
either use string or the other approach
that you can use is Paul style
interpolation so if you have two
different variables that set isn't my
first failure both storing a for my
first ring and my second variable is B
which is storing my second string and if
I want to join these two together I can
say quote dollar a space dollar B dollar
a means the value of a space dollar B
means the value of B when I do that I
will get a concatenated string again
this is poor style interpolation but
which is supported in julia with this
particular syntax you can join strings
with any other type of variable for
example you have tour variable which is
a number and if you want to join that
with the string less with the string in
variable a you can do this and crystal
work how what do you have the fourth
character which is actually an array
so here D one two three is an array and
if you want to join that with your
string variable you can still do that
and here is what you'll get okay the
next operation we want to cover is
search so if you have a string a long
string and you want to search for a
particular character or a substring you
can use search function I can say search
love I'm going to find a character Oh
for example when I do that it gives me
the index back so the O is at index
number two one two that's why it is
returning me - you can also look for a
substring so for example I want to
search for ve and it will give me the
index index range for that substring so
in string l.o.v.e my ve is at zero one
no sorry one two three four that's why
it is giving me three for index range
back okay if what if you don't have that
particular character or substring in
that given string in that case it will
return zero zero means string is not
found or character is not formed okay
the last set of operation we want to go
over is contains contains is similar to
search but instead of returning and
index it will return you either true or
false
so when you say does love contain al
it will say contains is no matter much
oh I see contains doesn't support
character actually it's suppose only
substring search so let me search for
substring so I have the string I love
Julia and I am looking for string love
in that so whether I love Julia contains
love or not it says true yeah it has a
lot of love in it nice Julia such force
random substring XYZ it will say force
because I love Julia doesn't contain XYZ
okay that was all about strings in Julia
