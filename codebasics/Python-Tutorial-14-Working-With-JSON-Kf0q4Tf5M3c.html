scoring tutorials
today's topic is working with JSON
objects in Python and here is the list
of items we are covering in this video
let's begin with what is JSON full form
of JSON is JavaScript object notation it
is a data exchange format similar to XML
let's understand this by looking at an
address record we have this person
called Tom and here is his address book
record the way you represent this in
JSON format is you will have bunch of
keys so here name address phone are keys
and their corresponding values which is
storm his address and a phone number the
JSON objects opens and closes with these
curly brackets here is the similar
representation of the same object in XML
format as you can see here in XML the
difference is each of these keys are
represented as opening and closing tags
that's why this takes up lot more volume
of data and hence it is not as
lightweight as JSON JSON is much more
lightweight and that's the reason why
jason is gaining a lot of popularity
nowadays ok now let's work on a problem
of creating an address book so they are
what we are going to do is we'll create
another spoke will write bunch of
records into it and then we will save it
as a file on our computer then we will
write a second program to read that I
just book and print those address book
records
ok so first I am going to create a
dictionary object
there is no object called a JSON in
Python pythons native objects are either
numbers streams dictionaries etc G zone
is just a concept json is basically a a
format which is implemented by different
languages so all c++ JavaScript Python
all languages supports it but otherwise
is a very generic concept versus
dictionary is just specific to Python
okay
here in this dictionary we'll add a
first try code for Tom and we'll see his
name is Tom his address is this and the
phone number is this okay let's create
another object another record rather in
our book dictionary and we are going to
call it Bob and Bob's address is this
again let's type in some random phone
number okay now what we will do is we
will import a JSON module so that is the
standard model available in Python
called JSON and once you import it you
can call this method called
dump as
what this is doing is it is taking
dictionary object which is booked as an
input then it is dumping it as a string
that's why we have a string here and
then it converts this dictionary object
into a string it will convert it into a
JSON format that's why we have they're
using JSON model here so when you say s
equal to this the string s will be in
JSON format
let's first print it and see how it
looks when you say run address as you
can see here in the output this thing is
a big string but it is in a JSON format
it has all opening closing brackets
Collins two separate keys and values and
so on okay now we will write this to a
file so I'll just remove this and I'll
say with open sea
data book tour txt we are going to save
this address book n C data book dot txt
file and if you remember from my file
tutorial if you want to write to a file
you have to use W here you will just say
F dot write s so this will write the
string just string to a file let's
execute this excellent
it says program finish with exit code
zero means there are no errors now let's
go and check our C data directly so I
have C data directory here and i am
seeing book dot txt file if i open it i
see the content that I wrote to that
file this content is in a JSON format
that want it now is that once you have
content into a JSON format you can write
a C++ program or let's say JavaScript
program to open this and read the add of
the those objects successfully okay
that's why it's called JSON is a data
exchange format so you can exchange data
from your Python program to C program
okay but here to read that we are going
to use another Python program and for
that I will use idles so let me bring my
idle here and using idle I will write
another program that reads those records
one by one okay
so again you have to use all year to
first open the file
and this time I will use our because I
am reading it for writing you use W okay
you will say s equal to F dot read this
is going to read the whole file into
this variable called s if you print s it
looks like this you have entire files
contained into this variable now if you
want to lesson know Bob's phone number
you have to use a JSON module to read
this JSON string and pass it into a JSON
object okay so I will import JSON module
here and I will use another matter
called json dot load string that's why
it is load as lower string s okay and
once it loads it what it will do is it
will convert that string into our
dictionary so I will say book okay if I
from book here the difference between
this output and the next output is this
guy was a string versus this guy here is
a dictionary you can confirm it using
type function type of book is a date
alright how do I know Bob's phone number
first
let's print box and our address book
record when you do this
it is printing the hole at a spoke
record for Bob okay if you want to now
know the phone number you will safe Bob
and phone okay
this is printing his phone number once
you convert it to a dictionary object it
is very easy to access the information
within that big object using the keys
and that that's the power of JSON and
dictionaries alright next thing we are
going to do is now we are going to print
all the address book records in our book
for that you have to use for loop you
say for person and book print book
person this is going through all of the
keys in the dictionary one by one and we
are printing the corresponding values
excellent so it printed all these
records one by one you can have like
hundreds of records it will still work
fine okay
so that was all about JSON object we
covered how to read and how to write
JSON objects and how to convert them to
dictionary back and forth okay thanks
