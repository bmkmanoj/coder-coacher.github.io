numbers are very important ingredient of
any program I can't think of any
software program in the world which
doesn't use numbers so they are
extremely important
now in Python you can use Python
programming language as a calculator so
let me demonstrate that to you by doing
some simple mathematical operations so
for example you want to do addition of
these two numbers you can do it like
this so just type in two numbers and
plus sign in between if you want to do
subtraction you can do subtraction you
can do division like this so for
division you will use this last shine if
you want to do multiplication
you'd use star sign and it will multiply
two numbers now if you want to find a
remainder of a division then you will
use a percentage sign
so for example I want to divide 11 by 2
and I want to find out the remainder for
that you would use percentage sign like
this and you can guess what will be the
answer ok I think you guessed it right
so 11 divided by 2 is like 2 into 5 is
10 and that remainder will be 1 you can
also find the power of n number so for
example you want to find 3 to the power
of 2 then the way you do that is by
using 2 star sign 2 times so it will do
this so 3 to the power of 2 is 9
guess what will be the answer of this
thus to ^ for da 16 okay so when you are
doing any number manipulation when
you're writing any pattern program
normally you would create variables to
store these numbers and you will do
these mathematical operations on those
variables okay so let me let me
demonstrate this by having a simple
problem so for example you want to
travel from New York to Baltimore and
then from Baltimore to Pittsburgh and
you don't know the distance between
these cities now you want to find out
the total distance so the way you do it
is you first create a variable to store
the distance between New York City to
Baltimore let's say it is 188 miles so I
just created a variable called this an
assigned value hundred eighty eight to
it then you create another variable to
store the distance between Baltimore to
Pittsburgh and let's say this is 247
miles okay so to find out the total
distance you create another variable
called total distance and you just
assign those first two variables to it
so when I do like this and if I bring
the total distance it will tell me the
total distance that I will be traveling
during my journey okay
another interesting problem could be
let's say if you are driving at 65 miles
per hour and you want to find the total
time
that you will span in your journey and
we're just assuming you're not taking
any breaks you are like a super human
being you don't need any place you can
just constantly Drive okay so in that
case again create another variable for
your miles per hour speed so mph is
equal to 65 this is your miles per hour
and to find out the time you create
another variable called time and say
time equal to total distance if you have
total distance and if you have miles per
hour
how do you find out a time right it's a
simple map it is distance divided by the
speed so distance divided by miles per
hour is your time it's just a simple
high school math or school math so when
you say time it prints this number so
you see it's six point sixty nine hours
now it is printing it with a lot higher
decimal precision you see like after dot
you see so many decimal points if you
want to see like just for simplicity if
you want to see like two decimal points
you can use this round function so in
Python there is this function called
round where the first argument is as you
see it in the tooltip it's a number so
your number is time and how many decimal
points you want to see so you can say
two so it is showing it as you see like
after dot you you know see only two
decimal points one two if you want to
see like three decimal point precision
you can do this and it will show you
three decimal points okay
so just to summarize you can do all the
basic mathematical operations in Python
using these operator signs also there
are two kind of numbers in Python one is
integer which is like a whole number so
for example for 35 16 2
all these are indigent numbers because
they don't have a fractional part to it
whereas this number is called a floor
number because it has a fractional part
it's not a whole number basically it has
a fraction to it so just remember this
thing the two types of numbers integers
and floats all right now let me show you
something interesting so if I do let's
say if I want to add and if I do this
kind of operation just take a pause and
think about what will be the answer what
what will be the expected output okay
all right so I'm just about to hit enter
and you will see in a moment what it it
prints now what were you expecting some
of you might be expecting that it will
do 10 plus 2 which is well and then it
will multiply it by 3 so 12 into 3 will
be 36 but that's not what it printed why
well the reason is the way python works
is it has a priority on certain
mathematical operations so for example
in this case it will do 2 x 3 forced so
2 x 3 is 6 and then it will add it to 10
so 10 plus 6 is 16 if you want to do
what you expect there which is 10 plus 2
and then multiply by 3 you need to use
brackets so opening bracket 10 plus 2
closing bracket cross 3 so by providing
these brackets you are telling your
programming platform that I want the
mathematical operation to happen in this
order 10 plus 2 and then
now you get 36 okay cool now let me show
you one more interesting thing so six
minus five point seven okay take a pause
and think what will be the answer it's
really easy to guess that right it
should be zero point three but let's see
what happens
whoo why the hell I got this answer why
is it not zero point three well there is
an answer so in any programming language
then you try to store floating number it
ultimately numbers are stored in binary
format which is a sequence of zero and
one and the whey protein numbers are
stored they always lose the accuracy so
there is no precise way to store
floating numbers hence you will get this
kind of behavior and this is not just
with Python this is with any programming
languages and it's expected so it's not
a bug or anything it is an expected
output so if you want to again see point
three then use rounding number round
rounding function so just say wrong this
particular number by two decimal points
and you get zero point three okay so
that was all about numbers thanks for
watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
