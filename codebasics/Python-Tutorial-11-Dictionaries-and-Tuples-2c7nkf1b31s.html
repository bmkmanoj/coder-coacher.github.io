session of coal basics we're learning
coal is made extremely easy and
intuitive today we are going to talk
about dictionaries and tuples in Python
and here is the list of topics that we
are going to cover in this video
tutorial ok let's begin with a
dictionary or dictionary is something
that allows you to store key value pairs
they are also known as maps hash table
associative arrays and the classical
example of a dictionary is a telephone
directory so let's see if you want to
build a telephone directory in Python
how would you do it you will use
dictionary for that purpose you will
create a variable called D you can give
any variable name here and in a
telephone directory as you all know what
you have is a person name and a
telephone number of that person so what
I just did is opening curly bracket name
of the person callin the telephone
number of that person then my second
friend is job and his telephone number
is this and here is the third entry in
the dictionary so you can keep on adding
values like this what this will do is
when I print D it will create dictionary
for your phone book now if you want to
access any element then you can access
it by using the person name so let's say
I want to know a phone number of Tom I
can retrieve it by doing this what we
are doing here is tom is called a key in
the dictionary using the key we are
accessing the value which is the
telephone
so you use these kind of square bracket
or to retrieve the values based on the
keys now
dictionary sounds similar to lists but
in the list you retrieve values using
the index whereas here you retrieve the
values using key which could be anything
it could be a string it could be number
it could be anything okay
now let's cover some basic operations
how do you add a new entry in the
dictionary so I want to add a new
telephone number let's say Sam just
register a new telephone number for
himself if you want to add that into
existing dictionary you can add it like
this and once you print D you will see
Sam is here now here one thing you
noticed is when you initialize this
dictionary the order was Tom Rob Jo and
the order is different here because in
dictionaries order doesn't matter the
sole purpose of dictionary is to access
values using keys hence the order has no
importance here and that's why you are
seeing some randomness here next thing
is how do you delete an entry from a
dictionary so you use de al c'mon and
using de al you can just say something
like this SSM wants to unregister his
telephone number and remove the entry
from the telephone directory once you do
that if you print d you won't see sam
here we are back to three values
next item is how to print all the
directory values for that you can use
for loop you can say for key in d what
this will do is it will light it through
each of these keys one two three
for all those three things what do you
want to do you want to print key and
value so you will say key is key and the
value is how do you get the value from
the dictionary using the square bracket
to say key once you do that you will
just I to throw all the values all the
keys and retrieve the values by using
those keys another way to do the same
thing would be to use the topple so you
say for caseless v indeed or items so
when you sell your items it is returning
you these pass key value pairs and to
get the key value pairs you use
something like this you can say friend
you are doing pretty much the same thing
except that the value you are getting in
this variable called V okay so these two
are this they basically saw the same
purpose okay now how do you check if a
specific person's name is in the
dictionary or not in this dictionary we
have Tom raw banjo and I want to know if
tom is present in the dictionary for
that you use in operator if you recall
for list also be used in operator so if
you say tom in d then it will return
true because tom is present inside the
text now let me print dictionary one
more time if I say sameer in D it was a
false because there is no entry for this
person in our telephone directory okay
now all the phone numbers in my
getting change and I want to trash all
the entries from my telephone directory
how do you do that you just say the dot
clear and that will wipe out everything
and you are left with an empty
dictionary so that was all about
dictionaries remember one thing
dictionaries are pretty useful they're
used heavily whoever is doing Python
programming they use dictionary often so
it is very important to learn this
concept the next topic is tuples tuples
is nothing but a list of values grouped
together for example you want to
represent a geometric point in two
dimensional plane
how do you do that you use Topol so you
create a variable called point equal to
let's say your x coordinates value is 5
and your y coordinate is 9 so you will
use this kind of brackets and here is
how you define a top also what you got
here is a tapa it sounds similar to a
list let me show you how point remember
like lists if you want to access it you
can access it using an index so
similarly double also if you want to
access different values you can access
them using an index so you say point one
and it will print the second value but
there are some differences the most
basic difference between the list and
topple is that in list all the values
have a same meaning whereas Interpol all
values have a different meaning when the
values have are different meaning
they're called heterogeneous values and
then they have seen meaning they are
called homogeneous values here in this
example 5 n 9 a represent different
concept one is X Co
and the second one is y-coordinate
that's why it is appropriate to use
double if all values will seem less if
all values where x-coordinates then you
will use list some other examples of
list are expense list where all values
are basically an expense or a list of
people's names where each value is a
name of the person few examples of
toppers are point a dress sewing a dress
together this one purpose which is it is
an address of one person but if you look
at each individual values they are
different one is the street name the
other one is city name the third one is
the zip code okay
the second difference between list and
topple is that topples are immutable
what I mean by that is if you try to
change a value of a top also in point 0
now remember you will be able to do this
with a list but when you do it with a
double you get this an at this error
okay so that was all about dictionaries
and tuples thanks for watching
you
