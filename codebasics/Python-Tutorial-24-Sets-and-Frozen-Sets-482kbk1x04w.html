tutorial today we have another fun topic
call sets and frozen sets let's begin
with the formal definition of set a set
is an unordered collection of unique
elements so this is something that you
already learnt in your mathematics class
while you were in school this is exactly
the same thing so I'm going to
initialize my first set so let's say I
have a basket of fruits and I want to
represent that using the set in Python
so this is how I do it you should use
curly brackets it and then you should
add all your elements in the sand in
this set so I have a bunch of fruits
that I have placed in my basket I like I
like I love mango by the way it's summer
and in India the lot of mangoes coming
out and it tastes so good
and then I have some repeated elements
so I have to April's in my basket two
oranges and one mango so I just created
a set when I do type of basket it is
telling me that the type is set now
let's bring the content of basket when I
do that you notice that orange ORS
phrasing two times in my basket but this
one is just showing one time so that's
what unique element aspect means a set
doesn't allow duplicate elements so it
will remove the pickets automatically so
that could be useful when you want to
have on the unique elements for doing
anything okay there is another way to
initialize set which is by doing this so
you can just initialize set like this
and then you can add the elements into
it so for example I'm going to add
whatever number we add
so I a dot ad okay when I print a I get
one and two all right now when you
initialize the set using the first
syntax which is curly brackets remember
that you don't use our empty curly
brackets because when you do that it is
going to initialize it as dictionary you
see this and if I have a is equal to
something if I have as long as I have
some content into it it will only scope
or always make it a set okay so remember
not to use this another interesting
thing about set is they are unordered so
you cannot use the index of for example
in basket I want to access orange I
cannot do this basket so this is not
allowed so that's the basic difference
between a list and a set so list allows
index operation set does not allow it
lists allows duplicate elements set
doesn't allow it and that's one of the
primary use case of sad that if whenever
you want to remove duplicate elements
from a list you use set for example if
you have a list of numbers right so I
have
list of numbers and as you see two three
and four are repeated so that duplicate
now when you are doing programming you
will most frequently encounter this need
of remove removing duplicate elements
from a list whenever you are faced that
kind of situation you should always use
set and set supports taking lists as an
input in the constructor so I am
creating a set object here and this is
my constructor and I am passing list as
an input and it is allowed so when you
print are unique numbers here you will
see all the unique numbers in the list
okay now as we saw previously if you
want to add any new element or that are
sad you can always add it and it printed
is going to work fine now often there
are needs where you want your set to be
frozen frozen meaning you should not be
able to change the content of your set
in that case you have to use our frozen
set so to initialize a frozen set you
can use frozen set
can say numbers okay so when you print
frozen set is going to print again edit
the same thing so frozen set and set are
exactly same they are unordered lists
they remove duplicate as you see here to
remove the duplicate from this list but
the only difference between seven frozen
set is it doesn't allow to add a new
element so you saw it's not allowing so
you cannot change the context of content
of your frozen set
okay now let's cover some basic
operation that a sat coerce here I have
a set called X which has elements a b c
or it covers a it supports in operator
you can say a in x move the true but act
whatever G in X will false also if you
want to iterate over all the elements
and you can use syntax similar to a list
so you can say for I and X so it
supports I travel I Twitter you can
alter it over all the elements like this
now if you have another set
let's say here I have another cellphone
why is having these three elements a G
and H right so access this why has this
I want to find out a union of these two
right in basic set theory there are
certain common operations such as Union
intersection subset etcetera so in
Python all of those things are
supporting our to find out Union you can
use our operator X or Y so as you see a
was calm and so it's just present one
time and then it has all the elements
from both the sets if you want to find
out an inter inter section you use and
operation x and y and you see only
element common in both the sides is a
henson it printed a you can also find
out a difference so you can say X minus
y and that's going to print B and C
because from X if you subtract Y is the
common element so it will subtract a and
what is left is B and C it also supports
subset so if you want to check whether X
is a subset of Y you can say X less than
Y now here of course X is not a subset
of Y if a set is a subset of another set
it should have the second set should
have all the elements from the first set
so here I'm going to change ax set and
I'm going to say okay
it has H and G
two elements okay and my wife already
has a gingy now I do X less than Y it's
going to say true
okay so that was all about sad
operations
thank you for watching the three</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
