Python now what are variables variables
are containers that can hold any data so
you can use them to store numerical data
tax data etc so let's say you want to
track down your monthly expenses in
Python programming language what you
need to do first to solve this problem
is store unusual expenses in some place
and then use that place to do a sum of
all those Angeles individual expenses to
come up with your total expense so we'll
go ahead and create variable to store
all these individual expenses so for
example this on rent you are spending
1,200 $20 so what we just did here is we
created this variable called rent and we
placed value 1220 into it so using
assignment operator you can put a value
inside a variable so the left on the
left hand side of the assignment
operator is a variable name and right
hand side is the value similarly you can
create variables for other items for
example you are spending 202 dollar and
five cents on gas and you're spending
some money on groceries so we just
create a three variables now if you
print that value you can print it like
this so by using the statement you what
you are doing is you are accessing this
variable called rent and you are
printing the value in it
okay now to calculate the total monthly
expenses all you do is just add those
three things
and this is the sin text on how to do it
in Python so you created a fourth
variable called total and you added all
these three individual values in it so
if you put in total you'll get this okay
now variables are called variables
because the value in it can vary so for
example now let's say instead your rent
went up and it become $1400 so you can
use the same variable and assign a
different value so again the container
is same is just that you now remove the
previous value and you put the new value
in it okay all right you can also put
tax data into it so for example now I
want to store the name of those inducer
group of expense items so you can create
a variable called item and put the name
item might into was gas and might and
three was groceries so this way now you
can just print all the sized items so
you can say my expense items where these
so you see like when you do this it is
printing the value inside these three
variables now there are certain rules on
variable naming conventions so for
example you cannot use certain Python
key words like the the predefined key
words as variable name for example true
is a key word in Python what I mean by
that is it has a specific meaning in
Python so you cannot use it as a
variable name so if you try to do that
you will get this error to get a
complete list of files and key words you
can just google it and you'll get a list
so don't use that list as variable names
other than that you cannot use special
characters in it for example if I create
a variable like this then also it won't
work because I have a plus sign here
okay so that was all about variable
thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
