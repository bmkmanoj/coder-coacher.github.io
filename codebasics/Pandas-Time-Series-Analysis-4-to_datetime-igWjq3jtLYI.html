going to cover to date time method of
pandas to see how it can be used to
process different times one of the
common problem in data analysis is the
lake of uniformity in the structure of
input data for example since January
2017 can be represented in all these
different formats and many times when
you're processing data it can come in
any of these string formats and the
challenge for you is to convert it to a
common concept called sis January 2017
as a date/time data type I'm going to
show you how you can use to the time
function to perform this conversion as
usual I have launched my Jupiter not
took and I have all these different
string formats in this dates list you
can use pandas to date/time method and
pass this list as an input and it will
successfully convert all this variety of
formats into a date/time which is
January not only this it can handle
times also so right now you have only
date let's say you are referring to 2:30
p.m. on 1st January you can represent
the same thing as 1430 and it should be
able to handle it fine you can see that
here now in u.s. the date format is
mmddyy YY but in europe we have dates
first so in europe if you want to say
swift january you will say it like this
and if you pass that to pandas
take time two days time function then it
will think that you are talking about
forced me because it is going by mm DD
whatever for
so to handle Europe dates you need to
supply this argument called Dave first
and set it to true and then it will
convert it to a 5th January you can see
that here you can use your own custom
format also for example let's say
instead of slash you have dollar as a
delimiter in that case by default to
date time function won't work because it
doesn't know how to pass this string but
you can help it by supplying a format
argument in format argument you will see
the first thing is day and the way you
do that is by typing percentage D then
you a dollar then you have percentage M
which is your month and then percentage
why I'm missing dollar here and you can
see that it works you can help pretty
much anything you just need to help to
date time function clarify the format
and it should work okay now going back
to my original method here what happens
if you supply a garbage string this ABC
is and invalidates change by default it
is going to throw a value error
exception and the reason behind this is
that in to date time function
documentation errors are said to be
raised and what it means is that invalid
string will cause an exception if you
want to ignore the invalid string then
you can just supply ignore as errors
argument so here I'm going to say errors
is equal to ignore and then it will
ignore the errors and it will not
perform the
time our daytime conversion for any of
these strings if you want to just ignore
this particular invalid string and still
perform the conversion for rest of it
then you will supply this argument and
the invalid string will be converted to
not a timestamp but you can see that
rest of the strings are converted fine
now what if your input date/time is
coming in UNIX epoch format unix time or
epoch time is number of seconds that
have passed since January 1st 1970 and
if you google for epub converter you get
this website where it will show you the
epoch equivalent of current date time I
am going to take this and store it in
this key variable and then call pandas
to date/time function on this now if you
again open the documentation you can
find that there is an argument called
unit which is set to nanosecond by
default and this is for UNIX epoch time
or you need to set this argument to be
seconds because the tea that I am
supplying is number of seconds since
January 1st 1970 you can see that it
converts this particular unix time
number into human readable or date-time
format you can also convert the same
thing into date time index by supplying
it as an array and I'm going to now
store that into a variable and then to
convert back to epoch you can just say
DT dot value integer 64 convert my date
time index into English is 64
okay the correct name of the matter is
actually view not the value now you can
see that you got back your epoch time
which is same as this guy here and you
got extra zeros because by default it is
giving you nanoseconds that was all I
had about two day time function it is
pretty useful makes your job really
really easy when you are dealing with
dates and times highly recommended that
you use this or and that's all that's
all I had for this tutorial I have a
link of this Jupiter not book in the
video description below thank you very
much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
