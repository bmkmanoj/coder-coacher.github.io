are living under a rock you might have
heard these terms already and the reason
is code is such an important part of our
life all the devices that we use cell
phone computers tower flight camera
microwave everything has code in it not
only these devices but let's say banking
software retail software video games and
our internet everything is driven by
code so if you want to understand what
code is and how it all works just stay
with me okay I'm going to explain code
by giving an example of a servant when
you have a servant in home you can give
him commands like prepare food serve it
to me go wash my car and the servant
will perform those tasks for you
similarly computer is your servant of
course it cannot go and wash car for you
it can do things like numeric
computation browsing internet and so on
so for example you want the computer to
read excel file and sum all the numbers
in every line you can ask computer to do
that but if you ask this in a plain
English language here is what's gonna
happen look at the sad face computer
doesn't understand English so it's not
gonna do anything if you just tell it in
English language so then what language
computer understand the language that
computer understands is called
programming language and all these are
examples of programming languages so
just to give you the analogy humans will
understand languages like English
Russian Spanish Chinese and so on versus
computer will understand all this
programming languages ok so yeah you can
now tell computer the same thing in this
code which is returned in Python
programming language
so here is the list of commands written
in Python programming language and when
you give these commands along with this
file to a computer computer is gonna
happily understand that and produce this
output look at the happy face so to go
over a definition code or program is a
list of instructions written in a
programming language now let's see how
it all works underneath when you give
core to your computer this big piece
here is a computer and here is the same
code when you give this code to a
computer it's gonna first go to a Python
interpreter now this code is in Python
programming language hence it is going
to Python interpreter Python interpreter
is just a piece of software that comes
with with Python installation and it's
gonna convert that code into something
called assembly code okay and this
assembly code is then given to a CPU in
your computer CPU is basically a central
processing unit you can think of it as a
brain of your computer and then it's
gonna produce the output that you need
ok so now the question that will come to
your mind is why don't we directly write
our code in assembly language well the
thing is as you can see this assembly
code is very hard to write and
understand verses this is more like
English which you can easily write and
maintain in old days people used to
write code in assembly but as your
software program grows it's kind of hard
to manage it and it's even hard to it
takes a long time to write this code
that's why humans invented all these
different programming languages ok so
that was a short introduction on code
and programming language I hope you have
little better understanding of all these
terms
thank you very much for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
