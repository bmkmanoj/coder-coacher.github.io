what is list let's understand this by
working on this sample problem we all go
to grocery stores what do we do when we
are about to leave for grocery stores
yes you guessed it right we make our
grocery list the list of items that we
won't buy from grocery store if you want
to store this list of items in Python
and parent them later on with whatever
we have learnt so far what you will do
is you will essentially create different
variable for different items for example
you say item 1 is equal to bread item 2
equal to pasta let's say these are all
the items that you are buying from a
grocery store an item 3 equal to let's
say you want to buy some fruits so you
will create these kind of variables but
the problem here is you're creating so
many variables if you have like say 10
items to buy from a grocery store you
will create 10 variables and that's
little bit tedious a programming
language should have something better
correct our list comes to a rescue in
this kind of situation so to do the same
thing in a list what you do is again you
create a variable which is going to
store a list so you say items equal to
now to start a list you'll open open
you'll use open square bracket then you
add all your items in the list separated
by comma
faster my tour item that I want to buy
is fruit and I love veggies so let me
buy some veggies as well and closing
square bracket then I hit enter I just
created a list and the list got stored
in items variable so when I print items
I will see this list so as you see in
the diagram the way list is stored
internal in computer memories is it is a
sequence of memory locations where each
of these items are stored and these
locations are accessed by the index so
items will point to a starting location
and each of these items will be the say
bread will be at 0th index pasta is at 1
index and so on so this is similar to
strings if you have this into my strings
episode you're kind of recall some
similarity between that and the list all
right now if you want to access each of
these individual individual items you
can do so by using then Dec so if you
use bracket 0 hit enter then it will
print bread how do you access this item
ok again use the index and this is
stored at 0 1 2 so fruits is at number 2
cool now let's say I made a list I'm
about to go to grocery store and I
change my mind
now instead of bread I want to buy chips
how do I modify my list well just two
items 0 so this is the location at which
bread is stored and you say equal to
sign
chips okay
so what we just did is in this list at
zero location we placed chips instead of
bread so now if you print items you see
you notice a difference between this
list and this one
the first item got changed from bread to
chips so this is how you change the
value of individual element within a
list okay now how do you access a range
of elements so for example I want to
print first two elements from the list
again you can use the sub index range if
you recall from my string episode so you
just use the starting index so which is
zero so let's say you want to print in
this list you want to bring chips and
pasta so chips is stored at zero
location and call in pasta is at 1 but
you don't specify one because the way
Python index works is the second the
second index is always excluded so you
have to say 1 plus 1 which is 2
and if you do that it will print chips
and pasta let's say you want to print
the last element in the list for that
you can use a negative index so negative
1 means index number 1 but from the end
all right you can also use a pen there
is a method called a pen which can be
used to append an element so for example
let me just reinitialize my list if you
do ctrl C like this and control V it
will again reinitialize the list so your
items is again back to the same state
now you are going to grocery store with
this list of items and all of a sudden
you recall that you have to buy butter
as well
so you will just say items dot app and
bracket butter okay let's see what
happens
nice so you see like this was our
original list up till here and when you
say app and it just appended butter
towards the end but now in the grocery
store butter is in the near most aisle
as the bread so you I really want to
have butter at the second place in your
inducer list how do you do that so let
me again or initialize the list so that
we are back to the original state so let
me just confirm okay I don't have butter
now I want to now insert butter at this
location immediately after bread so I
say items dot insert okay so what insert
will do is rather than appending at the
end it will insert an element at a
specific location as you see in the
tooltip it is showing you some help so
index means the index at which you want
to insert it so at which index you want
to insert it so bread is 0 and 1 so at 1
is the location where you want to insert
it so butter and enter let's see what we
got
voila so after bread now I have butter
all right
now what do you do if you want to join
two lists so you're going to grocery
store and you prepare a list of all food
items so let's say you have all your
food items here and your wife made a
list of
all the bathroom items right so you now
have got like two lists one is the four
items and your wife has made a list of
all the bathroom items so let's say this
is the list that she's having and as you
both are going to go sister together you
want to just have a 1-1 single list so
how do you do that so you can say my
items is equal to 4 plus bathroom so
this way by using plus sign so what
you're doing here is food is a variable
pointing to one list bathroom is a
variable pointing to another list when
you say food plus bathroom it is going
to join these two lists together and on
the left-hand side of equal to sign is
another variable called items and it
will assign that list to it so if you
print items you will get this so now
you've got the combined list okay now if
I have a list which is food and if I
want to insert just single item can I do
like this let's try it what happens so I
want to buy soda as well if you do this
then it won't work because you cannot
add string or any odd number to a list
whenever you drink plus sign here to
make sure on the left-hand side as well
as on the right side both the things
should be list okay so that was about
concatenation you can figure out the
length of the list using this command
line so now I got all these items in my
list right so I have these many items
and I want to know how many items I'm
going to buy from the grocery store so
for that use this function land
so when you say Ally and opening bracket
items
it is going to print the land of these
items so as you see it's 5 1 2 3 4 5
okay all right now I have this long list
and I'm doing my shopping I want to know
whether I added fruits to my list or not
how did I do that I can just read this
list one by one this is a simple one but
less if your long list and if you are
using a powerful programming language
like Python you don't want to read these
items one by one there should be a
better way of doing it right and that
way is the in operator so you can say
bread in items and it will say true
right if you say soda in items and it
says false because it didn't find soda
an item so whenever you want to look up
in the list you can use this operator in
alright so that was all about lists
thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
