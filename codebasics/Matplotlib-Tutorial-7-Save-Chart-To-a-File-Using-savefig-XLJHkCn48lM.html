you can save matplotlib chart to a file
I have this pie chart which I'm going to
save it to a PNG file for this you can
use save trig function and in bracket
supply the name of the file I want to
save it as a PNG file and when I execute
this and when I go to my directory here
I got this chart now I see that this
chart is cut off so it is not fitting
the area very well so let me see what's
going on so if I open savefig
documentation then I have various
arguments here one of which is Bbox
inches so if you supply Bbox
inches to be tight it's gonna fit your
chart in the output file very well so
now when I open this chart you can see
that the chart is exactly fitting with
all the labels and everything is now
perfectly fit into a chart sometimes you
want to have an extra padding so here
you can see that these labels are almost
touching the border let's say you want
to have some extra padding and extra
space then you can use another argument
which is pad inches so pad inches it
says that it is the padding let's say I
want two inch of padding and when I run
this and when I reopen the chart you
will see I got this extra two inch
padding around my chart one more
argument to try out is transparent so if
transparent is set to true it will set
the background of the chart to be
transparent that way if you want to put
it on your website or you want to
overlay on top of another
chart or background then it becomes
really helpful so now you can see that
the background is transparent you can
check the documentation for rest of the
arguments there is orientation paper
type frame on there are like color so
right now my edge color was white by
default you can also change the color to
be something else you can also save
chart as a PDF file and this time let me
save the chart to a different location
so in order to save it to a different
location you have to specify the
absolute part so when I run this now I
need to go to C code directory so here I
have C code directly and I can see that
it generated pie-chart dot PDF file
which is here and when I open the PDF I
will see this chart here okay so that's
all I had for saving charts I have
provided link to this Jupiter not book
in a video description below also I have
an exercise for you to try it out so I
highly recommend that you download this
Jupiter notebook and you try out that
exercise so that you have an effective
learning just by watching this video
you're not going to learn it you have to
try this out alright thank you very much
for watching goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
