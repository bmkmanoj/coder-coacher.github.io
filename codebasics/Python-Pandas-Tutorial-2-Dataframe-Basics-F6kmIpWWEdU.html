going to cover data frame basics in
pandas now if you don't know what is
Ponder's then you can watch my tutorials
on pandas introduction first okay
now data frame is a main object in
pandas framework if you are using pandas
you are almost always going to use data
frame data frame is a data structure
used to represent tabular data such as
this excel file here you can see that in
any excel file
what you have is rows and columns so it
is basically a tabular data and if you
want to represent this data in to fund
us then you are using a data frame
object okay now for this tutorial I'm
going to use cue Peter not book you can
use whatever ID you prefer you can use
py charm not pay plus plus whatever
you're comfortable with I'm using
Jupiter not book because it is great
with data visualization so the way you
launch Jupiter not book is simply around
Jupiter not book come on on your command
prompt now I have a separate tutorial on
how to install anaconda so if you follow
that and install anaconda you will end
up installing both Jupiter not book and
pond us okay so I assume that you have
followed that tutorial and install
anaconda after that you come to command
prompt run Jupiter not book and it is
going to launch your not book alright
now I'm going to create a new notebook
by clicking on new Python commands here
right now before we begin writing code
let's look at list of topics that we are
going to cover today alright first thing
we are going to do is import pandas
module in our notebook so you will say
import pandas s.pd okay and then you
will create a
data frame by saying DF is equal to PD
dot now the method I am going to use is
read CSV okay so I have this comma
separated excel file which contains
weather data so it has number of days
the temperature wind speed event
etcetera okay
so I am going to import this data into
my data frame okay so read CSV takes a
path of your CSV file as an input and if
you are having your CSV file at some
other location then the not book that
you are running here then you need to
specify the full path okay when you run
this the star that you are seeing here
means that it was running that okay now
it successfully created your data frame
here now first thing we are going to do
is just type in DF and it will show you
the content of that data frame so you
can see that this is pretty much looks
like the excel sheet that we had here
you can see that in this data frame you
have columns and these are column
headers and you have rows here you can
also create your data frame by using a
Python dictionary so let me do that
quickly so here if you have a dictionary
like this where each of these columns
are your keys in the dictionary and the
values are basically your rows or
columns I'll use okay so then you can
say DF is equal to DF p deep dot data
frame okay so if you do that and run it
looks like it worked and if you print
the content of your data frame you will
see the same content so you can see that
you can either use read CSV or use this
Python dictionary to
data frame now Lita SEM is all about
rows and columns it is a tabular data
structure so the first thing we are
going to do is we are going to print a
shape now shape means the dimension so 6
here represent number of rows you can
see it has six rows and four columns
okay so if you and then this thing is a
double so if you want to store number of
rows and columns you can say rows
columns equal to DF dot shape and when
you print rows it says six and it keeps
playing columns it will say four okay so
this is how you are print rows and
columns now we are going to use D F dot
head so when you say D F dot head is
going to print basically initial few
rows sometimes you might have a big
excel sheet and you might have like
hundreds of rows so you don't want to
print all of those rows here okay
because if you do DF is going to print
everything DF dot head gives a
convenience of printing only few rows
okay now if you want to let it print
only two rows then you can say D F dot H
2 and it will print only two rules as
you can see here okay you can also do
the F dot tail and it will print last
fire rows so you can see here these are
last fires now if you want to print
again let's say last one row you will
pass that number as a parameter in your
tail function now if you have ever used
indexing and slicing with Python lists
then you can use the same thing with
data frame so you can say something like
let's say I want to print row number two
to four okay then what you can do is
d f2 : 5 so it includes row number 2 but
it doesn't include row number 5
that's why to print it on number 2 to 4
I'm saying to column 5 and this is how
you print it ok if you want to print
everything then you can use either this
or this whichever way is convenient to
you ok
now let's look into printing the column
so in order to print column you can say
D F dot column so DF dot columns will
print the number of columns that you
have you can see you have four columns
ok and to print the individual column
the content of the column you can say D
F dot day so D F dot day will print the
day column ok similarly D F dot event
will print event column so you can use
this in text or you can specify that as
if you are accessing a property in your
dictionary
alright so whichever way as this or this
they both are same okay all right now
let's look at the type so so and by the
way I'm using this B shortcut so when
you say when you place B is gonna insert
a new shell after your current cell you
can also use this plus icon to insert an
yourself ok and you can look at all the
shortcuts here so if you say insert cell
below the shortcut was B so that's what
I have been using right okay now let's
do the type so the type of my DF
event column in series so remember that
the columns in your data frames are
basically off type Ponder's series okay
so this is just just a reference
information now we saw that when you
print when you type DF it prints the
entire table or entire data frame what
if you want to print only few columns in
order to do that you can do in bracket
one more bracket and then only mention
your columns that you want to print so
let's say I want to print event along
with day okay
so if you do that it will print event in
game so this way you can print however
many columns that you like sometimes you
are our data frame will have too many
columns and for doing your analysis you
want to just restrict printing only few
columns and this is a great way of doing
that alright so we covered how to deal
with rows and columns how to basically
view your data okay next thing we are
going to cover is some operations with
your data frame so when you have weather
data like this the thing that comes to
your mind first is what was the maximum
temperature in the given data set okay
so if you want to do that you will say
DF temperature so remember DF
temperature prints the entire
temperature column and if you want to
find the maximum from all this number
all you do is just say max okay if you
do max and you do control enter by the
way control enter is a way to execute
the cell so you use control enter or
click on this guy here excellent so I
just call Max and it entered me the
maximum temperature
in my data set you can also perform some
other operations such as mean expending
the minimum not minimum actually mean is
average okay for minimum you will say
Amen okay you can also print standard
deviation okay you can also say D F dot
describe now what this scribe is going
to do is it's going to print the
statistics on your data set so you can
see we have temperature and wind speed
column and these two columns contains
integer data okay so it is gonna print
the statistics on those columns so you
can see things like count mean standard
deviation with mean and then these are
percentile so 25 percent as 50
percentile and max now this function is
pretty good in terms of quickly printing
the statistics on your data now let's
look at how can you conditionally select
the data in your data frame okay now if
you are aware of SQL then whenever you
have your data base then you can run
your SQL query to select Tinka data okay
based on the condition so data frame
also support a kind of like SQL where
you can type in your condition and
conditionally select data so for example
you can do something like okay give me
all the rolls in beta frame where my
temperature is greater than equal to 32
so when you do that you can see that
it's printing three rows because these
three had temperature greater than equal
to 32 okay what if you want to get a row
where your temperature was maximum so in
that case you will say okay give me D F
where my D F dot temperature was maximum
so D F dot temperature dot max when you
do that you will see it's printing that
particular row okay so you can use this
syntax or you can even do this okay
whichever way you prefer sometimes what
happens is in your comma separated file
the column may might convey might
contain spaces like this and if it
contains spaces then you will have to
use this syntax okay so you can run
operations like these or to
conditionally select data in your data
frame now let's say if you don't want to
print the entire row then you can only
print specific column by saying let's
say I want to paint only day okay
then it paints the day when your
temperature was maximum you can also
print the temperature and a day so I
want to say okay give me a day when the
temperature was maximum and print that
along with whatever temperature okay so
when you do that it says that maximum
temperature was 35 in my data set and
the day was a second January 2017 now as
far as operation success are concerned I
only called Qi cover like min max
standard deviation and describe but
partners has whole bunch of operations
if you do pandas operations then you
will find a let's say two pandas these
operations then you will find a
documentation where you will see all
kind of operations so we looked at mean
here the mean median max this is entire
of operations that you can do and you
can see it's written tens here the list
is pretty long and you can do almost all
kind of statistics on pandas dataframe
and sees next thing we are going to look
into is a set index so when you have
your data frame which is like this okay
you will see that it has this particular
index it is an integer index which it
assigned it automatically ok now when
you run this function DF dot index you
will see my index right now is a range
starting from 0 to 6 actually it is 0 to
5 but the six is not included that's why
it says 6 okay now if you want to let's
say change this index to be lets say a
something else for example de ok then
you can use the F dot set index and say
day okay when you do that what happens
is you notice the difference between
this data frame here and this here your
data of the index was your integer index
0 to 5 and now the index is your actual
date the advantage of doing this is that
you can now run loc our function and you
can say ok give me a row on one for 2017
and when you do that it's giving me some
error ok it gave me an error now let me
investigate why give me the error so let
me print DF and when I spin DF you can
see that I still have integer index so
what went on well the thing is when you
run index set index command it returns a
new data frame it doesn't modify the
original one okay so
to modify the original one you have to
say in place equal to true okay and when
you say in place equal to true and when
you print the F now you will see my DF
has my actual date as an index okay now
I can use date as an index okay so one
three 2017 so this will give me this
particular two row okay now if you want
to reset your index to be the original
one then you can call DF dot or reset
index function and that function also
requires you to plop past implies equal
to true and after that when you bring
the s you can see that now DF has my
integer index back okay so now what I
can do is uh I can now set index to be
event one more time in place is true
okay and when I print DF it's giving me
error well if you give me an error
because I've recruited this statement
twice so let me do this so let me reset
my index after my index is reset let me
run this again and here I can see that
now my event is an index but you can see
that index is not a unique here I have
two rows with no so let's see what
happens when you try to print rows using
snow as in index so when you do that you
will see that it will print both the
rows so it still works okay so you can
pretty much set any column
your index and then you can use it as
short of like a hash function we're
using that particular column as a hash
key you can get the values associated
with it okay so that's all I had for
this tutorial this is just a brief
introduction of data frame data frame
has many features that I have not
covered in this tutorial but I'm going
to cover them in my future tutorials our
next tutorial is going to be a different
ways of creating data frame in this
tutorial we saw how to create data frame
using read CSV function and a dictionary
but then there are many other ways also
of creating this data frame object okay
so that's what we are going to learn in
our next tutorial until then thank you
for watching and I wish you all the best
of luck for your pandas learning and if
