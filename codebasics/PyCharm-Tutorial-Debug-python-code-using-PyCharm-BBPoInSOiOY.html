familiar with py charm so if you've
watched my previous episode you should
have py gem install on your computer
already so just click on it to open it
click on create new project and just
give a project name to it so since we're
writing your first Python program we'll
just set for Python I have created a C
colon code directory you can save this
wherever you like create okay cool
so it just created this project call
force Python and what we will do is we
will add our first python file here so
just right click on it new python file
let's see you want to write a program to
calculate an area of a triangle so just
give that a name area hit OK and it
created area dot py file py extension is
used for python programs so whenever you
are adding any Python program file it
will always have dot py extension so
under force python program now I have
this python file called a dot P Y you
can add multiple py files so let's say
if you are doing string manipulation and
you want to have another string stored
py file you can create it and it will
add it like like as you see here ok so
now you understand the difference or the
relation between the project and induce
a python file project is a container
that contains these individual Python
files
okay now let's write our program so if
you want to calculate an area of a
triangle you need a couple of things
first thing is your base so what is the
base of your triangle so I'm just going
to assume less it's ten centimeter so
I'll just say ten and this a height is
five and now to create to calculate a a
you'll create another variable called
area and if you remember from your high
school education the area of a triangle
is 1 by 2 multiplied by base x height
now one interesting thing that you might
have already noticed is when I say H it
is giving you this awesome
autocomplete with suggestions so it is
intelligent enough to know that you have
created a variable called height and
that's why it is highlighting height so
if it is highlighted and if you hit
enter it will just type it in for you so
you don't have to type in all this
different characters so this is like six
different characters that you need to
type it in but because of this smartness
of this IDE you kept you type H hit
enter so your walk gets done in
basically two keystrokes versus six
keystrokes this is extremely useful in
increasing your productivity when you
are writing big Python programs plus you
are writing less the 200 lines of Python
program this automatic complete will
help you a lot
ok now let's print over area so we'll
say area of our triangle is again I'll
use the autocomplete hit enter ok so now
we just wrote our Python program in
order to run it you have to click on run
menu
hit run and click on here and it just
executed it here you see area of
triangle is 25 at this tis now I will
walk you through different elements of
this py charm editor so it has basically
four different UI elements number one is
your menu so this particular region has
all your menu options and your project
name and your Python file name second
area is called project pan so it is this
area where you have your project and
list of files you can have multiple
projects open as well so this is one
project you can you can actually open
multiple projects the third area is your
code editor this is the most important
one this is a place where you will be
writing your code the fourth area is
your console output so when you run your
program the result will go here in this
area okay so these are remember there
are like four different areas and you
can control the visibility all of these
areas by going under view tools so let's
do to some reason if your if you go here
and click on project if this gets hidden
and you're wondering where that thing go
and you want to get it back always go
into view tool windows option and click
on project and you'll get it back same
applies for all this other areas as well
okay now let's learn some basic concepts
of debugging so what is debugging debug
as the word suggests it is a process of
finding Bob so you are finding a bhag
and you're fixing it now what is bug bug
in any programming language is a problem
that you have in your program and things
are not working as you expect it to work
so you do kind of like thorough analysis
of your code and you find out that
particular problematic area and you fix
it so that's what is called fixing a bug
okay and if you notice you might have
already noticed this icon here there's a
little bug icon okay so this if you do
this it will actually debug so let me
first set up a breakpoint so break point
by setting a breakpoint what you are
doing is you are asking a program to
stop at particular line and not just
execute all at once so when you when you
click on run and say run area what
you're doing is you're executing all
these four lines at once and you
immediately see the output let's say my
program has some problem and it is not
printing expected output so I want to
break at particular line and see what's
going on so in this area click do left
mouse click
and it will draw this red circle this
means you have set a breakpoint here and
after that either click on this poly
icon to debug it or go to run and click
on debug again you have bot icon here so
click here nice so what just happened is
our debugging started it started
executing this program and it stopped at
this very first line which is indicated
it with this blue background color and
you see couple of things here that is a
variable pan here that is watches here
and I will go over them one by one so
you are base and base variables still
not defined so watches is used to keep a
watch so I want to see what's going on
with this base variable when I see hit
enter it says it is not defined
zero not executed this line yet so you
want to execute it and go to the next
line how do you do that you use step
over function so either click on this
icon
it says tabs tap over or there is a
shortcut or f8 so click here or hit f8
when you do that you come to the second
line which means the execution of first
line completed and this base which was
not defined now it is defined with a
value 10 int here means integer in
variable pan you will see all the
variables of the programs so now you see
base here again hit f8 or click on this
icon to step over so you see now height
is also added here and you can add
height if you like now you might be
wondering these two things are same
right a kind of same you have base
height your base height but this
particular thing is useful because
variables will have all the variables so
imagine you have 100 variables this list
will be long it will be hard to look for
the information that you are interested
in so in that case this thing watches
becomes pretty useful you can remove all
the clutter and you can add watches on
the things that you are interested in
looking ok again hit f f8 or step or and
it again creates another variable called
area and now it has a value 25 so other
than these two places it also highlights
the values in line in the code editor
itself ok
here in this area we have console as
well you are seeing that it has not
still printed that statement why because
you are at this line you have not passed
through that line that's why the console
doesn't have the statement so again hit
f8 or step into and now you see it it
printed the statement because you pass
through that line and it ended up in
some internal Python file that you don't
care about so just close it okay so we
learnt few basic debugging concepts here
one was variable how to watch variables
setting explicit watches and how to set
a breakpoint etc okay so this was other
introduction on py Jam
different areas and debugging thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
