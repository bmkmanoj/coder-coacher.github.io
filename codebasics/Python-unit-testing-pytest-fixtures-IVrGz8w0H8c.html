going to cover a very powerful feature
of py test framework called fixtures ok
what I have here is a sample database
class this is just a fake or a mock
class I have created for demos
demonstrating fixtures but if you are
using any real Python module for let's
say Oracle or SQL database it will have
all these basic functionality it will
have your database object will have your
connection and then the third thing will
be cursor so cursor will have an ability
to execute your database queries here I
have some put some fixed database
queries and returning some fixed values
here so again this is all fake ok now
when I start writing the test here I
want to write to kind of taste so first
test is to verify Jones employee ID and
the other one is to verify Thoms
employee ID so this database is
basically a employ database and all I'm
doing is verifying IDs of different
employees and I am writing unit tests
for them so first let's write unit tests
for Chon I will say taste Jones ID here
and in order to create the database
object I will call my DB this will give
me the database object and in database
first if you have some idea on how
databases work then you always need to
connect to your server it'll be served
now I am just saying server but this
will be appropriate connection string ok
and once you have your connection you
will have a cursor object next so can I
chinlock cursor will give you cursor
object and cursor dot execute will be
able to execute your SQL query here I'm
going to copy the query from this class
select ID from employee beware name is
equal to John this returns me the ID of
employee John and let's say this is ID
you want to assert that ID is 1 2 3 I
think so ID here is 1 2 3 so I just want
to assert that similarly you can write
another test case for Toms ID I'm just
going to quickly change these things and
7 8 9 that's your Tom's ID ok so if you
have seen my previous tutorials before
this tutorials and you know this is how
you write your test it should be I
should have taste underscore prefix and
the file name should also have taste
into score
when you run this test using py taste -
me come on it runs fine it will say that
is passed
ok now what's the problem with this
approach you can see that here there are
two main issues one issue is you are
repeating all these lines of code here
you see so if you have less 8000 test
cases you'll be writing these 3 lines
like thousand times okay which is not
good second thing is database connection
is costly you could be even writing test
cases requiring network connection and
those things are not also costly so it's
a costly operation which you are
performing on running each and every
test so again if you have thousand test
cases is going to take some time and
waste some resources there has to be a
better way of doing this in classic
xunit style you will use a setup and
teardown concept
so what setup and teardown does is it
will initialize whatever you need for
your test cases in the beginning so
first let let me use setup and teardown
and then I will show you how you can use
fixtures instead of setup and teardown
because fixture is much better than our
traditional xunit style setup and
teardown first I am going to make my
connection and cursor object global this
is a global and write down a setup
module method so this is a setup at
module level and you are just
initializing your connection and cursor
object here so you say global connection
and cursor is also global now this test
has this cursor available so it can
directly use it so you can get rid of
all these lines there is also a teardown
method so let me write that write that
down
tear down module now what teardown means
is after test cases have finished
execution you want to do some cleanup so
you will do coarser clothes first and
then connection close okay so I didn't
show that those methods earlier but I
also have these close methods here which
I want to call okay so basically
whatever your taste cases need you are
initializing that in your setup model
and then once you are done executing
these you will tear down tear down
meaning you will close the connection
and do necessary cleanup all right let's
this cool so you can see both the test
past it work as expected so now this is
better you solve the two issues that I
mentioned and those issues was repeating
the same line of code and calling costly
database connection every time now you
can do this exact same thing of setting
up and tear down using py test fixtures
so let me show you how to use P Attucks
test fixtures so I'm going to first
remove this these Global's are not
needed and import a py test module and
then write down my fixture so I'll say
py taste dot fixture okay and what you
need in each of these tests is really
the cursor okay so all right let me just
make a space here okay so what you need
is a cursor so here I can say cursor and
then I'm just going to copy this code
here okay so you create your database
you connect to your database and then
you have your cursor and you will just
return the cursor here okay now see what
happens when you return this when you
use this fixture so in order to use this
fixture in your test cases let me just
remove all of this all you will do is
call cursor here so what happens is when
cursor is passed here the EITS member
will realize that there is a cursor
function which is a fixture so it's
going to call this function and return
these object here right here okay so
that's that's what it's going to do and
just to make it clear this cursor and
this curve function is same as this it
was not this okay so I just gene the
variable name so this guy here is same
as here okay let's run this test and see
what happens okay clear cool so it works
see it passed all those tests okay so
this is better because you don't have to
create those global variables and also
here this concept aligns with your
dependency injection concept if you have
done like Java programming you might
have heard this term dependency
injection so what I'm doing here is this
test has a dependency on cursor and I'm
injecting the dependency using this
particular feature all right now when
you run this test you have to after
you're done executing these you have to
do connection close as well so for the
in connection close what you have to do
is you have to use a yield function so
first before I do that let me show you
by printing that it is doing whatever we
expect it to do so I will say setting up
here and yeah let me just do this first
okay so when you run this test here
or it's not printing the statement
because in order to print it you how to
supply - - capture option and you have
to say no no means don't capture the
output of s print statement somewhere
else but show it on Esther day out so
here you can see that it is printing
setting up twice so it is setting
calling setting up then it is running
the test again calling setting up and
then running the test meaning it is not
doing whatever we expect it is actually
creating these database of object every
time you call them here so to restrict
that at a module level you can use this
coke scope parameter and when you say
scope is equal to model it will set up
only once so now when you do that you
can see setting up is just one time okay
now this output this is more visible if
you don't use - - V so you can see it is
setting up these two dot means it is
running to test and that's it okay now
how do you do teardown teardown means
where do you close your connection and
cursor okay so for that you have to
return your you just change a return
with yield and after this use a cursor
dot close and then connection close so
what will happen is it will create this
cursor object only once
it will pass it to all the test cases
execute the test cases after all of that
is over it will go here and close the
connection and let me show let me print
this closing database okay
let's run this nice so you can see that
it set up the things that we needed to
run to this this two dot means it ran
those two test cases and then it is
closing the database okay so that was
all about fixtures in pure test
framework they are pretty powerful they
are recommended over using setup and
teardown methods because they are much
better than setup and teardown so
whenever you end right pure test based
unit test please use these fixtures all
right thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
