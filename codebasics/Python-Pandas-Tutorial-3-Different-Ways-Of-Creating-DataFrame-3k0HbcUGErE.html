going to look into different ways of
creating panda's data frame now if you
have watched my previous two tutorials
then you should have a basic
understanding on pandas framework and
also you should be familiar with data
frame in jalaw so let's start
Jupiter not book as usual now you can
use pH am not that plus plus whatever
IDE you prefer but I like Jupiter not
book because it is great with data
visualization Here I am going to click
on new button to start a new notebook
okay now I already have a CSV file for
weather data so you can see that this is
the way the data where your days
temperature and so on now the first way
of creating a data frame is to directly
read this CSV okay so I'm going to
import pandas SPD and then what you can
do is BD dot the real CSV really CSV is
a method that will read CSV into a data
frame so you can see the name of my
species weather underscore data so it's
weather underscore data dot CSV and
since it is in the same path as my
Jupiter not book I'm just storing a file
name but let's say if it was on some
other folder then you will provide a
full path name such as this okay alright
so this is my first way of creating a
data frame when I run this you can see
it created it successfully okay my
second way is to create a data frame
from an excel file
okay so the same way that you can use
the read CSV you can use the read Excel
to read an excel file so I have in the
same location I have this file called
Vader data dot xlsx so let me close my
CSV and open this xlsx file it pretty
much looks same as CSV but the format is
xlsx and the sheet name is sheet 1 so I
will provide full xlsx spot and then
sheet name will be sheet 1 and when I
print it it creates data SEM
successfully so this was a second way
third way is to create a data frame
using a Python dictionary okay so here
in this bracket you can specify a Python
dictionary and the dictionary needs to
have the data needed for your data frame
ok so I have this little file where I
have saved that dictionary so I'm just
going to copy paste to save time on
recording ok so as you can see that in
my dictionary I have this different keys
and each of these keys represent the
columns in my data frame so you can see
the temperature wind speed an event and
these are my row values ok so now I need
to pass this dictionary as an argument
into this function and when you run this
again my data frame is created
successfully so this was a third way the
fourth way of creating a data frame is
to use a tuples list so I'm just going
to copy tuples list here you can see
that this is a list and the list
contains topple each element in the
is a double okay and this double is
nothing but a row in your data frame
okay now when you create your data frame
one thing you need to do is you need to
provide column names okay so here my
column is stay then the second guy's
temperature then you have wind speed and
then you have event then you run this
once again it created a data frame
successfully so this was a fourth way of
creating a data frame using a list of
tuples and don't forget to mention the
name of columns here okay alright the
last way that we are going to cover is a
list of dictionaries so just let's make
let me just copy it from here okay now
here the difference between the first
approach where or this approach where I
had a dictionary and each key contained
values row values the difference here is
that each element in the list represents
one row along with its column
specification so you can see this is a
list and each record here has column
value column value so let's now create
PD dot data frame and supply this list
as an argument and you can see that it
created this dictionary this data frame
as well so these were a couple of ways
of creating our data frames recall like
five such ways the
are more ways that you can create data
frames so if you Google Ponder's IO then
it will take you to pandas documentation
where they specify you can basically
read your data frame from different
sources such as CSV Excel which we
covered but then you have all these are
the sources such as HTML that says
pickle if you read through this
documentation you will know that this
reading information from various sources
into data frame is made easy by these
api's ok so that's all I had for this
tutorial are in the next tutorial we are
going to look into reading and writing
data from into CSV and Excel files in
the next goal okay until then thanks for
watching and if you liked this tutorial
please give it a thumbs up bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
