tutorial
today's topic is functions in julia now
we all programmers love functions very
much they make our life very easy so
let's talk about them and here is the
list of items we are covering in this
video okay as usual I'm going to use
julia box door all for this tutorial we
are going to type it in into julia
notebook if you have julia terminal
install on your local pc you can use
that as well okay so i'll sign in via
Google and I will create a Julia not
book by going to new menu click on the
latest version I am going to click on
this one okay let's jump straight up
into writing our first function the way
you write function in Julia is using
function f so that's the name of your
function and let's say just some just
this function just does the sum of two
numbers so I will say return X plus y
and to end the function you have to use
and giver this indicates the function
body is now complete if it has ended
okay
alt enter to execute any line in Giulia
notebook as usual okay so this define
our first function now let's call it
excellent so it gives this result back
now if you are new to programming just
to cover the definition of function
function is nothing but a core block
that performs a well-defined task here
that well-defined task is adding two
numbers so this code block performs that
function and now you can call F this
function any number of times to execute
this code okay now there is another
compact way of defining the same
function which is this you can do FR f
of XY is equal to x plus y this will
also do the same thing so it's
essentially the same it has the same
effect it's just a very compact way of
writing a small function now of course
if your function is big you don't want
to do it this way but if it is small
like adding two numbers then you can
certainly go with this option okay now
in Julia you don't need to always the
return a value it will by default return
the value of the last line of execution
in your code so if I define the same
function f and I just do
so I hit alt enter that's why you have
to hit enter and I will just do X plus y
and now not is that I'm not returning a
value yet here I was turning it let's
see what happens
nice so even if you don't return a value
here by default it will always return a
value of last line that is executed in
that function body okay now if you
explicitly return a value then it will
stop execution after that point so for
example again I am going to write the
same function and I'm going to return a
value X plus y and then I will X x Y
okay and if I do if I call that function
again not is that it is giving me some
as an output so it executed this line
the return X plus y after that it didn't
went any further
so this line had no meaning okay so once
you explicitly write return it will
always return from that point if you
don't write return let's say if you
don't write this then it will always
execute this one so for example if my
function body was like this let me
quickly show you and if I do this then
it is going to go down and it is going
to multiply these two numbers and since
this was the last line in the function
that's what it will turn back okay now
how do you return multiple values to
return multiple values you can
do something like this again the same
function and I'm going to return to
values now which is a plus B and give
multiplied by P and I told you before I
don't need to write it instead when you
go over the return so to return multiple
values you just return them by
separating them by comma okay when I do
that if I call it a game interesting so
it returns a topple back topple means a
sequence of multiple values so here the
first one was the sum of these two
number which was three and four was
seven that's why I got seven here the
second one was multiplication between
the two arguments or 3 into 4 was 12 and
that's what I got back you can also do
something like this that way you store
the value of those two return values
into two distinct variables so when I I
do now X it says 7 and Y will show me 12
the next item is operators are functions
what does it mean when you do any
operation like this you're you this plus
here is called an operator it is an
addition operator
okay now this operator right here is
also a function so you can do the same
thing using this syntax so as if I am
calling this function so of Plaza is the
operator which is also a function and
you can call it using the function
syntax and it does the same thing same
thing with the multiplication operator
you can multiply by two number by
or you can use the function syntax like
this if you really want to call a
function by some English name then you
can assign operator to that English
string so if I want to say foo equal to
plus okay and if I say 2 &amp;amp; 3 it's going
to do some of those two functions now as
you notice here I can assign operator
which is a function to a variable name
what this means is functions are first
class objects in Julia so you can
actually assign function to a variable
so let's do that
for example of a last function so I'm
just going to simply define the same
function
and I'm going to now justify that
function to a variable called G so you
treat it literally f as your first class
object and assigned to a variable so now
when you use that variable to call a
function it will work okay
second thing is function can also be
used as a function argument okay so you
have a function that you use an argument
for another function and the standard
example for that is the map function so
map function in Julia what it does is it
takes the first argument of this
function is a function and the second
argument is a list so for example if I
have a list here list or an array that
is that will be my second argument and
my first argument will be function
itself so I can literally define a
function like this okay something like X
multiplied by 2 let's say I I have this
array and I want to multiply all the
elements of this array with 2 and return
back secondary which has all those
results in it so you can do something
like this
then you say all enter what just
happened here is it went through all the
elements in the array and it then
treated each of these elements as X here
and multiplied them by two and the
return value was another array with all
those results filled in this has
whenever you want to do a quick
transformation on one array and generate
the second array okay so as you notice
function was used as an argument to
another function similarly a function
can be written as a return value from
any other function that's why functions
are first class objects in Julia another
way of doing the same thing will be to
use this index where you will say X and
- arrow X - 1 2 3 this will have the
same effect but it is more compact
format it is same as this one but little
bit compact okay the next item is
optional arguments whenever you are
calling any function sometimes you don't
want to supply one or the other argument
so our standard function which does the
sum of two number let's say if you don't
want to supply it's the second number
this is how you initialize a default
value of an argument what it means is if
I when when I call F function and if I
don't supply the second argument then by
default it will take the value to be
five okay X plus y now if I call it with
the second argument then this Phi will
not have any impact okay so when I do
this is gonna show me seven it's not
going to show me eight right at three
plus five eight it's not like that but
if I don't supply the second argument
which I'm going to do right now then it
will be eight because the three went
into X and there was no why and it used
five as the value of y okay
the last item is the keyword arguments
sometimes when you are defining a
function the argument list is pretty
long
okay now until now we were using the
position argument positional argument
means x and y if you look at these two
arguments X is the first argument Y is
the second one and we have poojas in
position here so three since it is first
that goes into ax were four since it is
second it goes into Y but if you our
list is too long it might be cumbersome
you to see you know like what 3 means 3
means ax 4 means Y you have to kind of
map that if you don't want to do that
then you can use something called a
keyword argument so let's define our
function which is a division with a
keyword argument now the way you
specific your argument is you start with
a semicolon
and
you write down your keyword arguments
and the important thing here is you have
to always initialize your keyword
argument with a default value okay let's
do this
so this function just divides the first
number by the second number
now when you normally call it okay you
say X equal to 10 plus X equal 20 and Y
is equal to 10 okay when you do that it
works so X is 20 Wystan now it will also
work even if the order of these two
arguments is different because now we
are explicitly saying that 20 is x + 10
is y so the order here doesn't matter so
see it gives you the same result
okay so that was all about functions in
Julia thanks for watching bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
