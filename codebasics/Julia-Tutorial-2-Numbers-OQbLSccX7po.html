tutorial today we are going to dive into
numbers in Julia I have Julia command
prompt open and I recommend you guys
open it as well and practice it as you
watch this tutorial okay
there are two type of numbers in Julia
integers and floats integers are the
whole numbers and float numbers are the
ones which has fraction to it let me
create two variables with the two
different values the first one I created
is a whole number it doesn't have any
fraction to it that's why this number is
an integer number I just assign that to
a variable call a the second number is
having a fraction to it that's why it is
called a float number if you want to
know the type of a variable you can use
function type of this is an inbuilt
function in Julia that will tell you the
type of the variable it is saying
integers 64 the number 64 here means
that I am running on a 64-bit operating
system if you are having 32-bit
operating system then this will be 32
how do you know that I have 64-bit
operating system there is another way to
know which is word underscore size this
is a constant in julia which will tell
you the number of bits in your system
alright let me now figure out the type
of fee
so type of B which is 2.5 is floor 64
okay now you can use Julia as a simple
calculator to do certain basic
mathematical operation I'm just going to
quickly demonstrate them this is same as
what you do on your regular calculator
right oh when you do division
you get float number as a result back if
you want to just get the integer part of
it then you can use a division function
the better example would be 5 by 2 so
uses the difference between doing this
versus this this gives you integer
result this gives you a float result you
can do certain other operations such as
multiplication you can do power of a
number so 2 raised to power of 3 is 8
you can even figure out the remainder of
a division ok if I do 5% 2 I will get 1
okay Julia supports bitwise operators as
well what it means is you are doing
certain operations with the bit
representation of a number now first of
all if you want you want to find out bit
representation of a number you can use
this our inbuilt function called bits
this will give you a bit representation
the binary representation this is how
number look like when it is stored
internally in computer memory ok
similarly if you said bits
six it will look like this you notice
one one zero here and the total number
of bit count here is 64 because I have
64-bit operating system if you have
32-bit you will see 32-bit here alright
let's do B device and operation the way
you do it is by using and operator so
I'm doing n between 3 and 5 so let's see
how the bit representation looks for 3
and 5 so as you notice here it is 0 1 1
and 1 0 1 so when you do n between these
two what you will get is 1 and 1 will be
1 1 0 will be 0 and this would be 0 so
the end result is 1 ok you can also do P
twice or operator for all you use this
pipe character for doing X or you have
to use a dollar sign so $2 for means
doing X or between 2 &amp;amp; 4
there are metal shift operator as well
so if you want to shift the bits of
number six by one position to the right
side you have to use this particular
operator
it's a closing angle bracket so as you
see in the diagram it will move the bit
ripple representation of number six by
one position to the right side similarly
if you want to use the bit stream to the
left side by less the one position you
say this is my original number and move
it to the left by one position
and you get four okay now we quickly
covered integer and float but how do I
know the maximum capacity of these
numbers or minimum number that they
support there is another built-in
function called
type max when you slip type max integer
64 this will tell you the maximum number
supported by this particular type which
is individual 64 so do 64 suppose this
this is pretty huge similarly you can
use type min and it will show you the
minimum number supported by that
particular type okay let's do type max
fourth floor 64 to see how much capacity
Julia supports of course 64 and here it
prints INF what INF means is infinity so
in Julia there are two special floor
floor point values one is infinity and
you know how you what is the other way
up to get infinity whenever you divide
any number with zero you get infinity as
a result so you're getting I enough here
the other special floating value
floating point value is n a n which
means not in number and you get that
when you do an operation like this when
you do division of zero by zero you you
get a number that is not defined that's
why it says n a n which means not a
number
okay the last point we want to cover is
numeric literal coefficient what it
means is this in mathematics you might
have come across polynomial equations
like this 2x squared minus 3x plus 1
whenever you want to represent that into
any programming language you always use
multiplication operator operator let me
show you I will create a variable called
X and assign some value to it and if you
want to write this equation you will in
any other programming language do
something like this right
this works in Julia but Julia supports
are better syntax which is same as how
you write mathematical equation which is
this for you as you see I'm not using
multiplication operator here and it will
still work it will give you the same
result so this is more readable and more
convenient to use okay that will all
about numbers in Julia thanks for
