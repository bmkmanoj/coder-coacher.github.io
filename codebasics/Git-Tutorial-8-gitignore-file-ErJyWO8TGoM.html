dot get ignore file today I have a good
repository here which has only one
Python file when I run git status I get
a prompt saying that dot idea is under
act now dot idea is a folder that my
Python py charm code editor has created
I don't have any intention of checking
it in into upstream github repository
hence I want to ignore it but every time
when I run git status it just shows me
this file which is kind of annoying I'm
going to ignore this directory using dot
git ignore file let's first create dot
git ignore file you can say touch dot
get ignored or you can directly create
dot ignore file by Windows Explorer
option I created dot git ignore file and
in this file I'm going to put dot idea
directory once I do that and save it
again run git status notice that
previously it was showing dot idea as
contract directory now here it is not
showing dot idea it's showing dot ignore
file of course because we added that
file as a new file I am going to add
that into my repository because I want
to check it in
okay sometimes you have a specific file
that you want to ignore for example I
have a taste dot py file which I did it
for some local testing again I don't
want to check it in into my github
repository it will still show up here so
I'm going to add that particular file
here and once I do that it will no
longer show in this list of untracked
files let's run this come on see it went
away you can also have multiple files
with the same extension that you want
ignore for example I have let's say a
dot exe and I have B dot exe when you
run git status again those two show up
you want to ignore both of them you just
add a wild-card saying
star dot exe once you do that run git
status and they go away all right you're
getting your file can look pretty
extensive it can have all these files I
picked up this example from Google and
you can see here there are so many files
listed it's a sample dot git ignore file
you can also add a command using a hash
sign ok so that was a short tutorial on
dot git ignore all I hope you guys are
having fun learning get get with my
tutorials I will see you in a next
tutorial bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
