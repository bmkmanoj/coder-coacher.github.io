install Giulia programming language on
your Windows machine
Giulia is a new programming language
which is making a lot of buzz because of
its performance similar to C and the
conveniens and fast prototyping similar
to Python alright let's begin installing
it for this go to julia dot org website
that's the official website for this
language click on downloads and here
they recommend three different ways of
running julia one is in terminal using
building command line this is similar to
running Python idle if you have ever
used that one second one is Juneau which
is an integrated development environment
and the third one is if you don't want
to install anything on your machine you
can just run it in browser on Julia box
or website I'm going to show you the
first one today just scroll down on this
side and locate the appropriate binary I
have windows 64-bit machines so I'm
going to click on this one if you have
different OS then you can click the
relevant binary from here ok
when I click it it will begin the
download I'm going to pause this video
and resume it back when it is done ok my
download is complete I'm going to now
click on this exe to run it this will
begin my installation as you can see it
here ok I am going to install in this
default location click on install
okay looks like it has completed
extracting all the files click on these
check on these two options this will
create a desktop shortcut socket let me
click on this one as well then I say
finish it opened the directory where it
install it and I have this little icon
which shows me the Julia come on command
line let me double click it to verify
that the installation was successful
nice so I see a nice welcome message
from Julia this is the terminal for
Julia language similar to Idol for
Python you can now start writing your
first program so I can say print Alan
hello and it will print it I can use
Julia come online as a calculator as
well okay so that was about Julia
command line there was another way which
was going to Julia box.org so let me
quickly demo that one as well if you
open this website it will ask you to
sign in via Google and I have already
logged into my Google account so it will
just open the interactive not book here
if you click on this one and just start
tutorial it opens this ipython notebook
I alright so here you can execute these
lines so if you want to again do some
mathematical operation simple calculator
type then do here and click on this one
and it will execute it here this is all
running inside a browser you don't need
to install anything here okay so that
was all about installing Julia and on
your local Windows machine as well as
running it inside the browser thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
