Python for statement is also known as
for loop so to begin I have py charm
open so let me create a new file and I'm
going to call it for okay now in order
to understand this we will work on a
sample problem let's say you have a list
of your monthly expenses so for January
February each of these months you have
your total expense amount and you want
to calculate the total of all these
monthly expenses so how do you solve
this problem in Python you want to use
Python to track down your monthly
expenses and python program should tell
you the total result so for that first
you need to create a list and we are
going to call it exp equal to I will
Gradle is this is how you create a list
and you're going to store all your
monthly expenses so let's say in January
you spend 23 $40 your February expense
was 2500 your March expense was 2100
your April expense was 3100 because it's
your marriage anniversary your big
expense and your May expenses 29 80
hundred dollars if you are going with a
traditional way without using for loop
then you will create a variable called
total and you will add each of these
individual items so you say
so you will do this and you will print
total at the end so when you run this
program it will print the total
so I'm going to run for I have two files
if and four that's why it's showing me
two options so I'm interested in
executing four so it is telling me
thirteen thousand twenty is the total
expense for from 1 January all the way
to tell me now the problem with this
code is that you are writing a long
expression here what if your list had
like 100 items in it if you start
writing all of these you'll become
granddaddy by the time you you are done
writing it it's like really tedious so a
programming language should have
something better and that thing is a for
loop so let me now do the same thing
using a for loop so I'm going to command
this line so if you use control slash
shortcut in Pyg um it will comment it or
you can just put this character here it
means this line won't have an impact so
now you can say total you can create a
total variable and you can say my total
expense is 0 and now you are going to
run a for loop so the syntax of for loop
is this so you can say for item in exp
column what this means is for the
special keyword and then using item in
exp meaning for each of the items in exp
list do this what do we don't want to do
you're going to say
total equal to total plus items what
happens because of this is it will run
in a loop and every time it will keep on
adding this individual items so let me
run it excellent
so I'm seeing the same result and see my
code looks much better so compare this
curve versus this code here you are
doing lot of typing versus here is plain
simple so now when you write a for loop
or internally computer will expand your
code into something which is shown in
the diagram here so as you see in the
diagram at each iteration it is taking
each of these induce of items and adding
them into your total so you don't have
to write all the code that is shown in
the diagram but instead the for loop
will do that for you and it makes your
code look beautiful and readable now let
me show you the same thing using py
charm debugger so if you have seen my py
charm intro on on debugging etc you you
would have some idea on how to set
breakpoints in do debugging if you are
not sinned then I will recommend going
back to that video and take a look so
let me set a breakpoint here so when you
do again control left mouse click or use
control f8 it will set a breakpoint and
you can say run debug okay now I am here
okay so as you see let me expand the sky
my exp list is this two three four zero
and so on you can use this step or
function to go now one by one line by
one line so go so my total as you see
here is zero and I just enter the for
loop when I move into next tap what
happens is my item is twenty three forty
which you can see here so the for loop
men is started it first picked up the
first item which is twenty three forty
my total is still zero and I am saying
total equal to total plus item so my
total is zero and my item will be twenty
three forty so after this statement gets
executed you can imagine what will be
the value of total so next nice so you
see like total has a value twenty three
forty and then I am onto my next item so
when I say next item my next item now is
twenty five hundred as you see here and
my total is twenty three forty so now
total equal to total plus I had a
meaning twenty three forty plus item
which is twenty five hundred so now my
total is forty eight forty so this keeps
on going until the very end
so in the end your item is 29 et in your
total is already this much and when you
say next now see your total become
thirteen thousand $20 and you are in the
very last step so now since you have
traversed all the values in your list
this will come out of that for loop so
let me hit next so now it came out of
the for loop and your final value for
the total is this and when you run it it
will bring that so let me look at the
console and you got this value so just
to summarize for loop should be used
whenever you want to do same operation
and range of things okay next thing I
want to cover is a range function what
if you want to print number one to ten
so let's do that using for loop so we'll
say for I in range so range is a spatial
function in Python and the way it works
is you specify two indexes start and top
stop
so my start index is one and your stop
as it is indicated by the tooltip this
tooth is pretty useful
so stop index should be whatever
wherever you want to stop plus one so
I'm going to pin one to ten
hence I will put 11 because the second
index is always your end index plus one
column hit enter and then just say print
I what I means here is I is a variable
that you are creating in your for loop
and that variable has a value coming out
of this function so on each iteration
range will give you one new value so
let's see what happens so you can just
run it
nice so as you notice here it printed
one to ten okay so range just gives you
a range of numbers that you specify
using start and end index you can use
the same thing to print a square of all
these numbers so you can just say I
cross I and this will print square of
all the numbers from 1 to 10
so again run and you see 1 4 9 16 and
the square of 10 is 100 so whenever you
want to do this kind of operation on a
range of numbers you should use range
okay now let's go back to our monthly
expense example so let me create that
same variable for the list again and now
what I want to do here is I want to
print monthly expense along with the
month number so what I'll do is I will
use a land function so I will say
for I in rain
Len exp so what this land will do is it
will return the length of this list so
what is the length of the the list it is
5 so when you say for I in range 5 what
you're doing is you are omitting the
start index in you and end index will be
the length of the list
so you will say print your month is I
plus one
why am i doing i plus 1 because the in
the range function
I am specific only the end index and if
I don't specify my start index it will
be 0 by default so if it is 0 I want to
I don't want to start from 0 I'm going
to start from 1 that's why I'm doing I
plus 1 and I will say my expense is exp
of I
so again expense is a list so you can
use an index in a square bracket to
access each individual elements so I in
this for loop for the first time it will
have a value 0
so when you say exp 0 you will be
referring to this value and you say exp
1 you are referring to 2500 value and so
on also as we are calculating a total
we'll do the same thing as before create
a variable called total and on each
iteration you're saying total is total
plus exp of I let's run this
awesome so it is saying month one
expenses this month to express the
stress but hey we forgot to print total
so let me do that so you will save print
my total expense is my total and again
run it cool so it printed it in user
expenses here and at the end I have a
total expense so now let me just quickly
show you this land thing in idle so that
you know how what went behind the scene
so when you have this list like this and
when you sell n of exp this is it is
saying return the number of items in a
container so exp is a list which is a
container and when you sell an exp five
so this for loop was equivalent as
writing the length range file okay so
range usually have two parameters we
could have said this as well this is
starting index this is ending index but
if you don't specify by default it will
assume it to be zero okay so you can
have like this or you can have just this
but we knew it is five let's say if this
list was long you don't want to go and
calculate it that's why we had we had it
like this now full loop will normally go
through your entire list or entire range
that your specified here but often there
is a need to break in between you want
to do some operation and one certain
goal is achieved you want to stop the
for loop and turn
in between so let me give you the
example let's say you lost your keys
your car keys in your home and you now
begin searching it so you will go to
different places you will go to your
living room you're closer you will look
around chairs to see if there's a key
and once you find the key what will you
do you will stop your search so let me
denote demonstrate the same thing using
for loop and a break statement so let's
say my key location is chair
so my keys are actually placed on chair
and I don't know where they are but I
know all the locations in my home so all
the locations in my home are garage then
I have living room then I have closed it
and I have chair so let me put chair
here before close it so I'm going to
sort through my home for my keys in all
this location in this particular order
so again you can use for loop because
for loop is used to go through each of
these items one by one so you'll say for
I in locations meaning search each of
these locations one by one and if I is
equal to this is a compared with
comparison operator equal double equal
to sign if I circle to key location then
you will say print
keys found in this particular place
right and once the key is found now you
don't want to go complete your for loop
you want to break so when you write this
break statement it will just come out of
the for loop it will look it will just
terminate in between and if that is not
the case if I is not equal to if I is
not equal to key location then you want
to slip print key is not farm-in I okay
now let me run it and see what happens
nice so it first went through garage and
says key is not found garage then it it
went through living room and you saying
key is not found in living room then it
encountered chair and chair was a key
location so it it printed this one and
then it broke in between it didn't sort
through close it so use break whenever
your goal is achieved and you want to
just terminate so again let me show you
by debugging this
so just debug this use f8 to go through
each of these steps so your eye is
garage so you're looking into garage and
assess key is not found in garage then
its living room and your slinky is not
found in living room but third comes
chair and since key is on the chair it
will say Keys found in chair and it will
break so now see what happens
so you see you came out of the program
it didn't go through this thing this is
very useful when you are doing real-time
programming and you have a list which
has let's say 10,000 items you don't
want to just go or each of these items
because it it will waste some of the CPU
cycles it will be overburden on computer
for the work that that's going to give
right your goal is achieved why do you
want to continue with the for loop and
go over the remaining elements another
statement that is used frequently in for
loop is continue so when you are running
a for loop and doing same operation on
list of items sometimes for some items
you want to skip that operation so in
that case you will use continue so again
let's work on a simple problem where
between one to five you want to print
the square of all numbers except the
even numbers so you want to skip even
numbers so you will say for I in range
so if you want to go from one to five
you have to say one to six because it
will exclude this second index so it
should be always your N number plus one
now you want to skip even numbers and
four remaining numbers you want to print
I cross I so let me just first run this
guy so when you run this what's going to
happen is let me see what happen okay so
let's run this first so when you run it
it is printing square off all the
numbers between one to five but you want
to skip even numbers which is this and
this so for that this is your main
operation that you're doing follow just
before that just say do the check for
even number how do you do a check for
even number you said I personally do
equal to zero meaning if you divide it
by two and if the remainder is zero
then you will say continue so just
continue statement what it will do is
once you are an if condition if it is
satisfied you will just continue from
here and you will jump back here in the
for loop for the next iteration hence
you will skip any code which is written
below this line below this line
inside the for-loop so if you have
something outside the full loop you will
still do it so now let's run this
awesome
so you see the square of one is one
square of 3 is 9 and square of 5 is 25
but we skipped two and four okay now the
last thing I want to cover is vial
statement so while statement is similar
to for loop with a little bit difference
in the syntax so let's say you want to
print number one to five how do you do
that using while loop so in while you
say while and then the condition print I
and I equal to I plus 1 so while loop
takes only one condition and until that
condition is satisfied to be true it
will just keep on iterating so if you
run it you will be saying 1 2 1 2 3 4 5
ok now be careful whenever you're doing
while loop you have to increment this
counter if you don't increment this then
it will just go into infinite loop so
what happens is the way this works is
let me debug it
so here again I'm using f8 to go to next
line so your I was one as you see here I
was one and you printed I first and then
your eye is two then your eye is three
so when it is here it is saying I is the
I less than equal to five meaning 3 is
less than 5
hence you continue inside the loop now I
is 5 so eyes no I I is 6 this time so
now 6 is not less than 5 so it will come
out of it ok now if you don't have this
here then it will be pretty dangerous so
on what will happen is it will just keep
on iterating and it will cause an
infinite loop so that concludes our
