tutorial today I am going to show you
how to install Python module on windows
for this type in CMD here and open
command prompt as an administrator this
is very important so remember to run it
as administrator the first thing I'm
going to do here is check whether the
module is already installed the one that
I'm interested in is called Matt plot
Lib and when I try to import it it is
saying module not fun so now I want to
install this from Internet so I'm going
to use this PIB 2 that comes readily
installed if you have installed Python
3.4 or later version or in Python 2
series if you have installed two point
seven point nine or later then VIP will
already be installed if PAP is not
installed you need you just google it
how to install PAP in' and get it
installed but once it is on your system
it is extremely easy to install python
modules using this tool now the meaning
of p IP is p IP installs packages so
this is just the tool built to install
packages so just say p IP install matt
plot lib and it will download the module
from internet and it will install it on
your local machine so it just
successfully installed it you need to
have an internet connection for this so
just remember that now we'll just
quickly verify import matt plot clip
excellent so now it's installed so you
can just go ahead and use it so this was
pretty easy now the way VIP works is it
uses this PYP by the Python package
index and as long as your modules now
this module for example matplotlib
is listed on this PYP your index that's
that's why I'm able to install it so
this to when I install it goes to this
index it will download it and it will
install it now there are this many
packages present on this or if you want
to take a look at all the PAC packages
you can click on this link so I clicked
on this link and it opens this one so
you see like a whole range of packages
that are installed here okay now if you
want to uninstall it and then it's
against there is epi P uninstall matte
plot lip it will uninstall this it will
ask for confirmation and now when I type
in Python and if I say important dot lip
it's no longer available okay so that
was it thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
