going to look into reading and writing
CSV and Excel files in pandas and here
is the list of items we are covering in
this video okay let's get started what
we are going to do first is start a
Jupiter not book I before Jupiter not
book because it is great with data
visualization you can use whatever IDE
you prefer py charm not that plus plus
it really doesn't matter I have started
my knot book and the first thing I am
going to do is create a new notebook by
selecting new and python first thing we
are going to do is read a csv file into
a pipe pandas dataframe I have this CSV
file which contains stock market data
I have tickers earning per share revenue
price and the people associated with
that company CSV file is nothing but a
comma separated value file so if you
open it in plain not pair plus plus it
looks something like this where you have
values separated by comma these files
are lot similar to excel files so
whatever methods and properties we are
going to cover they pretty much apply to
excel files as well okay so let's begin
by importing pandas as PD as usual and
then you will create a data frame by
saying DF equal to PD dot read CA 3 and
in the bracket you supplied the name of
the CSV file which is stock underscore
data dot CSV okay and then you print
your data frame when you do this ah it
will successfully read this CSV file
into a data frame so let me now keep
this CSV file open on the side so that
you can see what's going on I am going
to run my windows here so that you can
see CSV file
as well as the knock all right this
looks good okay
now here you will notice that it read
the whole CSV file into a data frame and
it successfully imported the column
names and all the rows okay now what can
happen is sometimes you might have an
extra header in your CSV file so I'm
just going to insert an extra header
here and let's say you can have like one
row you can help couple of extra rows
and what you want to do is really start
from read and start reading from here
okay so let me first just read this as
is and see what happens so I let I
didn't save it so let me save it and run
it so when you do this what will happen
is it will treat this particular line as
a header now what you want to do is you
want to really skip this row okay so the
way you do that is by supplying skip
rows arguments so there is skip
underscore rows and when you say one is
going to skip one row from the top so
when I run this I'm getting and so looks
like let me see what is the excitement
metal name so if you google pandas read
CSV it's going to list all the methods
that you have so if you look at here or
and if you search for skip so here it
says skip rows okay so I provided
underscore which was wrong so now you
can see that it skipped this first line
and started reading from second line you
can also do the same thing by saying
header equal to one and it will produce
the same output so I think that my
header
is located at row number one okay all
right now we can have a reverse
situation that so that instead of having
this let's say extra header you don't
have this header at all so let's say
your CSV file is something like this
where you don't have header but you
somehow know that this is sticker this
is EPS and so on so what you want to do
in that case is you want to say header
is equal to none okay so what it will do
is it will automatically generate these
columns names but these column names are
not good it says 0 1 2 3 4 which I don't
like so the way you supply these column
names is by providing names argument
into your read CSV method and you can
provide the column names in sequence so
your first column is ticker your second
column is let's say EPS your third
column is let me see what it was it is
revenue revenue price and people okay so
there when you prize and people revenue
prize and people when you run this you
will notice that it will create this
column so always use header equal to
none and names equal to column names
whenever you have a missing header in
your CSV file okay now let me revert
back my CSV file to its original state
which is this and I'm going to zoom
with this extra thing here okay now what
can happen sometimes is your CSV file is
let's say pretty big and you want to
read only few rows from it let's say you
want to read only maybe three rows okay
so the way you do that is by doing n
roll's equal to three so n rows means
number of rows that you want to read
into dataframe and when I say three it
will exactly read three rows excluding
your header okay so sometimes if you
have millions of light lines in your CSV
or Excel files and you want to limit how
many lines you want to read then you you
can use n rows argument okay
the next use useful argument is any
values so here you can see that in my
data frame there are a couple of
problems a couple of cells I have as not
available any etc okay so I want to read
these things as not a number values n a
n okay so that you can do by saying any
values equal to not available and m dot
a what this means is whenever you are
reading CSV file and if you encounter
not available so not available and n a
turn that into n a and value okay so if
you do this you will notice that okay I
was missing dot so let me execute one so
not is that it replaced n dot a with an
A and it also replaced not available as
and then and here also there was
and so if you look at this file here
this this and this these three cells are
not now to placed by NN okay so this is
useful in cleaning up the cleaning of
the messy data that you get from your
CSV or excel file okay so we took care
of not available and any values but
there is one more problem with this data
frame if you notice it carefully I have
revenue column and I have minus one as a
revenue now any company's revenue cannot
be negative it is either zero or greater
than zero so this is clearly a problem
and I want to convert this to n a n now
if I put minus 1 here then what's going
to happen is it's going to convert this
to NN but at the same time it is going
to convert this guy also as n a n now
owning per share could be negative
companies don't do the report negative
owning per share but in theory it could
be negative so you don't want to convert
this guy to n n so how do you do that if
you put minus 1 directly here then you
notice that this guy got converted to n
n well in that case instead of supplying
a list you can supply a dictionary so
what you can do is you can supply
dictionary and you can save this you can
say that in my earning per share column
whenever you find our n dot a or not
available convert that to an end ok but
in my revenue column you can convert
both of these things to let me copy
paste okay you can convert both of these
things to n al but in addition to that
convert minus 1 also into an N
because I know that revenue cannot be
negative so negative value is always na
n okay and same thing now with people
you can say not available or or na both
are na and when you run this you will
notice that minus one still stayed as
minus one and my revenue which was
negative here got converted to na n so
this is pretty powerful feature this any
underscore values could be useful in
cleaning up your massive data and this
allows you to do data munging or data
wrangling okay
all right so that was about read CSV now
how about writing back to CSV so for
writing back to CSV what you can do is
so I have already this data frame with
me whenever I want to write this back to
CSV or the way I have read CSV files
there is it to CSV file so I have to CSV
file where I can say new dot CSE so I am
writing this particular data frame which
is this guy here to a file called new
dot CSV and when a done this it executed
fine so if I go to my directory I will
find this new new dot CSV file and when
I open it
so let me minimize this file when I open
it you can see that it wrote this CSV
file
okay now the one observation I have with
this file is it wrote this index also so
by default it writes the index if you
don't want to write this index then you
can say index equal to false and when
you run this
okay permission denied because this CSV
file is open right now so let me close
this do not save and when I was on this
again it worked this time so if I open
new dot CSV now what happens is I now
don't see that indexed being written to
this file okay it has a couple of other
arguments also sometimes you don't want
to write let's say all the columns let's
say I want to write only two columns
tickers and EPS and I want to skip
exporting these three columns to my CSV
files and the way you would do that is
by providing columns argument so first
first let me just print the DF columns
so I have these many columns and what I
want to do now out of these columns I
want to are write new dot CSV and export
only two columns which is Pickers and
DPS so DF dot to CSV the name of the CSV
file where you want to export and the
column names when you run this looks
like it what open new dot CSV file and
you will notice here that this file has
now only two columns to it excellent
okay now sometimes you want to keep
exporting the header so to do that you
can provide header argument and say
header equal to false so when you do
this let me close this guy here and run
this looks like it worked again and if
you look at
this thing now here you don't see any
header so it skipped a writing header to
my CSV file okay that was all about to
writing to CSV file now let's look at
read Excel okay so I'm going to clean up
all this cells and I have an excel file
here so let me just open the excel file
it is basically same as the CSV file
that we had okay so I'll just put it
here you can see the same stuff I have
the sheet one here and all the same
columns so import pandas as PD and the
way you read excel file is by doing PD
dot read Excel and the name of the excel
file is doc beta dot XLS X now I have my
file in the same folder as my Jupiter
not book if you have it in a different
folder then you need to provide the
complete path okay all right
the next argument is a sheet name here
it is sheet 1 so she won here okay and
put in DF when you do this you can see
that it created data frame successfully
okay
now sometimes are you want to do
conversion of your cell content from
excel okay so here you can see that I
have any in Walmart people column now I
know that Walmart's key person was Sam
Walton so if you want to convert this
any into Sam Walton then you can use
converter so the way you use your
converter is basically this so what you
do is you will define a function
so let me first define a function you
will say convert people
okay convert people cell and this is
your cell content and you will say if
cell is equal to end the day okay then
what you want to do is return Sam water
otherwise return cell whatever you got
okay and then here in read excel file
you can supply converters argument which
is which takes a converters argument
will basically take Python dictionary
okay and in Python dictionary you can
supply the name of the columns so for
people column I want to use this
particular function so whenever it is
reading people column is going to call
this function for every single cell for
every single cell that you're reading in
this column is going to call this
function and do this conversion okay so
let's read this so when you read this
what happened is you can see that
instead of Walmart key portion to be an
A now it will place it with Sam Walton
okay now this is not a very good example
because because I am always converting
any to Sam Walton I should be looking at
the ticker but this is just to give you
a demonstration on how converters
exactly what okay you can also do the
same thing with with other columns let's
say if you have some kind of logic to
convert EPS cell then you can do the
same thing you can write a converter
routine for your earning power shell
unimportant
share column and you can say okay
whenever you find not available you want
to return none okay and returns out back
and when you're done this you will see
you got any n okay so this is how you
use converters to convert your messy
data into something meaningful that can
be post processed later on easily okay
last thing we are going to cover is
writing Excel files okay so now I have
my data frame here and if I want to
write it back to an excel file I can do
something like PD dot to excel okay to
excel and the to excel function take the
name of the file as an input so my name
of the excel file is xlsx new dot xlsx
and you need to supply the sheet name
where you want to write to so you can
see talks okay and this should be data
frame when you run this looks like it
wrote to this file successfully so if
you open the directory
AHA you find this new dot xlsx file and
when you open it you will see that it
load this file successfully now again
same stuff if you don't want to write
your index you can supply next to be
false also let's say in this excel file
you want to start writing at certain
offset let's say you want to start
writing at okay so start so there is 'm
there is an argument cossatot row you
want to start writing at row number one
and column number let's say - okay
let me close this don't save run this
again and when you do this your new dot
excel file has is now returned from
column number two so 0 1 2 so it started
from column number 2 and zone number 2
so 0 &amp;amp; 1 row number 1 ok so this is how
you can write at certain offset or
location in your excel file also same
stuff if you don't want to write this
index column to excel then you can
always skip it by saying index equal to
false okay let me close this and run
this again and if I open new excel file
you will notice that I don't have that
index column being written to my excel
file okay now if you have let's say two
data frames and you want to write these
two data frames to same excel files in
different sheets how do you do that well
there is a class called excel writer
which you can use so let me first create
two data frames so I am going to here is
all this cells and create two data
frames so these two data frames are
stocks and weather okay so I have these
two separate data frames which I created
successfully and what I want to do is
write these two data sets into one
single excel files as two different
sheets okay so you will in that case use
this excel writer or class or in panda's
data frame in ponders module you have
this excel writer class where you can
say with PD dot excel writer whatever is
the name of your cell file as writer and
you use that writer to write your
new data frame so I am writing my stocks
data frame in sheet called stocks and my
weather data frame in a sheet called
weather ok and when I was on this it
works and I have this stock underscore
wiggle file created when I open this
file you will notice that this file has
two sheets stocks where you can see all
the stocks information and weather where
you can see all my weather information
and if you look at your data frame here
you can see you have your weather data
30 to 35 30 28 okay
and you can look at your stocks you have
your stock data you can see all these
values with the same as this particular
data frame okay so that was all about
reading and writing to excel files I
didn't cover all the properties that
reading and writing
excellent CSV files offers if you google
Ponder's documentation on let's read CSV
or write CSV you will find all these
useful properties so for example for
read CSV you have so many other
important properties that you can use
for example you have separator and
Eliminator okay so now in my case I had
a comma separated file where a separator
is comma but sometimes you might have
pipe or some other character as a
separator
but using read CSV file you can handle
those characters by using this separator
or delimiter argument you have other
useful properties as well such as two
values false values where you can say
that if I have this particular value
then consider it as a true or a false
values you can also use skip
for skipping your footers you can also
use a skip blank lines so sometimes if
you have blank line in your file you can
just set this to be true and it will
just ignore them next tutorial is going
to be how do you handle missing data in
pandas so stay tuned and have fun
learning pandas if you like this
tutorial or please give it a thumbs up
below and also share and comment on
whatever feedback you have for me okay
so that was all I had thank you for
