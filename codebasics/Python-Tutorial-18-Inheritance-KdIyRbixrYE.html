tutorial today we are going to cover a
fun topic called inheritance and here is
the list of items we are covering in
this video ok let's understand
inheritance by taking the example of
vehicle anything about vehicles you have
so many vehicles available for you such
as car drugs motorcycle etc but they
provide a same purpose which is
transportation and we need when you go
to specific type of vehicles such as car
and motorcycle or they have their own
purposes and own characteristic for
example our car has 4 wheels it has no
roof it has a roof where a motorcycle
has only two wheels and it has got no
roof car also has specific usages such
as committee work and records in with
family whereas motorcycle is primarily
used for road trip and racing so as soon
in this diagram both of these vehicles
cars and motorcycle can be thought of as
subclasses of a base class called
vehicle and they share the same
properties of a vehicle class which is
to provide transportation but on top of
that same shared property they have
their own specific characteristics and
purposes such as bills or roof
difference and specific usages so here
you can say that we have derived car and
motorcycle subclass from a class vehicle
or you can also say that these two
classes inherit from a vehicle class so
that's essentially the definition of
inheritance here now what we are going
to do next is we
going to implement the same example in
Python so I have a Python py gem code
editor open here and I'm going to write
over first class which which is vehicle
now if you remember from my last video
or the way you write classes is using a
class keyword followed by the name of
the class and colon and then you start
typing your methods so here I'm going to
create one method in my vehicle class
which is a general usage and the general
usage is I'm going to say okay the
general use of vehicle car vehicle class
is to provide transportation now I'm
going to derive my first sub class
called car from vehicle and the way you
inherit a class from another class is by
writing the name of that class in and
bracket like this so here it means my
car class is derived from vehicle class
or it's inherited from a vehicle class
Here I am going to write an init method
which is same as our constructor and the
first thing I'm going to do is I'm going
to say okay I am car ok and I am going
to now define certain properties such as
business for
as roof equal to true okay
the second method I'm going to write is
specific usage so God has got some
specific usage which is commute to work
vacation with family etc okay so this is
how I derive my class from another class
okay
now let's write our second class which
is motorcycle and this is again derived
form our vehicle class and it's
essentially I'm just going to copy this
code here
and here I'm going to say okay I am
water cycle and the specific use will be
different than that of the car and the
specific use here is a road trip and
racing okay so we just derived two
classes mortal and car from vehicle now
let's create some objects of it and
let's try to realize like what real
benefit this inheritance thing is giving
us so the first object is the car object
I am going to say C is equal to car and
first print C dot general usage now
notice that car class doesn't have a
method called general usage and still I
can call that method why because I have
inherited that method from vehicle class
here since this vehicle since this car
class is derived from vehicle class I
have an access to use all the methods
and properties from my parent class okay
so think about this being a parent and
these two are its children
okay so C dot general usage and C dot
specific uses
okay now let's force execute this and
see what happens
so when I run this here it is saying I
am car so when I created the class
object here it executed this constructor
and that's why it is saying I am car
then the second thing I did is seed or
general usage so seed or general usage
was transportation so as you see here it
says general usage transportation and
that's what it printed here
and when I say seed or specific usage it
is going to put in the specific usage as
shown here which is commute to work in
vacation with family so you can confirm
that that's what it printed okay now
let's create a an object of class
motorcycle so here I'm just creating an
object of motorcycle flag and again I am
going to paint the general usage and the
specific usage so when I run this what
happens here is it says I'm motorcycle
my general usage is transportation and
my specific use is road trip and racing
okay so key takeaway from this exercise
is you can call a method or a property
on your from your parent class using the
object of your derived class so these
car and motorcycle are derived classes
C and M are objects of their classes and
using those objects I am calling this
general usage method of my parent class
and then you can call the specific
methods from those subclasses now if you
don't want to call this general usage
property method explicitly you can call
that within your specific usage specific
users method so here in specific uses
method I
is self dot general usage so remember
self is an object of car class and since
it is derived from vehicle you'll be
able to call general usage here and same
thing you can do in motorcycle class so
self dot general usage okay so here I'm
creating an instance of car and
motorcycle class and just calling
specific use it matter so if I execute
this I get the same output as what we
saw previously so it cause specific uses
math method then it comes here it calls
general using matter which is this guy
and then it calls the specific usage
goal okay there was that there was a
simple way to illustrate inheritance
using vehicle example if you have any
doubts or any questions please post in
the comments below or the next topic
next section we are covering is the
benefits of inheritance the there are
three primary benefits of inheritance
number one is core reuse reuse as you
saw in this example vehicle you can
reuse the core of your parent class so
let's say when you're programming in
Python and someone has returned a class
already and you want to use all the code
in that class but on total on top of
that you want to do some customizations
of your own then using inheritance you
can do that easily that's why it
provides a code reuse the second benefit
is extensibility and it kind of overlaps
with this first benefit that we just
talked about in vehicle example we
extended over vehicle class to derive
new classes such as car and motorcycle
the third benefit is the readability or
it provides a very nice structure to
your program especially vendor you are
writing a big
program you want your core to be such
that it remains readable because if the
code is simple few lines it's easy to
read but if the core is less million
line of code it's very hard to read it
for troubleshooting purpose and for
developing new features using
inheritance you will be able to gain
this readability as it will provide a
nice and uniform structure to your
program okay one last thing we want to
quickly cover is is instance and is
subclass methods so here are in the same
example what I'm going to do is so I
just created two class objects I'm not
going to call any method here so I have
car instance and motorcycle instance and
let me first call is instance method so
is instance is a built-in function
available in Python and what it will do
is it will tell you if an object is an
instance of a specific class or not for
example here C is an instance of our car
class so when I run this and let me just
print this okay when I run this it is
saying I am car I'm what if I can in
true so did the execution of this
resulted in to true which means C is
indeed an object of class but if I do
motorcycle here it will say false
because C is not an object of motorcycle
class okay so that is is instance now
there is another method called is
subclass what it means is if car is a
subclass of vehicle or not so you want
to figure out if one class is a subclass
of another then just use is subclass
method when you run this you
true because car is is a class of
vehicle but if I say car is a subclass
of motorcycle then it's going to print
false because car is not derived from
motorcycle
you know car is more like a sibling of
motorcycle it's not a child of
motorcycle okay so that was all about
inheritance thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
