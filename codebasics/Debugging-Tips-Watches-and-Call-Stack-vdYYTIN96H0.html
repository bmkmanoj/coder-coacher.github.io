coding tutorial and today's debugging
tip we are going to talk about watches
and call stack I would suggest that you
watch my video on what is debugging if
you haven't already done so so after
that you can continue and watch this
tutorial alright now here I have a
simple Python program where I have a
list of numbers and I've returned a for
loop to go or all these numbers and do
their sum so in the end I'm printing the
total of these numbers pretty simple and
straightforward program okay now when I
divide this using this bug icon okay
I want to set a breakpoint here and I
want to kind of understand how this for
loop works and at each iteration what
happens okay so I use this bug icon to
debug it and when I do it py charm will
by default open few windows so here I
have first window which is frames window
the second one is variables and the
third one is watches okay now let me
when you get this window for the first
time it will look like this it will be
blank okay now before we talk about
watches window let's talk about
variables what variable window shows you
is all the local variables so here we
have numbers total num all these
variables it will show here other than
that it will show you some system
defined built-in functions underscore
underscore file etc okay so what what is
does is similar to variable window but
it allows you to watch a specific
variable okay so let me add num here so
when I add num it will show me the
current value of number okay and then
let me add another watch called
total so here
you have a breakpoint at this point and
you are just adding a bunch of keywords
that bunch of variables that you are
watching okay now when you say next you
will see here that the values are
changing so you can monitor the progress
of your program by having this watch
window now you get the same thing in
variable window as well you can see here
also the number is changing so these two
are essentially same but good thing
about watch window is that you can only
watch the things that you are interested
in versus in variable and it will show
you all all the variables basically so
there'll be too much noise here
my program is pretty simple in real life
your program will be much complex and
you'll have so many variables here that
it becomes hard to watch what you are
interested in that's why I personally
love this watch window you can just plus
minus you can remove these things at any
time okay you can also add the
expression so for example I want to know
what are the built-in functions for num
and when I do that it will show me all
the building functions for numbers okay
so you can add variables you can an
expression etc so that was all about
watches window next thing we are going
to cover is the call stack so kostik is
this guy here okay now in this program
is not quite clear so let me just modify
it so let's say I have this function
called foo which caused another cup
function called bar and
a function called bar which will do
nothing and here in my main program I
will call function foo okay now the way
calling function works is there is a
memory area called stack so when I
execute this program what will happen is
first it will stop here then when I step
into it it goes into bar then when I
again step into it this is step into or
f11 sort keyboard keyboard shortcut then
it goes into bar function so I was in
info from foo call bar and then I now I
am in bar okay now let's say you are
debugging a complex program and you are
here and sometimes you know you might
have a very complex call stack you might
be coming from 10 different function in
that case this pan call call stack is
pretty useful here it will show you the
whole stack of your call so it says ok
first when you double click on it it
will say okay if foo was called then foo
call bar and then you are here so call
stack shows you where you are at present
and it also shows you from where you are
coming at ok so again when you are
debugging a complex program call stack
is extremely useful the the call stack
is called frames in phm code editor but
there are other editors such as
microsoft visual studio and eclipse
where it is called all stack again this
these concepts variables watches call
stack frames they are all common
concepts they are not specific to py
term code editor these concepts apply to
other famous code editors as well so
once you know these concepts you can
pretty much use it with any programming
language with any
editor okay that was all about watches
and call stack thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
