tutorial today I am going to talk about
lists sat and dictionary comprehensions
so let's begin with list comprehension
first list comprehension provides a way
to transform one list into another and
the same definition applies for set and
dictionary comprehension as well let me
show you what I mean by that if you have
this kind of numbers array and let's say
you want to find out the even numbers in
this list so what you are doing
essentially is you are generating a new
list which has only even numbers from
this list using a traditional for loop
you will do something like this you will
just iterate through your original list
and you will check if a number divided
by 2 years a 0 remainder then you will
just append that to a new list and that
works but here you're writing three
lines of code list comprehension
provides you a way of writing the same
code in one line you can do even equal
to i for i in numbers if i person to
equal to 0 and when you do that you get
the same result so this thing is
essentially same as this 3 line of code
here you are writing a for loop here is
your condition and here is the output
that you want to put in this resultant
list so you can see here if the syntax
is very compact so it can reduce number
of lines in your code and it is much
more
and easy to understand what if you want
to generate square of all these numbers
you can do that by doing this you can
say I cross I for I in numbers so here I
don't have any if condition and I'm just
writing to the list and generating a new
list which is a square of original
numbers so 1 1 2 squared is 4 3 squared
is 9 and so on
ok let's cover our set comprehensions
now in now if you don't know what set
already set is an unordered collection
of items unique items basically so the
different the basic difference between
on list and set is that set is unordered
and it doesn't allow you to contain
duplicate items so for example this is
how you create set you can pass a list
to a set so if I say one two three one
two three four five and if I pass let's
duplicate numbers so here you can see
two and three are repeated it will just
clean them out so you will get a unique
ah numbers in this list now I want to do
the same thing I want to generate
another set which has only even numbers
so the syntax is exactly same except
that instead of using square bracket you
are using a curly bracket here so I will
just do
same thing so just copy base this line
here and then you print even you can see
here it has only on given numbers okay
now here there is a six because I use
numbers error instead of s if I use as
you will not even see the number six
okay
so 24 okay now let's talk about
dictionary comprehension
let's say you have two lists so one the
first list is the list of the cities and
the second list is the list of the
countries that those citizens those it
is belong in now you want to create a
dictionary where the key is name of the
city and the value is a country name now
you can do this easily using a
dictionary comprehension now before we
go into the dictionary comprehension
let's talk about the safe function so
zip is a built-in function in Python and
what it will do is it will zip two lists
together so if I do this it will create
this Z zip object which is nothing but a
zip version of these two lists
I can either it through this object and
if I print the elements in that you will
see there are nothing but R topples are
created by using those two original list
right so we are going to use zip
function in our dictionary comprehension
so again the syntax is similar to set
where you use curly bracket and here you
will
city con country okay so this is this
this former represents each element in
our dictionary and in dictionary as you
know there is a key and after : there is
a value so here now I will say for city
country in zip cities countries okay if
happen D and you can see that it
generated city country dictionary all
right that was all about comprehensions
remember comprehensions are a very
powerful and unique tool in python so
you use it wherever possible they are
very fast as well it provides excellent
performance alright thank you for
