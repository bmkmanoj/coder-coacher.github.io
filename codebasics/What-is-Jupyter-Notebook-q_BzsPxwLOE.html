what is Jupiter not booked today now
Jupiter not booked an ipython notebook
our same
it used to be ipython notebook but later
on it evolved to become Jupiter not
booked now in order to explain Jupiter
not booked I have a sample not booked
open here now this looks like a website
of web page you can clearly see that
this is running inside a browser and I
have some rich tags a video and some
visualizations here but this is not
really a website this not book has three
essential components number one is live
code so you can see that here I have a
Python code which is trying to use
pandas module to retrieve Microsoft's
stock price in a table format and also
in a chart format okay now I can change
from Microsoft to Apple let's say I want
to reduce the price of an apple okay now
when I will run this code you will see
that these prices will change when I
click on this button so you can see this
price is got change again when I run
this this particular line it will change
the chart also you can see that now it
is showing apples chart you can also
change a color from red to green so you
can see that this is not just a static
page it is pretty much live you can make
changes in your code and it will print
the output accordingly the second
important component of this Jupiter not
book is visualization so when you are
running let's say your code inside let's
say py charm or some other code editor
you can't have this kind of fancy
visualization so here I can have you can
see I have this table printed for the
data frame then I can also have this
Matt plot chart printed I have two
charts here on not only that I can embed
a YouTube video link here so in terms of
visualization or Jupiter notebook is
awesome
third important component is the rich
text so here I have some explanatory
text but you can see that I can color it
I can embed this logo so this logo is
pandas logo which I got from pandas
website and here you can see this is an
HTML tag okay so this is pretty powerful
because now you have your explanatory
text your visualization and code all in
one place so just to formally define
Jupiter not book it is a web application
that allows you to run live code embed
this realization and explanatory text
all in one place now let's say if
Jupiter not book didn't exist and if I
wanted to give this tutorial to a friend
of mine basically this is a tutorial
panda's tutorial on stock price analysis
right so if I want to give this tutorial
to my friend then I would have typed in
a cool in py charm or some editor and I
would have sent this Python file to him
but you can see that in order to write
comments I have to use the Python
comments and you don't get very nice
visualization you can see you can notice
the difference between these two so let
me open this side-by-side and you will
notice how dull the explanation would be
if I had to use Python comments so okay
I have these two things side by side
open and you can see that if I had to
give a tutorial I would write this thing
like using Python comment you can see
and I have same thing here but it looks
much more visually appealing right so I
have this jar
types I have found as logos here I have
different color and not only that this
YouTube video link I have right in the
not book so where is looking at the
tutorial can just play it here and see
it okay another thing is if you want to
look at intermediate state of data for
example the F dot head here when I say D
F dot head it will immediately show the
intermediate state of data so that when
you go in to know your next line you
kind of know where you are versus here
you have to write all the code and then
execute it and you will see the output
in the very end versus here you are kind
of intermediately seeing the output and
it kind of helps you with your
programming okay so that was a
comparison of Jupiter notebook and
versus writing the code in your plane
IDE now here is the Jupiter website
Jupiter dot also if you can go here it
has an information on Jupiter not book
etc or if you check some of the facts
about Jupiter not book then you notice
that the first one is it supports 40
programming languages so it is not just
about Python it has so many other
languages supported all right second
advantage is you can share your not book
so you can email you can use Dropbox or
github or to share your notebooks and
then it has support of interactive
widgets and a big data integration so it
is very powerful it is highly used in
data science community lot of
researchers and data scientists use
these not books to share their research
if you google Jupiter not book gallery
then you will find many examples of
these not books so the one I like here
is basically present on github and here
you will see a gallery of lot of
interesting not books all related to
statistics machine learning
or signs signal processing and so on and
I have to sample not books open here so
you can see that this one is on logistic
models of well switching in Bangladesh
and basically whoever is doing this
analysis he will type in some
explanatory tags he will have some code
running to kind of convey his point you
will have some charts plotted here you
can see there are some fancy char spot
plotted here matplotlib has support for
many rich charts and you will see them
being used on this notebook here all
right the other one I have is the
analysis on gun violence gun violence
using vika pedia data so here this is a
homicide and gun homicides poor country
wise and some interesting charts to kind
of show the statistics on on this topic
okay so the these these were some couple
of interesting our Jupiter not books
that you can find online all right that
was all about what is Jupiter not book
in the next tutorial we are going to go
into details and we'll have in-depth
tutorial on how you can create your own
not book how you can create different
visualization and basically some I will
give you details on various features on
Jupiter not book so don't forget to
watch that also if you like this
tutorial please give it a thumbs up
comment below and subscribe to my
channel thank you very much and I will
see you in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
