today we are covering bar chart in
matplotlib if you google bar chart and
look at some of the sample images you
see a chart like this where each of the
values are represented as a vertical bar
in finance world bar charts are used to
represent measures like revenue and we
are going to create chart similar to
this in matplotlib today as usual I have
launched Jupiter not book and imported
matplotlib and numpy module initially
and now we are going to use some static
data say I have revenues for some of the
major US tech companies in these two
lists ok and now I want to create a bar
chart out of it so the way you do it is
you just call
PLT dot bar function ok and in argument
you you want to pass company and revenue
but the thing is it won't honor string
values here so what you have to do is
you have to create a vibe position
alright and you would do that by doing
NP dot a range length of your company
list so let me put this into a separate
cell and let's see what Y pose looks
like this is simple numpy array with 0 1
2 3 value now you can use a simple list
also but there is a reason I am using
numpy array and we'll cover that little
later on now in my bar function I can
use Y pose because it is a list of
numbers and not the strings and when I
plot a chart it looks something like
this
now these bars represents revenues of
each of these companies but here I have
values so now to
place these values with these labels you
have to use X ticks function so you will
just call P and T dot X px and there are
two arguments to it okay the first
argument is your white by position and
your second argument is your company
list what this will do is it will
replace these values 0 1 2 3 4 with the
corresponding elements in this second
list so 0 will be replaced by Google 1
will be replaced by Amazon and so on can
you run that you now see google amazon
MSFT and Facebook's revenue plotted as a
bar chart now let's add some x and y
label just to make this chart a little
fancier so these are revenues in US
billion dollars and actually viable is
revenues and X level is the company name
so we already have company name so I do
not need to write it I will set it title
US tech stocks and now my chart looks
better ok now what if I want to plot two
different measures so here this
particular measure is revenue so let me
add a label for it
so revenue and alt dot Legion
now let's say I have profit numbers for
each of these companies okay so I have
profit number also and I want to plot
profit on a same chart so in finance
people typically plot side by side bar
chart for revenue and profit so that
they get a comparison of how much
company is earning and how much they are
how much revenues they are generating
and how much is their actual profit
after deducting expenses so you can
simply call PLT dot bar once again with
y position and profit this time the
label is profit now when you do this
what is happening is it is plotting the
profit but it is being plotted in a same
chart you can see that same bar contains
profit and revenue both I want to
generate side by side bars for this the
reason this is happening is because the
Y position that the sorry the x position
is actually the same for both of these I
should have named this as X position
actually okay so let me just quickly
change it okay so the x position is same
I need to make it a little different by
subtracting some number from it so what
I'm doing is now X position for my
revenue is 1 minus 0.2 so it will be
like point eight like here to BC minus
0.2 then point eight and one point eight
and so on
okay now that is one reason why I
created numpy array because if you are
simple list then it this will be hard
but if your numpy array then expose
minus zero point two is going to create
a new array with four elements and zero
point two will be subtracted from
two of these elements okay when I run
this I see a little better shot though
not perfect but at least the bars are
separate to control the width of this
birth you can call a width function so
I'm just going to set width of these
bars to be 0.4 and when I do that now I
see a better chart so here I have
Google's revenue and their profit
amazon's revenue you see Amazon is a
weird company by the way they don't
generate any profit they keep on
increasing the revenue but the profit is
like really small and I never understood
Amazon MSFT and Facebook okay now the
last thing we want to cover is
horizontal bar chart sometimes people
want to draw the bar chart not in a
vertical fashion but in a horizontal
fashion so for that there is a function
called bar H bar H means horizontal bar
okay and let's just run this and see
what happens
here I need to change this to white X so
that company names appear here and you
can see that you can generate a
horizontal charge-charge like this okay
so that's all we have for this tutorial
I want to mention the same thing again
that by just watching this tutorial you
are not going to learn anything you have
to download this Jupiter not book which
I have provided in the video description
below and just play with it play with
different properties try to use this in
any sample project and that would be the
real way of learning programming
okay and you can look at Matt brought
lips documentation for your bar chart
check out different properties and just
play with it just to get a feel of it
alright thank you very much for watching
