tutorial today we are going to talk
about tasks also known as generator or
Co routine in julia now without going
into any formal definition of what task
is i am going to cover a Fibonacci
series example and i'm going to
demonstrate how using tasks can be
beneficial now you probably know what
fibonacci series is it's just a sequence
of number and every number in the
sequence is the sum of previous two
numbers so for example here one is sum
of zero and one the next number is two
which is sum of 1 and 1 3 which is sum
of 1 and 2 5 8 and so on ok so 13 is sum
of fine 8 now here I'm going to write a
function called fib and what I want this
function to do is every time when I call
this function it should return me the
next number in the Fibonacci sequence
now as you all know functions can either
return one value or it can return an
array of values but here I what I want
to do is something special every time
when I call the function is to give me
the next number in the series which
means it should remember the previous
state it should somehow remember that
and then every time it just gives me the
next number so for this I will first
initialize my first number which I'm
going to call a and I will use the
special function called produce now
produces a special function in julia
what it does is it's similar to return
but then at the same time it will also
remember the state of the function and
we will you'll learn more about it when
we actually call this function so the
next number is B
and I'm going to produce B and then I'll
write an infinite loop here because
Fibonacci sequence goes all the way up
till infinity and here what I'm doing is
in each iteration you're a variable
becomes B so this is this means a is B
and your B is a plus B okay because b is
sum of previous two numbers and whatever
number I get in me I'm going to just
produce that okay all right so I just
defined my function now the next step is
I should create my task and I'm going to
call this task a generator so the way
you do that is you use keyword tasks in
bracket function name so task here is
going to generate a task or a generator
from this function now this generator
has an ability to generate a sequence so
I'm going to call that generator now and
the way you consume that generator is by
using this another special function call
called consume so let's see what happens
okay so when I call consume generator
for the first time it generated number
zero because it called this function and
it produced a which was zero now and I'm
in my ipython I do lebackes not book so
I'm what I'm going to do is I'm going to
just execute this one more time so if I
click on this button or if I hit alter
enter it's gonna execute that same line
again so
hit on enter again so what happened now
is it called this one produce B so it
produce number one so I'm going to call
it one more time and I produce one again
and I call it once again it says 2 3 5 8
13 and so on so now it is producing the
Fibonacci sequence for me so as you saw
you can call consume on generator one by
one and every time it gives you the next
number in the Fibonacci sequence now if
you want to produce all those numbers in
one short then you can write a full loop
so I'm going to write a for loop here so
I will say for I in to ask fib so again
this task fib is giving action general
is generating a generator and you can
run full loop on that generator so you
can say ok print land I and if you just
continue running this for loop it's
gonna go into infinite loop so you need
to terminate some somewhere else ok if
the number is greater than 13 break
because I just want numbers under 13
okay
so I was an N here and
when I do that I get Fibonacci numbers
between 0 and 21 because okay so I move
my statement above the println line and
now it is generating numbers until 13
okay now we looked at the function which
didn't take any argument if you have a
function which takes an argument then
the alternate syntax would be let me
first delete this guy here so the
alternate syntax of writing the same
thing so I'm going to write write the
same thing using a different syntax that
allows you to pass arguments you'll do
it something like this babe let's say I
want to just print some message before
writing a Fibonacci series
so here Ln MSG I'm going to execute it
again by hitting alter enter shortcut
see it's printing hello world so this is
how you pass an argument to your
generator function using add task or
keyword okay so what's the benefit of
doing writing generator then you write a
generator it saves you on memory because
every time it is returning only one
value if you write normal function then
you need to return an entire array and
that array might be very big so it
becomes a lot of memory when you are
dealing with big data kind of problems
generators are pretty useful one other
advantage is you don't need to wait
until the entire array is generated as
soon as first element is generated the
consumer or the caller can start calling
it and it can start doing
the processing so this this concept of
task or generator is pretty useful when
you are working on producer-consumer
type of problems that was all about
tasks and generators in julia thank you
