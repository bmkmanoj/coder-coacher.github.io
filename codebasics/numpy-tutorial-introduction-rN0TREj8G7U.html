numpy by module today it is extremely
popular in Python community and it is
heavily used for scientific computing we
will see why it is so popular so let's
first start by installing it I will
install it using pip
you can run pip install numpy why come
on to download and install it while it
is installing number wise main object is
n dimensional array okay so we will look
into that array so here I have my Python
idle shell open and I am going to import
numpy Y model here so num I've imported
it as NP and to create an array object
you will use NP dot array and in this
bracket you just pass down your list so
this is my number Y array if you look
into it now this is sort of similar to a
list it is actually very similar to a
list you can access the elements by
index it looks like a list so the
question is I only have a list why do I
need this number Y array well there are
several benefits of using numpy array
there are three main benefits first is
it requires less memory it is fast and
convenient and will go or all these
three benefits one by one okay so
essentially what we are doing is we are
comparing numpy Y with number Y array
with a Python list here okay
so let's first create a Python list I'm
just going to say range thousand so I
created a list which has thousand
elements here and I'm going to print the
size of the list now to print the size
you need to get a size of one
one element so one element here is one
number you can give any number here and
then lengths off your list second I am
going to create a non py array so this
is how you create an umpire array this
function a range is similar to range is
going to create an array with element 0
to 99 okay so the size of this numpy
array would be thousand and to print the
size of this array you need to call
array dot size so or a dot size will
give you thousand ok and the size of
every element will be I will be item
size so just remember that added or item
size is size of one element vs. added of
size is the total length of an array
when you run this program you'll notice
that the Python list is taking taking 14
thousand bytes versus number wise taking
only four thousand bytes now this is
because your Python are the size of one
Python object is like 14 okay and what's
the size of one number why are a object
is here in this case since we are
storing integer numbers it is only four
bytes okay so if you look at this
diagram it kind of should this shows the
memory presentation of our list and
number I array on the left hand side we
have numpy array which points to
continuous or contiguous location of
memories where you have all your element
store 1 2 3 4 5 and so on and each of
these element contain is occupying 4
byte of memory versus in case of Python
lists you all know that in Python
everything is an object so the list will
contain a list of pointers first as you
can
see in the diagram and each pointer will
then point to another location in the
memory which will be your object and the
size of that one object will be 14 bytes
so this is the reason why or numpy why
array the mammal usage is very less
compared to a plain Python list now when
you are array size all this size is very
small you won't notice much difference
but let's say you are dealing with the
heavy amount of data where you have
millions and billions of numbers to
process in that case it will make sense
to use numpy why all right
the second advantage of numpy why is
that it is fast and convenient so let me
prove that point as well so I am going
to what I'm going to do here is alright
let me just close this guy here and I'm
going to now create here two lists first
call it alone and l2 okay so range
sighs so size is thousand here and l2 is
also similar so I created two lists here
and then I am going to create two array
so NP dot a range again to create a
number Y array and then second array
will be called a two okay now I want to
measure the time between list processing
and number your array processing so for
this you use start is equal to time to
time and now what I'm going to do is see
the thing the operation that I am doing
here is I am adding these two lists I am
adding these two lists and producing a
new list call call it result okay
so to order these two lists you have to
do something like this X plus y for X Y
in zip l1 l2 what this will do is it
will take first element from l1 first
elements from l2 add them together and
put it in this result as a first element
so it will just add in usual elements
from these two lists and put it in a
result okay pretty straightforward and I
am just going to say Python list too
this much time so right now the time is
this I am going to subtract start from
here and I'm going to multiply this guy
with thousand because by default it is
in second I want to print milliseconds
here all right now again at this point I
will capture time one more time and then
I will store result here so now so this
was your Python list okay so let me just
say Python list and here now I am
processing numpy Y array so that's the
difference between these two code blocks
or now num py is also convenient because
if you want to add two arrays you just
say a1 plus e2 right so it is not like
you have to write a list comprehension
okay you can just add them together and
you can just say print my num py took
this is just a way to measure the time
that this code block took okay
all right so let's run this program here
okay says Python list of zero point zero
number I to zero point zero because this
size is pretty small so I'm going to
increase the size and do a processing
for um about a million elements here now
you can see that in order to add million
R elements from to list Python list took
116 millisecond versus numpy Y or eight
took eleven point five seconds this is
crazy fast so you can see that again
when you're processing millions and
millions of numbers it just makes sense
to use numpy Y it is also convenient
because you can see that if you want to
add two lists together you just do a 1
and a 2 a 1 plus a 2 I I will just
demonstrate that using idle because it's
this little easier to demo that in idle
so I'm going to create let's say 2 numpy
our array okay a 1 a 1 is NP dot array
it has 1 2 3 and a 2 is again n P dot
array it has let's say element 4 5 6 ok
you can do a 1 plus a 2 so it will give
you that is NC 4 + 1 5 2 + 5 7 and so on
you can also do a 2 minus a 1 you can
see you subtracted this guy from here
you can also do multiplication so a 1
cross a 2 you can do division and so on
you can do all these operations okay so
that was all about numpy our
introduction
you saw that why num py is so better
than so much better than the plain
Python list I will cover more about num
py in our next tutorial thank you for
