tutorial in today's session we are going
to learn one more important debugging
tip called conditional breakpoint now if
you don't know already what is debugging
and what is fake point I would suggest
you go and watch my previous video on
these two topics but just to kind of go
these two topics very quickly debugging
is basically a process of finding an
error or a problem in your code and
breakpoint allows you to stop execution
of a code at certain point when you are
debugging your code okay now what
conditional breakpoint does is it is
basically a breakpoint but it will stop
the execution of your code when certain
condition is met now just to demonstrate
the need of this let's look at this
sample code what this code is doing is
it is going over all the expenses in
this list and it is just calculating the
total of these right so if you look at
this array this is like Python array
which has all this number which are my
individual expenses and I want to just
do a sum of all these expenses okay so
you see this for loop which is going
through this list and it's just adding
all these numbers one by one to total
expense variable and I am just printing
it towards the end okay sweet let's run
this program alright when I do it I see
this error it is saying that I cannot
add integer with string object what this
error means is one of the elements in
this array is string now you notice that
this array is pretty huge okay this will
be the case often when you are doing
programming in real life you will have
our
which will have thousands of element in
it okay
so it is not actually visible that you
go and look at these elements one by one
right as a programmer you don't want to
waste your time doing this okay
so we'll use a conditional breakpoint to
identify the culprit now before we do
that let's use our normal breakpoint and
see what happens when I click here you
will see this red circle which means I
set a breakpoint here and now I will
start my debugging using this bug icon
okay when I do that
my expense for the first iteration is 1
2 3 0 so it started executing this for
loop it went to the first element and
now we stopped here okay
when I say next now next element is 2 2
4 0 which is here okay again go next
next is 1500 which is here okay you can
do debugging this way but the problem is
that you don't want to go or all the
elements in the array
if array has 10,000 elements you don't
want to wait for those 10,000 iteration
to find out the element with our problem
okay so what I will do is I will change
this breakpoint to be a conditional
breakpoint for doing that in peeve I
charm Python editor you just right-click
and here you type in your condition now
just think about for a moment what will
be your condition the problem in our
code is that one of the elements in this
expense list array is string so I want
to say if type of expense is equal to
string then stop here ok all right
let me stop my previous session and now
let me rerun it great so now you see it
didn't stop when it was here here here
it stopped
when this condition was met which is my
expense type or string and at that time
the value of expenses two four six seven
and you see these two cords which means
the type of that object is string so
this is wonderful
because now we found the problem one of
the elements here is 2 4 6 7 and and
that one is string so i will do control
f and i will try to find 2 4 6 7
aha nice so see i found the culprit
you can see that this is a string and
these are integer so this is the problem
so what i will do is i will just remove
the quotes i will stop the execution and
I will just rerun my program and see if
there is any other element like that hmm
there is none so now it worked
excellent great see it was pretty quick
if you had to do it using a normal break
point you will just keep on iterating it
will waste so much of your time okay now
these conditional breakpoints are
supported in all major code editors also
known as integrated development
environments it can be microsoft visual
studio or eclipse or any other food
editor all of them support conditional
breakpoint so whenever you are debugging
your Java or C++ board make sure you
figure out the option to set conditional
breakpoint and you use them wisely to
save your time on debugging that was all
about conditional breakpoints thank you
very much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
