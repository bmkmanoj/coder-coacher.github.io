what matplotlib is and what is the main
use of it it is a 2d plotting library
that is used primarily for data
visualization now I'm here on matplotlib
official website and if you look at some
of the sample plots that they have
you'll notice that they support almost
any kind of 2d chart that you need for
your data visualization you have line
line plot you have subplot histograms
you have stream plots bar chart pie
chart basically any kind of chart that
you will possibly need for your data
visualization okay now the question that
arises is why do we need data
visualization in first place let's say
you have this kind of weather data where
you have temperature information for all
of your week days and if you ask me a
question what was the maximum
temperature and minimum temperature now
I can tell it by scanning through these
data points one by one but it's gonna be
little tedious you know when you present
this information in front of my eyes I
have to scan through each of these data
points one by one versus if you
represent the same information in form
of this chart then I can quickly tell
you when was the temperature highest and
when was it lowest this is because human
brains are wired to process images
better than the text someone has rightly
said a picture is worth a thousand words
okay so now let's first install
matplotlib now the way to install
matplotlib is by simply running pip
commands so pip install matplotlib will
install this for you now the second way
to install matplotlib is by installing
anaconda I already have anaconda install
so if I look at the packages
which are coming in my condo list you
will notice that matplotlib is already
part of the distribution
so let's confirm that so I can see that
matplotlib is here so I have it
installed already so if you don't have
end up on the install then just run a
pip come on here okay so the command was
pip install mad
Lord Li and that will install it for you
all right now after matplotlib is
installed i am going to run my jupiter
notebook to launch a sample not book and
we are quickly going to plot our weather
chart okay so the first thing you need
to do is import mat plot mat plot lib
dot Levi's plot py plot is the main plot
object that you get in matplotlib module
as PLT and also when you are using
jupiter notebook or you have to use my
plot clip in line magic so that it can
render the chart fine now I'm using
Jupiter notebook you guys can use Idol
or py charm whatever is the IDE of your
choice I like Jupiter notebook because
it's it's great with a visualization in
general okay now after I have imported
this I'm going to just copy my weather
data here so I have created two Python
lists X&amp;amp;Y X has number of weekdays and Y
has the temperature information
associated with it and to simply plot
this you can run plot PLT dot plot XY
come on here and that will plot your 2d
chart so now I can see that ok my
maximum temperature was 52 and my
minimum temperature was 46 on a day
seven ok now if you look at the API for
plot
I just googled it and I found this API
page for the plot and I can see it has
variety of options so for example one of
the options is color so let's say by
default this chart is in blue color if I
want to change it to green I can supply
color argument you can also supply line
width if you want to if you want the
line to be more thicker you can just
apply it to b5 and you will see it will
become more thicker you can also supply
line style I think that's what the name
of the properties let's confirm it
so line style yes so line style if you
look at the possible values that line
style takes it has dash dash dot so I'm
just going to try dash dot so there is 1
- 1 dot you can only have dot also dot
is not supported it is dotted ok now my
chart doesn't have X and y axis labels
so I'm go I can set that by using X
label function so PLT dot X level my X
level is day and my Y label is
temperature also I want to set title of
my chart so my title of my char is
so you can see that now my X and y-axis
have labels and my chart also has a nice
title okay
so plot function has so many properties
that you can play with since this is
just an introduction tutorial I'm not
going to go into details so this is all
I had for this tutorial we'll cover more
in the next tutorial I have a link to
this sample Jupiter not book in the
video description below so you can
import it and start playing with it
alright thank you very much goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
