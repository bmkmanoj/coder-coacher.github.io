memory leak when it comes to software
and writing code we are going to answer
that question in this tutorial first
let's clear some basics when I say
memory I am referring to random access
memory or RAM I'm not talking about hard
disk memory now any program needs memory
in order to do whatever it is trying to
do without memory bad things would
happen and your program would misbehave
now I'm not sure how much familiar you
are with C++ but I have this sample code
return in C++ and I will just go or what
is it trying to do my program tries to
track the value of cost of goods so here
I have a variable created cost of goods
and it is trying to allocate some memory
in order to store the value of cost of
goods when you say new double it will
allocate 8 bytes from all the available
memory so here this is my random access
memory I could have like 4 gigabyte a
gig 8 gigabyte whatever is your computer
configuration I could have that much
free memory and out of that memory these
8 bytes are now allocated after that it
will do all its calculation and logic
and then once it is done it will call
delete on that pointer to free up the
memory so you can see that those eight
bytes got freed up you can compare this
situation with your water tap example
where you open a water tap whenever you
want to use your water so water is a
resource here similarly here in case of
our program memory is our resource
whenever you are done using your memory
you delete it to clean it up similarly
in water tap example you will close your
water tap so that water doesn't leak and
your and your resource doesn't get
fisted
if you forget to write that daily
statement what will happen is even after
the program ends you will still have
that memory allocated now no other
program or variable can use this memory
so what will happen is if you have too
many programs which are not a cleaning
of the memory properly then your
computer will become slow because other
programs which are trying to come up
will have hard time finding of free
memory so this is similar to your
opening a water tab but you are not
closing it in your water is leaking and
it's just a waste of your resource so if
you have a lot of memory leaks on your
computer your computer will run really
slow and you will feel like crashing it
so that was all about memory leak so
without further talking go ahead and fix
your leak right now otherwise you will
face my anger</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
