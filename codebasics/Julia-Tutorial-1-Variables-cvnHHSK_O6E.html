coding tutorial
today's topic is variables in julia
programming language i just opened a
julia command-line interpreter by double
clicking on this icon in order to see
how to install Julia please watch my
previous video on Julia installation all
right Julia is a dynamic programming
language what it means is you don't need
to define the type of a variable in
advance now just to go our basics
variable is a container that holds some
kind of data it could be numeric string
etc Julia you can directly assign
variable a value without defining as
defining a type so if you say equal to 2
it will just work and if you use type of
function to know the type of that
variable it will tell you in digit 64 so
at runtime detected that the number 2 is
integer 64 and that's why it assigned
the value that's that's why it it is
saying the type of a is integer 64 I am
using 64-bit operating system if you are
using 32-bit operating system then it
this will be integer 32 you can assign a
different value to the same variable you
can say a is Julia which is a string so
now type of a will be a string here it
is saying it's an ASCII string because
we don't have any unicode characters
however you can assign unicode character
inside string for that you have to use
slash character and let's say I want to
type in alpha
so you say slash alpha then hit the tab
key this will allow you to type type in
the unicode character now let's see what
happens when I say type off a hmm
interesting here it is saying utf-8
string because the character is Unicode
and internally it is using utf-8
encoding you can also use unicode
characters as a variable name for
example I want to use alpha or lesser
Delta as my variable name so you say
slash Delta hit the tab key equal to
four again / Delta hit the tab key and
it works so you can use all these
special characters as a variable name
Julia comes with predefined constants
for example when you say b i buy it only
knows what pi means it has this value
assigned to it however you can use fire
as a variable name and assign a
different value to it the reason it is
giving this warning is because it is not
recommended to use these predefined
constants as variable names but there is
no strict enforcement so it will still
allow you to use it as a variable name
same thing applies for predefined
function s qrt is a predefined
functioning julia which allows you to
calculate the square root of a number
but you can use that as a variable name
so now as p already means variable which
has a value 9
one rule you have to remember is that
you cannot use predefined keywords as
variable names for example you will use
for to write for loop in any programming
language you cannot use for as a
variable name here because four has a
specific meaning same thing applies to F
you can get if you google it you can get
a list of keywords like for if etc and
you should not use them as a variable
name all right that was all about
variables in julia thanks for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
