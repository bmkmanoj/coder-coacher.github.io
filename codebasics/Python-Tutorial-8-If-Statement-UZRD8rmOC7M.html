Python we are going to use py charm
today because phm is nice and cool
editor we will use idle in between when
you want to try simple one-line
statements in Python I clicked on pure
charm icon
it opened this dialog here create a new
project I'm going to give it a name lon
Python this will be my project name in C
code directory you can choose whatever
directly you like create it just created
a project for me here I am going to add
a new Python file so I was a new Python
file if
so it created F dot py file I will
explain you if statement by working on a
sample problem so let's say you want to
write a program that asks user to enter
a number and the program should print if
the number is even or odd for this
purpose we will need if statement but
before we go there we need to first take
the number from user for that we will
use this function call input input will
say enter in number so what this
function is doing is it will ask the
user to it will bring this text on the
console
so where is running the program he will
see this tags and he will have to enter
a number and once the number is entered
it will be stored in this num variable
so I created a non variable amzing Namie
qual to input this ok once the number is
entered it will be a string so you need
to convert it to an integer using int
function so let's save user and 5 the
Phi will be string and that file which
is stored in num when you call integer
function it will convert that to an
integer which is a number and it will
put back again in the same variable so
number will now have 5 now let's write
if statement so the syntax of each
statement is if followed by a condition
so to check whether the number is are a
1 you need to divide it by 2 and find
out the remainder so if you recall from
our numbers episode percentage is used
to
figure out the remainder so if num
divided by two and the remainder of that
operation is zero then your number has
to be even so you'll just print number
is even if that is not the case then it
will go into this ass block remember you
have to enter add a Colin so Colin sale
means it's beginning of the block and
you have to also indent it py jumble
indented for you
so when you say enter you see cursor is
here it is not here if you have it here
then your program won't work it will
give you an error you will say print
number is odd okay let's run this
program so click on run run so here it
is asking a user who is me I'm running
the program and it is asking me to enter
a number so I enter five and when I hit
enter I see number is odd let me run it
again you can click this icon as well by
the way to do the same thing for
for is even let's debug this and see how
it actually works so I will set a
breakpoint here so you can use control
f8 or left mouse click to set a
breakpoint it will be highlighted by
this red circle and you can save run
debug when you do that the first thing
is going to do is it will come here on
this line and it will wait for user to
enter number so here I will enter 5
after that it will move on to the next
line so right now you are just stopped
at the next line you didn't execute
remaining lines yet
so you see here num is string 5 when you
go to the next line using this
particular button or by using f8 key
stroke the numb from indeed or from
string it got converted to integer and
that's because of this int function f8
again and see what happens cool so it
then go to this line if you noticed so
that's why if it's called control stood
when it controls the flow of your
execution if the condition is not
satisfied then it will go to else and
again print f8 you can close this if you
go to console you now see number is odd
if you do the same thing for this around
debug for number 4 then it will go to
the first line so let me add 4 here f8
fh - you see now it went here it is
saying number is mmm cool
so in the condition here we used equal
to operator there are other operators
which I am going to demonstrate you
using Idol
so I like to use idle always along with
beer a charm
because idle executes one line very
quickly and it kind of helps in your
programming so always use idle along
with the by charm by time you are using
to write a main program but either you
are using it for experimental stuff so
we saw equal to operator so when you say
for equal to four it is true if you want
to say not equal to then you use this or
this is called not equal to operator so
4 is not equal to 5 and it is printing
true but if you say 4 not equal to 4
then guess what will happen yep it says
false
it says false because we are lying we
are saying 4 is not equal to do other
kind of operators are alike greater than
less than so this one is called greater
than operators when you say 2 is greater
than 1 it is printing yes 2 is less than
3 is spending years so greater than less
than that is greater than equal to
operator so this means if this number is
either greater than or equal to the
other number then printer so you this
will be true for this condition as well
similarly less than equal to we also
have no and an or operator so if you
want to instead of one condition
sometimes you want to check two
conditions so you want to say 3 is
greater than 2 and 4 is greater than 1
so this returns true the way n works is
both the conditions has to be true if at
least one of these guys is false then
the overall result will be false but let
me just show you 3 is greater than 2
which is true but when you ship 4 is
greater than file that is false
so overall result is false why because
one of these guys is false another
operator is or
so let me try the same thing with our so
it's the same it's a condition and see
what happens
you only guess on how this works so it
will check for both the condition if at
least one condition is true then it will
return true it's sort of like a common
sense logic another operator is not so
when you want to negate a condition so
not true means false so when you say for
equals so for equal to for is true but
when you negate you're essentially
converting it from true to false and
from false to true okay so that was a
little demonstration on all the
operators so let me close this and now
let's work on another problem so you
want to I will just say raise it you
want to write a program that asks user
to enter a dish name and the program
should tell you which cuisine it is
whether it's Indian Chinese Italian what
kind of food it is so we need to do
couple of things here first we need to
ask user to enter a dish name and that
we will do using input function and the
second one is we need a list of all the
cuisines not all the cuisine but we'll
we'll pick few cuisines and we'll just
enter we'll create a list of all the
dishes in that cuisine so I will use
Indian cuisine let's say so when we make
list right so for Indian cuisine I am
going to make a list of some Indian
dishes so the first one that comes to my
mind is samosa because I just love it
although it is fried and not that
healthy it tastes so good
so samosa you have down in you her nan
nan is an Indian bread then you create
another list for Chinese cuisine
so you are creating a list here and you
are storing it in a variable so Chinese
cuisine is a grow pot sticker and fried
rice Italian is Pisa pasta and risotto
we if you want to make a program perfect
then you need to enter all the possible
dishes and this list and it will be too
long so there just for simplicity sake
we are just trying few dishes here so
now let's ask user to enter a dish name
so we'll say enter a dish name okay
after user enters a dish name this
variable will have the name of the dish
so we now need to do a check against all
this lists so if you remember from our
list talk there is an in operator that
you can use so we will say if dish in
Indian what this means is if the this
that user entered belongs to this list
then
print that the dish is Indian okay now
if this is not Indian then you need to
do another check against Chinese so for
that you will use
else if statement and the key word for
that is LF L if means else if if this is
Chinese then print it is Chinese okay up
if it's not Chinese then you need to
check if it is Italian so you will say
Italian if it is not even Italian then
so you were doing bunch of else if
checks and now you are the stage where
you want to write default case where you
you say based on little knowledge I have
I don't know
great cuisine then is this dish okay so
let's run this program
okay let's enter the name of the disc so
we'll say pasta cool it is saying it is
an Italian dish let's run it again and
the same try samosa my favorite one
Indian awesome and at the third days and
use a burger and sit saying I don't have
complete knowledge of all the dishes in
the world and I'm going to be honest and
say I don't know okay so that was a
little fun program with its statement
cool so that I think we pretty much
cover all all the things in if statement
record if LS LS and how the control
flows based on the based on the
evolution of the condition thanks for
