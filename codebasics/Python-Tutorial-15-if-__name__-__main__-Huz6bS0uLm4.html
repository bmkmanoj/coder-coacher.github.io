tutorial today we are going to talk
about very interesting topic if you have
looked at Python programs you might have
noticed this line and this is very
common in any Python program let's see
what this is it is saying if underscore
underscore name equal to underscore
underscore mean let's first check out
what is underscore underscore name if
you have Idol open let me open Idol
first we will see what is the value of
underscore underscore name when I do
this it is telling me the value of this
particular variable is main so this is a
predefined variable in Python which is
which gets set to mean if you run here
for example if you run a dot py directly
then this will be set as me so let's
just run it you see it is now
calculating the area okay so this thing
is used as kind of like an entry point
for any Python program now if you have
done any coding in C or Java eat the
entry point in those programming
languages is main function as shown here
if you recall if you are in C or Java
this is the function from where your
program execution begins that's why it
is called an entry point similarly in
Python this thing is often used as an
entry point inside the program okay now
when does the value of underscore
underscore name is something other than
me well if you have another file called
collar dot py where you are importing
area model so you're importing area
meaning you are importing all the poor
in area dot py file which is here and
I'm saying I am in collar dot dy and
you're calculating the area okay now if
you are in here in area I'm just going
to print the value of the name okay so
on this Berlusconi
let's see what is the value of anaconda
school name when we call it from collar
dot py okay so I am saying I am in
collar dot P right let me add one more
line here saying that I am in Illya dot
py okay and first I will execute area
dot pure in Colorado py and we will see
the difference of this print statement
okay now this time I am going to execute
it in a little different way usually I
run it from py charm editor itself but
today I'm going to show you how you can
learn any Python file using Windows
command prompt okay I have Windows
command prompt open here and I am in the
directory where I have area dot P UI and
caller dot TV okay now if I if I want to
execute our area dot V Y directly then
this is how I will execute it I will say
Python ke r dot P Y so Python is my
interpreter and I am executing Ariel py
when I say this I get I am in area dot P
Y and the value of underscore underscore
name is underscore underscore main okay
let's see what happens if you execute
caller dot py when you do that it is
saying that I am in caller dot P Y but
the underscore underscore name value is
now area so if you compare that with
here it begins execution of this program
and that's why I printed I am in
Colorado Y here and from here it went
into another file which is area so it
went in here and when you started
executing calculate area the value of
underscore underscore name was area so
the summary here is when you execute
Python area dot py directly the value of
underscore underscore name is main and
when we execute it from some other file
the value of that variable is the name
of that module here we are treating area
or py as a module okay so that was all
about underscore underscore name thanks
