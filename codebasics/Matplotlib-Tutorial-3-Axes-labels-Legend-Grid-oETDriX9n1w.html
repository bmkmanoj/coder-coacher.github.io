tutorial we are going to look into our
axis labels the legion and grid aspects
of any 2d plot I have a Jupiter notebook
open here and I have imported matplotlib
py plot as PLT and the second line is
just the inline magic so that the chart
can be rendered fine now I'm going to
use some static data for my 2d plot I
have 4 different lists and this list
represents weather data so the first
list is your weakness 1 2 7 the second
list is the maximum temperatures that
were recorded on these days the third
list is min temperature and the fourth
one is the average temperature now as
you know to plot a chart you can just
call PLT dot plot passing your x-axis
and y-axis so let's say I am plotting a
chart for my maximum temperature execute
this so then it will plot it this way in
the same chart you can plot three
different lines so what you can do here
is you can plot max min and average
temperature all in one chart now when I
look at this chart the thing that is
missing is first of all I don't know
what this x-axis and y-axis is right
it's just set of numbers so anyone
looking at this graph will not have any
idea that this is representing
temperature and this is this is your
weekdays to set the axis label you can
call X label method on your plot object
and set your X label to be days let's
say and you will see that nowadays will
appear here so the same thing you can do
it for your y axis which is your
temperature
and then you can use title function to
set the title of your chart so you can
see I have title here y-axis label and
x-axis label okay now my chart looks a
little better than what it was
previously but it is still not perfect
because I am looking at these three
lines and I don't know what this line
means that I mean I don't know what this
green line is okay so I need to have
some légion here so in order to have a
lesion first thing you need to do is set
a label on each of these lines okay so
this one is let's say maximum
temperature so I am just going to call
it max this plot is for minimum
temperatures I am going to call it min
and this one is average when I run it
the labels are still not showing up
because I do not have my Legion property
set so I can set my Legion like this and
you can see now legend appeared here
sometimes you want to change the
location of Allegiant so there is a
property called lock where you can say
okay I want my legend to be in upper
right corner and that will move your
legend here on the upper right corner
okay by default the property is set to
be best based means the module
matplotlib module will decide where to
put the légion see here it recognized
that there is some free space so that's
why it put the legend here let's say my
numbers were little different here and I
had let's say 32 here so what will
happen with that is now my data point
got here so that's why Legion is now
smartly mood
into this blank area so you can see that
this based is feel intelligent it tries
to find the blank area and it will put
the legend over there you can also set a
shadow property and when you say Shadow
equal to true it will create this kind
of nice little shadow if you check the
API for your Legion then you will find
various properties for example for
location we had all these locations we
tried best we tried upper right but you
can set Legion in two different areas of
your chart then there are other
properties such as font size so let's
try this one
so font size let's say I want my font
size for the Legion to be large when you
do this you can see that this fonts are
little bit bigger now let me make it
small so that you notice the difference
so you see when you say small it's like
really small okay so you can play with
different properties that are available
it is pretty fancy actually you can do
lot of things with your Legion okay so
based on your use case you can try out
these various capabilities that Legion
have another thing that people are
normally interested in when doing 2d
plotting is grid so right now in the
canvas of this 2d plot is blank
sometimes people want to have a grid so
that they can visualize the data points
better for this there is a property
called grid so PLT dot great and when
you said that what is now happening is
you are seeing this nice grid so that
when you're looking at any data point
you can see for example
here I can ex I can use these gridlines
to exactly figure out what the data
point is right it is the temperature on
my fifth day the temperature was 40
degree centigrade all right so that's
all I had for this tutorial I will see
you in next tutorial thank you very much
