session of core basics coding tutorial
today's topic is reading and writing to
a file and here is the list of items we
are covering in this video okay let's
begin with creating a new file and
writing some content to it as you can
see here I have C data directory which
is completely empty I do not have any
file what I want to do is create a new
file called funny dot txt and write some
statement into it for that you use open
statement open will open a new file or
either for reading or writing the first
parameter in this open function is the
complete path of the file name so I'm
using C colon slash slash data less less
20 dot txt now why am i using two
slashes here if I don't use two slash
and just one slash then that has a
special meaning and it won't work right
so that's why I need to use two slices
here whenever I am specifying the part
of the file name okay so the first
parameter is the file name and the
second parameter is the more in which
you want to open the file I want to
write the file so that's why I'm using W
which means right now let's write
something into it
this has us this file handle has a
function call right where I can say okay
I love Python and once you are done
writing to it you should close it
closing a file will free up all the
resources that operating system is going
to allocate for this file all right
let's run it okay so looks like it
executed fire fine and now if I look at
my seed data directory I'm seeing this
file now funny dot txt if I open it I
will see I love Python excellent ok now
let me write some different lines
instead of Python I'm saying JavaScript
if I execute it again and open this then
I see I love JavaScript but one thing
you noticed here is it over wrote the
previous content I previously had
I love Python and now I have either a
skirt what if I don't want to overwrite
the file and just a pen the content do
it for that you need to use a different
mode called a pan so just remember
whenever you say W mode it will always
override the file so you need to say a
means a pen and now as you see I have I
love Java Script and I'm just going to
use some different statement here and I
say I love C++ and I run it
see what happens so it had I love
JavaScript now it upended
I love C++ now this was in the same line
if you want to append it in a new line
then you need to use less and character
which is a new line character and you
can say I love PHP when you run it if I
open it again
you'll notice now I have I love PHP in a
new line okay now let's see how you can
work on reading a file line by line
right for this we're going to work on a
simple problem where you're funny dot
txt so I'm going to open funny dot txt
here's all the content and I'm going to
put this funny dialogue here okay you
can take a moment and read it it's quite
funny alright so what I want my Python
program to do is read this file and for
each of the line I want to count the
number of words and towards the end it
should append the world card and what I
want is I want to create a new file so
let me first save it okay my Python
program will run on this file it will
create a new file with a word count at
the end of each line okay
so first let me open this file in
reading mode so if you want to read the
file the mode that you specify is are
okay and if you want to now read the
lines one by one first first let me show
you how I can read the entire file
content in one shot right so when I save
print F dot read
you always do after close let me run it
cool you can see in the output that it
read the whole file and it just printed
the contents here so after trade gives
you the entire file content now this is
not what I what I want because I want to
count number of words in each line so I
want to go through this file line by
line for this you have to use for loop
when you save for line in F this will I
trip through file one by one and every
timeline will have one specific line
from that file okay so let me first
print it just to show you that I'm not
lying it is working as what I did just
mention F dot close let me run this
again run it again again now you see
every time it is reading one line if you
want to count the number of words in
this line now what you have to do is say
you have this file how do you count
number of words words are basically
separated by spaces like these okay so
if you can somehow detect these spaces
then you will be able to figure out
number of words in Python
there is a function on a string called
split so when you say line dot split
what you're doing is you have a string
and you are splitting the that string
using the Saboteur so I'm using space as
a separator
and when I do that it will give me list
of tokens tokens is nothing but the list
of words okay let me just bring those
token serious STR tokens
you notice what just happened I went
through each line one by one and for
every line I split it using space what
that gives me is a list of wars which is
an array when I print it you see that
this array right now all you have to do
is now you have an array with lists of
words all you have to do is just take
the count and how do you take the count
you use lamb come on so lamb okay when I
run it
voila I get the word Khan
now what I want to do is I want to open
another file called F underscore out and
I will use the same path and I will say
okay I want to name this file as funny
underscore WC which means what count and
open it in a write more so that you can
write to it okay and here use the F dot
out dot alright so when you want when
you say write it is going to write a new
line into this new file now what do we
want to write here we want to write the
original line as well as the word count
so my original line is line okay and
when you want to append to a string you
can use plus operator plus operator is
going to just append to that string I
will say word
calm and what is my work on STR of le
and of tokens okay
alien tokens will give you the workout
and you want to convert it to a string
so that you can append it to analyst
and you can just remove this one and
once everything is done you want to
close the handle for the output file as
well okay let's run it case looks like
it finished successfully now let's look
at our C data directory excellent
now I see a new file called funny
underscore work pound or txt when I open
this hmm I feel that at all
okay so it printed work on but it was in
a new line because I think we had
okay we had I see so we had a slash and
so that's why it head towards the end
and that's why it been dead were count
in the next line what we can do is we
can we can print work out at the
beginning of the line and for doing that
just append this line towards the end
okay let's run it again okay it executed
fine money work out when I open it what
I see is this
okay so work on six so this line has six
verse one two three four five six
that's why I work on two six and so on
okay so that was a real fun exercise now
let's talk about file opening modes a
little more we already covered few more
such as the read which is used for
reading the file only if you open a file
in read mode you cannot write to it
similarly if you open a file in a write
mode you cannot read I you cannot read
it so if you want to open a file both
for reading and writing then you use our
plus so that will open a file for
reading as well as writing similarly if
you use W plus then that will also open
file for reading and writing then what's
the difference between the two here the
difference is if you open file like this
and if let's say this file doesn't exist
on your hard disk it will create the
file versus in this mode it will not
create the file if the file does not
exist so that's the difference otherwise
they both both the modes are pretty much
same and the next mode that we cover was
a which is append mode where you can
append to an existing file there are
other file modes as well if you just
google it it will the pipe Python
documentation page will show you all the
different modes one last thing you want
to cover is a with statement here you
saw that you have to explicitly open and
close the file if you don't want to
close the file or explicitly because
sometimes if you are writing a big
program you may forget that and that's
not good so for that if you want to
avoid this kind of situation you use
with statement so I will use with
statement so you say with open sea data
funny dot txt fall for reading mode as
app when you do this it will do the same
thing except that you don't have to know
close the file
I will say F dot greet okay
now how do I know if file gets closed
automatically with which statement you
can print F dot closed flag this F dot
close flags flag tells you whether the
file is open or closed okay let me run
it I'm seeing some out of here
oh I remember see I have forgot once
less this way
okay so first thing what it did is f not
read printed this math output which is
just the file content
the second thing is here it is saying
true meaning f dot closed is true
meaning with statement automatically
close this file okay so that was all
about files thanks for watching and
don't forget to work on these sample
