tutorial
today's topic is I traitors in Python
and we are going to cover basically the
introduction on I traitor and then we
will implement our own iterator using a
class
so first let's begin with what is an
iterator I have Python idles shall open
here and I'm going to first show you how
you typically use for loop to iterate
through an array let's say I have an
array of string this is hey bro you are
awesome okay now if you want to write it
through this array you will just say
this okay and it works you might have
tried this before but have you ever
wondered how it works internally this
loop right here is going through these
elements one by one and that process of
going through elements one by one is
called iterating through a loop
internally it uses the built-in function
called ITER so if I just say dir of a R
it will show you the list of methods now
among these there is this item method
which is a built-in method so if you use
that let's see what happens I will say I
equal to
or I will say ITR equal to either a now
what either gives me here is a list I
trade an object now using the iterator
object you can both go to a next element
in this list so if I call this next
method on ITR it will print me the first
element okay if I call it again
by the way in idle if you want to repeat
the old command you can use alt p or
shortcut against I'm just using world P
or the RP and it just it is now at the
last element so let's see what happens
if I call it one more time okay so now
it's calling it's raising the stop
hydration exception so this is how for
loop works basically it has an eye
traitor and each time when you are I do
through it is internally calling next or
method on the idea object and you can
see the next method on i.t object here
so you can see that method here okay so
this is a basic introduction on what I
traitor is are there are few other
examples of I traitor that you can see
in the at in this screenshot the first
one is I trading through a list the
second one is I trading through a tuple
the third one is I trading through the
dictionary keys the fourth one is
basically a training through all the
characters in the string and the first
example is I trading through every line
in a file all of these for loops
internally are using a
hydrators okay okay now there is also a
reverse I tutor available which allows
you to write it through a list in
Reverse and the way you get that is by
calling this reversed method this is a
building method so now on ITER if I call
next you notice that it is giving me the
last element if you call it one more
time is going to be last second element
so this is basically I trading in a
reverse order and this reversed method
is a building method which you can see
here
so when you say dir a you see the worse
math right are always these are majority
of these building methods has underscore
underscore which you can ignore
basically in just type call this method
directly so now let's go ahead and
implement our own I traitor class let's
say you want to design our remote
control class where when you praise a
Next button it will give you the next
channel on a TV so in order to implement
that class will first write a simple
class called remote control okay now if
you have already taken my tutorial on
the how to define classes then you
already should have some idea on how you
can define the classes okay I'm just
assuming here that you already know how
to write classes so here I created a
remote control class and what I am doing
here is I am just initializing a list of
channels
as a static list variable and then I
will have an indexed variable so in X
variable is where like what channel you
are on right now so minus 1 is your TV
is off and you don't have any channel
coming in okay now in order to implement
I traitor you have to define this ITR
built-in method okay and this I tell
built-in method will return the self
object so when you call ITR on remote
control class object it will return you
the same clock object basically but this
might be a little confusing but you'll
get better understanding when we start
using this and the next thing you need
to do is you need to always are define
your next method because once you have a
little object you need to have next
method implemented because that's how I
I treat object works whenever you call
next on I traitor object it always gives
you the next result okay so for the
first thing I want to do here is I want
to or increase the index by one so let's
say you have a remote control you start
your TV then your TV you are at minus
one and you want to now come to the
first channel which is SB oh so that's
why I am increasing this index okay and
if at any given point of time or your
index is equal to the length of this
channel meaning if it is end of this
channel list then you want to stop
iterating you want to then raise top
iteration so this is standard protocol
for hydrators that whenever it reaches
the end it always raises the stop
iteration otherwise it returns the
element in self dot channels so you are
basically what you are doing here is
just returning the next available
channel okay now I'm going to define my
remote control bus now so I'll say
okay so first what I did is I define my
remote control class okay
and my ITER is ITER of art okay so this
ITER is an iterator object and then I
will say print next off either okay you
can just keep on printing it as many
times as you would like okay so let's
run this program and see what happens so
right let me just run it first
okay so here it printed HBO for CNN ABC
ESPN is in the and it raised the stock
hydration okay let me now debug through
it so that you know how it is how this
is working I'm going to set a breakpoint
here in order to set a breakpoint you
just click in this span here and it will
set a breakpoint and then you click on
this bar icon Bogg means debug okay so
let's see good so you are now let me
close this one okay so you are at the
very first line of your program
okay so I'm here and now in order to go
to the next line or you can use this
button or you can use at thank you so
when you press this it initializes this
our object which is a remote control
class object now let's go inside this
and see what happens so to go inside
this method you have to use this
particular button or the f11 shortcut
it's called stab in do so you are going
inside this function so when you go
inside this function you notice you now
came here because ITR is same as
underscore underscore ITR so it's always
going to call this method okay so let's
see okay now idea here it says it's
underscore underscore main remote
control object at this so it is
basically your I traitor object now you
are going to call next method and I am
going to again step into that method
using f11 control or this particular
button and when I do that you notice
it's calling this method so when you
call in next it's calling underscore
underscore next and when you call ITER
it's called underscore underscore I turn
this is how Python works basically it
knows that it has to call this method
and you just keep on pressing this
button at this point your if you want to
know what is yourself indexed then you
can look into this variable pan and here
the index is zero so in the list the
index starts from zero so it's gonna
return HBO here okay so let me press
this button one more time and so I am
now at the next call and if you look at
console you see that it printed HBO okay
if you go into that one more time again
it's coming to the same next method and
here you can see not pin to CNN you can
keep on doing that so one more time if
you don't want to go inside and if you
want to just go to the next line
directly you can use this button or f10
key word
that's called step over okay so now I am
at ESPN so now I'm going to go inside
this method because it's going to raise
top iteration now because we are at the
end of the list okay so let's see now
self dot index if you notice what is
self dot index so servlet index is 4 and
length of self dot channels is also 4
right 1 2 3 4 so it is going to go into
this if condition so now it is raising
this top iteration exception okay so if
you look at your console now I'm going
to just yep
so now hear it traced the stock
attrition okay so that was all about I
traitors thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
