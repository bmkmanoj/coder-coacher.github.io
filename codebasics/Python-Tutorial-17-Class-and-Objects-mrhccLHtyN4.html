tutorial
today's topic is classes in Python and
here is the list of items we are
covering in this video ok let's begin
with what is class when we are talking
about class it's not specific to a
Python programming language it applies
to move to the other programming
languages as well and it falls under a
common paradigm called object-oriented
programming okay so let's see what is
class when you talk about human beings
it has every human being has a common
set of properties such as name gender
occupation etc also every human will be
doing some kind of common activities
such as picking doing work or sleeping
so the first set of properties that we
cover are called properties in
object-oriented programming world and
the activities that human performs are
called methods in object-oriented
programming
thus properties and methods forms a
central entity called a class so here
human is a class which has two central
component which is properties and
methods so class is nothing but an
abstraction of some entity which
contains common set of properties and
matters ok what is object then so object
is nothing but a specific instance of a
class for example for human being these
two are specific instances of the human
class Tom Cruise and Mayas are poor the
both are human beings they both have
names gender occupation
they both do common set of activities
such as speaking doing work right but
when you talk about specific instance
the behavior so that the behavior varies
that properties are common for example
Tom Cruise has a name - our opera have
has a name but when you look at the
actual value which is the real name they
are different for example Tom Cruise no
name is Tom Cruise in the second case it
is - are poor so these names are
different but the the properties are
common okay as we know the concepts now
let's write our first class in Python as
usual I have P by charm editor open and
I have created class dot py file so the
way you write your class is first you'll
use a class keyword followed by the
class name which in our case is human
column enter the first property the
first method not the property is in it
method so you say depth underscore
underscore in it and it is Auto typing
this first argument which is self self
means this class itself and this self is
useful to define the properties of this
class and the way you define the
properties is self dot name equal to
something and you say self dot
occupation is equal to something
by doing this I effectively define two
properties in this human class and those
two properties are named and occupation
okay now this init method will be called
whenever you will create
an instance of this class later on so
then you're not as you know from the
concept that an instance has a specific
value of those properties so we need to
pass those here in this function so I'm
going to pass name and occupation as an
argument of this function so I will call
it N and O and assign the value of those
arguments to these two properties of the
class ok let's slide our first method
now which is do work okay so if you
recall from our concepts based on the
occupation of the person that human
being will be doing different kind of
work so if the human being is a tennis
player what kind of work does he do well
he will play tennis right so I will just
say plays tennis
as if the occupation of the person is an
actor then what does an actor usually do
by the way does he cook in the kitchen
no he shows a film usually you might
coconut kitchen who knows okay so this
is our first matter less side our second
method which is speaks so human being
speaks what does he speak well I will
say just for simplicity how are you
okay so we effectively defined two
methods of the class and two properties
of the class so our class definition is
complete so this entire thing is our
class definition now let's create some
instance of it the first systems I'm
going to create a storm and the way you
do it is you create a variable named
term equal to the class name and in the
bracket you will pass down those
arguments as you seen in the tooltip it
is same self and onn is highlighted
which means when you're creating an
instance of a class it is going to first
call this method in it okay so by doing
this you are calling this method and
this method takes three arguments self
and and oh but if you look in door tool
tip here it was saying that the first
argument is just implicitly taken so you
need to start from the second argument
okay so in the case of Raoul's it will
the name is Tom Cruise and the
occupation is an actor
I'll say Tom do work and Tom dot speak
okay so I create an instance of human
class and I just call in these two
methyl s execute the program and see
what happens
okay so when I execute it what happens
is it says Tom Cruise suits film
Tom who says how are you excellent
so here it recognized that if this guy
is a co occupation is an actor that's
why it printed shoots them okay let's
create another instance of this class
which is Marius our boss so I'll see
what I'm going to do is just okay I'm
not going to do copy paste because that
won't be efficient here so name of the
person and the occupation is tennis
player and I do work and my - speaks
okay
so this for the second instance the name
and occupation is different okay so
although the class is same the instance
is different so let's execute this okay
excellent so here you see for Tom it
printed tom cool suits film and he says
how are you
vs. 4 - our poet says she plays tennis
and she also says how are you ok so this
was a very quick demonstration of how to
create a class and how to create the
instance or an object of that class
