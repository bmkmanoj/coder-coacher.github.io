y-axis contains the frequency of a
variable let's say you have blood sugar
level of different patients in a
hospital and you want to know how many
patients are normal pre-diabetic and
diabetic in this case having a chart
like this could be useful where these
different bar represent different blood
sugar ranges and the y-axis contains the
number of patients who are within that
range for example you have for patients
who are above 125 sugar level and hence
they're diabetic we are going to plot
this histogram in matplotlib today as
usual I have launched my Jupiter not
book by running this command on my
command prompt and imported matplotlib
py plot as PLD I have put all the sugar
numbers for different patients in this
list I don't need the names of these
patients because when you are working
with a histogram you need only single
dimension array and the y-axis will
contain the frequency of those different
numbers to plot histogram you can call
PLT dot hist pass in the array or the
list and simply execute that and that
will do it for you now by default it
will plot 10 bins for you so in
histogram there is a concept called bin
or a bucket which is nothing but really
arranged in our case we want three
different ranges right like 80 to 100
hundred to 125 and above 125 but by
default here histogram plotted ten bins
so you can see that these are the bins
and these are the y-axis numbers okay so
let's play with this bins parameter a
little bit so you can
do a couple of different things with
this bins parameter so by default is 10
you can reduce it to whatever number you
like so let's say I want to reduce it to
through 3 ok now it looks a little
better because I have three bars but
these bars are joined ok so I can make
them look a little better by supplying
our width parameter our width is
basically a relative width of a bar
compared to a bin size so maximum value
is 1 so I wanted to be 0.9 to 5 which is
like 95% so now this bar looks a little
better this is like point 95 of the
entire range now by default it selected
bin sizes on its own by doing some equal
distribution so you can see the ranges
that we are using is 77 to 101 and then
125 and so on
you can customize this range and change
your bin parameter to specify the range
explicitly so remember our blood sugar
levels are 80 200 is normal 100 to 125
pre-diabetic and anything more than 125
is diabetic so I'm just going to put
some max number I know I don't have any
position is like ridiculously high so
there which is like more than 200 so
I'll stick with that okay so now this is
how it looks
I can probably reduce it to 150 to make
it look a little better ok if you check
the API for hist function there are
different parameters you can pass you
can pass parameters like color so let's
gene the color of this chart and here
you can either say green or you can use
abbreviation and both of that will work
you can also have this type set to be
step so in that case instead of the hard
rigid bar it will be like
as if you are hanging the steps okay so
you can try that okay so now let's say
you have two different samples so right
now you are having blood sugar levels of
man and let's say for the woman you have
those samples in a different data set so
I'm just going to copy some static data
once again and say I want to now plot
two type of histograms okay side by side
you can do that easily just change the
first argument and make it array okay so
now I have a list and in the list you
can pass both of these samples also for
convenience I'm going to use two
different colors so let's say I will use
green for the first sample orange for
the second sample and you can see that
now I have side-by-side histograms the
thing that this is missing is I don't
have any label so I don't know what
chart is what so I can add those labels
easily by supplying label parameter so
the first chart is men and the second
chart is for women also I will enable
legend okay you can also set your X
label and X label is sugar range Y label
is your frequency or like total number
of patient
and the title is your blood sugar
analysis probably so now my chart looks
much better I have two side by side
histograms of one for men one for women
and this is showing the blood sugar
levels along with the frequency when you
have this kind of chart it helps you
analyze and compare the different ranges
right here for example I can say that
number of patients who are normal are
more than the number of patient who are
either pre-diabetic or diabetic so you
can do like comparative analysis with
different data sets and different
groupings within the data set so
histogram this way is a very powerful
data visualization tool that you can use
in solving any given problem
one last property I wanted to show you
is orientation or en station where you
can plot histograms in a horizontal
fashion so sometimes people like
histograms to be in this way okay that's
all I had for this tutorial I have
provided a link of this tributon
notebook in the video description below
as usual I am going to say that you
don't learn coding just by watching this
tutorial you have to download this
notebook play with it and try different
data sets and different histogram
properties and that that would be the
only way to learn it okay thank you very
much for watching and good bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
