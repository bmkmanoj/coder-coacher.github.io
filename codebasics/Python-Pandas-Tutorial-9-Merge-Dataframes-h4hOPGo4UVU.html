tutorial today we are going to talk
about Marge in pendous as usual I have
launched my Jupiter not book by running
Jupiter not book command on my command
prompt and it launched my notebook here
and what I'm going to do is create a new
notebook now to save some time on
recording I have some code snippet which
I am going to just copy directly so I
have this first data frame which
contains temperature information on
different cities and then I have the
second data frame which contains data on
humidity now often I want to join these
two data frames to create a one single
data frame which contains both
temperature and humidity and you can do
that using pandas merge function so you
can say PD dot merge your first data
frame your second data frame and the
column on which you want to perform this
much okay
and when you print your data frame it's
going to look like this so now it has
temperature and humidity and you can see
that New York has 68 humidity which is
68 here and 21 temperature so it is
truly it's not just going by the row
index it is truly looking into the value
of the city and performing this join now
if you are aware about database joints
then this is exactly same it's like
doing a joint between two tables using
this column such as which which is
basically City okay now here you had all
three cities present in both the data
frames what if you have let's say one
extra city here Baltimore where the
average temperature is less 832 and then
you don't have all lando here instead of
that you have San Francisco
okay so let's say this is how your data
frames
our setup okay now when you perform this
joint you'll notice that the result has
only New York and Chicago so whatever
was common between these two data frames
you are seeing it here now it's missing
Orlando Baltimore and San Francisco the
reason is it as you already figured it
out it did and in the intersection so if
you remember you're the set theory as
you can see in the diagram intersection
is basically taking common elements
between the between the two sets okay
also in our database wall there is this
concept of inner join so that's what
this is inner join or intersection okay
now the second kind of join that you
have in database is basically outer join
or if you want to use set theory down
terminology then it will be a union
taking union of our two sets basically
okay so the argument that you would use
is how saying how if you say outer then
it's gonna take it's going to be a union
of these two tables so you'll see
Orlando Baltimore and San Francisco and
the columns for which it doesn't have
information is going to put na n over
here okay so you we saw outer join then
inner join is default is whatever you
see when you don't supply how column so
if you do find as more documentation you
will see that by default how is inner ok
alright another kind of joint is left
joint so again as you can see in the
picture left will take all the common
elements between the two sets and also
the remaining elements from the left
data frame so you can see that now I
have all lando in Baltimore okay these
two are present but I don't have San
Francisco because census
go is my right data frame and by the way
left and right is decided by the order
in in your March call so df1 is left and
bf2 is right okay
now let me do or right inner joint not
right energon really right joint so in
right join you will see elements from
right data film so you can see San
Francisco and of course the common
elements but you don't see now Orlando
and Bosma going back to outer join when
you have this result data frame
sometimes you might want to know from
which data am these element coming so
for example this has an end so you know
is that it came from left or right okay
so in order to know that you can use
indicator flag so by default it is set
to false but if you set it to true you
will get this additional merge column
where it where it will say if you know
where this data came from so for example
this was present in both the data frame
so it says both then it says left only
which means Orlando will was present
only in the left data frame so this
could be useful sometimes we also have
one more argument called suffixes so
let's say you have common columns in
both the data frames so again I'm going
to copy some poor snippet here okay so
let's say this is your data frame which
has both humidity and temperature and
then you have your second data frame
here which also have humidity and
temperature okay now when you join this
two so I again do like PD dot mod DF 1
DF 2 and your own would be City okay so
what you'll notice is is going to
automatically append underscore X and
underscore why because humidity column
temperature column were repeated between
these two data frames hence our when it
shows the result it needs to somehow
distinguish these two columns so it
appended these suffixes now if you want
your own surface suffix X then you can
use this suffix X column there you can
say okay my left column and my left data
frame and right data frame so when you
do that it by default is using
underscore X and underscore Y but when
you explicitly supply this suffix X is
can I use that as you can see it here
okay so that's all I have for this
tutorial thank you very much for
watching you can find the link of the
jupiter notebook used in this tutorial
in the video description below
I'll see you in a next toriel thanks
again bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
