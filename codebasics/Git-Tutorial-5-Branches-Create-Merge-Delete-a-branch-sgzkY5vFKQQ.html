going to look at branches in gate let's
first see why branches are needed if you
have code like this where I have this
file hungry dot py and let's say you are
making some crazy changes on this file
ok and these changes are experimental in
nature so that you might throw them away
hence you want to preserve your original
code so in order to do that what you'll
typically do is you will copy/paste this
file ok and then you will make your
changes here I will just call it
original file so this one is my original
file original file and then you will
make your changes here bunch of changes
here and then you run it and you kind of
do your experiment with it that way your
code is still saved in this original
file ok but this way of working is not
very efficient so get by default
supports this branch concept which
essentially allows you to do the same
thing it allows you to create two
branches of your code where you can do
parallel code development on both the
branches you can make experiments you
can test stuff and once things look ok
you can merge them back into one file ok
so that's essentially what primes will
do for you now if you noticed or
whenever you have good directory you
will see master here so master is a
default branch that it will give you now
I want to make experimental changes on
this core so I need to create a new
branch
so first let's run git branch come on
when you do that it will list all the
branches that you have I only have
master right now I am going to create a
new branch called thirsty and when I do
get branch
I now see master and thirsty okay now
first you need to make thirsty branch
active you see there is a star here and
this is in green color which means
master is an active branch so to make
thirsty branch active you will run git
checkout spaced branch named thirsty now
it is saying it switched to branch
thirsty so now you are on a thirsty
branch again when you run git branch
you'll see star in front of thirsty okay
I will now make my changes so if you are
not hungry I want to ask are you thirsty
so I will just say input odd I you
thirsty and based on the user feedback
are the asked user to drink water okay
so let's say this is your code you ran
it it works fine so now you want to
commit it so you say git commit before
doing it commit you always need to do
you get ad and then you get commit minus
M water okay so you committed your
change into thirsty branch
okay now let's so let's check out our
master branch back and let's see what
our master branch has so I just checked
out my master branch and when I move my
cursor here you notice that all those
changes went away because master branch
doesn't have those changes those changes
are experimental in nature
and they exist only in thirsty branch
okay so masters Magda brands now if I
again go back to thirsty I will be able
to see those changes so you notice there
is no thirsty change when I when I
switch the branch
I will now see this changes right so
it's quite powerful all right now let me
make one more change so I added water
now I am going to ask my kid to drink
soda as well because it's so thirsty
right so I added that and I will now
commit this change as well cool
so now if you do get long you see soda
water per groupies are all the previous
changes and if you switch the branch to
master you will obviously lose those
changes and when you do when you do get
long okay I mistakenly tired
let me type it here good long I see only
border Pisa you see I don't see any
water and soda changes because I am on
master branch and that branch doesn't
have any or thirsty related for changes
okay so I will keep on making my core
changes in my thirsty branch like this
execute the code run it and the moment
when I feel that these chord changes are
ready to merge I will do the mush but
before I show you the marsh let me now
make a chord change into master branch
so if you want to make a chord change in
master branch you need to check out
master branch
so now I'm in master branch Here I am
going to add
so I love to eat junk food so I'm not
going to eat only samosa but pizza
burger and fries as well okay and as
usual you do get a git commit to add
your fries we need to get log you have
fries burger peas etcetera but this
change eat fries doesn't exist in you're
thirsty branch you can always verify by
checking it out so you see there is no
fries here okay so just to give you kind
of pictorial view of what we just did
you can take a look at this picture
so we we're on master branch this this
line here is our master branch and we
all the circles are individual commits
so you added Pisa you added burger and
at this point you created a new branch
called thirsty so all green colored dots
are commits into thirsty branch okay so
you added water juice here you are the
fries here so fries is not present in
thirsty branch and water in juice is not
present in master branch okay so now
what we are going to do is these changes
look okay and I want to merge a thirsty
chord changes into master in order to do
that you first need to go to your base
branch where you want to merge into so I
want to merge thirsty chord changes into
master branch hence I am going into
master branch master branch first okay
so master is my active branch and now I
will do git merge
thirsty this is that moist thirsty
branch into master branch when you do
that it will ask you to type in the
commit message I will do : WQ that will
save my commit message and my Maj is
done
so when I
cat get log here here after fries I have
one more change which says Kate branch
Marge branch thirsty alright now when I
look at the code here you will notice
now it is a merger of these two branches
I have my thirsty code as well and I
have fries as well so this is explained
by this picture here so until this point
you were two different branches and now
you merged so at this point you have
fries and water and juice as well
okay alright now when I look at my
github repository I only have master
here because I have not pushed my
changes so this is the place where you
see all the branches on github okay I'm
going to now push the thirsty branch
okay so it says good push alright so it
is not alright so you will just do git
push and this is failed to push
reference up to the DJ because it is
behind integrator remote changes okay
let me do get poked is something which
is not okay git push now when you do get
push it's gonna post the master branch
alright so right now what it did is when
you do get push at any time it is just
pushing the current active branch so
master changes are pushed if I look at
here I see all the all the changes say
fries and thirsty and everything okay
but now I want to help thirsty branch
present here as well so for that you
need to check out that branch first so
now your interests around and now you do
git push okay what this is saying is
that upstream meaning github doesn't
help thirsty branch so you want to push
a new branch use
this command yes I want to do that so
just copy paste this command and what
this is saying is set upstream origin
thirsty meaning pushed thirsty to my
upstream which is github so now when i
refresh and take a look here I have two
branches master and thirsty so when I
switch the branch here
thirsty look at my core this is just my
thirsty branch code it doesn't have
fries here and if you look at master
it has everything okay so branches
essentially allows you to maintain two
separate copies of your code okay and
those copies might have alternate
versions of your code your algorithm or
whatever you're trying to do all right
okay now let's see how you can delete
the branch okay so I'm going to show you
how to delete the branch so for deleting
the branch first let me create some
dummy branch now last time when we
created a branch we shoot two commands
get branch and then get checkout you can
do both the things in one come on
by doing it check out - be dummy so mine
what this is saying is create a new
branch called dummy for me - B means
branch and also check out that branch
alright so now it created the me branch
and it made that active as well so if
you do get branch see you see a third
branch called dummy and this is active
ok now what I'm going to do is delete
this branch
so get Ranchos three branches I want to
delete the me the way you do it is by
running git branch - dee dee means
delete dummy when you do that it says it
deleted the brunt so now when I do get
branch I don't have that planche anymore
alright so that was all about get
branches and great merging thank you for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
