show you how to write compound
expression in Giulia using begin and
semicolon jeans compound expression is
nothing but something similar to a
function where you perform multiple
operations and assign a value final
value to a variable so for example you
want to calculate an area of a triangle
you can do that by writing a compound
expression like this so you begin with
begin and then you say okay my base is
whatever my ideas I'm just putting some
random values here and the area of a
triangle is 1 by 2 into base into height
and to end it you just type in n so what
just happened is it executed all these
three expressions and the value of the
last expression which was this got
assigned to area you can do the same
thing by writing on semi colon separated
chain so I will do base 10 sampled
height equal to 5 semicolon 1 by 2 into
base into height when I do that I get a
simpler so both of these have the same
effect now you might have already
realized that this is nothing but a
short way of writing a function so this
is equivalent to writing
triangle area function where you will
basically do the same thing so I can do
the exit same thing here and it is it
will walk the same way as begin compound
expression okay so number one number two
and number three all these three things
have a exact same effect so these two
are just a quick way of writing compound
expression in giulia they're pretty
powerful you don't need to go into a
formal definition of a function you want
to do some operation pretty quickly so
you just write it in line and get it
done so that was about it
