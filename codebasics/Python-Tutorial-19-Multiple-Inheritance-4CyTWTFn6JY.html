tutorial today we are going to cover
multiple inheritance in Python in my
last video we looked at single
inheritance and we paint two basic
concepts and this one we are going to
inherit a class from two different
classes so as you see here I have
defined two classes father and mother
and father has one method gardening it
just prints I enjoy gardening mother has
one method called cooking now I'm going
to define get child class from these two
classes and the way you inherit your
class from two classes is you specify
just the class name in the bracket like
this okay and that will inherit child
class from this base class number one
and base class number two okay now you
can say okay child
what does chai know so sports child will
say okay I enjoy sports
okay now as a standard an example
indicates child will inherit properties
of father and mother so that's why now
child will have access to cooking and
gardening method as well so when you
create a child glass object and if you
say gardening it will allow it to access
that method and then of course it can
access its own method as well so let's
run it and see what happens
excellent so you can access so child
class can access the matter of both of
these base classes okay so the benefit
of multiple inheritance is sometimes you
have two different classes and you just
want to inherit the properties and
methods of those classes just to reuse
the code and then you want to add your
own customization so that's when you
should use multiple inheritance and you
can inherit your class from as many
classes as you want so here after comma
you can type any number of classes and
it should work another way to look at
multiple inheritance is you can even in
a single method you can call the base
class method so if I replace this method
with let's say by calling just the
skills so let's say father has skills of
gardening and programming this father is
a computer engineer by the way and
mother has a skill of cooking and art
okay now the name of the methods are
same here child also has the same
method called skills and child in your
sports now when you run the program like
this it will okay let me just remove all
these calls see God skills when you run
the program like this it will just print
sports now if you want to inherit the
base class skills method then you can
just type in your class name here so
father dot skill you can do monitored or
skill so what this will do is when it
executes this method it will first
execute father door skills method and
mother discuss method and then it will
print this statement so when you run it
oh yeah it is complaining because you
need to pass this self parameter in the
bracket okay
so it says now gardening programming
cooking and art so this child is a
multi-talented personality now he has
all the skills of his father which is
gardening and programming all the skills
of mother which is cooking an art and he
has his own skills as well which is
sports so that was all about multiple
inheritance thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
