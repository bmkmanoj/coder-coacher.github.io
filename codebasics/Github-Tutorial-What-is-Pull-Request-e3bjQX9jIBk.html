going to see what is pull request and
github on github owner can share his
code with others
now other person can look at the code
and he can make changes to fix a bug or
add an enhancement and then send a
request to the owner to pull or merge
his core changes into honors repository
this request is called a pull request
let us understand this by using this
picture these four people on this github
repo let's say this is the repository
for node.js which is an open source
project this guy here
his name is Tom unless it Tom looks at
node.js code base and then he realizes
that he needs to fix a some bug or make
sanim and enhancement now since this is
an open source project he can copy the
project into his local github private
repository then pull the project on his
local computer make core changes so this
blue color indicates the coaching that
he made and then he can push that into
his own private github repository after
that he can create a pull request or
asking owners to pull his core changes
into owners repository when this request
is sent owners can see the difference
which is this blue color line code
change and they can either comment or
they can just accept the request
directly so pull request allows you to
start a conversation around that code
change between the owners and between
the code contributor so this promotes of
collaboration and pull request is one of
the reasons why github has become very
popular ok now let's look at the
demonstration so let's say we have
these two users Brad and Angelina are
who not only collaborate as a wife and
husband or actors but they want to do a
collaboration when it comes to
programming as well so this guy has this
code repository called hungry and he has
all this code now if you look at the URL
that is Brad 27th oh so this is owned by
Brad ok now
Angelina looks at this codebase and she
wants to let's say make some changes
here so she will then go and so the
person right here is Angelina so she
will open odd this repository here so as
you can see here the signed-in user is
Angelina but she has opened the
repository from Brad and she can click
on this fork button to copy Brad's code
into her own private repo ok so now she
has Corbis copied and now you can see
that is the links is Angelina ok
so typically she will pull the if the
code changes are huge civil pull this
code base into her local computer and
make code changes run the code and do
some test verified and once things look
ok she will push it here to her own
private repository but since this is a
tutorial I am going to make code change
directly on this web website so if you
don't know our github allows you to edit
code directly on the website so I will
just click on edit file and make a code
change here and I will
and hungry equal to Y so she wants to
add Y as a valid input okay so let me
make this bigger so that you can see
what Co change I made so she just added
this line okay and then she can commit
her changes you can say okay added Y as
a valid answer and commit changes so
once you do that and if you go to your
commits you can see the difference here
by clicking here so it says you added
this thing here okay now it is the time
to create a pull request so Angelina is
ready with her chord changes now she
wants to merge these chord changes here
in to Brad's repository so for that she
will click on pull request here okay and
then let's see so here there is a button
new pull request so click on new pull
request so here it will tell you from
where you are merging to which
repository so your base the repository
is Brad 27 so this says that from
Angelina hungry a code repository master
branch I want to merge into brass
repository okay and it allows you to see
the difference so if I am Angelina
Angelina can see that I am asking to add
this coaching okay so I'll click on
create pull request here you can add
some meaningful comment here and then
just say create pull request so at this
point the Corps from here it's not
merged here okay so now Angelina is kind
of waiting for Brad to review his whole
code okay so if I am Brad I will are in
this area
if I just refresh my webpage I will see
this little notification okay
and this notification is telling me that
let me maximize the screen so this
notification is not telling me that uh
someone has sent me a pull request so I
will click here and if I want to see the
actual cogeco changes I can go here in
file chain and I can see the code
changes now I'm Brad let's say and I
like this call change but then one thing
is I want to add capital y as an input
so I will put a comment saying that a
good change I like it can you also add
capital y ah so then you will put your
comment here and once you put your
command now let's go back to Angelina
because the ball is in Angelina's code
now okay and once she opens this pull
request see will see a comment from Brad
twenty-seven saying that good change I
like it can you also add y ok so now
what Angelina will do is she kind of
agrees with bad so she will go ahead and
add Y as well so let's see so here I'm
in this pull request ok
just a second okay sorry so I'm looking
at Brad scores
okay I shouldn't be so this is bad
suppository okay let me go back so
Angelina should be looking at her
repository which is hungry okay so here
what she will do is she will add capital
y as a valid input so we'll say okay and
hungry equal to capital y then that also
is a valid input added capital y into
list of valid answers okay she will
commit her core change and let's look at
the full request okay so the pull
request will be here
okay so now you can see here that there
is added wine to list of valid answers
and if you look at this files change now
I have both of this available in my pull
request okay so if I am bread
I will also again get a notification
saying that Angelina Argosy there is a
notification here saying that there is
some update on this pull request so you
can view the Jean that was made last
time or view you can view all the
changes so now this change kind of looks
okay to me and I'm fine merging it into
my depository so what I will do is I
will go here and I will click on merge
button okay eventually you will click on
merge button to merge it so now what
happened is in brass repository I have
now d score changes so this completes
the cycle and now I have Brad and
Angelina both showing up as a decor
contributor okay so that was just a nice
quick demo of pull request they are
extremely popular in open source world
where there is a open source project and
multiple people contribute to it okay
and this whole model of pull request and
sharing code is number one reason why
github is so popular</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
