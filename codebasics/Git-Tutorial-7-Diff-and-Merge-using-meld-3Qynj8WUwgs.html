going to learn how to do this and merge
using a tool called meld in git and here
is the list of items for this tutorial
let's first begin by installing Mel for
this are just type in download Mel in
Google and click on this first link mail
merge dot org is the website here click
the link for the download so I have
Windows and I am going to install it
using Mel installer here click on
download button and it will begin the
download okay so it's downloading the
file here okay my download is over and I
have this file here so just double click
here to run the installation just click
on next next neck and install it my
installation is complete and you can see
that it put the installation into this C
program files melt directory okay so
this is where I have this program
installed now what I'm going to do is
show you the git repository that I have
here I have this C code hungry
repository where I have a hungry dog py
file and if you look at that file this
is how the file looks and on github the
files looks like this so basically I
have added these two new commits to the
file if you compare these two you will
see these two are the extra lines that I
have added and if I do get flogged
you will see those two lines were added
through this commit now let's see how to
run get lift to command to see the
difference so first we are going to see
the difference between this upstream
which is github and our local repository
in order to do that you had to run git
diff tool origin master origin master
here miss github then you do that here
it is saying that launch vm disk
so we install meld but we have not
configured meld yet that's why it is
using some default tool that comes with
get installation if you do yes then it
will show you the difference like this
now when leaf looks like a UI from 80s
it looks like jaws okay it shows you the
difference that this is a new file you
added these two lines but it's not
doesn't look very nice doesn't look
modern basically okay and that's the
whole reason why we want to use Mel so
in order to use Mel
first you need to configure it now to
configure it you need to go to see users
your directory so I am laundry user and
here you will find a git config file if
you open gate config file you have only
this thing ok now you need to add a
couple of lines here so I am just going
to copy paste
from here so you need to add these three
lines in order to configure melt first
line says that for lift you are using a
tool called meld now what does meld mean
so mal means go to this path and fetch
the exe we previously saw that this is
the directory where mal was installed so
you want to supply the same directory
name okay and the third one is diff
token false meaning don't give me this
kind of prompt whenever I say git diff
tool always launch mal
so let's try this out now when I do this
it's going to launch Mel and Mel is a
nice-looking UI where you see a cord on
the left side this is your upstream and
this is your local code okay are so now
here there is an extra line okay so it
looks like there is some problem let me
do get pull real quick to pull whatever
changes I have up on upstream and it's
going to merge and when I do get diff -
now I will be seeing the correct depth
okay so the correct diff as you can see
here I don't have those two lines versus
in my local file I have these two lines
so so let me
just adding my windows so that you can
see the difference clearly okay so this
is what I have on upstream so see this
is what I have an upstream so on the
left side this is github pour this is my
local code where you can see this extra
two lines okay so this is how you see
the difference between your local and op
strings now if you make any further
chain and let's say you did not commit
it then there is a way to see that
change as well so for example here now I
am adding a new line call and hungry
equal to you let's say I add this line
okay and then when I do get status I see
this file is changed now I can just
simply then get lift to get diff tool
they show the change between your
uncommitted changes in your head so your
head doesn't have this and your local
changes has that okay so that's why it
is showing how okay now let's say if you
have multiple different stalls and you
want to launch a specific tool for
example rims if some people like them
differ even though it is old then to
launch that you can always use minus T
option and give the name of the tool - t
means - then this so use vim diff for
this one
it will launch him death you can also
use meld so mad so this way by giving -
the option you can launch different
tools okay now we are going to look into
how to resolve conflicts or how to merge
conflicts okay so now let me make some
changes locally so locally I have this
chain all right and I'm going to commit
this change so let me just commit this
chi and I will say added Bo okay so this
is what I have locally now someone else
can go to this repository and they can
make a change so let's say they added Y
okay and I'll just stay added why
now what happened is my local repository
and my upstream got out of sync here I
have this stuff but locally I have
hungry equal to you so they are at the
same location but they are different
chord changes now when I do get cool so
that before pushing the changes you
always want to do get full so that you
can always get the latest copy from the
upstream when I do that it is telling me
now that there is a merge conflict you
see here much conflict because we both
made a change at the same same location
okay and if you open your file now it
looks really messy
you'll be worried what happened to your
file so what this is saying is your head
has this head with your local change but
your upstream has this now obviously you
can manually edit this and you can let's
say it choose which gene you want to
keep let's say you want to keep upstream
change which is this then you can just
remove these lines and manually edit it
but it's not very convenient if you have
so many changes so for that you need to
run merge tool now before you run merge
tool you have to again configure your
merge tool in your git config file and
to configure your merge tool you need to
add these three lines okay here it is
saying that for merge use this tool
called Mel and again the for the Mel we
have specified the path so that get
knows from where to launch that tool and
also there is an option to not keep
backup files if you keep backup files is
going to create so many new files in
your code repository and it's going to
confuse you so I recommend you add this
option alright once you have added this
option in your kit country
now I'm going to launch git merge tool
so just run git merge tool come on
so remember you are in a merging stage
here and at that point you are running
git merge tool ok so in the middle
you're seeing your local file which is
here CC code hungry hundred-watt py on
the left you have your local changes
like before it showed these merge
conflicts these were your changes and
these were changes from the upstream now
you can decide which in change you want
to keep so for example let's say I like
the upstream change I want to keep it so
you can click on this little arrow here
ok once you do that what its gonna do is
it's gonna remove everything else and
keep this one and if you didn't like
that alright so let me just close it and
cancel it
ok
close it and say close without saving
and again launch the same command
basically
let's say I wanted to keep my chain
instead of abstention in that case you
would have clicked this arrow and it
will keep your change okay so I can do
undo so you can do unknown or do undo
and then you can go to next chain if you
have so many changes you can use these
arrows you can use this save option
there are many useful options in this
area okay I decided to use my upstream
chain so I'm going to click on this
arrow okay and hit save and hit cancel
okay at this point I have some local
changes so I can just say git commit - M
most conflicts so I just successfully
merged conflicts okay at this stage now
my repository status is clear now it is
master from merging and I can now push
my commit so when I do push is gonna
update the upstream and upstream now has
both of these changes plus it has this
new okay so that was all about how to
use a med for deferring the changes and
also for merging the changes I have used
mal uh for quite some time it is very
very user friendly so I would recommend
you to use the same tool alright thanks
for watching and we'll see you in the
next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
