Python strings are used to store text
data in Python let me show you example
so let's say you want to store ice-cream
and to do that you create a variable
called text and using double quotation
mark you type in icecream when you hit
Enter
what happened is this variable now
contains this data call ice cream so you
see on the right-hand side here in the
picture the way python stores ice cream
is it's a sequence of characters so text
starts at specific memory address and
then after it's a sequence of characters
stored in different memory addresses now
using an index you can access individual
characters so for example if I want to
access first character I in this
variable then the way I do it is using
square bracket type in text square
bracket 0 if I do that I will get I so
if I want to access now see you will do
one so each of these initial letters are
stored at specific memory locations
which can be accessed using these
indexes ok if now you want to let's
change the content of particular
character you would think what if I do
this hmm it gives the error so this
means strings are immutable
once you create them you cannot change
it you can place another string into
this variable but you cannot partially
change it using the index character so
just remember that strings are immutable
in Python programming languages other
programming languages such as C++ Java
they will allow you to do it
but not Python now what if I want to
access substring within this main string
so let's say I want to print eyes the
way you do it is using the index sub
range so I starts at zero index and ii
ends at two but the way sub index works
is you have to give index after it so ii
answer to so give three and when you do
it you will get eyes here
so always remember the first index is
included whereas the second one is
excluded so whatever is the second index
minus 1 that's then dex
up to which it will go and print your
substring similarly if you want to print
cream what you'll do is you will first
figure out the index of it so it will be
0 1 2 3 4 and then you will go all of it
until the end so 5 6 7 8 9 so you're
going one more here but what if you
don't want to supply this index and you
just want to say ok start for from 4 and
go until the end in that case you can
just omit that index so just don't
specify the index and it will assume
that you want to go all the way towards
the end similarly if you omit the index
with the starting index then if it will
start from 0 so if I do this again I got
eyes so if you don't specify anything it
will assume it's 0
okay if you can use double quotes and
single quotes to store the text data so
for example I can say hello like this so
this is also defining a string using
double quote or I can use single quote
or doing the same thing
they both are same thing there's just no
difference this could be useful
especially if you have single or double
quote as part of your string itself for
example if I have a string called let's
run Python
so let's we'll say let's long Python if
I do something like this where I used
single quotation to as a as a boundary
of my string and I have a quote within
my string itself if I do it it will give
an error why because it is thinking that
this is the end of the string whereas my
intention is to make this whole thing
one single string it's in situation like
this I would always use double quotes
outside and then internally you can use
as many single quotes as you want and it
won't give you any problem similarly if
you have double code inside your string
use single quote outside so
let's say my hollow world world has
double quotes then I will use single
boat outside and it just works so if you
print X it will bend it fine all right
what if now I have multi-line string
let's say I were to store my address
which because which comprises of
multiple lines and my address is plus a
1 purple Street New York and I want to
go to the next line so as as soon as I
hit enter I will get this error so in
this situation use triple board so
triple quotes one purple Street New York
is the name of my city USA and when it
ends and end it with triple code so now
when I print this address you will see
that it stored it fine without any
issues right now the internally the way
it stores it is it will use a special
character so as you if you look at
internal representation of this string
it is using slash and so slash and means
newline ok now the next thing about
string is you can use plus sign to
concatenate two strings so if you have a
string called
hello and another string call Walt and
if you want to join them you just do s1
plus s2 right now here I want little
space in between so you can add space
like this
so airspace all right so plus we'll just
join the two strings what if I want to
join number with a string so let's say I
want to say total States in USA is oops
I made a mistake
so total states in the USA so this my
string and my number is 25 so I have
another variable called num where I'm
storing total number States and I want
to join these two if I do s + num it
will give me this error because Python
doesn't know how to join string with an
integer so what you need to do first is
convert this number into a string little
python can join two strings so somehow
can was this convert this number to a
string and then join okay so there is a
function called STR very important you
will use this a lot in Python if you do
this it will convert 25 which was a
number to a string how do I know this is
string you because you see this
quotation mark here so now when I do s
plus STR nom
it will bring total states in USA 25
okay so that's it that was all about
strings in Python thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
