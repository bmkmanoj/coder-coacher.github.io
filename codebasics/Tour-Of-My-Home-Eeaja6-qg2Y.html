it's the Christmas Day wish you all a
very happy Christmas and Happy Holidays
I don't feel like doing any programming
video so I thought I will walk you
through my home so let's get started
starting with my Christmas tree so this
is my living area you can see here we've
got some nice lights a nice drape work a
photo frame and my wife bought this
Christmas tree she loves Christmas all
the ornaments and stuff she loves dogs
by the way so you can see little there
are so many ornaments with the theme of
dog so that's what we got and you can
see you Santa Claus okay so this is our
sitting area some pictures and then here
is our dining table so it's just me and
my wife so we don't use this also on but
just when we have guests we end up using
it you can extend it all also so you can
make it like 12 or 8 seater two days
back it was my sister's birthday so we
have a little happy birthday banner here
my back here has a nice golf course so
you get a nice view and it's an open
view we know that there won't be any
constructions or any trees around so you
get plenty of sunlight okay nice now
let's go to kitchen so this is our
kitchen area I am my wife we cook a lot
we spend so much time in kitchen we
believe in healthy eating so don't mind
spending our time in kitchen
I rarely watch TV we believe in spending
time in meaningful things you can see
there is a wheatgrass juice so we grow a
wheatgrass at our home so you can see
that here there's a nice wheatgrass we
got and then we have a second batch
coming up so here we have a second batch
you can see that it's barely started but
it will become like this other guy and
then in the morning what I did is I took
some of the wheatgrass and I used it in
my Vitamix and I got an extra class so I
drank I usually drink it we just use all
in the morning and then this is the
extra glass I got so I will drink it
around 4 o'clock ok this is our
breakfast table this is where we eat our
lunch dinner whatever breakfast and then
this is the family room so again big
windows
I like sunlight a lot I'm from India I'm
used to too much sunlight so I feel real
depressed when it is cloudy so again a
nice goal of course view here is our TV
and then we got two big car garages so I
have my car here my wife's car is not
here because she is working today so
that's the thing with working in
hospital this is a respiratory therapist
even though such Christmas someone got
to work you can't say to your patient
that it's a holiday you guys go home
we'll see you next day that's something
very different about health care
profession that you end up working on
major holidays sometimes again nice
do I have an open deck in summer we
spend a lot of time here we usually take
our dinner in this area okay so now
let's go upstairs
okay so this one is our master bedroom
it's pretty decent in terms of size you
can see that now here easily is my yoga
mat actually I spend time in the morning
doing yoga here here is the east
direction so the Sun will rise from this
this direction gives the plenty of
sunlight I can do my Sun salute and my
meditation in this area when we bought
this home two years back this is what we
like the the open air and the sunlight
that was our main criteria and that was
one of the major reasons why we bought
this home that's my wife
I took her picture when we visited Grand
Canyon few years back Bonnie's teddy
bears a lot more pictures and close it
all the plots bathroom we have a jet tub
which we have never used as a troop with
any other homeowners they end up buying
this big table with jet and rarely use
it this is a guest bathroom so one thing
is my previous owner was very particular
about little details so he did a lot of
like type of like art well you can see
all these mirrors and the frames and the
color very particular about those things
my mom visits us from India and summer
usually and that's when she stays in
this room
otherwise if we have any guests or
something they will use it another
closet again one more big window and now
we go to most interesting part which is
my office so when I work from home I use
this computer it it it has got a bigger
screen which really helps and then there
is my recording device a printer and
another window so this is facing my
community so like a you can see other
homes in my neighborhood I live in
Monroe Township New Jersey it's a very
nice neighborhood very quiet and 95 is
accessible from here it is like two
minutes from my home so if you want to
go anywhere it you just take 95 and it
saves you a lot of time okay now
basement so basement is something we
don't use at all actually I mean
especially this area so you can see that
my previous owner had nice furniture
here and he used to spend a lot of time
in this area but we don't we rarely come
here now one thing let me turn the
lights on it's going to be dark sorry
about that
okay so he had this nice 900 bottle wine
chiller where he used to keep all his
wines
you can see that this storage unit is
empty because I don't drink when my own
of previous owner learnt about me not
drinking he was very disappointed
because he did all this hard work in
building this thing and now it was not
going to be used for this okay different
section of the same basement so you can
see there are two sections like the one
that we just saw was fully finished this
one is like semi finished we keep all
our like sometimes we buy like extra
groceries and stuff and we have got nice
racks here so we'll keep it here and
then here is our boiler I recently had a
water leak so I had to get this guy
replaced so this is like only one week
old this is my furnace and then I have
my dumbbells here sometimes I come in
this area do a little light weight late
weight lifting
okay and then I have got some closets so
my extra closet where you can keep your
things okay so that was my basement okay
let's look at outside so how it looks
it's very cool my neighborhood so this
is how it looks
that's my thank you guys
Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
