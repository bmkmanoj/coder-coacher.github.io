are going to look into top five reasons
on why everyone should learn Python
reason number one it is very easy to
learn so if you are a new programmer
just starting out then buy Python is
definitely a way to go the reason it is
easy to learn is because of its compact
and English like orphan - I have an
example here on how to open a file in
Java versus Python as you can see in
Java it is lot more lines of code and
it's not very intuitive or easy to
remember
whereas in Python it's pretty compact
less lines of code and extremely easy to
remember even today when I want to open
a file in let the Java or C++ I have to
do Google to figure out that the API
whereas for Python you can wake me up in
the middle of the night and I remember
exactly what lines to write reason
number two is you can develop code much
faster in Python
compared to other compiled languages
such as Java or C++ and there are three
reasons for this reason number one is
whatever we talked about earlier which
is easy to remember course index so
let's say if you remember on the top of
your head all the APS is index then you
don't have to do Google too much and you
can just type your code this number two
is Python is an interpreted language it
doesn't have compilation I worked in C++
for more than 15 years and I remember I
used to spend majority of my time in
compiling the code rather than focusing
on the real problem the full comparison
step is missing in Python which speeds
of your development by great amount
compared to C++ developing code in
Python is at least five times faster so
for example if it takes five hours to
develop something in C++ in Python it
takes only one hour and this is very
important
reason number three is that is library
for everything PYP I which is a Python
app package index has more than hundred
thousand packages so if you want to do
something there is a huge possibility
that someone has it turned off for that
orderly and you can directly use it
there is only a package available and
this is awesome because now you don't
have to write too much cool you can just
use a ready-made code from someone these
are number three is what I just
mentioned earlier which is a rich set of
libraries PYP I has more than hundred
thousand packages so let's say if you
are working with images then there is
pillow if you're a database programmer
there is SQL alchemy if you are doing
scientific computing then there is side
by there is numb by method live the list
just goes on and on top of it everything
is open source so you can look at the
code and if you find any bug or
enhancement then you can send a pull
request or you can form the repo and you
can make adjustments reason number four
is python is used heavily in three
specific domains data science machine
learning and scientific computing the
reason python is so popular in these
three areas is the whole ecosystem of
jupiter not book combined with these
awesome packages such as scikit-learn
number sci-fi and benders makes is a
perfect candidate for these three areas
and reason number five is there are so
many job opportunities available in
Python
companies like Google and Facebook uses
it heavily so if you have good skills in
Python then it's very easy to get a job
also some of the popular websites such
as YouTube kora Survey Monkey and
Dropbox are powered by Python now these
are very high scale systems doing some
heavy lifting so it proves the point
that Python
useful enterprise systems I think people
complaining that python is slow but it's
not really slow because most of the time
you are using third-party modules and
those modules are developed in compiled
languages like C or Fortran for example
number is actually implemented in
Fortran and when you use it in your
Python code you will be running that
code at the speed of Fortran which is
pretty fast that's all I have for this
tutorial if you like the content please
give it a thumbs up like subscribe or
comment below also check my youtube
channel I have tutorials on various
topics such as Python julia binders and
kit alright thank you very much for
watching and I will see you in next
tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
