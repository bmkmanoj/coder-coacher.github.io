our survival game series done by
brackets I am the CEO of Brad keys and
in this video we're going to take a look
at expanding on a time of day script to
allow us to change the color of the
water so it can fit in with the time of
day so when it's night we're going to
have like dark water not that saturated
and when it's bright or daytime we're
going to have bright and colorful water
so if we open up the unity you can see
that a lot of things has changed here
wow I am currently working on a video
where I do some time lapsing and then
slow down certain parts of the video to
show you what I've done here but
basically I've just made a new terrain
and don't worry everything will be shown
in the video it's going to be called
survival game level design 0 1 I think
so but I have sculpted and painted a new
terrain I've added some water from the
standard assets pack I've also made a
path and I've included some of the
different objects that we imported in
the last tutorial so I've put some of
them together and change them up a bit
and I've also added some particles and
some lights and some colliders here and
there and so everything I've done here
will again be explained in a future
video so that's going to be really
really awesome but for now let's just
take a look at how it looks
so hit play and we can see it looks much
better now we have much more detail we
actually are starting to see a level
shape type deal going on here so if we
walk down to the border and this is of
course not the finished result
the the level design video is probably
going to be a whole series showing how I
am what I'm doing to expand on the level
so if we walk down to the water right
now it's it isn't looking too bad keep
in mind that this is done with the free
version of unity and so the water will
never get to look really really awesome
but we can make it look more some than
this because if we change the slider to
night time and look at the border it's
almost like it's glowing and that's not
really with something we want and if we
change it to like mid day you can see
that the water is then too dark so I
just had to go with a property in
between there so now let's actually
modify our time of day script to allow
us to change the color of the warrior so
now let's go ahead and double click on
our time of day script
and so now let's go ahead and change
this so um let me just bring my copy of
this up on the other screen so you can
see what we're doing okay so at the
button of the variable declaration here
I want to create several new variables
but first of all I just want to type out
some quick comments saying that this was
added in tutorial number 24 it allows
for changing the color that reflects of
a water object and just one more comment
saying that uncheck include water if you
are not interested in using this so
basically what we're going to do now is
we're going to create a variable that
will store our water game object we are
going to create a variable that will
allow the user to decide or rather you
guys to decide whether not you want to
actually use this feature so you can
enable and disable that and then we're
going to create two variables one that
would will define the war during night
color and one that will define the water
day so now that's good and just do that
so var border what the border the game
objects answer my colon another one
called
include water it's going to be equal to
false by default so you have to enable
this feature as we will get a null
reference if we haven't assigned
anything to the game object and so it
will just give us a bunch of errors so
the user or you guys have to decide
whether that you want to use this before
you assign stuff then we're going to
have one called water
right which is going to be a type color
and then a water day which is also going
to be a type color so now save this out
and now we should be able to go back
into unity and see some variables
appearing at the button here so we have
the warrior game object we have a
checkbox if we want to include the water
and we have then two color properties
which you can just click and set or use
the color picker here to choose anything
from the scene so let's actually go
ahead and set this up so let's drag in
the start area water here so well that's
just the water object and of course you
can make multiple of these variables and
just assign it to all of them if you had
if you have more than one void of place
or sea or whatever so time of day and
then drag in the start area water to the
water variable hit the include water and
now let's change the water now at night
to completely blank and the word day -
something like a bright blue I would say
so something like that and again you can
just go ahead and change change it to
whatever you want
that's completely up to you now let's go
down to where actually let's go down to
right under the Sun dot color equals
color Dudley and make some space and
let's type let's actually come copy
these comments down also so just so
we're completely clear that people are
understanding this and so if I include
water is equal to true
then we want to do something here oops
get a hold of the bracket keys there we
go
and what we want to happen is we want to
take our water that renderer so the one
that store is stuff like materials
shaders and so on that material we want
to access the material and we want to
set a color for it so set color and then
open up a parenthesis and this is where
we're going to access a shader property
and we have never talked about shaders
and scripting custom shaders and so on
before but basically what a shader
property is is it's a it's a variable
for the shader basically so it just like
we can have checkboxes and color stuff
going on here we can have a property in
a shader called for example color or
blend amount reflectivity amount
transparency and so on
so we are simply going to type start
parenthesis then underscore horizon--
color comma and now we want to set it so
this is what it's called for the shader
that basic water uses and we can go in
and find this inside of unity so we can
go under our assets or day-night know on
our standard assets and this is where i
have imported the water by press right
clicking hitting import package and then
water basic and if we import the water
pro we can see if this uses the same
kind of shader so if we just hit import
on that and wait for it to import
correctly should see it being done in a
sec
and so I really recommend that if this
is not working for you you go ahead and
check whether or not the property is
called the same so if we go under the
water basic it's like the day daylight
symbol water you can see that it is
using the boiler symbol shader and so
under sources and under shaders we can
see here the effects water symbol and
there's a category here called
properties and the first one is indeed
called horizon-- color and we can see
that it's a type color so if we go back
we can see that the nighttime symbol
water uses the same one and we can also
see that if we go under our Pro and hit
the daylight water it uses the effects
water so if we go under source is here
under shaders hit the effects water it
is here called D let's see horizon--
color there so that's also called
horizon-- color and we also have the
water for and so on so you can go ahead
and find it by doing this so go under
the different kinds of water here and
changing that up so here I don't know if
it's called Horus on but you can I'm
sure you can find it on your own
so let's the lead out the water pro go
back to the water basic go under i time
of day and now let's just finish this
script up so horizon-- color color color
double loop parentheses water night
comma voided day comma slider two times
two minus 0.2 and up the parentheses and
then with the semicolon
so I won't go into too much detail here
but basically this line allows the color
to loop or fade between the world and
night and avoid your day based on our
slider values so now if we go in back
into unity hit the play button you can
see we have an error so let's check that
out
would your base editor this is something
to do with the wordy probe which we in a
we input it so let's just go ahead and
delete the editor version there too so
go under the editor hit delete that now
that that's done we should be able to
play the game
indeed we are and if we walk down to the
water and maybe change the speed
variable of our time of day so go on the
off time of day and change this to
something like thirty so we can see
changing quickly you can see that the
color of the water now fits the day much
more nicely and everything blends
together it's not like it's shining and
and glowing so that's pretty much it for
this video guys so I hope you enjoyed it
and I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
