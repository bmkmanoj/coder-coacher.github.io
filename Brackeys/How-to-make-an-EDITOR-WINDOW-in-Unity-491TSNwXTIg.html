features in unity is being able to
extend the editor something that people
often forget about especially beginners
but being able to create your own tools
to make game development easier it can
just save you so much time this video
will be an introduction to creating
editor scripts and unity we create our
editor window and talk about how you can
use it also huge thanks to Commander
Firestone 38 for support over on patreon
if you want to support the videos
yourself you can do so at patreon.com
slash brackets so let's get started to
create an editor window we need to start
in the same way when adding scripts to
our game let's go to the project panel
and hit create and it's like c-sharp
script let's call this script example
window let's hit enter and let's double
click it to open it up in visual studio
now first we want to delete the two
using tags at the top here we won't be
needing those and we can also go ahead
and delete our two methods
now normally when we code in unity
everything that we need to use is inside
of the unity engine namespace but when
programming for the editor we have a
separate namespace let's write using
unity editor and of course we don't want
to put the script on a game object
instead we want unity to recognize it as
an editor script to do that instead of
writing monobehaviour we write editor
window so now we should have all the
functionality needed available to us
what we then do is create a function
we'll write void and this function is
called on GUI we don't need any
arguments here and let's just open and
close our curly brackets so those of you
who've been using unity before the new
GUI system in 4.3 you might recognize
this function that's because the on GUI
method was used to draw UI in the game
as well but now we pretty much only use
it in the editor this is where we'll put
all of our window code so if we want to
add buttons to our window editable
fields labels and even some
functionality we'll put it in here
so this is our window code but first of
course we need to display the window to
do that we create a separate function
now this needs to be a public static
void and let's call it show window again
it won't take in any arguments and in
here we want one of two things to happen
if the window isn't already shown on the
screen we want to create one and if it
is we just want to focus on it but we
don't actually need to check for this
sort of stuff ourselves if we write
editor window dot get window this
we'll actually open up a window for us
and make sure not to create another one
if one is already open all we need to do
is specify the type of the window and
that's going to be our class name so in
our case the type of window is going to
be example window we can even go in here
and give it a title if you don't specify
title it's just going to use the class
name which is fine but I just want to go
ahead and shorten this to example note
how it kind of Gray's out the first part
here that's because since we are
deriving from editor window this
function is available to us without
needing to call the specific class and
so we can actually just get rid of that
so as you can see opening up a window is
really easy but we're not currently
calling this show window method anywhere
so right now it's never going to get
opened we could call this from another
script what we could make a menu item
that would call this method and
therefore show the window to do that we
use a simple attribute attributes are
used by using square brackets we then
write menu item let's open and close the
parentheses and here we simply write the
item name we want ours to be under the
window tab and we want it to be called
example so now when we save this head
into unity wait for it to load then go
under window we can now see our example
when we press this a new window called
example opens up and we can go ahead and
dug this anywhere in our editor but
currently the window is totally blank
let's go ahead and add some stuff to it
remember this is done inside of the on
GUI method first of all we can add a
label by going GUI layout GUI layout is
a class that has functioned for all
sorts of stuff like drawing buttons
labels spaces etc the cool thing is that
it will automatically layout everything
for us so if we now create a label we
want the label to say something like
this is a label and we can even give it
a style so we can go in here and specify
editor style dot let's just choose bold
label now when we save this go into
unity and wait for it to reload we can
see that it says this is a label in a
bold fund of course this is very static
we can also add a text field here to do
that we first want to create a variable
that is going to store our text let's
create a string I'm just going to call
it my string and set it equal to hello
world then in our on GUI method we write
GUI layout dot text fields we then give
the text field a label so that the user
knows what to input here in our case we
could put in something like name and we
then feed the variable that we want the
text field to display in our case that's
going to be my string and then finally
of course we'll set my string equal to
the result of this text field that we're
both displaying the string and updating
it now you might notice that in one
place here I'm using GUI layout and in
another one I'm using editor GUI layout
but the distinction between the two is
actually really vague some functions
only in one class and only in the other
and sometimes the same function will be
in both but they will look different as
a rule of thumb though we use editor GUI
layout whenever we want to edit fields
and properties and we use GUI layout
whenever we want to create labels spaces
between properties and buttons but you
really just have to get a feel of the
two if you see the same function in both
start by trying out the editor GUI
layout after all it's made for this
particular purpose now when we save this
heading to unity we can see that we have
a field here called name that is
currently set to hello world I'm going
to set this to Dwayne Johnson just
because you know he's cool so now we can
add labels and fields let's add a button
to do that we write if GUI layout dot
button and then we write the text for
that but I'm just going to write press
me we then open and close some curly
brackets and everything in here will be
called if our button is pressed let's
just throw a debug dialog statement here
saying button was pressed let's say that
going to unity we now see a button does
appear called press me and when we press
it button was pressed awesome but this
is just showing off the technology let's
try and apply this to a simple topic
here I have three primitives I have a
cube a sphere and a capsule and each one
of these objects also have a material
which is currently just a simple
standard shader but they're all white
say I had a ton of these objects and I
wanted to be able to simply select them
and then call you all of the selected
objects to a nother color well we could
go and edit a million materials and try
and find all the matching ones or we
could
and editor extension so my example
window let's go ahead and rename our
example to color riser let's do the same
thing for a menu item color riser
let's delete our string and the text
field for our string as well we can
change the label to color these selected
objects then exclamation mark we
annotate the button to colorize and
start throwing out a debug deadlock what
we want to go through and colorize stuff
let's just delete that for now of course
we want to be able to specify a color
let's go to the top here and create a
color and let's just call it color
notice how this is the exact same
process as when we were creating a
editable string you know on GUI method
after our label we can now go and call
editor GUI layout dot color field again
we want to give this a name we'll call
it color and want to give it a color to
show which is going to be our color
variable and of course we also want to
set our color variable equal to the
result of this color field let's just
save to see if these changes are applied
you can see how the title of our window
didn't change immediately so let's just
collapse that go window and now we have
the color riser and you can see that
it's changed here as well and we have
this color field here that we can edit
in any way that we want but of course if
we select a few objects here and hit
colorize nothing currently happens so
when we press the button we want to loop
through all of the currently selected
objects to do that we use selection
under the selection name space we have
stuff like the active game object
whether or not the selection changed and
most importantly we have a variable
called game objects this is simply an
array of game objects with all of the
currently selected objects as it says
here this also includes prefabs
non-modifiable objects and so this
includes pretty much everything for now
we won't worry too much about that so
now that we have a way to get all of the
currently selected game objects we can
loop through it let's create a for each
loop and for each game object and we'll
call the game object we're currently
looking at obj in our selection that
game object array well then we want to
go ahead and set obj dot and to access
the color here we first need to get the
renderer
opponent so we go get component of type
renderer and if we just go ahead and
access the material here directly we
might get a case where we have objects
so they did that don't have a renderer
and so that would display an error let's
instead store this in the temporary
variable the variable is going to be of
type renderer and it's just call it
renderer with a non capital R then we
can check if renderer is not equal to
null so if we actually found a renderer
on the object well then we can set
renderer
shared material color equal to our color
variable and that should actually be it
so now for each object in our selected
game objects you get the renderer and if
it's not null well then we go ahead and
change the color and of course all of
this happens when we hit the colorize
button to make this just a tiny bit
cleaner let's go ahead and cut our code
and wrap this in a separate function
called colorize and let's create that
right here void colorize no arguments
and then simply paste all that code in
there editor scripts can get really long
and weird so it's a good idea to
separate it out in multiple functions
let's now save this going to unity try
selecting say the cube and the sphere
here and hitting colorize and there we
go we can change to any college here and
do any kind of selection and really
easily we can colorize our game objects
let's pretty much it for this video I
