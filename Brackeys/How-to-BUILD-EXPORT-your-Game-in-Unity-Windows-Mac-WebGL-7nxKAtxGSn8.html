exporting your game from unity to a
platform of your choosing we go over how
you can build for Windows Mac and WebGL
this might not be the most interesting
of videos but it's something that every
developer has to do at some point at
least I hope so let's get started let's
start by opening our build settings menu
we'll go file build settings make sure
to add all the scenes you want in your
build and you can see here that we have
a long list of platforms the default one
is the PC Mac and Linux standalone you
can easily switch to other platforms by
simply selecting them and hitting this
switch platform button however lately
unity has made the different platforms
into optional modules that you can
install with unity so in my case I've
installed PC Mac and Linux panel on
Android and WebGL however I did not
include any of the others luckily we can
simply select one of the modules it's
going to say that the module isn't
loaded we just hit open download page
and unity will automatically start
downloading that module simply run
through the installer restart unity and
you should see there but no matter what
platform you want to build for there are
a few things that we need to set up the
first one is to go to edit project
settings and then quality in here we are
able to set the different rendering
settings and the cool thing about this
is that we can separate it into
different levels and we can have each
platform default to a certain quality
level so right now we are viewing our
game ad fantastic that means a pixel I
count of 4 full rest texture quality and
so on and so on but if I switch to the
other levels we can see these settings
change we can add new levels or delete
some I think we should go ahead and
delete some of these levels I'm going to
delete the fastest this symbol and the
beautiful I think three is plenty for
our game for fantastic I'm going to set
the pixel light count to 10 keep the
texture settings I'm going to bump up
the anti-aliasing to 8 and I'm going to
leave all other settings as is then for
good I'm going to set the pixel light
count to 4 anti-aliasing to 2 and keep
all the other settings and for fast we
can have the pixel light can't be too
and I probably also want to have hot
shadows only cool so this way we have
three different quality levels I'm going
to set the standalone to fantastic
Android we can just go ahead and set
that to fast and WebGL to good but
you'll of course have to experiment with
these settings depending on the
complexity of your game next up we need
to change the player settings to do that
we go edit project settings and then
player and in here we have the different
build settings first off we have the
company
I'm going to write brekkie we have the
product name let's write cubes on and
then we can choose a default icon and
you can even change the cursor if you
want to I'm going to leave the cursor as
is but I do definitely want a build icon
now of course you are going to have to
create this somehow I recommend using
Photoshop or GIMP in my case I'm just
going to take a screenshot of our game
and then load that into Photoshop and
edit it a bit this way we can pretty
easily create a cool looking icon for
the game but you should really go nuts
and just have fun with it creating icons
can be challenging but it's also a
really good thing to learn alright so
when you're done with your logo to save
it as a PNG to make sure that you get
the transparency you need or if you made
it in Photoshop you can just save it as
a Photoshop file so I'm just going to
take this image here and save it
directly into my project so I go to how
to make a video game and save it under
assets and I'm just going to call this
one cubes on and then icon save that a
non-unity we should see it appearing
make sure to select the icon and change
the texture type to sprite to D nui and
under compression we'll select none
let's say that and that should give us
some transparency and make sure our
image isn't compressed now we can go
again edit project settings player and
drag in our icon so from here now it's
going to depend on what platform you
want to export to so on the screen now
you will have some time stamps that you
can jump to if you want to skip ahead to
a specific platform so if you want to
build a standalone file meaning PC Mac
or Linux we need to change the player
settings on this tab first we'll go
resolution and presentation here in
change will end up we prefer to have the
window in full screen or windowed mode I
think because we're making a casual game
we would like it to open up in windowed
and the default width and height is fine
here you can also choose whether or not
you would like to display the resolution
dialog this is a small window that pops
up before your game which enables the
player to choose a quality level and a
preferred resolution again since this is
a mini game I think we should just
disable this we can also easily make the
window resizable and we can pretty much
go ahead and support all aspects then
under your icon we can just leave
everything as is nudey is going to go
ahead and build different sizes of our
icon for us under the splash image we
can configure stuff like the banner
image shown in the dialog box we of
course don't have that enabled so we
don't care about that and the splash
screen that is going to show when you
start up the game of course if you are
not using
you pro your options here are going to
be limited but it's very cool that you
can easily add different logos through
the splash screen customize the
animation and the colors you can always
go ahead and hit preview and it's going
to show you what it will look like in
our case I'm just going to change the
background image to a white and change
the splash style to dark on light this
way it fits better with the rest of our
game finally we have other settings
these can be important for larger games
but for now you are definitely not going
to need to change anything here finally
we need to go to file build settings and
this is where we choose our target
platform so again here it's going to
depend on whether or not you want to
install for Windows or Mac and again I
have some timestamps on the screen so if
you're building for Windows you of
course want to select Windows as the
target platform as the architrave to
choose between 32 and 64-bit almost any
modern system will do fine running
64-bit however our game probably won't
benefit too much from the difference
here so I'm just going to go on the safe
side and choose 86 which is equal to
32-bit we don't want to copy any files
and we don't want this to be a
development build now we can just go
ahead and hit build we can go and make a
new folder under the how to make a video
game project and let's call this one
builds inside of this we can create
another folder called windows and just
to stay totally organized we'll create
yet another subfolder called x86 and in
here we can then write the name of our
game so that means cubed on and then x86
and you can also write a version number
for your game but I'm just going to go
ahead and hit save so now unity will
build all of the necessary files and
open up the folder so you can see here
that we now have an excel file with a
nice icon and a data folder containing
all the stuff necessary to run our game
if you run the exe it's going to open up
a new window with our game and the game
is already totally playable however
these files here aren't too easy to
distribute you can of course go ahead
and zip them up by right-clicking on
them both getting sent to and then
compressed zip folder and now you can
send this single file to your friends
ask them to unzip it and then play the
game but that's not to use of friendly
what most games do is create an
installer that means just a single file
that you open up and then you've gone
through the installed process this way
the user can choose where he wants the
program to be installed you can have
desktop shortcuts and an easy way to
uninstall the game you really won't do
that for us we need some third-party
software that will turn these files into
a setup file what
like to use it's a program called a no
setup so if you go to the description
that will be a link to this page if we
then go down here and choose a download
site I'm going to go in a set up five
point five point nine exe choose random
site and it's going to start downloading
it's a very small program you can then
run through the Installer and once
you're done you can go ahead and open up
you know set up compiler so in a setup
allows you to customize so many things
when it comes to creating the Installer
in fact it even allows you to edit the
script file that makes it but if you
don't have experience creating these
sort of files from scratch let's face it
not a lot of people do we can go and
create a new script file using the
script wizard
that's it okay let's select next and
here we can fill out all of the
information publication name cubes on
application version 1.0 the publisher
break is and I'm just going to link to
my YouTube channel here like next we'll
just have the destination base folder be
the programs files folder and this is
fine for the folder name let's like next
and this is where we need to tell the
Installer what files it needs to install
on the system so we'll go ahead and
select browse and now we need to find
our project car builds folder and then
our exe file so I'm just going to go to
desktop projects go to the how to make a
video game unity project go build
windows x86 and select cubes on x86 dot
exe
hit open so now we've linked it to the
main executable file but we also need to
include all of the data and this is
where it becomes a little bit weird we
can make Ino setup also install off the
data within this folder but when it does
that it doesn't include the folder
itself only all of its contents that
means that when we install it we're
going to have our cubes on x86 exe and
then at the same level all these files
but we need this to be in a separate
folder or else the exe cannot find the
data it needs to make sure this is what
happens we need to wrap this inside of
yet another folder so we'll go ahead and
copy the name of this folder and create
a new custom folder let's just name this
one data would then take the cubes on
x86 data folder and move it to the newly
created data folder and now we can take
our data folder and paste the name back
in this means that inside of our data
folder is another data folder that
contains everything we need you can see
the hierarchy up here it's a bit weird
that we need to do this but as long as
you know this trick it works every time
so now we can go back to a know set up
hit add folder we can again locate
project and once you get to the windows
x86 folder you need to select the
topmost cubes on data folder not the
bottom one or it's not going to work but
the folder we just made it's now hit OK
and it needs to include all the
subfolders we'll then hit next and you
can choose the default settings you want
here I'm going to hit next you can even
input a license file and show some
information here and there
I'm just going to it next English is
fine as the language so that's the
custom compiler output folder we'll go
ahead and hit browse again let's find a
project going to build and then under
windows let's go ahead and make a new
folder and let's call this one installer
that's it okay as the name of our output
file we'll set cubes on setup and then
x86 and parentheses you can even include
a custom setup icon file or a password
but I'm just going to use the default
one I don't need that level of security
let's then hit next finish an inner
setup will now go ahead and create a
script with all of the settings that we
just set and you can go in here and
change anything that you'd like the
scripting language is fairly easy to
understand or you could just go ahead
and compile the new script right away
let's do that by hitting yes you can
also choose to save the script before
compiling this is a good idea if you
want to go back and change something at
a later point so we'll just hit yes and
again we'll go under builds this time
we'll go into Windows and installer and
we'll choose at the file name here cubes
on setup script let's hit save it's
going to go ahead and compile my file
you can see here it says finished now we
can open up our builds windows installer
folder and in here we now have the cubes
on setup x86 exe and this file is now
all we need to distribute the script
files you can just be totally ignored we
can go ahead and delete it if we are
satisfied with the results let's close
down you know setup and unity and if you
now go ahead and run our setup file
we'll hit yes we can go through the
Installer to our own program I'm just
going to install it in the default
location we're going to create a desktop
icon hit install then you can see that
we get the option to launch cube Sun and
a shortcut down here to the game so if
we double click that it is now going to
boot up our game and you can also
uninstall the game as with any other
program on your system so if you want to
build for Mac you should of course
change the target platform to Mac OS X
and when it comes to distributing on the
Mac there are two main possibilities the
first one is using the Mac App Store and
this can be quite a complicated process
you also need to change around a few of
the build settings and that's
lot of work to be done after you export
it from unity you can also take your
build and turn it into a dmg that you
can then distribute through your website
Dropbox or any other file sharing
solution I will have a link to a guide
for both in the description let's have a
look at actually building the game into
an app to do that we first select the
architecture x86 means 32-bit and under
square 64 means 64-bit Universal means
that it will run on both but this will
also be twice as big any new computer
will have no problem supporting 64-bit
but since I came into this small we
might as well choose 32 we don't want
this to be a development build so let's
just go ahead and hit build and as you
can see I've gone ahead and created a
folder inside of our project called
builds double click on that and in here
we can create a new folder and we'll
call this one Mac and inside that will
create another subfolder called
x86 let's just go inside of the x86
folder and hit select this is going to
build everything for us and it's going
to open it like this and it's a bit
weird that unity opens it this way we'll
just take the app folder here and move
it inside of the x86 and now we can
rename this to anything we'd like I'm
going to rename this to cubes on and
then x86 now on Windows this is going to
display as an ordinary folder so we can
simply open it and see all the contents
but on Mac this should display as an app
that you can then just open up if you
want an easy way of sending this from
one system to another you can right
click go send to and then compress zip
folder this will turn it into a sip file
and then remove the dot app in the name
here and we now have a sip folder
containing our app and if you are
putting this on a Mac again you can
either upload it to the maggot store or
turning it into a dmg I check the links
in the description so if you want to
build for WebGL select the web shield
platform and again if you haven't
included this when installing unity make
sure to click the open download page and
download that module there not a lot of
settings for this however we do need to
have a look at the player settings
let's click player settings and let's go
to the last tab here which is for WebGL
let's have a look under resolution and
presentation in here you can choose the
default screen width and height which
can very easily be modified later in the
HTML I'm just going to leave it as is
you can also choose a template the
default one includes a unity logo a way
to maximize the screen and maybe also
the title of your game and stuff and
some other pretty handy things I think
for most people it's a good idea to just
choose the default one and then modify
it but you
of course also go with the totally
minimal one so I'm going to select
default WebGL doesn't include an icon so
that doesn't matter
on the splash image we can customize the
intro screen and see what it looks like
right now if I hit preview I've chosen a
background color that's very white as
the splash style I've chosen dark on
light you can also play with the
animation add custom logos and of course
some of these features are pro only but
still things you can customize it a bit
in the free version let's then go other
settings you can pretty much leave all
these settings as is and the same with
the publishing settings
some people prefer bumping up the WebGL
memory size but with the game this big I
think 256 is going to be just fine
so now we can just go ahead and hit
build and as you can see I've created a
build folder inside of our how to make a
videogame project let's go on to that
let's create another folder called WebGL
and under this one let's create a folder
called
cube thought it's like that select
folder and unity will now start building
exporting for WebGL does take quite a
bit of time and it might look like it's
getting stuck especially at the last
part here but it will get there so when
it's done it's going to open up the
WebGL folder and you can see our cube
done folder here with the different
elements that make up our game first off
we have the index.html this is what you
run in order to display the game in your
browser we also have some template data
this is basically just some images a bit
of styling and a JavaScript file that is
referenced by our HTML file in order to
display our game nicely on the release
we have the files that actually make up
our game I've never actually come across
an instance where needed to mess with
these only template data and index dot
HTML so if we open up index dot HTML we
get this error it says that the browser
does not support running this WebGL
content locally that we need to set it
up on a server and then connect to it
we're going to click OK a couple of
times and you can see the template but
the game isn't working of course you can
solve this problem if you have a web
server or you can create one yourself
but most of the time you probably want
some way of running your game locally so
what we can do instead is use Firefox if
you don't have Firefox already go ahead
and download it and then right-click and
say open with Firefox as of this video
Firefox supports running these games
locally and you can see working just
fine it might take a little while before
boots though so now we can actually play
our game inside of the browser but how
can we distribute our game well here we
have a few different options the first
one is hosting your game yourself if
you've bought some server space you can
use a
our management solution like FileZilla
in order to upload your file to that
server but most people probably just
want to host it on some kind of
marketplace the most common ones for
indie games are probably congregate and
each dot IO I'll have links in the
description on how to add unity games to
both of them one thing that you
sometimes have to do is to compress this
folder we do that by selecting the
folder right clicking going sent to and
then compressed zipped folder on the Mac
you simply right click and hit compress
we can also go in directly and edit the
HTML so if we right-click on this index
file we can open with some kind of text
editing software that could be node plus
plus visual studio but I like to use
sublime text now we can edit the HTML
that makes up this template we can add
custom styling change the height and
width we can add custom elements or
delete elements for example if we wanted
to have a very minimalistic template we
could go ahead and delete both the title
the fullscreen button and the logo so
now when we save this and run it again
we can see that all this stuff is gone
so that's pretty much it for this video
