using rendered textures let's get right
into it so as you can see I have this
very simple scene with a player that we
can move around but of course it's very
much in need of a mini-map but in order
to create a mini-map we need a second
camera that can render our scene from a
top-down view to do that let's deselect
everything right-click in our hierarchy
and select camera let's then reset the
transform on our camera and make sure
that this sits at the same position as
our player to do that we can select our
player right click on his transform hit
copy component we then select our camera
right click and hit paste component
values but we want to move our camera up
so let's drag up on a y2 something like
20 let's also flip the camera so it's
facing downwards we do this by rotating
by 90 degrees on the X and first off we
want to make sure that we have all the
same settings as our previous camera
because in most cases you probably want
to render the seam in pretty much the
same way to do that let's select our
previous camera hit right click copy
component it's like our new camera and
paste those back in in my case this just
changed the background to a solid color
then we can change the projection from
perspective to orthographic this pretty
much just removes all perspective from
our scene this is something that almost
all minimaps do it's great because it
gives the impression that the scene is
laid out flat we then use these sides to
zoom out on our mini-map and you can
choose the size of your zoom here you
can have it show the entire level at
once or have it only show a small part
of your level but then follow around the
player I'm just gonna set mine to 15 we
can also delete our audio listener our
GUI layer and off layer layer we only
want to be using the camera but
currently our mini-map is overlaid on
top of the entire screen and that's not
really the effect we're going for we
want our mini-map to be shown as part of
our UI
let's now rename this object call it
mini-map camera let's go into the scene
view and let's create another object
this time we are going to go under UI
and we're going to select raw image we
then switch into 2d mode and hit F to
focus on a raw image now a raw image is
basically like any other UI image
component except it takes in a texture
instead of a sprite this is good because
basically going to tell our mini-map
camera to take everything it renders and
put it into a texture this is called a
render texture we can then take that
texture and display it on a raw image
let's select our 2d controls up here
let's zoom out a bit and now we can
position our mini map where we want it
I'm gonna anchor mine to the top right
here I'm gonna set the offset on the X
to negative 75 and the same thing on the
Y I'm gonna set the width and height to
something like 170 by 170 and then gonna
offset it on the X&amp;amp;Y by about 110 so now
in our game view we should see a white
square in the top right corner of where
our mini-map is going to be but of
course we still need to display our
texture to do that we create a new
render texture let's go to the project
right click go create and now select
render texture and let's call this our
mini-map render texture here we have a
bunch of texture settings we're gonna
leave pretty much all of them as is our
link to where you can read about these
in the description first off we can set
the size to the same as our raw image
let's set it to 170 by 170 and we can
also disable our depth buffer if we now
select our mini-map camera we can see
here that there is a target texture
variable and this takes in a render
texture let's simply drag our mini-map
Brenda texture into this slot and you
can see now that our game view switches
back to our main camera so a mini-map
camera is no longer rendering on screen
instead all of its data is being fed
into this mini map render texture and if
we click on it we can actually see the
preview here so now all we need to do is
select our raw image and drag in our
mini map render texture as the texture
input and voila our camera is now
rendering directly onto the screen as a
hue il iment now we can rename this to
our mini-map and if we now hit play and
start moving around the scene you can
see our player moving around of course
our mini-map isn't following our player
yet but we can add this very easily also
remember that you can style this
mini-map in any way you'd like it works
just like any other UI element you can
add a mask in case you want say a
circular mini-map you can easily add a
border I'm just gonna right click go UI
and add another image I'm gonna scale
this up to be about 178 by 178
then gonna place this behind the
mini-map I'm gonna call this the
mini-map border
we then parent the mini-map to the
mini-map border make sure to anchor the
mini-map border to the upper right and
let's have our mini-map snap to the
center of our mini-map border so now
we've created a border for our mini-map
let's now have it follow our player of
course the easiest way is to go ahead
and just parent this to the player and
as you can see this works just fine as
long as it plays only rotating on the
y-axis but this is not always the case
so better more stable way is by creating
a small script let's call this our
mini-map script let's say create an ad
and open it up in Visual Studio now
first off we want a reference to our
player will create a public transform
player and then instead of the two
default methods we'll create a void and
now this is going to be a late update
method we want to do this in late update
because it's called after update and
fixed update and so we'll only update
the position of our mini-map after a
player has moved in here we can create a
new vector3 this is going to be the new
position of our mini-map and we can set
this equal to our players position of
course we still want to be zoomed out on
the Y so we can set new position dot Y
to our current Y position we can then
say transformed up position equals new
position if we save this go into unity
make sure to reference our player and
hit play we can now see the mini-map
actually follows around the player it
doesn't rotate with the player but
that's a very common thing for many mini
maps if you wanted to also rotate with
the player we simply go into our code
add a few lines and we can now set
transform dart rotation equal to
quaternion Euler and here we feed it 90
degrees on the X a player's rotation on
the Y and here we want to make sure to
use Euler angles dot Y and then zero on
the Z let say this going to unity hit
play and voila our camera is now also
rotating with the player less of course
a lot of fun stuff that you can do with
your mini-map from here and out you can
add icons you can add the ability to
zoom in and out by simply adjusting the
projection size of your camera and you
can add lots of styling options and mass
