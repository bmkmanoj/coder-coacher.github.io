been missing for a long time that is of
course a way to complete a level we'll
have a look at triggers UI loading the
next level in the queue and the most fun
part animation let's go let's begin by
creating a trigger that will place at
the end of our level let's go to the
hierarchy right click go through the
object and then cube it's also switch to
3d mode here reset the transform on the
cube hit F to focus on it let's set the
X scale to 15 the same as our platform
let's let the Y to something like 5 and
the Z to something like 5 is walk will
also drag it up a bit let's set the Y
position to 3 this way it stands on our
platform let's switch to top mode by
clicking the y-axis and switch to
isometric by clicking the centre we can
now zoom out and drag him to the end of
our level let's also rename this to
something like end and point and trigger
anything you like and you will notice
right now that if we switch back to
perspective view we can of course see
the trigger and we don't want this to be
noticeable in-game let's just go ahead
and disable the mesh renderer you can of
course remove it completely I just like
having it here for easy positioning well
of course keep the box Collider but
remember to check is trigger and if we
go ahead and put a script on this it
should actually trigger it but in the
editor can be kind of annoying if you
can't see your object let's just select
our object go up here and select the box
and we can actually choose an icon I'm
going to select the green label here and
now even though our object is invisible
we always have this green label to show
where I endpoint is now we're going to
close click it to select it pretty cool
let's now create a script that will
communicate with our game manager to let
it know that we've reached the end of
our level to do that we go add component
and we call it something like and
trigger let's say create an ad and
double click it let's to lead our using
tags and our two methods not just like
we can detect the collision by using
void on collision enter we can detect if
something has hit our trigger by using
void on trigger enter note that on
collision entry will not work if your
collider is marked as trigger you need
to write ontriggerenter instead then
open access in parenthesis and some
curly brackets now whenever we hit our
trigger we need to tell our game manager
to display some UI in the screen to do
that we first need a reference to a game
manager of course we could use find
object of type as shown in the last
video but I think here it makes sense to
just reference it directly let's create
a new public game manager and call it
game manager with the non-capital
we can then go down here and ride
game-manager dot and now we have the
ability to call a function on the game
manager of course we haven't really
created a function that we want to call
you now let's go back into unity and
open up our game manager script here we
have code for ending the game if we hit
something and then restarting it but we
also need a function to call if we
actually succeed let's go in here and
create another public Lord again
remember the order doesn't matter it
could be up here down here and even
below the restart method as long as it's
not within another method so let's write
public void and it's call this one
complete level if now I'm just going to
go ahead and throw a debug that large
statement saying something like level 1
let's save that go back into in trigger
script and now we should be able to
access that function game manager dot
and then complete level of course we
also need to actually make this
reference let's find our end object and
drag our game manager under the empty
slot now if we hit play and actually
managed to reach the end of our level
you can see that it displays in the
console level 1 this will also display
if any other object collides with our
trigger so make sure it doesn't touch
anything but our player if you have
problems with other objects touching the
trigger you can use pretty much the same
technique as we did with our plan
collision to check what object has
collided and only act if it was tagged
as player so currently displaying a
message in the console it's a bit boring
let's instead show some UI to let the
user know that he did it that's going to
the canvas right-click and create a new
UI panel let's also switch to 2d mode
and hit F to focus on it as you can see
a panel is basically just an image that
currently fits the entire screen and it
will always resize to fit it instead of
using the default background force image
I'm actually going to go in here and
change it to none this just means that
our image will be a blank color I'm
going to make it completely white and
remove the transparency by bumping up
the Alpha I'm going to rename it to
something like level complete and I'm
going to right click on the object go UI
and add some text I'm going to scale up
the boundaries of our text centered on
both the X and Y and change the fonts or
something Roboto
let's choose Roboto thin let's bump up
the font size to something like 100 and
let's change the text to level I'm also
going to change the name of the object
to level and then duplicate it and this
one is going to be named
complete let's also change the text to
complete I'm doing
in capital to increase the dramatic
effect let's change the font here to
Roboto bold drag it down and I'm holding
down shift only drag it on one axis
let's bump down the font size to
something like 53 and I'm just going to
put them a bit closer together like both
of the objects and drag them up a bit as
well very simplistic but I think it
looks pretty good and this will of
course also scale without screen also I
want to take this text object the
display soft score and just rename it to
score it's good to stay organized
finally let's take our level complete
and disable it this way we don't start
with level complete on the screen let's
now take our game manager and add a bit
of code first off we need a reference to
our UI so that we can enable it when we
complete the level to do that we create
a public game object and we call it
something like complete level UI then
under our complete level function we
write complete level UI dot and then set
active and in here we can write false if
you want to disable it or true if you
want to enable it and of course we want
to enable it so we write true let's say
that go into unity reference our UI
notice that I can create a reference
even though the object is disabled let's
try and hit play and we should now see
that once we reach our trigger the UI
will display it's not currently animated
in any way so it looks a bit boring but
at least it works let's go ahead and
create an animation to do that we find
our level complete and re-enable it so
we can see what we're doing you also
need the animation window so let's go
window animation make sure you choose
animation and not animate door that's
the difference there the animation
window as you can see here has a
timeline and allows you to animate
different properties on any object in
unity the animator is responsible for
playing animations and transitioning
from one animation to another because we
only need a single animation here we
don't need to focus on the animator but
on the animation let's go to the
animation window here let's say create
let's create a separate folder because
animations click this bag up let's call
this folder animation and under this
let's create a new animation called
level complete notice if we go to the
project panel that is now a animation
folder and inside our queue assets the
first one is the animation itself we
need to disable looping because we only
want the animation to happen once the
second one is the animation controller
and this is what we edit in the animator
notice how I can drag this animation
into the animator and how we can make
transitions from one
into another now this is of course the
same animation so it's not going to do
much but imagine we can have a whole
network of animations in here to create
very complex behaviors I'm just going to
undo those now you can see that it's
automatically added the level complete
animation I made it orange this means
that it will play at the first animation
that means as soon as our level complete
gets enabled so we don't have to trigger
it anywhere it's just going to play by
itself let's go to the scene you so we
can see what we're doing and let's go
back to the animation window as well
notice how the play buttons are red
that's because we are in record mode and
now any changes we make to the object
are going to be recorded as keyframes
for example if we go forward about a
second go into the color of the image
and pump down the alpha we can now see
that a keyframe is created at the 1
second mark and at the 0 second mark in
the beginning the alpha is normal and
it's then going to start fading out and
this is only happening on the background
of course you need to reverse this so
we'll check our two keyframes and change
their position we can also make it a bit
quicker there we go so now our
background fades in and we probably need
to do something similar to our two text
objects so let's select our level that
maybe go a bit forward and change the
Alpha to zero let's do the same thing
with our complete now again we have to
flip these keyframes let's take the
bottom two keyframes here which is the
Alpha of our complete and level text
move that forward and move these ones
back let's have them start fading in a
bit later than the background so now if
we play this back you can see that it
fades to white and then the text fades
then I think that looks pretty cool
so now that we're satisfied with that we
can go out of record mode and we can
once again disable our level complete
object and that's it if we now play the
game this animation should automatically
play awesome now we can do a lot more
with the Unity animation system the last
thing that I'm going to show you here is
that if we zoom out and go forward a bit
we can actually have things happen
through script at a certain point in our
animation in our case we want to load
the next level after a few seconds let's
go forward towards the two second mark
I'm just going to put it here and add an
event now this animation event allows us
to select a function you can see how
many things are here by default what we
want to do is create a small script that
sits on the double complete object in
order for the event to work it has to
sit on the same object that we are
animating and the script will just load
a new level so let's go here and add a
new component this one will call
something like level complete we can
double click it to open it up
in Visual Studio we can clean up as
usual and now we can create a public
void called something like load next
level notice how even though we don't
have any more code than this we can now
save this and when we go back into unity
and select our animation event draw a
new function and go down a bit at the
very bottom we see load next level so
now whenever we reach this point in our
animation it's going to automatically
call load next level in our script and
now in here we can change the scene for
us to do that we need to write using
Unity engine dot scene management then
down here we write scene manager dot
load scene and then the name of the
scene that we want to load but of course
the scene that we want to load is going
to depend on what level we are currently
on we just want to load the next one in
the queue so what we do is instead of
using the name we use the build index
remember if we go into unity go file and
then build settings you can see all of
the different scenes that we want to
include when we export the game
currently we only have one here and
that's level 1 each scene in this list
has a build index that's the number to
the right so what we can do is simply
ask unity to load the scene with the
build index that is equal to our
currently loaded scene plus 1 so in case
we are on level 1 which has an index of
0 we want to load 0 plus 1 which is 1
which is going to equal level 2 so to do
that in Visual Studio we simply write
scene manager dot get active scene to
get the scene that we're currently on
and then dot build index to get the
build index of the scene where county on
and then we write plus 1 and we close it
up and that's actually all we need to do
so we can now save this and of course in
unity we need to now make sure that
there's always another level waiting if
we just run out of themes it is going to
create an error so just make sure to
create a scene congratulating the player
when you speed all the levels I think
we'll have a look at doing that in the
next video for now we can just go ahead
and duplicate our current level so let's
save our current scene by hitting ctrl s
command s if you're on the Mac it's then
select level 1 press control D to
duplicate let's double click on level 2
and we can now see that level 2 is open
up here and what we can do to make this
look a bit different is just delete all
of the obstacles except the first one
and we can maybe just move this over so
if we save this level to looks like this
another one looks like this if we then
drag level 2 under level one we can see
that to build indexes and if we now run
level 1 we should see that when
reach the end of our level it's going to
display the UI and then load the next
scene and of course if we reach the end
of that scene it's going to throw an
error because there are no more scenes
added to the build settings but we'll
fix that don't worry that was pretty
much all I had to show for this video
we're nearing the end of the series I
still want to dedicate at least one more
video to wrap things up and then we can
have a look at exporting everything to
the platform that you want the series
has been really fun to make so far but I
don't want to have too many videos in
one series instead I want to make more
videos to spend that on subjects that
can apply to many games that of course
also means that it will make lots of
more videos that are relevant to this
series so don't worry lots more to come
of course make sure to subscribe if you
aren't already all right thanks guys
I'll see you in the next video thanks to
of the awesome people who donated in
February and a special thanks to Derek
huge Kirk faithful Merrifield James
Calhoun and Jason Latino if you want to
become a picture in yourself you can do
so at pitching become slash brekkie
thanks a lot guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
