the awesome patron alright maybe the
answer is a bit more complicated than
that let's try and break it down also
thanks to hands off tuned for his
support on patron now let's get into the
free version of unity unity personal
includes all engine features this means
that you have access to all
functionality within the editor in
previous versions of unity a lot of
features like real-time shadows render
textures and the profiler were not part
of the free version in fact you have to
purchase separate licenses in order to
publish for mobile but as of mid 2016
all engine features and platforms are
freely available so why would you need
to pay for a subscription
well unity now offers to paid price
tiers plus and pro unity plus gives you
the ability to customize the splash
screen this means that you can put your
own logo instead of the unity logo at
the start of your game you also get
access to performance reporting which
automatically collects errors across all
platforms and devices which means that
you can quickly find an address issues
this is cool because it can be used to
solve bugs after release and then of
course there's unity teens unity teams
is a set of features that makes it
easier for multiple people to work
together on a project both collaborate
and cloud build are part of unity teams
that means that you sync your project to
the cloud and other team members can
make changes and publish them from
within the editor when a change is made
unity will then automatically create
builds for the desired platforms and
send them to all team members this can
be a huge time saver because you no
longer have to worry about version
control and it pretty much eliminates
time spent waiting on builds as of
making this video unity teams is free
for everyone but that unfortunately ends
this October from there on out unity
teams can be bought as part of unity
plus or as a separate subscription but
splash screens and collaboration aside
we all know the real reason for buying
unity the dark editor skin no and when
it comes to unity Pro you get all the
same features as with plus but with some
added extras most of it however is
fairly minor to regular indie developers
if you're making a multiplayer game
unity Pro will allow you to have more
concurrent users but really the main
reason for picking up unity Pro is that
it has no limit on annual revenue
remember that unity personal is only
available to studios who generate less
than $100,000 a year and during the plus
4 studios that generate less than
200,000 again this mostly applies to
well-established studios but it's
definitely good to keep in mind so now
that we know the difference between the
different versions which one should you
pick well that totally depends in my
opinion if you're a new developer
working on your own there's no problem
in using the free version it has all the
core engine features and some of the
cloud stuff to make your life a little
bit easier so you can definitely make
and publish some great games using unity
personal of course you will have to live
with the light editor skin when it comes
to your new Pro I think it's way
overkill for small indie Studios
especially one that's just starting out
however if you're serious about making
games for living especially if you're
working with multiple people picking up
unity plus can speed up development
quite a bit oh and I almost forgot if
you subscribe to unity plus or pro
you'll now get a free essentials pack
this is actually a really nice selling
point because some of the tools like the
uber standard shader and final ik'
are really nice tools in their own right
so whether you want to get Unity
personal plus or pro you can click the
link in the description to be taken to
the website in the end the choice is
totally up to you and feel free to join
the conversation in the comments keep in
mind that this video is solely based on
my own personal experiences and I would
love to hear what you guys have to say
on the subject on that thanks for
