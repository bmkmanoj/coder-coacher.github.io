creating a bullet time effect in unity
yes what we'll be making today
throughout this video I'll explain about
how time works in unity and how it can
manipulate it while still getting really
smooth results I also just want to
mention that I'm on a fixed video
schedule so you can expect a new video
both witnessed days and Sundays let's
just go ahead and get started here's the
project we're going to be working with
today it's fairly simple but I will of
course have a download link for you in
the description if you want to have it
on your own system if you go ahead and
in play we can see what it currently
looks like
so we can move around and we are able to
shoot these explosions that will create
a force that acts on these rigid body
objects which are currently just red
cubes
however we currently have no slowing
down so let's go ahead and create a
bullet time effect so to get started
let's create an empty game object so
right click in the hierarchy go create
empty and let's reset the transform on
that to make sure it's centered in our
scene we can now rename this to
something like time controller or time
manager and we can go ahead and drag it
to the top of our hierarchy and add a
new component and this is where we want
to add our actual script so let's just
go ahead and call it the same thing the
time manager lets it create an ADD and
let's double click this to open it up in
visual studio let's clean this up a
little bit let's delete our two
functions and let's also delete the two
using tags up here because we're not
going to be using anything under system
collections now we can create two
variables that will allow us to
configure how our slow motion will occur
the first one is going to be a public
float and this one is going to be the
slowdown factor the slowdown factor is
going to control how much we will slow
down time when we do up all the time
effect the lower the number the more
slow we're going to be moving so I'm
going to default this to something
really low say 0.05 we also need a
variable to define for how long this
slowdown will occur so in that case
we'll create another public float called
the slowdown length and we can go ahead
and default this to something like 2
meaning that we will be slowed down for
2 seconds tolls now we need to create a
method that will change some time
settings around in unity in order to
make the game engine
slow down we'll go ahead and write Boyd
and the name of the function is going to
be something like bullet time or slow
down or slow motion I'm just going to go
ahead and call it do slow motion and
inside this function we can set time
time scale so what is time scale time
scale is basically a value that
determines the scale at which time is
passing if time scale is one time we'll
be passing at a normal pace we say that
it's running in real time if time scale
is 0.5 time we'll be passing two times
slower than real time and so we can
adjust time scale to a value between 0
and 1 the lower the value the slower the
game will run so let's go ahead and set
our time that time scale equal to our
slowdown factor because the slowdown
factor is equal to 0.05 we can very
easily calculate just how many times
slower we are going to be moving at and
we do that by saying 1 divided by 0.05
which is equal to 20 that means that we
will be moving 20 times slower than
normal this function should actually now
slow down time but we also need to call
the function from somewhere let's go
ahead and find the place in our project
where we can do that online player I
created in a script called explosion gun
and this is responsible for shooting out
an explosion wherever the user is
pointing let's go ahead and double click
on that to open it up in visual studio
and we can have a look at what's in here
so I have a few references one to the
explosion prefab that we want to spawn
and one to the camera in the update loop
I basically just check if the user
presses the fire button and if he does
we should then I do a bit of break as
trigger II to shoot out away from our
cameras current position and then just
straight forward and if we hit something
I go ahead and create an explosion as
the impact point and this is basically
where we also have the opportunity to
slow down time but in order to do that
we need a reference to our time manager
let's go to the top here and create yet
another public variable and it is going
to be a public time manager and we'll
just go ahead and call it time manager
with the non capital T so right after we
instantiate the explosion we can now say
time manager dot do slow motion but the
problem here is that our slow motion
method is currently private so we cannot
access
from within this script to change that
we seem to go into a time manager and
insert a public in front of the board so
now this method is public and so we can
access it from within this class so we
call the do slow motion and hit save so
if we now head into unity we need to
select our player and drag in the time
manager into the time manager variable
there we go
we can now hit play and we should see
this working but something weird is
going to happen so if I hit our shoot
here we can see that time is slowed down
quite drastically but it almost seems
that the game is lacking
however our mouse movement and the
particles here are smooth so what is
causing this well the reason why is that
whenever we adjust our time time scale
we also need to adjust time ducts fixed
Delta time fixed all the time is one of
those things in unity that just sounds
really scary but actually it's quite
simple
we know that the update function runs
each time the computer draws a frame
this normally happens many times each
second and allows us to make changes to
an object over time but how many times
the update function runs each second
depends on how much load the computer is
under and how fast the components in the
computer can perform this is normally
not an issue but when it comes to doing
physics calculations everything becomes
much easier and more reliable when we
know beforehand how many times a second
of function will be called there for
unity uses a separate function called
fixed update to calculate its physics
fixed update is of course called a fixed
amount of times per second so the bug
that we just saw in unity occurred
because fixed update got slowed down so
much that we could visibly see it
updating luckily we can change the time
between each fixed update through script
that is done by modifying the fixed
Delta time variable we normally want a
fixed update to run around 50 times per
second which means that fixed Delta time
should be 1 over 50 which is equal to
0.02 and then we multiply with the time
timescale so that when we slow down time
making timescales smaller we will also
decrease the time between each fixed
update so to make sure that we adjust
the fixed Delta time inside of our time
manager we simply go time dot fixed
Delta x equals x time scale
multiplied with some small numbers say
point zero two which is the standard
make sure you do this after we adjust
the time time scale so now when we save
this and head back into unity we should
get a very smooth slow-motion effect so
if we go over here and hit you´d we can
see just how nice that looks in
comparison so much much better
however we are currently just staying
slowed down time doesn't go back to its
normal state so in order to slowly
return back to our normal time scale we
need to use the update method let's go
here and write void update and update is
of course called each time the computer
draw the frame and unless your game is
ridiculously hard to run that means many
many times a second so what we'll do is
each frame add a tiny number to time
that timescale in order to slowly return
it back to one so to do that we write
time timescale plus equals and in here
we write one divided by this slowdown
length so right now a slowdown length is
Q which means that this will say 1/2
which means 1/2 and so each second will
add 1/2 back to the time scale and so in
2 seconds it should return to normal
however that's not what we are currently
doing what we're currently doing is
actually adding 1/2 onto the time scale
each frame which might be drawn say 60
times a second or 120 times a second so
what we need to do is multiply this
whole thing with time.deltatime so to do
that we wrap this in a few parenthesis
here and then we say multiply with time
dot go to time and time that delta time
is the amount of time passed since we
drew the last frame and that means if we
are drawing a lot of frames a second
this value is going to be small and if
we're only drawing a few frames a second
this value is going to be big and that
means that it is going to even out this
value so that over 2 seconds we are
going to be adding 1 to the time scale
and we'll do that in very small
increments if that's kind of hard to
wrap your head around I totally get it
no one really understands time that does
the first time but really the more you
get to use it the more you understand
however this is currently going to
propose a problem and that is that time
that Delta time is actually also
affected when we change the time scale
and so this whole equation becomes
really weird so what we do instead is
use time unscaled go to time and this is
the exact same thing as delta time the
amount of time elapsed since we last
refrain but unscaled delta time is not
affected when we change the time scale
so right now we're altering the time
scale in order to have it returned to
one but time scale can actually be
greater than one if we want to speed up
our game we can set time that time scale
equal to something larger say if we
wanted to run two times faster we'll set
it to two and so right now unless we are
slowed down this is just going to keep
increasing and so our game will run
faster and faster if we hit same on this
right now
and then hit play we should see that our
game just slowly speeds up and indeed it
does we're able to run quicker and
quicker until of course we shoot
something and then we are reset back to
0.05 so we're going here and say time
time scale equals mass dot clamp and the
value we'll want to clamp is time time
scale and we want to clamp it between
zero and one and this means that will
either be totally slowed down or running
at a normal speed and so we won't be
able to increase the time scale between
or further than to the value one and so
when we add save now we should see if we
have play here that time will not
increase above the one and if we go
ahead and shoot something time will slow
down and then slowly go back up to one
and so now we have that old school
bullet time effect what i really suggest
to do is combine this with some changes
in audio a very normal thing to do is
adjust the pitch of your game so that
when you're slowed down you will
decrease the pitch and then increase it
as you slowly increase the time scale
but that's really just a lot of things
that you can do to play around with this
and I suggest you just have a lot of fun
finally I just want to say if you're
making
a shooter and want to grab some weapons
you can go to dev assets calm and select
the modern weapons pack here there are
some really really nice high quality
weapons here for you to download it's
pay what you want so you can totally
decide the price and yeah we really hope
that you are going to enjoy them that's
pretty much it for this video if you're
making a shooter
I really suggest you check out my latest
tutorial on creating a sniper scope
effect in unity I think it turned out
pretty well if you want to see more
