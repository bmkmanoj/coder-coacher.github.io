want to look into this video into how to
make a 2d platformer course today we are
going to be making our at least
beginning to make an upgrade menu for
our game so we can upgrade different
stats on our player and maybe even on
our weapon too so that's going to be a
lot of fun of course whenever we want to
upgrade something we're also going to
introduce some kind of currency to the
game and yeah I think it's going to be a
lot of fun to do so let's just jump
right into it so you can see I'm here in
unity as I normally am and the first
thing that we kind of want to do is
sketch out how we want the update menu
to look because if we have a look at our
player you can see that we already have
this idea of stats and currently we only
have a max health in here we also have
on a platformer 2d eye or character 2d
we have our max speed which is something
that we could definitely make
upgradeable and then of course on our
player arm them pistol we have this
weapon that has stuff like fire raid and
by the way I want to change this to
something like 20 and this to let's say
30 and we have both the fire rate and a
damage parameter that we could make
upgradeable here we could also make it
possible for our player to switch
weapons and that completely depends on
what you want to do and yeah that's kind
of the base of what we have going on
here we I think we should also implement
some kind of health regen overtime and
maybe we could even make that upgradable
to we could also do something like how
much money you gain from enemies making
that upgradable it's also a lot of fun
so that a lot lots of different
opportunities for us to are to implement
here so the first thing that I want to
do is I want to expand the you i overlay
game object and i want to create a new
empty here which is going to host our
update menu there we go and this is
something i think we should be able to
bring up from
- time by simply pressing a button we
could also do it so every time we
complete a wave it will take us to the
upgrade menu but I like to kind of make
it more dynamic so you don't have to go
through the update screen every time
instead you just hit let's say you to
upgrade and it will pass the game while
you're in there this way it also serves
as a pause menu if people don't use
escape that's up to them
good so we have the update menu here and
under this I want to go ahead and create
a UI image and this is just going to be
a flat image that will serve as our
upgrade menu background so for some
reason it isn't snapping oh that's
because we need to take our update menu
hold down alt and click in the bottom
right corner here to anchor that to the
entire screen and that now we can do the
same with this image hold on old and
click there there we go so now it fills
up the entire screen and we can go ahead
and make this some kind of light blue
color I think that could be pretty cool
something like that would be a fine base
to work off so we're going to rename
this to BG and we can make this complete
completely solid or we could make it
somewhat opaque so it just kind of fits
on top of the game but I am going to go
ahead and make this actually maybe we
should just died in the game no I'm
going to make this completely solid and
then make that this blue color I kind of
like that so that's what we're going
with cool and then we also want to
right-click go on the UI and I want to
add just a simple graphics element in
hue to make it look a bit more
interesting so I want to go under our
sprites and find our austere astronaut
sprite Atlus and drag the astronaut idle
in here and hit set native size and then
I want to kind of expand him and drag
him over and we also need to give him an
arm so let's just duplicate him drag in
the arm now hit set native size and
again let's expand this a bit size that
up
so it looks proportionate with our
character here something like that looks
pretty good just to have something in
here that isn't just text and buttons
kind of to spice up the menu so this
makes it feel like we're actually
upgrading our character which is
something nice to feel we can also of
course if you want to be able to switch
weapons in here or upgrade your weapon
you can have a weapon graphic here and
show the updates visually on that weapon
how it changes if you want to go fully
all-in with this system that's not
something we're going to add now maybe
in the future so we're going to have an
astronaut here and under him we are
going to have his arm they're good and
again this has no purpose other than
being pretty then under the update menu
let's go on the UI and hit text and
let's change the text here to update or
no no no no upgrade have ice been saying
update this entire time this is not the
update menu this is the up grade menu
brainfart and of course that should be
capitalized there we go alright so this
is the upgrade menu and then we can go
and find our cool font the little put
steps I'm going to be using that again
and we can size this up at bunch so
let's make that something like 64 drag
it up there anchor it to the top and
while we added the astronaut should be
anchored to the left hand side this
center of the left hand side and his arm
should yeah that's fine at the center
and everything else looks good awesome
so you can see how that looks and it
should do just fine if we mess around
with it good then we can take our text
and make that completely white I think
that looks pretty awesome then we can
take an add on
a shadow effect and let's make this red
solid color and let's make the shadow go
from 3 to
negative three there and you can see
that just gives it this cool retro look
I'm going to take the astronaut here and
maybe move him out just a tiny bit so it
doesn't take up so much space on the
screen and maybe move him down a bit too
so something like that looks pretty good
and the upgrade text we can drag that up
a bit there we go and now we can
actually fill in some text here so this
is the upgrade title and we can just use
that as a base so let's duplicate that
and let's call this the health amount
maybe and this is simply going to say
that health and then a colon and then
the current amount of health that we
have I'm just going to set this to 120
and of course we're going to be changing
this through script and then we can set
maybe the size of something like 24
maybe a bit bakery or something like 40
actually and the effect the shadow
effect here I want to make that black
instead and I want to make it a lot
thinner so something like 2 to negative
2 that looks great so just to give it an
outline but it doesn't need to be very
clear actually maybe one two negative
one
yeah I think that's even better so we're
going to stick with that but I like the
white college so we're going to stick
with that too
so under the upgrade menu we can now
create another MT and this is simply
going to act as a container for all of
the different attributes just like the
health amount that we want to display
this way we can very easily add more we
can even add them through code and it
will make sure that they they are laid
out correctly on the screen so this will
simply act kind of as a group of
elements in the UI so I'm going to drag
it out something like this I'm then
going to rename this two attributes
there we go then I'm going to take the
health amount and
ragged under attributes then undo add
component I'm going to go under layout
and then choose vertical layout group
and this is going to make sure that all
as as we add more attribute GUI elements
it's going to stretch them to fit this
UI element vertically so if I add
another one here you can see it makes
them stack and that makes it very easy
to add more attributes for now I'm going
to stick with health amount and a arm
maybe speed amount and yeah that looks
pretty good and we can change this here
speed and then we want it to be the
default speed is ten I believe again we
are going to be changing it through code
so it really doesn't matter then we're
going to take the health and speed
amount and make sure that it's centered
on the left here and now you can see we
can move them both by simply scaling the
attribute so we can simply scale that
over there and that already looks very
fine and if we want them closer together
well we can just scale down the
attributes here or we can play around
round with some of this functionality so
we can choose the alignment upper left
is going to be just fine we can choose
whether or not we want them to X be
expanded on the height and width and we
can also add a component on each of
these which which is the layout element
that will allow us to control different
properties for width and height for that
element that's not something we're going
to be needing here but it's definitely
something that you should pay attention
to because it's it's actually really
cool so play around with these things
they can make your life a lot easier so
as long as we only have these two I'm
just going to scale them in like this
and that's basically all we are going to
have for the attributes for now so the
next thing that we want to add are some
buttons that will allow us to upgrade
each of these attributes and for that
I'm simply going to duplicate the
attributes here and instead call these
upgrade
buttons and again instead of health and
speed amounts we are going to have some
buttons in here and I want to simply
take the buttons from our main menu that
we made our quit and play button that
for some reason is parked but if we hit
play here you can see they appear again
these two cool buttons right here I'm
just going to take the play one copy
that go back into the main level find
our UI overlay our upgrade menu go onto
our upgrade buttons and paste that in
there and you can see it works just fine
but we need to take our upgrade buttons
here and move this entire thing so we're
going to move it over I actually want to
scale in the attributes a bit here move
place the upgrade buttons somewhere
there I can just duplicate these so we
can see it what it looks like if we have
two side-by-side scale them in kind of
like that then we can take then we can
add some padding and we can also add
some spacing so I want a spacing of
maybe five actually a bit more maybe ten
and then maybe our ten on the top and 10
on the bottom something like that looks
pretty good but I want to play around
with these buttons but because I'm not
entirely satisfied with how they look so
I'm going to take the effect distance
here change that to a two and a negative
two I think that's actually a lot better
already
and I kind of like how that looks then
we can go and expand it this and then
change the text to oops
to upgrade and the font size we're going
to have to bring that down a bit to
maybe 36 nope 33 okay so I think we are
going to go with something like 26 there
that looks pretty good and instead of
making this black we could also make it
some kind of like appealing orange
yellowish color now
- that doesn't look too good we could
add an outline on the upgrade but I
think that would add too many colors I
actually like this black just like this
and then we can rename this to an
upgrade button and we can delete the
play button there and then simply
duplicate this but I also want to remove
the event trigger here remove component
we have the animator and all that which
is fine and let's just try and duplicate
that and hit play and see if it works if
we hover over these and again the game
is playing in the background so you are
going to be hearing shot noises it's not
currently passed or anything we are not
checking if this is open but you can see
just how nice these buttons actually
feel so I really like this animation and
I think we're just going to stick with
this one thing that I might want to do
is actually make some kind of image that
goes that kind of covers our entire
health and our entire upgrade and that
will kind of need us to restructure this
a little bit so I I'm kind of making
some of this up on the go which is
definitely something yet you're going to
have to do when designing a UI it is a
creative process so I excuse if I
haven't thought this all the way through
which I have not and so I'm going to
take the health amount here and just
duplicate this and move it out of the
attribute so we can kind of experiment
with it up here and yeah so this is the
health amount and that's fine I'm also
going to make an empty object
so create empty here and this is going
to be called attribute and it's going to
be storing the amount and a button so we
can take our health amount and drag it
under the attribute and we can take
loops before we do that I want to take
the attribute here and just scale it to
the health amount here it's going to be
fine and then take our health amount
under the attribute there we go and the
health amount we want this
to scale with the attribute from there
but we don't want it to scale on the
other direction so we only wanted to
scale there so we can kind of do this
yeah that's very nice
and then we down here we need some kind
of button and that's going to be our
upgrade button so we're going to take
that duplicated and again put it under
our attribute and drag it up here and we
can drag the button in there actually
instead let's take our attribute and
drag that out a bit slice that up take
our upgrade button drag that there and
there and we want this to scale with the
side but not with the x-axis
I believe so this way you can do this
yes that's perfect so it actually scales
and it moves but it doesn't scale on on
the wrong axis so now that we have this
idea of an attribute we can simply put
different attributes under the
attributes group here so we can delete
the upgrade buttons and we can delete
our two attributes and simply take our
one attribute here and place that onto
your attributes so you can see how that
looks and we then of course need to make
this wider there we go and when we now
duplicate this attribute you can see
just how smooth on that is and we can
then go on to our attributes object and
add some padding just as we did before
so that's that's going to be 10 10 and
10 and there we go so that makes it a
lot easier to add new attributes and I
think it's just more logical overall so
this is going to be our health attribute
and this is going to be our speed
attribute there we go and you can of
course prefab allies this if you want to
make it into a prefab that's completely
fine and this is of course
going to be instead of writing what kind
of amount it is I'm just going to write
amount and this is going to be our speed
and it's going to be defaulted to ten so
I think this is a lot better if you
structure it this way and therefore
that's what we aren't going to do so we
have our attributes and everything
should scale nicely with the screen this
is parented to the center so you will
notice if I go ahead and do this ah if
we have a very tiny screen our astronaut
will actually overlap with our
properties but again this will require a
very small screen so I think we will be
okay with that for now at least you can
of course go ahead and change how these
things move on different screen sizes I
mean if we go ahead and choose the
smallest possible screen here you can
see it does overlap a little bit so we
can maybe take our astronaut just move
him out here so that he doesn't overlap
with the properties and this way our
game is kind of future proof no matter
what screen we want to display it on so
that's fine and yeah I believe that is
all we needed to do with the UI work let
me just check how long I've been
recording here yeah so this is already
almost 20 minutes and therefore I'm
going to cut off the recording here and
we're going to continue in the next
video by actually scripting some
functionality into this so we're going
to actually make our upgrade menu do
something this was just the very
beginning of a very cool system a system
that I definitely want your feedback on
so if you have any great ideas on what
you want to see in this upgrade menu
system definitely write them in the
comment section you can also visit the
brackets for on both with suggestions or
if you want to ask some questions about
how you can implement your own ideas if
I'm not able to cover them in the
tutorials so that was basically it for
this video stay tuned for the next one
and I'll see you there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
