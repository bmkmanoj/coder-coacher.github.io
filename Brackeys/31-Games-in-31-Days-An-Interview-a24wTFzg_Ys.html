everyone and welcome to this exclusive
interview with the guy behind 31 games
in 31 days is called Victor aka Zeppelin
captain and he's just made his own block
featuring the 31 games so welcome to you
Victor tell us how long have you been
making games hello
well I've been making games for about
six years
and I've been making most of them in
game maker just small games in my spare
time and after well I at some point I
wanted to move on from game maker and so
I made some I started learning flash and
using ActionScript and at some point I
put flixel in there to use as a library
and and I also took half-year class in
Java programming but I've never actually
made any games in that since I decided
to move back to game maker after trying
out Java cool so you you've been making
games for quite some time this project
you have started it's it's really
interesting to me the nature of it could
you tell us more on how you came up with
the concept like the reasoning behind
the idea well half a year ago I tried
out how fast I could make games in game
maker and I tried doing these games
which I called
15-minutes project where I made a few
games something like seven games and so
I realized that it was actually possible
for me to make one of these very quick
games I could actually make one of those
every single day and so because I wanted
to practice and because I wanted to try
out if I liked making games for a long
time so at the end of September I kind
of just decided out of nowhere that now
was the time
for me to try making games for a full
month and see if I could actually finish
this idea of mine
turns out you could but maybe you could
elaborate on your experience with game
maker as a tool like the goods and the
bads did you ever meet any limitations
throughout when making these games
well the main good thing about game
maker is how easy it is to use and how
quick it is to use which was of course
perfect for this project because I could
make games in a very short time and
still have quite a bit of functionality
in them the bad things about game maker
are mainly its limitations in that it is
very bad at making 3d games for example
so if I wanted to make a 3d game I would
probably start learning unity but for
this purpose and for most 2d games I
think it is game maker is quite enough
definitely agree with you to those of
you out there who think that unity can
be quite the challenge game maker is a
great free tool unless you want to
publish to extreme platforms like mobile
and and so on one thing that fascinates
me is how you just oh you're just able
to sit down and sell yourself
force yourself actually to come up with
some kind of ideas some kind of mechanic
that just works and maybe you could give
me some insight on how what do you think
when you sit down to make this game how
do you brainstorm the mechanics and from
there start building the game the way I
do it is that I make sure that I have
some time where I won't get interrupted
and where I have time to be alone and I
sit down and I start thinking sometimes
I put on some music which helps often
but I sit down and then I I start
thinking about these very abstract
things like abstract things interacting
with each other like
big buildings growing out of walls and
big circles hitting them and I just let
my brain go wild with everything that I
can think of and then at some point if I
think of something that I think is
interesting I kind of try to condense
that into something that that I could
make in game maker into a mechanic that
could work then when I have that
mechanic I I can pretty quickly tell
from experience if it will be any fun
and if I will actually be able to make
it if it's if it doesn't meet these two
criteria I scrap it immediately and I
try to think of something new but when I
then when I have something that has
passed these two main criteria I then
start thinking about a goal for this
mechanic because often I'll have thought
of something like like an interesting
way to move around but then I because I
want to make games and that is funny
ways of moving around I I then try to
think of a goal for this in something
that that you can do like collect
something or avoid something and those
goals are often very simple because well
because I have to make something quick
and that's why many of the these games
are score based or have very quick
levels with with a very simple goal
right I mean your brainstorming method
seems really effective it must be since
you've completed this project but
something I often see when when people
start making games is that they start
out by saying that it should accomplish
this it should include this and have
this and that and and what you really
need to to
do is just let your brain go wild as you
said just come up with something that
you know you can create and then later
try to accomplish goals with it so not
build up too many criteria in your head
which the game has to fulfill because
then you can just brainstorm and
brainstorm and you will never really
reach that goal and and also it's not
about what the first prototype looks
like but because that's always gonna
Sark but it's really about taking
something that that you think could be
good and then just building on top of it
and building and building until it
finally looks polished because you can't
expect it to be with the first prototype
so what really got me into making games
what was the idea of being able to
combine hobbies I've always been this
happy person and I could suddenly make
music design and program and all of this
in and combine it into one piece but
what what do you find most interesting
about the process of making these
smaller games is it problem-solving
coming up with mechanics shoot right now
the most interesting thing about making
games for me is coming up with mechanics
because when I have made a mechanic and
I've implemented it for the first time
when I then boot up the game for the
first time and see how it actually works
out I really understand a word that a
lot of game developers used which is
exploring that they feel that they're
exploring and mechanic I really
understand this the first time I booted
up because it's like I'm exploring this
whole new world that I've just created
in a way so what's your next big project
are we gonna see a hundred games in a
hundred days or do you have something
more specific that you can tell us about
what what what's the next big thing from
mr. Sablan captain well actually I have
something very different in mine I am
still going to work in game maker and
make something 2d but my next project
will the most important thing for me
right now is that I'll be able to make
something where I focus on the details
and go in into more depth with the
project and more specifically the idea
I'm working with right now is kind of a
2d version of Proteus with a more heavy
focus on interaction if that makes any
kind of sense it does definitely but it
looks like we are running out of time so
basically if you want to play mr.
captain's games please we'll visit his
website links on the screen and in the
description or his Twitter again screen
description and thank you for
participating and thank you for having
me
enjoy the games everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
