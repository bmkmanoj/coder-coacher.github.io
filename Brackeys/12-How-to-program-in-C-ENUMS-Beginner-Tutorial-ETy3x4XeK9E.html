welcome to video number 12 in the how to
program in c-sharp course this video is
going to be about enums so i excuse that
it's been such a while since the last
video but as you can see i've been
really busy and also i got sick right
after my vacation so if my voice sounds
kind of weird that might be why but
without further adieu I quickly want to
mention that the practice forum is the
place to be if you have any questions or
the code is not working or something and
also for you the those of you who are
using a unity I've just released a new
version of UPA toolkit on the store that
introduces blend modes and a bunch of
new layer functionality so that's super
cool I might make a video about that too
we'll see cool so let's open up samer
studio and get started
so enums are fairly easy to understand
once you know why they are useful so let
me just line up a case here where enums
would be great so the formal definition
of an enum is basically a a type that we
create consisting of a bunch of
constants that we associate with the
name so an example of an enum if I just
make one up here is if we type in enum
that's just like we type in class or
anything else that's a keyword and then
we give it a name and this a name could
be for example Direction this is a very
common example and then we open and
close some square brackets and we close
it up with a semicolon
let's grab brackets curly brackets and
then in here we could do our North West
East
and South and they don't need to be in
any particular order and this way down
here if we wanted to access this we
could make a new direction so we could
say direction and call this maybe deer
or whatever you want to call this and we
could then set it equal to direction dot
and then it will show the different
options that we've given it so it's
basically a way to define a bunch of
types that are very easily readable
instead of just using an integer to
represent on different things or a
string so a good example of when you
would use this is again we have this
idea of a base class called animal and
then we derive from that into a dark
class so this dark class is derived from
animal and so it will inherit all of
these members and the dark class adds on
a public void that will print out
everything we know about the dark to our
console so that includes currently the
name age and happiness and if we should
add on to this let's say we wanted to
add a dark breed so I found this useful
list of all dark breeds as I run run out
and that's one of the weirder searches
I've made today and basically if we
wanted to define a breed for our dark we
could make this a public integer called
breed and then let's create a
constructor also here so again all of
this with inheritance and constructors
that's covered in an earlier video so
let's just quickly make a public dark
constructor here like this and this will
take in a name so we're going to do a
string name and integer for the H and a
float for the happiness
and then down here I will simply set
name equal to the name that we've passed
in do the same with the age and the
happiness okay cool so now we have this
constructor set up and if we wanted to
pass in a breed here we could simply go
in to breed and set the breed down here
and then when we wanted to print this
out we of course don't want to print the
number but then we could make a switch
statement for example that would check
for the index of the breed so we could
do a switch for the breed and then we
couldn't define a bunch of different
cases so we could define that if this
was equal to zero we would print out
that the breed was a bulldog and and you
can just keep on doing that and we would
probably be forced to do a default one
also because we there are a bunch of
breeds in the world of dogs and we would
probably not be able to write out all of
them here so you can see that that's a
very cumbersome way and also it's hard
to remember on which indexes associated
with what so you would have to
constantly check when using this so a
better way to do this would may be to
turn this into a a string and this could
of course be done and so you would just
change this to string and now we would
simply write out the ARBs write out the
breed as we've done with anything else
so simply write out the breed here to
the console and then down here when we
make a a new dog will simply say dark
and we'll call this one Hulk and we'll
make it a new dog called Hulk with a H
of six and a happiness of 0.7 and we
could then May
the breed a what do we want to do this
time a boxer like this but this way when
we print out Hulk we will notice that it
actually looks fine we can see that it
says the breed is a boxer but let's
imagine that we have a bit of a bigger
program and we actually want to do
something with the knowledge of the
breed we don't want to just print it out
we actually want to have some logic that
depends on what breed it is again we
could go in and make a switch statement
but this way we don't we have to
actually support all of the different
types of breeds and that's maybe not
something we want I mean there are so
many here and we don't want to sit and
sit there and type in all of them and so
our code could be easily broken so what
we do instead is we simply limit our
possibilities and this is xxxx
especially great if you're working
multiple people because it makes the
code very readable and and easy to not
 up so I will say and we basically
do this by up here creating an enum and
this will be our breed and we do a
couple capital B here because we're
defining and type and we simply use the
same syntax here to then type in a
Bulldog a boxer we could do a chihuahua
and you could just keep going here Brian
and you can do as many as you want by
the way some people like to type it out
like this and that's completely valid
even some people do it like this and
again that's just fine but when we are
not talking about a lot of types of
values I like to just do it on one one
line there so now we have all of our
different options and you will notice
that spaces cannot be used here but
basically now we've defined this we
we need to turn our type here instead of
string into brie and this way down here
it will simply print out the breed so
when we pass in here
what breed we want we're going to do
capital breed dot oops and then you can
select whatever one you want so if we
want this to be a tea to our called hog
we simply do that and we save this and
hit play and it's going to say that we
cannot implicitly convert oh that's
because we need to change the type there
also try this again you can see that it
prints out that our breed is of type
Chihuahua and you can see that when
printing out an enum the conversion to a
string actually happens automatically if
you wanted to be specific in telling
whoever is reading this that it is
actually not a string you can of course
called the two string method that's a
bit more explicit but really unnecessary
cool so that's basically enumerations
for you one last thing you can define
values for each of these and when I say
values I mean integer values but that's
not really needed in most cases so I
think we'll just stay away from that but
that's in uhm a basic introduction to
enums and and how they can be used so
that's basically all for this video I
hope you enjoyed it and I'll see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
