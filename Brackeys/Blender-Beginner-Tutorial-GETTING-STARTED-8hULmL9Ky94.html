place to start and these videos will go
with the basics of using blender from
modeling to texturing to lighting in
this video we setup the interface then
to navigate around and create our first
objects and by the end we make your
monkey explode yeah welcome to 3d
modeling alright so let's get into it so
to download blender let's go to blender
dark I'll have a link in the description
as well that's it download choose an
operating system and choose the location
closest to you in my case that's Denmark
it's going to start downloading once
it's done just open it up and run
through the Installer so let's open up
blender the version that I'm using is
2.7 8c but I don't expect the stuff will
cover here to change anytime soon let's
get rid of this opening window by
clicking anywhere on the screen and
welcome to blender not a lot of people
find the interface to be really daunting
at first don't worry as a beginner you
won't be using 90% of the stuff you see
here the primary thing that we're going
to be focusing on is the 3d viewport
that's the big one in the center here
this is where we do all of our modeling
where we change around objects and
select them that means that this is
where most of the creative stuff happens
on the right here we have the properties
panel this is probably also the most
scary one you'll notice just how many
knobs and dials there are here this is
used to modify things in our scene and
some of the tabs modify the object that
is currently selected in our case we
have the cube selected so if we were to
go to the materials panel and change the
color of the material to let's say green
we can see that that modifies our cube
but if we then select our camera we can
see that the materials tab is gone
because our camera does not have a
material now let's undo that by hitting
ctrl V a couple times and some of you
might have had a hard time selecting the
camera here maybe this happened
let's because blender is a bit different
and doesn't use left click to select
instead we use right-click and
left-click just moves around our 3d
cursor the 3d cursor is used for a few
things mainly it's the place where we
spawn new objects and it can be pretty
annoying if you accidentally click
somewhere and now everything is spawn is
out here so to reset that you can always
hit shift C and it's going to snap right
back to the center of our scene now
before we start changing things around
let's go file user preferences and this
is where we configure blender you will
see a lot of people using a different
theme you go on the themes and presets
there are a bunch of different ones to
choose from a very popular one is
Elysium but we'll just be using the
default theme on the input we can adjust
all of our keyboard shortcuts of which
there are many by default you can leave
everything else is but if you're using a
keyboard without a number pad maybe on
the laptop without one the number pad is
the numbers to the right of your
keyboard you will probably want to go
ahead and check emulate numpad that's
because we use the number pad a lot in
blender when adjusting our view and
checking this will allow you to use your
normal number keys instead also if
you're really annoyed with having to
right click to select you can change
that preference here so now that we're
satisfied with our settings that's hit
save user settings to make sure that
they will be there next time we open
blender let's have a look at how we can
navigate around up view now three main
ways to move around in blender the first
one is using our scroll wheel this will
swim in and out if you hold down the
middle mouse button and drag it will
rotate and round a certain pivot point
this allows us to view object from
multiple sides and if you hold down
shift and middle mouse button we can pan
around a theme so using these three
different ways of movement we can
quickly focus on different objects and
if you quickly want to snap to a certain
object you can always select it and hit
period on the number pad to snap to it
in fact if you get so lost that you
can't even see your objects you can
always go up here this is called the
outliner and it shows all of the objects
currently in our scene we then click the
object that we want to snap to and hit
period and there we go the outliner can
be really handy for selecting objects
you can't see or hide objects that you
don't want to focus on we can also use
the number pad to quickly view as seen
from different sides if we had seven we
view it from above three from the side
and one from the front however if we go
ahead and pan to the side here you can
see that we're still viewing things in
perspective and this is sometimes a good
thing but other times we actually just
want to view things flat in the same way
that an architect would draw out
different sides of the building to do
that we hit fine
this changes us into orthographic mode
and it basically just removes
perspective from our scene so now
everything is going to be viewed flat
and we can still view it from above the
side and the front and we can even drag
around here and still view things in
orthographic mode you can see up here
which mode we're currently in if we had
five again we switch back to perspective
this can of course be a bit confusing to
the mind when you first get started but
you'll quickly get used to switching
between them and find out just how handy
it is to be able to do that now that we
know how to navigate around our scene
let's start do
things let's begin by selecting the
camera holding down shift to select the
light as well let's hit delete or X to
remove it let's select our cube and the
first thing that we can do here is use
the arrow keys to move it around our
scene an easier way to do this is simply
hitting key for grab and we now drag it
around when dragging things in freehand
like this it can be hard to get a grasp
of where your object currently is in
space so instead of really moving it
it's normal to have it snap to a certain
axis we can hit X to only move it around
the x axis z to move it along the z axis
and Y to move it along the Y if we left
click we go through with the movement
but if we right click it snaps back
other than moving our object we can also
rotate it to do that we hit our again we
can rotate in freehand or around the X Z
and Y axis and finally we can hit s to
scale by default we scale on all axis
around the center you guessed it we can
also choose to own the scale on the x
the Z and the Y so we can now manipulate
objects the way that we want and so we
can start building cool stuff if for
example we were to delete this cube hit
shift a to bring up a menu this menu
allows us to spawn new objects into a
scene there's a lot of different stuff
here but what we are going to be working
with is everything underneath the mesh
tab and these are basic primitives that
you can work off of
let's begin by spawning in a cube here
let's scale it down on the z axis let's
grab it and move it up on the z axis as
well let's then hit shift a and let's
spawn in a cylinder let's scale this
down quite a bit but scale it up on the
z axis we then hit seven to view this
from the top to get a better view we go
down here this allows us to change from
solid to wireframe mode and we can now
see the cylinder through the cube we can
then hit grab to move it let's move it
to the edge here to duplicate an object
we hit shift key and we can move this
over to the right as well let's now
select both of them by holding down
shift and right-clicking and let's
duplicate both and move those down to
the bottom if we now if back into solid
mode hit five to switch back to
perspective we've created a table now
there are about a million different
things that we could do to make this
cooler but you have to start somewhere
and congratulations on your first model
if depending on the cylinders here is
really annoying you you can select all
of them and go up here and change the
shading to smooth that should help sort
that out
if we now were to select all the objects
and remove them and instead go ahead and
add a monkey the monkey head here is
blender history it's been there for so
many years and it's been used for pretty
much everything it's been blown up
shattered and put into environments of
all sorts so you'll probably be seeing a
lot of this guy let's just do something
fun and go ahead and make him shatter to
do that we hit space to bring up a
search menu and this is a really cool
part of blender if there's something
that you don't remember the shortcut to
or can't find in the menus maybe you
just get an idea of something that you
want to do but don't know how try
searching for it for example if you
wanted to add a sphere research for add
sphere and you get options for the
different spheres you can add if we hit
add UV sphere boom this is free in our
scene but now we want to make this guy
explode that's going here and right
explode that's an option called quick
explode if now we go down here and hit
play we can see them shattering this
here is the animation window and you can
scrub through to any point in time we
won't be using this too much but it's
cool to know about so I really encourage
you to take what you've learned here and
go completely nuts with it don't be
afraid to change around dials and adjust
knobs you can also mess around with the
interface all that you want if you feel
you get completely lost don't worry all
you need to do to restore your settings
just go back to file new and voila
everything gets reset that's properties
interface and everything you've done
with your scene so go nuts and save
asking that's pretty much it for this
video if you enjoyed it make sure to

this is of course a bit different from
my usual video normally I do tutorials

using my favorite piece of software
which is unity so if you're interested
in game development I have a course here
for complete beginners so answer my lot
of subscribers don't worry
I'll still be doing plenty of unity
tutorials on that thanks for watching
and I will see you in the next video
thanks to all the awesome patreon
supporters who donated in April and a
special thanks to Derek Hughes Kirk face
