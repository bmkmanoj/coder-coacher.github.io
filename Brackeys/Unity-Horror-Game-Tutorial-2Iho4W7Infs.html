game tutorial and this is just going to
be a quick walkthrough with some footage
that I have sped up and as you can see
first off I create a project and import
the character controller because I know
that we are going to be moving around in
the game it's going to be a first-person
so I start off by creating a ground
plane for character to stand on and just
a while doing some of the basic level
shaping and level design and this is say
a good way to start out especially with
mood games like horror titles so I
create a material and I apply a texture
to it
and what you might want to do I didn't
do this though s to create a normal map
for it this means that light will
reflect a whole lot better and this can
be done with a free program called crazy
pump it can generate it for free so
after this I create the walls and the
loft and the backdrop and I just created
some pillars which I then duplicated
along one axis so now I start to apply
lights and I go into the project
settings and change the ambient light
down to completely black I then go into
the render settings and fiddle around
with those if you want you can watch one
of our other tutorials on creating a
survival type game where we cover some
more rental detail so generally in
horror games you want a lot of shadowing
you want a lot of dark mystical places
because what you can't see you're afraid
of so what I did there was I went into
window then light mapping and I mapped
out the lighting so this allows for much
more detailed shadowing so the shape I'm
creating here and applying texture to is
just a basic piano I just wanted to get
something in there
with a detail among all of this just
borrowing my pillars and walls so I'm
basically what I wanted to do is I
wanted to have a light a spotlight to be
excited which I create here to come
flying up revealing the piano so um so I
play around with some of the color of
the lights which is very important
because generally if you just make it
like a light yellow it's it doesn't get
that scary
you need some harsh color is contrasted
with some bright white light that's
generally a scary thing so here you see
me create a game object that's is going
to act as a trigger for our piano so I
basically want to say that whenever the
player insists this Collider and so
create the script for it then we want
the animation of the light to play so
the light come down when the player is
close to the piano basically and this
way you don't have to time it with them
just yeah with timers because then you
are dependent on how fast the player
will move so this is a good way to do
with do it in general so I just type out
the basic script that if ontriggerenter
something needs to happen first of all
it needs to check if we could object
that it collided with it has attack
called player and I remember to check
the player later as player and then it
needs to play the animation and maybe
even a small audio file so you could
have some stab playing I don't do audio
in this tutorial because it's pretty
easy to figure out whenever you have it
an animation playing or if something
happens you generally want something
that could
people so have a a ground layer of so
they attack the player have a layer of
just mute music so just something
playing in the background this could be
a basic violin some piano maybe just
some harsh strings and I have these as a
decent low volume and then whenever you
want something exciting to happen make a
stab a rough chord something like in
that ology there are plenty and plenty
of horror steps out there on the
internet so what I did here is I created
a light cold light fleiger
and I just made it completely blue and
animated on and off using the end
enabled and I just set the animation to
play on awake and loop and you can see
that this gives a really scary feeling
this is like the final playthrough we
come and the piano is revealed and
imagine it playing a sound right now
it's it's playing and maybe even it's
it's maybe even moving like an invisible
invisible man is playing so that was
basically it
for the horror game tutorial this is how
to set up a completely simple horror
game that will absolutely freak people
out you might not find it that scary to
play for yourself because horror games
are generally based on not knowing what
happens and of course you do when when
you're the one who made it but um well
thank you for watching this was all I
think and I'll see you soon hopefully
with another video I've been really busy
with creating seananners the game it's
up on our website and I'll I'm sure
leave an annotation and just go support
wherever you want maybe even send
seananners message
this game is Donna I don't know if he
has realized yet so I'm I hope you like
it
I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
