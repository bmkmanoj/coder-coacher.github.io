how to create a cool main menu inside of
unity at the end it should look
something like this especially thanks to
hands off tune kudamon
a nominee rusi for their support on
patreon and now let's make a menu so I
currently have two scenes a menu one
which is completely empty and a game one
just pretend that you're seeing a game
here now inside of our men you've seen
let's begin by creating the UI let's
right-click in our hierarchy Co UI and
select panel this will create a canvas
and inside of this canvas it will create
a panel now I want to go under image and
replace the source image I've imported
my own background image here that we can
drag in you can choose to use any sprite
here just make sure that when you select
it under the texture type it's set to
sprite 2d and UI then under our panel
let's go to color and let's amp up the
Alpha Channel so now we have a nice
backdrop for our menu let's rename it to
background and at this point we're ready
to add some text let's right-click on
our canvas go UI select text and of
course we could just use unities default
text here we could scale it up Center it
change the font size change the color
but that's about the control that we
have if you want to change the font we
need to import some custom fonts we
can't add nice-looking shadows or
gradients and for most menus that I've
created I definitely want to have these
options so instead let's delete this
text object and let's import a free
package called text mesh Pro so let's go
to the asset store search for text mesh
bro I'll of course have a link for this
in the description let's select the pack
here this pack was recently acquired by
unity and I've created a separate video
on how to use it so if you find
something confusing along the way
definitely check that out for now we can
just hit download or import and we'll
hit import again and after it's done you
should see a folder in your project
panel code text measure Pro now we can
go back to our scene view we can right
click on our canvas go UI and you should
now see an option here called text much
pro text and right off the bat we can
see that the text renders a lot more
clearly let's go into the font size here
and let's change it to something like 84
let's also give our texan room i'll hold
down alt to scale from the center let's
make sure to align our text to the
center both horizontally and
non-staff new text will write play with
capital letters and I'm also going to
change the font asset to Roboto bold and
I think we can make this even more bold
so that's also under font style check
off the B here that looks pretty good
but currently it's just a plain white to
change this that scroll down under the
material settings let's first add an
underlay in order to create a shadow
let's enable this it's offset it by one
on the X by minus one on the Y we can
also increase the softness to play the
shadow a bit I think that looks a lot
better let's also add a gradient to the
text we do that under the font settings
where it says color gradient we'll make
sure to check that we can now configure
a color for both the top left and right
and the bottom left and right but
instead of doing that in here since I
want all of my text elements to share
the same gradient we can create a color
gradient asset to do that we'll go to
the project right click go create text
mesh and let's select color gradient
let's rename this asset to gold and now
we can define some colors and I have
some color codes at the ready here so
simply paste these in I'm going to be
using the same one for the top left and
right and then for the bottom left and
right we'll choose another one a bit
darker this time
that's some nice yellow and orange
colors let's now select our text object
let's scroll to the gradient part and
let's now drag in our gold object into
the gradient presets slot and there we
go we now have a nice gradient to our
text let's rename this text to play and
of course this is currently just a
simple text object we want to turn this
into a button to do that that's right
click on our canvas Co UI and let's
create a button let's start by scaling
this button up and let's move it up as
well for the image here we'll make that
completely black and for now we'll just
go ahead and disable it then under our
button will notice a text object and
this is what we want to replace with the
play text that we just created so let's
delete this text object and instead
dragging our play text let's just rename
this to text and instead rename our
button to play button we can now select
our text object we'll click on the
anchor presets at the top of the rect
transform hold down alt and click on the
bottom right corner this will snap our
text to the center of our play button
make sure to always scale it to the same
size as
button so now we should see that if we
hit play we can actually press on our
text however we don't actually see
anything changing we need some visual
feedback on what's going on to do that
that's rename our image under the normal
color let's go and change the Alpha to
zero then under highlighted color we'll
definitely also decrease it but we do
want it to be visible and when we then
press the object we want it to be even
clearer so with these settings if we try
and hit play we should see that when we
hover over our text the black box
appears and when we click it it becomes
even darker awesome we can of course
change the size of the black box by
adjusting this element so when we're
happy with our button let's go ahead and
duplicate it we'll click and drag while
holding down shift to move it down on
only one axis and this is going to be
our options button so let's change the
text to options let's also increase the
width to make room for it and let's
rename it to options button again we'll
duplicate this hold down shift while
moving it down and finally we want this
to be our quit button again we'll resize
it to only just fit our text I mean then
rename the button to quit button awesome
so if we now hit play we should see that
we're able to select three different
buttons and that you can also use your
keyboard
to change between them of course our
buttons currently don't do anything our
play button should load the next scene
our quit button should close the game
and our options button should lead to
another menu let's start by creating
this menu to do that let's go to a
canvas that's right click and create an
empty we'll rename this to our main menu
it's also just size it up a bit this is
going to contain all of our main menu
elements so we can select all of our
buttons and drag them under our main
menu object let's then duplicate this
object and let's rename this one to
options menu let's disable the main menu
now for this menu I don't want a lot of
buttons but I do want it to say options
at the top so I'm gonna go under my
options button take the text element
alone and drag it to the top and then
I'm gonna drag it up here where it says
play and I'm gonna delete both the play
and options button the quit button we
can turn into a back button let's call
it back button and change the text to
back also decrease the text
sighs to something like 50 and we'll
then resize it to fit and now we have
some room where we can add our settings
I'm just gonna show you how to add a
simple slider we'll right-click on an
options menu go UI and select slider
let's definitely make this wider and a
bit taller let's go into the slider find
the handle and it's disabled the image
component we can then select our
background and make this a neutral black
let's also decrease the alpha to not
make it stand out too much finally we
can go into a fill area and select fill
and let's use the color picker here to
get a nice color from our text now we
should see if we hit play that we're
able to adjust our slider to anything
that we'd like let's also add a tiny
text element telling what this slider
does do that let's duplicate our text
let's move this on top of the slider
let's rename this to volume that saint's
the text to volume as well and let's
decrease the font size to something like
32
we now shrink down this element move it
to our slider and let's align it to the
left and we've now created a volume
slider of course a slider doesn't change
any settings if you don't know how to
create a options menu in unity
definitely let me know in the comments
so now we have our two menus an options
menu as well as a main menu all that's
left is to add functionality to these
two menus let's begin with the play
button this is found under the main menu
object but instead of adding a separate
script for the play button itself let's
add a script to the main menu object
that will have functionality for all of
our menu buttons that's it a component
let's write main menu let's create a new
script of type c-sharp create an ADD
let's double click it to open it up in
Visual Studio now let's remove our start
and update and instead let's create our
own function that will call whenever we
press the play button in order to be
able to call it from the button we need
to make the method public so we'll write
public void let's call it play game and
inside this method will simply load the
next level whenever we want to change
scenes in unity we need to be using
unity engine that's scene management now
we can simply go scene manager dot load
scene and here we could give it a name
of the scene say level 1 we would also
give it a build index say 1 but instead
of loading a particular level let's
simply load the
next level in the queue to do that we
get the index of our currently loaded
level so scene manager dot get active
scene dot build index and we simply
increase it by one so plus one if we now
save this and go into unity we of course
need to make sure that we add our scenes
to the queue to do that we go file build
settings and here we have all the scenes
in our build first you want to add our
menu so that has an index of zero I will
then add our game which has an index of
one now the last thing we need to do is
simply hook up our play button to the
function that we just created to do that
let's select the button let's scroll
down to where it says on click this is a
unity event we can add an action to this
event by hitting the plus button we need
to select an object that will be on main
menus let's drag that in there now we
can go and find our main menu script and
under here we've created a function
called play game and now if we play our
game and press on the play button it
loads the next scene which is our game
even though it currently may be our menu
is more fun so that's awesome the next
button we'll hook up is the quit button
again we can do this inside of the same
script so we'll create another public
void and this one will call quit game
and this is even simpler we simply go
application
daaad quit and that should close down
the program however this won't happen
inside of the unity editor so just to
let ourselves know that this is working
we'll throw debug deadlock and the
message will be quit again let's go into
unity let's select our quit button let's
scroll down to the onclick event let's
add an action again we want to reference
our main menu and the function that we
want to call is under your main menu and
it's called quit game and again if we
hit play and select quit we can now see
the quit message displayed in the
console and I promise you that if you
build this and try and do the same thing
it will close down the program now the
last button that's left is our options
button that's because we don't want this
to load another scene or create the
program we simply want this to change to
another menu and we have that menu
available right here it's just disabled
so we don't actually need to do any
programming we simply select the options
button scroll down to the on click event
add an action and here we can simply
reference our options menu directly then
as the function will go on the game
object I will
this said active function this is a
really awesome part of the unity UI
events the fact that we can call
functions on unity components and then
we can choose whether or not we want the
game object to be enabled and in this
case we do but we also need to disable
our main menu so we'll just add another
action this time we'll reference our
main menu we'll again go under game
object choose set active and this time
we want it to be false so if we now play
the game and select our options we can
see that our main menu gets disabled and
our options menu gets enabled and here
we are in our options menu of course we
also need to be able to transition back
using the back button to do that we'll
go under the options menu select our
back button add an action and here we
want to reference our main menu go under
game object you guessed it will select
set active and we'll set that to true
and then we want to disable our options
menu so we'll add another action drag in
the options menu go game object said
active and this time false and that
completes our menu we can go quit in
order to quit the game we can go options
in order to go into our options menu and
adjust our volume we can select back and
then we can press play and it puts us
into the game yay let's pretty much it
