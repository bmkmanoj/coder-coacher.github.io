an entire video and forget to hit record
that feeling is what we begin with today
thanks for tuning in at break ease so
hello everyone I will consist video and
creating a tower defense game in unity
today we are going to be adding new
coulthard to the game it's going to be a
missile launcher we'll begin by
importing the model will then be setting
it up with the turret script in order to
make it point towards and shoot enemies
and finally we'll be implementing it
into our our UI so that we are able to
select it and place it on the map one
thing that we will not do today is kind
of changing the bullet to allow for
explosions so that we will damage
players in the radius and have explosion
particles and all that that is for a
separate video so without further ado
let's delve right in to it
so you can see that I'm in unity and
basically what we want to begin by doing
is finding some cold model to use for
this chart and you can of course go
ahead and create your own or you can use
one that I've provided for you here on
the D tower defense assets pack this is
available at patron under one of the
posts you can download it here if your
patron are not completely free and I
will of course have a link to it in the
description however now that you are
here you could choose to become a patron
that means that you will support me with
a monthly donation it gives you some
cool rewards and also helps me create a
lot more awesome stuff more stuff in the
assets on in the assets pack more cool
videos the next goal is live streaming
and a game math essentials or course arm
which is going to be super cool so
please do that it's of course 100%
optional and without further ado let's
actually get to the video part here so
when once you've downloaded this assets
pack and unzipped it you will get this
folder called the tower defense assets
pack and if we double-click this you
will see two folders on the models and
missile launcher we have three files
which are the ones that we are going to
need in this video the first one is the
missile launcher blend this is if you
have blender installed and
want to be able to edit it you can
simply open this up in blender and you
can also import it directly into unity
if you do not have blender installed
there's also an FBX file which works
either way and a missile launcher
texture to use with one of the two model
files so I'm just going to be using the
missile launcher FBX and the texture
here so make sure to select both of them
and then we can drag them into unity
however let's just make sure that we
have the correct folder structure here
so under our imports let's create a
separate folder for our standard turret
and drag our materials and turret undo
that and let's create whoops not sure
and Explorer let's create another folder
which is going to be our missile
launcher this is a really great thing to
do have one folder for each import
because if you import everything into
one folder unity will import a lot of
materials into one folder that it
generates called materials and that
there can be like hundreds of materials
in there and you might never notice that
you're not using them and they will just
clutter up the project and it's a whole
mess so this is a really great thing to
do and now we can just take these two
files and drag it under that folder and
you can see here what I was talking
about these are the generated materials
let's select the missile launcher and
get rid of those by disabling this
import materials and now we're able to
simply remove this folder and it won't
come back then what we can do is we can
drag our missile launcher into our
hierarchy make sure it's centered and
let's focus on it by hitting F and
shifting away from the 2d tools you can
see that this is currently quite large
so let's just bring up a reference here
in size by dragging in that standard
turret and let's our reset this as well
and we'll have it be 0.5 on the Y and
let's just drag it over here using
holding down ctrl to snap it to the grid
now you can see that this is way too
huge so let's select our missile
launcher and chillz this change the
scale factor here to something like 0.5
and everything else looks fine so that's
it apply on that and you can of course
also go ahead and disable regen
animations here but there is no
animation on the
take so it might not be too important
Coon so you can see now that it fits in
scale but we still need to set up a
bunch of materials so to do this let's
first actually take our missile here and
just drag it out and don't mind that it
will break the prefab instance that is
fine just to continue on that and let's
just disable the missile and focus on
the launcher itself so the first thing
that I want to do is just bring this
launcher up to actually stand on the
node and let's just do that by setting
the Y to 0.5 just as with our other
turret but you can see now it currently
floats a tiny bit above the node and to
change this what we do is we select our
stand and our turret and just drag these
down until they are barely touching the
surface it needs to just rest on the
node so it does that right there and
that is fine thus we are preserving the
Y value of 0.5 on the missile launcher
itself cool
then on the stand here that is called
base on the other models let's rename
that and the turret here we'll call that
the head let's just drag it up there so
it makes sense and now we need to add
some materials so you can see both on
the head here and on the base there are
two materials added and both of them are
currently using the default material and
this is because both on both the head
and the base have a primary color and an
an accent color or a secondary color so
let's create these let's go create and
let's add a folder for these materials
and let's right click and create a
material here and we'll call this the
missile launcher and then we'll call
this the primary and let's duplicate
this and call this one the secondary and
the primary we will make kind of black
will adjust it in the second and the
secondary we will make red then we can
take the primary color select the head
here and drag it under the second slot
so you can see that fills up most of our
head here and we can do and then we can
take our secondary color and drag it
into the first
and you can see it fills out on the
actual tip of the barrel here and then
and we'll do the same with the base the
primary on the second slot and this
secondary on the first slot I know that
defies logic but that is fine it really
doesn't matter
cool so these materials are not looking
great let's compare it to our other turd
and make it look somewhat like that one
you can't go ahead and use exactly the
same colors but I like tweaking it to
fit this particular instance after all
it is two different turrets so let's
change the albedo here firstly to
something a lot darker and let's bring
up the metallic miss quad a bit and take
the smoothness on down just a tad I
think that looks pretty cool
then under our secondary color here I
want this to shine very brightly red so
in order to get more saturation in here
let's bring up the metallic miss and we
can bring this up fairly far and the
smoothness down just a tiny bit I really
like the feel of that yep I think that
looks super cool again spend more time
on these graphical things than I do I
just don't have time to tweak and and do
all that sort of stuff in the video so
I'll just continue here but feel free to
spend more time and also feel free to
not only use two colors you can of
course have different materials on the
head and on the base and you can also go
in and create your own textures should
you want to do that so let's just rename
this to missile launcher in one word and
let's now add to the base of this to the
missile launcher object let's add a D
turret script and we'll just change the
range here to something a far creative
something like 30 and the fire rate to
something like point two five that means
it will fire one bullet every four or
one missile every four seconds and then
we have some unity set up fields here we
have the enemy tag which is the same
then we have the pot to rotate if we
look under your standard turret we had
this empty object called pot to rotate
that basically allowed us to change the
rotation of our head here in such a way
that we make sure it always
points in the z-direction let's do the
same here because currently our head
points in the negative X I believe this
is yes it does and our Z is pointing
upwards so let's create an empty game
object under the head and let's reset
that so that will be centered at the
pivot using the local axis here make
sure you set the pivot and local up here
reset that there then we can drag it out
rename this one to part two rotate drag
our head under the part to rotate and
and then we can take our head and rotate
on the and let's see what we are going
to need here actually wait wait wait
something is wrong okay so let's drag
out the head again here we need to
rotate this of course to point in the
right direction here so that's 0 on the
X here and let's do negative 90 on the Y
there we go so now this is pointing in
the right direction and then we can take
our head and drag that under there so
now when we select our pot to rotate or
on our actual graphic is pointing in the
Z direction cool and then we can go in
here and we can right click create
another empty and this is going to be
our fire point so let's call this fire
point and we can maybe just shift to the
side view here shift to isometric view
by clicking in centre there and let's
drag this up and out to make sure that
this is centered and we'll have it be
spaced a bit out just so we are sure
that the missile won't overlap with our
model and clip through it and it will
look kind of weird so now on a missile
launcher we can take our pot to rotate
and drag it under pot to rotate we can
take our fire point and drag it on the
fire point and finally we can take our
bullet prefab and drag it under bullet
again now in the next video we are going
to create a separate bullet prefab which
is going to be a missile prefab and that
will have its own graphic and its own
settings but for now we'll just use this
standard one then we can take on this
missile launcher and turn him into a
prefab
let's uh click and drag him into the
prefabs folder to turn him into a prefab
and we can now remove these two turrets
from this scene the last thing that we
want to do is now integrate this into
our UI so we can select the turret and
actually spawn it into the scene and
that is very easy to do with this way
that we have things set up right now so
if we go into our canvas shop you can
see that we have a standard third item
and we can focus on this by hitting F
and then shifting 2d 2d tools there and
we have another chart item and all we
want to do is simply instead of having
this be another turd actually make this
a missile launcher item and we need to
change the icon we'll do that in just a
second and instead of calling purchase
dot another turret we want to configure
our shop script to have a function
called purchase missile launcher so
let's just um
click here to go to our shop object
double click on a shop script open it up
in visual studio and all we really need
to do here is a tiny bit of renaming so
if this will just get done loading
that's the build manager the shop here
you can see we have this method called
purchase another chart we just want this
to say purchase missile launcher it's
not going to make any difference for the
end user but it is good to always make
sure that your naming is correct
so purge or missile launcher selected
and you can see that this uh calls set
toward to build on the build manager and
uh it our inputs build manager and not
deterred prefab and therefore we want to
find the build manager it's under the
scripts folder I already have it open
here and we want to go here and rename
this instead of another turd prefab to
missile launcher prefab and the way that
I'm doing the renaming here is by
hitting ctrl our control R so control RR
if you want to be quick about it you
could also go right click and then
rename in some IDs it's called
refraction
and that will just make sure that we
rename it both here and under the shop
there nothing else you can of course
rename it manually and that just what's
all the coding that we needed to do it's
already in there we just need to add a
function each time we add a new turret
and add a prefab each time we add a new
turret cone so now that we've renamed
this method we need to relink the
missile launcher item button to that
method it's lost its connection because
of the renaming so let's find our
missile launcher item let's go into the
iron click event and you can see it
still has a reference to the shop but
it's missing shop that purchase another
turret so let's change that to shop duck
purchase missile launcher and now that
should actually be set up finally we go
to game master and we can see that we
have our missile launcher prefab in here
we want to drag our missile launcher
prefab there we go and the final and
this is the very final thing that we
want to do is change the icon to
something more fitting and in the first
video where we implemented the UI here
we discussed how you can go about
creating some icons of course already
created an icon for you if you don't
want to go through that so again go to
the assets pack instead of going on the
models we go and do sprites and we find
the missile launcher icon that's also a
PSD if you want to edit it and we just
drag it on your project panel change the
texture type to sprite and the format to
true color you can change the max size
to 512 but it won't make a difference
it's already 512 and hit apply and now
we can see it has a transparent
background and all we need to do is
select our missile launcher item and
drag our missile launcher icon under
that slide and we can maybe just make a
new folder here since we now have a lot
of icons called
icons and we can also drag our two
scripts on the D scripts folder and
everything looks so clean now and you
might think that this icon is a bit too
large you can either go in and edit the
icon file or you could just go down here
and change the preferred width and
height height to something like 90 and I
think that fits
much better so that was basically all
and now we are ready to play test so
let's hit play and see if this is
working firstly we cannot click anywhere
then we select our standard turret and
he should work yeah there we go he is
then we select our missile launcher and
click there and you can see that it's in
the game and the fire rate is a lot
lower and you can also see that the
range is a lot higher than with on the
standard turret it's now exactly double
as as large a range so that was all I
wanted to show you in this video I hope
you found it exciting I definitely did
the next one will have a look at some
explosions which is also really really
fun so without further adieu thanks for
watching and I'll see you in the next
video thank you so much to all of the
awesome patreon supporters who donated
in July and a special thanks to vixen
famous own Andrew K and locks game TV
these videos wouldn't be possible
