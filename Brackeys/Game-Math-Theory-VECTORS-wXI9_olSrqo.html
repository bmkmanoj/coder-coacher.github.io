Metta thank you so much for donating if
you want to support breakage yourself
you can go to patreon.com/scishow so we
want to welcome to the first video in
the patreon funded game math theory a
series that covers essential
mathematical concepts that you will
definitely run into during your game
development career today we will be
looking at vectors before we get into
how a vector is defined let's have a
look at why they're useful vectors are
often used when we want to move a
character around the scene let's say
that we want to move our character two
units to the right and one unit up what
we essentially do is create a vector
which we represent with an arrow that
points in that direction we can then add
this vector on to the position of our
character to make him move if we were to
write down this vector mathematically we
would write to one because the vector
moves to one the x + 1 on the Y we say
that a vector is defined by direction
and a length in our case the direction
of the vector is where we want our
character to point and the length of the
vector is how far our character should
walk in that direction if we wanted our
character to then move one unit to the
left we would make a new vector with the
coordinates minus one zero because the
vector goes minus 1 on the X and zero on
the Y however you will quickly notice
that the coordinates only show what the
vector looks like and not where we
should place it in the scene that is
because vectors don't have any inherent
position that allows us to draw it
anywhere we want it is only when we
combine it with the position of our
character that the vector adds anything
meaningful to our example now let's look
at another example where victors come in
handy say we have a scene with two
players player a and player B and we
want to find the distance between the
two well both players have a position
which means where they are in
relationship to the center of our level
in this example player a has a position
of two one because he's two units from
the center on the X and one unit from
the center on the Y likewise player B
has a position of 1/4 because he's one
unit from the center on the X and four
units from the center on the Y we can
now create a vector that points from
player a to player B to do this we
subtract the position of player a from
the position of player B this is done in
the easiest way possible by first
subtracting the X components 1 minus 2
equals -1 then we subtract the Y
components 4 minus 1 equals
three and the result is a vector with
the coordinates minus one three let's
try to draw this in our scene we can see
that the vector correct it goes from
player a to player B but how do we
calculate the length of this vector that
is in fact really easy the length of a
vector can be written as the square root
of x squared plus y squared note that
the length of a vector is referred to as
the vectors magnitude if you wonder why
the length of a vector is defined using
this particular formula you can try to
think of the vector as the hypotenuse of
the triangle created by the vector
coordinates and then use Pythagoras
theorem to calculate the length of that
side but you could of course just use
the formula as is so if we want to
calculate the distance between our
players we simply insert the x and y
coordinates of the vector into the
formula and voila the distance from
player a to player B is three point one
six units the same thing is extremely
easy to do in three dimensions as well
all the vectors now simply have a third
component the z axis which is also added
into the formula at this point you might
be thinking why do I need to know all of
this my game engine has an easy function
for getting the distance between two
points in space well an example of why
this knowledge might be useful to you is
the fact that it has just allowed us to
make a very important optimization in
our code say that we are making a racing
game and we have two players a and B who
are competing to reach the goal and in
our game we want to display who is
currently ahead in that case we might
subtract the position of each player
from the position of the goal to get two
vectors from our players to the goal we
could then get the length of each vector
using the form left from before and
compare them to find out which car is
closest however using the square root of
Raider can be pretty taxing on the
computer and doing this calculation a
lot of times during a game might lead to
performance issues since that we could
simply remove the square root and only
compare the remaining x squared plus y
squared this doesn't give us the actual
length of the two vectors but it still
shows what vectors greater than the
other which makes it perfect for doing a
comparison between the two so that is
pretty much all I have to show for this
video if you're interested in learning
more about vectors that's the link for
that in the description hope you enjoyed
the first part of game math Theory next
I hope to cover the magic of sine waves
if you want to support the series you
can do so on my patreon page thanks for
watching and I'll see you in the next
thank you so much to all of the awesome
patreon supporters who donated in August
and the special thanks to our and Metta
