everyone welcome to the third video in
going to D today we're going to be
taking a look at making some code that
will automatically adjust boundaries or
colliders to fit the screen size of our
users so aspect ratio and all of that
we're going to take care of it and also
we're going to make our players spawn
with a certain distance from the edges
so as always I've opened up unity and we
can just go ahead and get started so
first off let's actually create an empty
game object so go to game object create
empty or press control shift and that's
of course command shift then if you're
on a Mac now let's rename this to
underscore G and that's for a game
master and I like to create a empty game
object to handle all of the game setup
all of the score like and when when the
player scores a point restarting and
going to menus all that through AGM game
object which is just empty that's just
preference of mine and the reason why
I've put an underscore here is so that
it will stay on top of the other objects
in the hierarchy so first off let's zero
out the position that's just general
good practice and let's hit new script
and let's call this game setup so we can
handle all of our setup logic in here
and let's hit create an add double click
it and it will open up in mono develop
so let's go ahead and get started here
let me zoom in so you can see this a
little better and actually want we want
this code for performance reason to only
be run in the start function but just to
show you how cool this actually is the
calculations we're doing here I'm just
going to do it in the function update
and then change it later you can do the
same we could detect our camera we're
going to need our camera we could detect
that
once in the function start by searching
for it but instead let's just create a
variable that's better on the computer
so let's call this not seeing him
actually that's just called this main
cam and it's going to be a type of
camera then down here we're going to
type var top wall and this is going to
store our top box Collider which we want
to access later and also we're going to
store the bottom wall which is also
going to be a type box Collider 2d and
the left wall let's do that one and of
course you can exclude any of these if
you want if you don't want it in your
game it really depends on the game you
are making so here right wall and then
box Collider 2d okay great and now let's
also make some variables for the two
players when we want to access those so
play one of type transform and player 2
also of type trance form great so in the
function update let's make some space
here first thing we want to do is we
want to move each wall to its edge
location so we're just going to go ahead
and do that now
first off let's access the top wall dot
size so we can change the size of the
collider and one thing you should notice
is that I will just do the top wall
because there's a lot of typing and
random numbers and such so I'll just do
the top wall and then I'll copy paste
the other walls and I'll of course leave
them on the screen so you can fill in
the numbers yourself but you can also
download the script from brackish comm
that's way easier and I will of course
explain everything so Tomball dot size
equals new vector2 which is basically
just stores to float numbers the first
of which is going to be our
Green to world point and basically what
this means is actually let me just fill
this out first so it's going to have
something here it's going to have
something there and then it's going to
be comma one F and then round it off but
and we if we just say okay we want this
to be basically as long as the width of
the screen you would normally think
let's just do a screen dealt with then
so it will be the size of the screen
dealt with and then one F but the
problem is that screen dealt with
returns the width in pixels and we want
this to being unit so basically we would
have a Collider that all the sudden was
1920 if you're on Full HD units long so
it would scale all the way out here and
that's not really something we want so
an an easy workaround is to use a screen
to world point and we can do this by
accessing our camera and that will
automatically do this calculation for us
so let's type main can touch screen to
world point I don't know why monodevelop
didn't suggested there but it's
completely fine to do it and then we are
going to open up a bracket and inside
this one we are going to type new
vector3
and then open up another bracket and
here we're going to type screen that
with just as we did before and then
we're going to time it by 2 to f4 float
and then we're just gonna do comma null
F and 0 F again so basically we only
need this number but it needs to be a
vector 3 because that's how screen to
world point works but we only need this
number so that's the x value so we are
just going to do dot X and that also
means that the 0 F is here they don't
really matter the amount of those don't
really
so I just saw I was missing a
parenthesis there so just close up the
parentheses and then do dot X and then
comma 1f cool and then we're going to do
the center so top ball dead center
equals new vector to open up a
parenthesis and we want this to be 0 F
comma because we want this to be
centered in the width and then on the
height we again want to access the
screen height so men can touch screen to
world points and this is going to be
again a new vector3 and it's going to be
0 f comma screen oops
screen dud height comma 0 F close up the
parentheses dude why because we only
want the the screen height and it's X Y
and then Z so dud Y and then plus it by
0.5 F so right now you might be thinking
okay what's going on here what is what
and it can be really hard to keep track
off but basically we are setting the
center to be 0 on the x axis Oh Sorrell
horizontally and vertically we are
setting it to be just by the edge but
the reason why we are saying plus 0.5 is
that it will be at the edge but from the
center of the Collider
so we're just plussing with 0.5 because
that's half the width of the Collider or
the height of the Collider and so it
will only just be outside the screen so
now that this is working let's just see
if it is so save it out and hopefully we
don't get any errors so we don't and
let's drag in the main camera
and now it's time to drag in the walls
and we need to create those first so
let's just do ctrl shift and to create
an empty game object again command shift
and if you're on a Mac and let's call
this top wall there hit the 0 0 0 the
position that's important make sure all
of your objects doing this are at 0 0 0
drag it under the GM so if something's
not working that's probably why and then
let's hit add component physics 2d box
Collider 2d and there we go and you
don't need to send you set any of these
values because the script will do that
for us but just make sure that it's
trigger is not enabled now we can go
ahead and duplicate this and rename it
to bottom wall duplicate it again oops
that didn't register bottom wall
duplicate it again that's ctrl D command
D on Mac left wall and at last the right
wall there now select the GM object and
we can drag in first off the top wall
then the bottom wall we could also store
these in an array which is basically
just a list but as long as it's a
stationary number like this I wouldn't
worry about it and then a right wall
cool so now when we go ahead and play
our game we can see I've turned on
gizmos here just so you can see what's
going on these are the ones that are not
set up yet so this is the left wall
right wall and bottom wall but up here
we can just see barely see a line that
is green so that's the collider and if
we go into the scene view we can see
that it's up here once we have the GM
selected we can see it up here and if we
then control click on the main camera we
can see that it aligns just with the
edge of the camera and basically you
have to watch out a little bit when
check
if it's working this way because if you
just switch between the scene and game
view it musk unity might confuse things
especially with the left and right wall
so what you want to do is you just want
drag the game out so undock it then hit
play and now and then hopefully it will
show correctly yeah see now it's it's
all the sudden much longer and the main
camera is only here so the unity doesn't
know exactly how to display this but I
promise you it does work I've tested it
out in many resolutions and the collider
your way snaps the math is right so cool
this is working and the yeah let's just
go ahead and add the other parts to this
so let's go ahead and add the bottom
wall the left wall and the wide wall and
I'm just gonna copy this in here because
it's this is a lot of values it's the
exact same code just with by switching
around on a few numbers and and it works
for them all so go ahead and take a look
at this now pause the video and write it
down or go to brackish comm and there
you can download it as part of the
assets pack so cool let's continue I'm
just going to assume you've written all
of this down and let's round it off by
making the code for our player so let me
just quickly find my reference script
here so there okay cool so I have it on
my on the money to announce just so I
don't make any errors awesome so let's
first off access our player one and say
dot position because it's his position
we want to change and it's basically
only the x-axis so just say dot X now
we're going to say that this is going to
be equal to the main cam and then again
our favorite functions green point to
screen to well point there it is and
we're going to do new vector3
and we want this to be you can you can
basically make a variable for this but
I'm just going to set it to a fixed
number I'd say 75 is pretty good and
this is just the amount of pixels you
want the the player to be from the the
edge so I would say 75 pixels is just
enough and then come as 0f come as 0 F
and round off the two parentheses and
say X because that's the value we want
and now we can just round it up with a
semicolon and let's just make the other
player 2 so player 0 2 dot dot X equals
main kam dot screen to world point and
open up new vector3 and in here we're
going to do screen dot width minus 75 F
so basically if we imagine that the the
anchor crunch starts out here over here
on the left hand side we are moving it
with the screened up with over to the
other side and then subtracting 75 so it
will be about here so now that we have
subtracted the 75 we can just say 0 F 0
F close off the 2 and say dot X because
that's the value we want and round it
off so now when we hit save everything
should be working we can head into unity
and we have errors yay let's see what
does s have I'd said oh I think I've
typed something wrong yeah these are
seen cam I want to change these two main
cam that's just
I called them seen came for some reason
the last time at this is so may incur
main campaign cam main cam there we go
now we can go ahead and hit play and
some more errors okay yeah we need to
assign the
the players of course so now we can head
over and select our GM object we can
drag in our player let's rename this
guide to player zero one and we can go
ahead and duplicate him rename him to
zero two and let's just drag him over
here just to position them about where
he's going to be I mean our script is
going to do this for us but just so we
know like how it would would go and then
let's change his controls from move up
on W to the right to using the arrow key
so let's see if we can find the arrow
key so up arrow for up and move down
that's going to be down arrow let's see
if we can find it here that is down
arrow so now they have different key
bindings what would have actually been a
good idea was to make a prefab out of
those yeah okay what the hell let's just
do it so let's drag this guy down player
1 duplicate them move them over player 2
and change the change the key bindings
here yeah I'm sorry it's a great idea to
make prefab out of these kind of things
because it's just going to save you
trouble later on when you've made a
modification and all the sudden you
realize that you are you're the players
still way back so move down and now we
are ready to assign them to the GM so
player 1 drag that in there play it to
dragging them there hit play and now
when we go into the scene we can see the
beautiful green lines here we can select
it and we can see it's made a triangle
around and also you will notice that our
player has now snapped to the position
and the cool thing is that if we now
resize the game view it will change in
real time and adjust itself accordingly
and mmm and this is just a fancy feature
to show you how it's working we can
still move up and
moving out up and down with the other
player so all of this is moving or
working and what we can do now is we can
simply go back to the script and change
this to function stats so that the code
will only be called once because there's
really no reason to to update this
unless you know the screen size would
change and I don't know why it would do
that so that was basically it for this
video thank you for watching and I'll
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
