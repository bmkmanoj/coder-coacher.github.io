everyone and welcome to video number
five and make a game a cool little
series on making a video game in unity
so in this video we are going to add
some shadowing to our game we are going
to add some real-time shadows we're also
going to talk a bit about lights and how
they work and then we're going to move
on to making our ball die or at least
react whenever he falls down from his
platform so whenever the player fails
and unfolds to infinity we're gonna
we're going to stop that and make him
maybe respawn instead so basically let's
start out by adding the lights here so
as always I've opened up unity and we
left off last time with a ball rolling
around a little bit more exciting level
but as you can see once we roll up here
there's there are no more lights and the
reason why we are still able to see
what's going on up here is because of
what is called ambient light an
ambulance is also called fill light and
it's basically how bright and what color
the light is whenever we don't have a
light so it's it's basically the color
of the shadows and and what we can do to
adjust this is we can go up to the Edit
hit render settings and then you should
see a setting called ambient light and
if we click this and drag it all the way
down we can make everything but the lit
up parts black this won't affect the
skybox of course and this is great for
horror games but not really in a moody
fun little game like ours so let's just
leave it this at a gray color like it
was before but you can go ahead and play
around with this you can also tint it a
bit blue if you would wand them or you
want the color from the sky reflecting
it I might tend it just a tiny bit
the blue side there and maybe make it a
bit darker so we can have some more
lights in there without it getting too
blown up but now that we have adjusted
this let's go ahead and look at how our
light is set up so currently we only
have one light in our scene and that is
a point light emitting and you might
have noticed that if we go to the
right-hand side here we can set it to
have shadows though once we do unity
will will will tell us that we need the
pro version and so we if we are just
going to consider that we don't have the
pro-bush version so let's just disable
this light and if we now want some
shadows in there
in unity 4.2 they added real-time
shadows to directional lights in the
free version so that's really great it
helps your game look much better and
it's it's really an awesome feature so
let's go ahead and go to game object
create other and now directional light
so we can get some shadowing in there
and if we have a look at our skybox it
looks like our Sun is coming from
somewhat behind us so we can just go
ahead and play around with this until
you find it looking good and I don't
think this is too bad you don't want to
come in straight from the camera and
this is not going to be our only light
source but let's just maybe bump down
the intensity to something like zero
point three or four let's try four yeah
this is looking pretty great now and we
can go ahead and add shadows so go under
the shadow type and hit hard shadows and
set the strength is fine at one and the
resolution is fine as is but what we can
see now is we have a shadow on our ball
this is not that apparent because it
doesn't have that many objects to cast
the shadow upon so what we can do is we
can make our ground a little wider and
this is where it comes in handy that we
have made the ground a prefab because we
can now we
can simply take the scale of this set
axes and change this to two and then
just hit apply and it will change all
the other ground objects too so now when
we play our game here we can see that we
have some nice shadowing coming from the
bowl and and this looks much better so
great now that we have this in place
whoops we can go ahead and add some more
things to our game one quick note is
that if you think this gets too blown up
from one side you can duplicate the
directional light and rotate it to the
other side and then just bump down the
intensity and this will make it look a
little more realistic because now we
have some light on the other side too
but for now let's just not include that
let's just let the ambient light take
care of it okay so let's rename this
light to Sun and there we go
one thing you can do is if you want
something to be in the top of the
hierarchy and you know you're not going
to be using it in a script you can just
make two spaces and it will go right up
there but I like to making an to make an
underscore instead and it will also just
be in the top of the hierarchy so you
can always find it this is great for
things that is always there and isn't
changed so so that's let's see a nifty
little feature great so let's save our
scene file save scene and let's delete
our old light there we go okay so what
we are going to be doing now is we want
to make a make it so that our ball will
respawn whenever it falls from one of
the platforms and we are going to do
this by selecting our ball hitting add
component going to new script and whoops
so I added script without renaming it
let's just try that one more time
selecting the ball
hitting add component new script and
let's call this bulb health of type
JavaScript and hit create an ad now we
can go ahead and duplicate a double
click this to open it up in monodevelop
let me just explain because there are
several ways to do this first off we
could have let's see if I can drag this
there we go the first option is to use
what is called a trigger Collider so a
trigger and what a trigger does is it
Wow that's extremely bad but basically
what a trigger does is it it normally
uses a box Collider so if we have a box
here and what it does it is detects
whether or not something enters the
trigger so if something should enter
this it won't collide with it it will
just go straight through
so if our ball enters this trigger we
can use a script checking that called on
trigger enter ontriggerenter and and
what we can do with this script is that
we can use this to call some code so if
something enters the trigger and if what
enters is equal to a player or the ball
then we want something to happen so on
trigger is equal to the ball then we
want something to happen then we can
make something happen down here in code
so we can play some code in here this is
what we want to happen right but but
this has some faults because if our
bowling ball is falling so fast that
that the trigger won't detect it and
that sometimes happens then we have a
problem because then our ball will fall
to infinity so what we are going to be
doing instead is we are going to be
using the position of our ball and
that's
by using transform that position
transform that position and and what
this will allow us to do is we'll we'll
just check for the Y position of the
bowl which means the up and down values
of the up and down and if we can just
check that if that value is equal to and
then we can say let's say minus ten or
less than so less than or equal to I'm
sorry more than or equal to minus 10
then we want something to happen so
instead of using a trigger and get this
complicated set up we will just check
for the position of the ball and see if
it's below what we wanted to and we can
use a variable for this so what we're
going to do now is we're going to go to
a ball health and we're going to delete
the function start we're not going to
use that and then we are going to make a
variable called let's say max fall
distance and this is going to be equal
to let's say minus 10 now in our
function update let's make some space
and in here we can type if and then this
script is going to be sitting on our
Bowl so all we need to do to access it
is type transform and then we will get
the position and rotation and all of
that on it on the object the script is
sitting on so we're just going to be
using transform then dot position and
dot Y because we only want to check for
the y axis and if this is more than or
equal to max' fold distance then we want
something to happen and let's just first
off check if this is working and we do
that by typing in debug dot log
and then opening up some parentheses and
in here we can type test and close it up
and what this will allow us to do is if
we go back in our game we should see a
variable down here no errors and what it
will do is if we go to the console
window it will show this text this test
text it will show tests in here whenever
that is called so we can check if it's
working by hitting play and you can see
just when starting out we get a bunch of
tests and we really only want this to be
called
whenever we get below that distance and
the reason why is because this should be
more than or less than or equal to so
like that so if we are minus 10 units
down or less or more then we should call
this debug log your test and the reason
why we use the less than is because this
is in negative numbers and that's why
can be confusing sometimes if you don't
get this right away it's completely
understandable just save this and we can
hit play and if we hit clear view we can
see there are no tests and if we now
roll our ball down and wait for it and
there you go the test variable is called
so now once we get below the 10 units it
calls the test and basically here we
would make our ball jump back to what
every checkpoint we had reached but
since we don't we haven't made
checkpoint yet what we are going to do
is we are simply going to replay the
level so we're just going to make it
load up the same level and we do this by
using application dot load level and
load level all this needs is the name of
the level so we are just going to type I
think I called it level 1 let's just
check in the project pane yeah I call
the level
once of whatever you called it we'll
just copy paste that in there and close
it up so if this is still unclear what
we're doing is we are making a variable
which is the max fold distance and this
is equal to minus ten because we don't
want it to get more than ten units down
and then we check if we get below that
distance and if we do we will reload the
level we are on
so now let's save this and this is not
going to work but let's try it anywhere
you so that's it play and make our ball
fall down and what's going to happen now
is well actually this worked and that's
that might be because and this is our
first level if this isn't working and
it's saying that you have to assign this
level then what you can do is you can go
to the edit I'm sorry the file then
build settings and what you have to do
is you have to add the scene into the
build settings here so just hit add
current and this does work because we
only have one scene in there but if we
had multiple levels it would throw a
never so simply we just have to make
sure that all our levels are added and
if you add more than one you can just
drag them around to change the order in
which they're played so just hit add
current and yeah we can see it working
so now we can try out our level we can
see it's beautifully lit up all the way
and let's say we don't make this jump
OOP that's unlucky well then we can just
replay it great so that was pretty much
this video I hope you enjoyed it I know
it was a lot of scripting and we also
got some light in there and it's looking
much better so I thank you for watching
and also I would really like to see what
you guys are making so please go ahead
and treat to me at practice
sweet dot-coms let me just write that to
you here so you can get it on writing so
break ease treat not calm so at
breakfast
