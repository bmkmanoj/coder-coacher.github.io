everyone and welcome to this video on
setting up Visual Studio for unity so in
this video we are going to firstly
install Visual Studio then we are going
to set up unity vs which is a unity
package that nicely integrates Visual
Studio with a unity allowing us to use
bunch of awesome features which I will
talk about in a sec then we will install
a cool plugin called strippin which i
use all the time then we are going to
set up my preferred Visual Studio
settings and finally I will show you how
to install styles or themes because
let's face it your color scheme is the
most important thing that's what kind of
makes you look awesome compared to the
other program is just using the default
one cool so why would you use Visual
Studio well if you're on a Mac you can't
visual studio is windows only so if
you're not on a Windows computer you can
just skip this if you are however you
can pretty much just get used to visual
studio right now I mean it's the most
commonly used ide ever so you will
encounter a problem that should be
solved with Visual Studio at some point
in your programming career and therefore
it's a good program to get used to also
visual studio is much more solid than
monodevelop
at least that's my opinion I think
monodevelop has way too many parks way
too often then so Visual Studio this is
just a solid piece of software also
Visual Studio allows you to insert
breakpoints evaluate variables and
expressions use code Wizards kind of to
generate code or to browse code we can
install plugins it has intellisense
which is the Dakota diction a solution
that Visual Studio uses which is
actually pretty great so there are many
advantages to using Visual Studio
awesome so let's get on with installing
a Visual Studio on a Windows computer
so what you want to do here is you want
to head on over to visual studio comm
and once you get here you will very
quickly notice that there are a bunch of
different versions for visual studio it
comes with the community version express
version Pro versions all that kind of
stuff and when you first get here you
might be tempted to just download Visual
Studio community right here and we
aren't going to be downloading wishes to
the studio community but we are not
going to be using the 2015 editions
those are currently in preview which
basically means a public testing phase
and so if you want to go with the
completely a solid build go to free
Visual Studio in the top right hand
corner and then download Visual Studio
community from here great so once you've
downloaded the Visual Studio installer
simply click it and run to open it up
and installing an uninstalling Visual
Studio can be extremely slow and
therefore I've done this beforehand but
you should be able to simply go through
an a fairly simple installation process
and then you should end up with a
pattern that says launch Visual Studio
and I'm going to do that now one thing
that you will notice during the
installation period is that it will ask
you which modules you want to install
and then you can basically disable
deselect all of them you will only need
core Visual Studio components however on
my system right now I have installed the
C++ module because I do a fair bit of a
super splash coding on this computer but
that's completely up to you you can also
import all of the web stuff for whatever
that you you think you need cool so once
you start up Visual Studio you should be
met with the screen that looks somewhat
like this and once you have that open we
can basically just close it again for
now so and then we can move on to the
next step so I'll just dunk this on my
secondary monitor here and take a look
at what to do next
now we will integrate a unity vs so in
order to do this let's open up unity I
have a unity 4.0 5.1 installed it just
came out yesterday cool so I've made
this kind of test scene to just show you
how unity vs actually works and you can
see here in my assets that I have three
folders I have an edited folder a script
folder and the standards assets folder
and under the script folder I have a
single script called drag rigidbody and
that just currently sits on this cube
that I've made and it simply allows me
when I play to drag around this cube and
yes this is the script from the
standards assets bag so if that's
something you're interested in you can
simply right-click and import it cool so
in order to implement unity vs you are
going to have to download something
because what most people do here is
they're going to edit preferences and
then external tools and then they simply
select visual studio th C but that's not
going to work so what we can do instead
is we'll go to unity vs comm and unity
vs was actually created by a company
called syntax tree which is now required
by Microsoft so they are now working on
it internally which is pretty cool but
and the tools are still available at
this website so simply click Visual
Studio 2013 or whatever version you
happen to be using and simply click that
and it's going to do download about ten
megabytes often install it here you can
see it's downloading there and I'm just
going to cancel that and then instead go
into my downloads because I've already
downloaded it beforehand you can see
here and I'm simply going to click that
to run whoops now I started the download
again I want to show that in folder
instead if I can get to it here here we
go so I'm just going to double click
that and run it and I will just close
down these tabs again and then hit next
and you can see again I've already
installed this
simply run through the installation
process it's very easy and then you
should be done however it's quite
unusual with this installed it that
basically nothing nothing happens when
it's done it looks like nothing has
changed that's not entirely correct
because if we go to this PC going to
look at disk C then Program Files and
this is going to be 32 bits so times 86
and then we scroll down to what's s
Microsoft you should say Microsoft
Visual Studio tools for unity and inside
of this we have the 2013 version and
finally here we have a diet unity
package if you cannot find this on your
system simply search for Visual Studio
2013 tools so you will just go like this
and it's it's right there you can see I
already all also have the 2015 version
if I happen to should be happening too
if I happen to need bad so now let's
double click this to open it up in unity
and just like any other unity package it
will just import when you click a button
and it should basically be done already
so now we have a folder here called
unity vs and after a second it will load
again and say that the system our
version specific DLL was created and
that's very important that it's created
successfully in order for this to work
also to make sure that everything is set
up correctly go to the visual studio
tools tab that should appear up here if
not you can refresh it by simply
pressing a tab up here and it should
refresh the bar and then hit generate
project files just to make sure cool now
you can also see under edit preferences
external tools that it says unity via is
that open file and that it has these
arguments awesome so what we can do now
is we can go to visual studio open in
visual studio and it's going to boot up
our project inside of visual studio and
we
should in a moment be able to see our
full unity hierarchy right here so you
can see that we have the editor stuff
the plug-in stuff and the normal stuff I
should say separately but we can just
collapse these two and under the assets
folder we have scripts and darontay we
have the dragged rigidbody at CES and we
can even see what kinds of fields or
methods it's implementing all of its
members there so and once you click on
that you can see that you can browse the
code and you should have Auto completion
enabled also so if I were to go like
transform dot precision you can see that
that's working just fine and it even
gives us runtime errors and feedback so
that's super cool awesome so that was
actually the whole first part of this
tutorial with just attaching this editor
to unity and that's certainly something
we've done you can also see that if I
was to close this script here but keep
Visual Studio open we can go under the
cube and simply double click on the
script here and it's going to instantly
boot up in Visual Studio so they are
indeed linked actually really used
utilizing these tools like attaching to
unity up here and error handling and
breakpoints and all that that's for an
entirely different video and they
already have a lot of that kind of stuff
on the block and such so I'm not going
to go into it here instead I will show
you the next point here which is
installing stripping so when you're
using Visual Studio and unity together
you might notice that Visual Studio
saves the files with a different lined
ending format than other editors you've
been using or especially if you're using
version control there might be some
conflicts so the solution to this is
just using stripping which is a plugin
that will allow you to specify a certain
zero
end of file or AOL end of line format
for saving files because end of line
formats can really matter a lot when
using some files in some contexts on
some systems it's a whole separate
science but really just install this
plugin so what you want to do is
basically just search for stripping i
will also have all the links in the
description and hit download and then
we're going to download the add-in only
installer for vias 2013 and we can just
click that and it should put some files
you can see here it says that it's
already installed but it should put some
files into the documents visual studio
add-ins folder and you can of course
check it if they're there but it just
worked for me the first time and you
might need to restart visual studio in
order for it to appear once you've done
that you should be able to go to tools
strip and then just select unix LF now
you can also convert files matching a
regular expressions a regular expression
but I recommend just selecting UNIX and
get it over with that way so cool and
next up on our list that was a quick one
it's my preferred settings so I have
this whole set up with visual studio
where I like to keep my stuff and kind
of how it does coke completion and all
that if you would like these settings
and the style that I'm using the using
you simply need to go to the link in the
description there should be a download
link to this bracket vs or bracket vs
that zip file where if you open this you
will see a brakus v8 brackets vs vs
settings file and we can just copy this
to the desktop and you can see it right
here and this contains all the
information that visual studio needs so
in order to actually use this we simply
go to tools then
import and export settings then import
selected environment settings go to next
we don't want to save our current
settings then we want to go in here we
want to hit browse and you can see here
that we have a folder for all of our
settings files so simply copy this path
go into a separate Finder window paste
the path and then here we want to copy
our practice and v/s settings so simply
copy those in there and you can see I
already have mine but I'm just going to
replace mine and now you can simply
select it in here hit open and then we
can hit next and you can see here we can
choose what modules we want to install
from this settings file so if that's
something you want to keep the way it is
you can go through I recommend just
doing all of it I haven't made any huge
changes but if you want to use the
standard kind of color scheme simply go
under options environment and then
uncheck fonts and colors cool so now
just hit finish and it should reload
everything here the interface and all of
the Preferences should slowly be added
and while it does this oh okay it's
actually already done so you can see
here the theme that I'm using it's it's
the moniker theme I believe and I've
made a few changes to it I think it
looks pretty nice and you can see that I
like to have the solution Explorer and
class view over here it's pretty
standard for visual studio it's only in
the unity version that they've put them
over here but then again now it's it's
completely up to you you can also make
the output here just go under the area
list whoops they have the error list a
bit bigger here all of that is up to you
let's just lay out awesome so now that
that's setup everything should be
working and the last thing I wanted to
show you was if you want your own
the scheme you can go to a website
called studio Styles dot es or studio
style ES and that should also be in the
description and here they have over 3000
color schemes so you can get exactly the
the one you want and you can of course
also very easily customize them if
actually just open up visual studio here
again should be able to see just how
easy it is to customize so if we go to
tool options then go under environment
fonts and colors you should be able to
see that everything is very easy to to
change in here cool so that was
basically it for this video I hope you
enjoyed it and let me know what you
would like to see next so thanks for
watching I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
