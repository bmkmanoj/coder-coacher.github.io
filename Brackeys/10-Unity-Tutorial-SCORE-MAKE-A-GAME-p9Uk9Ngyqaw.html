welcome to video number 10 and make a
game a cool series on making a video
game in unity so today we are going to
be making the score system for all
players so every time we pick up a coin
we are going to see some DUI on the
screen it's not going to be fancy but
it's going to be there that will display
the score so let's just go ahead and dig
right into it so as always I've opened
up unity and what we're going to do now
is we're going to first off select our
coin and know you know what let's that
because there are two parts to this
process the first is of course the coin
we have to actually change a variable
but it's a good idea to store this
variable not on the coin itself because
we will have multiple coins spread out
the entire scene and so instead we could
just make in a master game object that
will have this variable and that will
also take care of the GUI and then we
can just access that variable and change
that so that's what we're going to do so
first off let's make this master object
so let's go in the game object and hit
create empty a press control shift and
that's of course command shift then if
you're on a Mac and let's go ahead and
call this underscore GM and again the
reason why I put an underscore is so
that it will stay on top of the
hierarchy let's just precision all of
this by 0 0 0 that's just general good
practice and let's go ahead and add a
new component new script of type
JavaScript and let's call this game
master he create an ADD and let's double
click it to open it up in monodevelop
there you go whoops this
some of our previous scripts so if i
zoom in on this we can go ahead and get
started so first off we of course want a
variable and this variable is going to
be var and then we're going to call it
current score
it's I'm just going to call it this
because we might also want like a high
score a master score okay let's call
this current score like this and let's
go make this equal to first off it's an
integer and let's make it equal to zero
by default and what we can go ahead and
do is we can make this into a variable
we can access from other scripts and we
do this by typing static in front of var
so it's a static variable meaning that
we can access it from all scripts cool
so that's basically all we're going to
do in here what we would do next is we
are going to change this function to on
GUI because every GUI element is made in
the on GUI function but I'm going to go
out and talk about the GUI system in a
sec first off let's just make this
variable actually change so you will
notice that we can't see this in the
inspector so what we can just simply do
is go ahead and make a function that
will allow us to see it in the inspector
because static variables are invisible
and we would like to just know if it's
changing so to easily displayed let's
just make a normal variable that will
that will be shown in the inspector and
make it equal to the current spor
variables so let's just call this test
and make it default to zero and then in
the function update we'll just say test
equals current score and round it off
and now we should see a variable here
that is zero by default try again
and wait for it to pop up
should see it in just a sec it's having
trouble showing hmm and I can't select
other objects it looks like I might need
to quickly restart unity because
something has gone horribly wrong with
the inspector here it's just yeah I'm
just quickly going to reopen up unity so
give this a reboot I'm sorry but if this
is enough I it's I don't want to cut it
out so let's see if it's working now and
select our GM and there was so we have
the variable now I don't know why'd
acted so weird
and I don't know why I can't dark it
over here as I wanted to we can go under
the layout and just try a slight default
great so now that everything is back to
normal let's just go ahead and see what
this variable does right now it simply
stays zero no matter what we do because
we need to find our coin and
double-click the current pickup script
and in here we need to change the score
so we can see that we first off add this
effect then we tell the effect to
destroy after three seconds and then we
destroy the game object and we've even
added a add coin counter here debug
deadlock so we know that this is where
we need to do it in our code so let's
just delete that and now we can go ahead
and make the coin counting so it's very
simple first off you give the name of
the script that the variable is stored
in and remember we can only do this
because we've made it a static variable
so that's called game master then we say
dot and then we can just type in the
variable name which is current score and
then we can set it to something but we
won't just set it to a fixed value we
want it to be one more than before so
therefore we do plus equals say plus
equals oops which we'll add on the
number right after it
which current value and then we do one
because we only want to add one you can
you could make coins that are worth
let's say ten scores if it's a huge coin
that's hard to get or if it has another
color or something and then what you
simply want to do is you want to make a
variable called let's say coin value and
make this default to one and then you
can change the it in the inspector and
instead of one here we'll just do coin
value actually let's just leave that in
that's handy to know if we want to make
cool power-ups or something great so
let's see if it's working so what we can
do is we can select our GM and now
observe our test variable to see if it
changes and it certainly does it changes
to one so now that we know that this is
working we can go ahead and delete our
tests we can delete the function update
and we can make offers to you I now GUI
is a pretty serious discussion in in
unity basically unity have been
promising a new GUI layout system
something for so long as I can remember
but it should hopefully be done in the
near future
but the specifics we really don't know
and the reason why everyone are so
longing for this is that the current
system is well to say it out clearly are
really bad so basically there are
several ways to do GUI as is you can do
it completely through scripting which is
what we are going to do because this is
the quickest and easiest way you can
also do it using a an in-game thing that
unitive made cold it's the if I let's
see if I can even find it it's the Joey
UI texture that's not really a viable
option either and GUI is just hot in the
computer though if you are willing to
pay for a good GUI there is a plug-in
called an GUI that's just
ngo I like this on the unity asset store
and it is a little expensive but it's in
insanely well done and most
professionals use it around the world
and it's the same guy who made this
plugin who is currently working on the
solution for for unity but until all of
this gets cleared out let's just use the
good old a GUI system so in the function
on to GUI
where all the gooey code gets cold let's
type GUI dot let's do a label and we can
see that a label first off once a
position then it wants some text so what
we can do is we can first off get it
give it the position so let's do a new
rekt like this and open this up so new
rectangle and in here we want to do a
screen dot height and let's do x 0.5
comma screen dot with you could also
just do / - that's up to you and let's
close this off and then comma and then
the string name and this is just going
to be score and then close it off and
ended up with the parentheses or a semi
colon of course so now when we try to
play we get some errors first off we can
see that I've spelled height wrong
that's annoying height like that and
let's see if this works right so it says
that it doesn't match the argument list
and this is because we need to use ATI
that box of course so we make a new
rectangle and in here we also need to
declare the sizes so we need to do let's
try 200 by 200
first so now it should be working and
yes it is and before let me just show
you what it looks like and then explain
the code so now we can see the score is
down here and it's in a very weird
position and let me explain what's going
on so basically first off we say to make
a new rectangle first the position on
the X so this actually needs to be with
then the position on the Y so this needs
to be height and then the size on the X
and then this size on the Y and using
screen death with we can make it in the
center by simply saying that we we stand
in the left-hand corner then we go all
the way to the right with our screen
width and then we just take half of that
so that's in the center so I'm just
going to do divided by 2 here because I
kept distracted and it does the same
with the height and this way it should
now be in the complete center so if we
hit play it's not really and why is this
well unity Orient's itself using the
top-left corner so much currently in in
India in the century is the top-left
corner of our GUI element but we want
the middle of the GUI element to be in
in the middle and this is this is
logical so what we can simply do is we
can subtract half the width and half the
height and so the middle of our GUI
element will be in the actual middle but
before we do this it's easy to just make
these into variables so we can change
them inside of unity and don't have to
go back into the script all the time so
let's just make these into some
variables so we want them to be in the
center of the screen on the width but I
want the score to be just a bit from the
top of the screen so we don't want this
screen dead height instead let's make a
variable for that
so let's call this y offset let's call
it offset Y and let's just make this a
float equal to let's try 40 by default
now we can go in here and just type
offset Y then on the X we are going to
do another variable and we're going to
call this var size X of type float and
this is going to be equal to about 800
then we are going to do a bar size Y
also of type float and this is going to
be equal to let's say 40 now if we save
this of course we need to copy in our
actual variables so size X and size Y we
can go into unity and we can see all of
these properties appear and we can
change them in here but you will notice
it's still not centered we'll take care
of this in just a sec this is just to
get a general idea remember that
whenever you tweak something it while in
play mode the changes will disappear as
soon as you stop playing so either you
have to note them there's a handy
plucking on the S and store two or just
remember them so I'll try to make the Y
something like 20 25 25 is pretty good
and the Y is probably fine because we
want to add in some some numbers too
we could do something like 90 instead
actually we can go all the way to 80 I
think that's fine so 80 or 90 and the
offset Y I'm pretty satisfied with that
so 80 and 25 so stop playing and change
this to a and this to 25 and now we can
go in here and we can just use these
variable to subtract from so on the
screen dot width we can simply say - and
then we can do size X
and then divide it by two and now when
we save this and hit play the score is
in the exact century because we have
subtracted half of our x-value now let's
make this actually show us koi because
right now it just sets the score so
let's make it score : and then a space
and then outside of these parentheses
you need to say plus current score and
if you don't want it to say anything but
only display in the number you have to
have these two parentheses but without
anything in between so you still have to
leave them there but I wanted to say the
score so now we'd play and it says score
zero when we roll into a ball
it says score one and we have a
beautiful label there to display the
score so that's basically it for this
video I hope you enjoyed it and I'll see
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
