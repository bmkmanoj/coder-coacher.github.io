exciting to show you guys today
here's the brand-new desert environment
by Sam truck all the mounts are PBR and
highly detailed so you can easily use it
in your first person or third person
game the pack is now available at dev
assets calm as with everything else on
the side it's pay what you want
everything you see on the screen now is
rendered in unity in real time using
only the example thing that you get when
you download it we've been working crazy
hard on this tax time has put in
countless hours in each and every one of
these models so we hope that you guys
will support the project if you want you
can grab the pack from the link in the
description right away but here's the
sure to turn on how to get everything
working in unity in case you're in doubt
so to get started open up your browser
go to dev assets comm click on the FPS
environment here you can check out the
screenshots and read a bit about it and
when you're ready simply select the
price and hit the blue button it's going
to download as a zip file and when you
unzip it you should get this folder
inside that we have the models folder
which contains all the individual FBX
models as well as textures in case
you're using unity I recommend your
double clicking on the desert
environment unity package this is going
to set up and import everything
including an example scene into Yanagi
so you can check out all the elements
that makes this pack it does include a
few things from the standard assets
folder so if you don't have that already
it's going to import it
let's hit input
and you can see it created a desert
environment folder inside this we have
some stuff for the example seen all of
our models neatly categorized and most
importantly a prefabs folder which
contains all these different props and
models with material textures and
colliders already set up I'm just going
to go ahead and open the example scene
here and right away we get this
beautiful looking scene and if we go
ahead and hit play we can see all the
different moving parts in our scene we
have a nice moving camera script we have
the leaves of the trees here blowing in
the wind we have some lights particle
effects both for the fire and for the
dust blowing by if we dump into the
scene view here we can have a closer
look at all of the different models
again if you want to add a particular
model to your scenes when you go into
the desert environment go to prefabs
find them all you want in my case I'm
just going to take the generator here
and simply drag it into the scene you
can see that because we're using a PBR
workflow everything is just going to
blend right out the gate because
everything is so detailed and set up to
scale we should be able to just import a
first-person controller I'm just going
to go import package and then characters
we can instantly go under the characters
folder go on the first person character
and drag one of these prefabs in I'm
just going to take the rigidbody FPS
controller here drag it in I'm also
going to just move them up and rotate
them a bit then replace the current
camera with our main camera from this
scene because this already has some
nice-looking settings so just delete the
old one
make sure to reference the new one and
on our camera I'm just going to disable
depth of field we'll also just reset the
transform of our camera and move it up
say 0.6 and finally I'm just going to
set our field of view to something like
60 and when we now hit play we should be
able to move around the scene you can
see some of the objects even have rigid
bodies on them pretty cool right
that was pretty much it for this video I
hope you enjoyed the pack now it's time
for Sam and I to catch up on some lastly
