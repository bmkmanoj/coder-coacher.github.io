simple pathfinding using unities navmesh
features at the end we'll have a working
pathfinding system where the player can
click anywhere on the level and the
character will then find the shortest
path there to do that we'll be baking a
navigation mesh using the nav mesh
surface component which allows us to
define walkable surfaces for our agent
will then write a script to control a
nav mesh agent along the surface also
this video is sponsored by unity alright
let's get started so as you can see I've
set up this simple example scene in here
we have a player that's the green
cylinder here as well as a tiny level
the level consists of a ground cube and
on top of that some walls and that's
pretty much it
now the improved high-level nav mesh
components are available now as you can
see I've included them in my project
here you can use the link in the
description to get both the nav mesh
components as well as this example scene
alright so the first thing that we want
to do is bake a nav mesh this means that
we will define what surfaces are
walkable for our agent to do that lets
go to the hierarchy let's right-click go
create empty let's reset the transform
on this and let's rename it to nav mesh
let's then drag it to the top so we can
easily see it so this game object is
going to be responsible for baking our
nav mesh to make it do this that said
add component and we'll add in the nav
mesh surface component here we have a
few different settings but if we just go
ahead and hit bake we can see that right
away unity creates a nav mesh for us all
the blue tinted areas represent surfaces
that or aging can walk on and so we can
see that he cleverly avoids all the
walls we can also see that the agent can
currently walk on top of some of the
walls and that the nav mesh currently
treats our player himself as an obstacle
to avoid this we edit the include layers
here we can select what layers we want
to include when baking our nav mesh in
our case we don't want to include our
player so we can go select our player go
to the top right Wed set Slayer and add
a new layer and we'll create a player
layer will then select our player and
make sure to assign this new layer to
him then when we go back to our nav mesh
we can simply disable this layer when we
then hit bake we can see right away our
nav mesh simply ignores all player
now we can easily control what parts of
our environment we want to take into
consideration when baking a navmesh we
can also choose whether we want to bake
or navmesh from the render meshes
meaning the actual look of our level or
using physics colliders now I don't
currently have any colliders in my scene
so if I go ahead and hit bake we can see
that nothing really appears however if I
go in here and add a Collider to the
ground I'm gonna add a box Collider and
then go back to the navmesh and hit bake
we can see that this now shows up but we
can simply use the render meshes and we
bake that finally we have a setting at
the top here called the agent type and
right above this we have a drawing with
some different values if you go under
the agent type we can open up the agent
settings this is part of the navigation
window you can always bring this up by
going window navigation now we can
choose some properties for our agent and
these properties will affect how the nav
mesh is built right now it's just using
some default values for a regular
humanoid character but if we go ahead
and hit the plus sign we can create
another one this one is going to be an
ogre we can increase the radius because
he's probably going to be fairly big
we'll set that to one I could also
imagine him being pretty tall so we'll
set the height to three then we can
adjust the step height which is probably
going to depend on the length of his
legs I like to imagine that he has
pretty short ones and finally we can
adjust the max slope which is how well
he can climb angled surfaces let's say
that he's fairly lazy so he'll only do
about thirty degrees now if we were to
go back to the inspector and change the
agent type to ochre and hit bake we can
see that our ogre will have a much
harder time getting around our maze in
fact there are plenty of places that he
won't be able to get through I'm just
gonna change this back to humanoid and
we bake now we don't want our walls to
be walkable so to change this we can go
and select our walls and here we'll add
another component called the nav mesh
modifier the nav mesh modifier allows us
to change nav mesh settings for a given
object we could for example ignore it
from Build which means that if we re peg
our nav mesh it's just gonna completely
ignore our walls we could achieve the
same effect by simply assigning our
walls to a layer however we do want our
walls to be used we just don't want them
to be walkable so we'll deselect ignore
from build and instead used override
area this allows us to change the area
type for this object if we select this
you can see that we have three default
area types
walkable not walkable and jump as you've
probably guessed if we select not
walkable and we generate voila our
player can now only walk on the ground
finally we can choose what agents this
is going to affect by default this is
set to all but we can't be specific this
allows us to create areas of the map
that are different for each agent say if
you're creating an RTS game and you
don't want your regular units to pass
through fire but you want your fire
elementals to freely walk past it so
affected agents can actually be really
useful now that we set up our nav mesh
we are ready to start moving around the
player to do this we're going to add a
component to a player called the nav
mesh agent a nav mesh agent is a
character that can navigate around the
mesh here we have a bunch of different
settings we'll look into these in a
second but first we want to create a
simple script that will control a player
so we'll hit add component and we'll
create a script called player controller
let's say create an ad let's double
click it to open it up in visual studio
now before we start scripting let's have
a look at how to go about this so
controlling a nav mesh agent in unity is
actually really easy most of the time we
use a simple function called set
destination this allows us to input some
kind of position and our agent will then
automatically find the shortest path
there in our case we have a level and on
top of that level we have a player we
also have a camera that looks at our
level and we want to be able to click on
some part of the level and then have our
play automatically move to that location
to do that we'll look for some kind of
mouse input and when the player presses
the mouse will send out a ray to the
point where the player pressed will then
look for where this ray hit and we'll
get the position at that point and then
by using set destination on the agent
will have him automatically calculate a
path and move to that location so to do
this in code we first want to remove our
start function and inside the update
method we want to check if the player
presses the left mouse button to do
this will write if look under the input
class and will use a function called get
mouse button down here we can specify
what mouse button we want to check for
we want to check for left mouse which
has the index of zero we then close off
our if statement and in here we can
specify what we want to happen when we
press our left mouse button in our case
we want to use the current position of
our mouse on the screen to send out
array we can get the position of our
mouse by going input dot Mouse position
and this is our current mouse position
in screen coordinates but we need a
function that can convert this to a
position on the screen into array that
we can shoot out luckily our camera has
a function that does exactly this so we
need to go to the top here and create a
reference to our camera we'll create a
public camera let's just call it cab
then at the bottom here we can use cam
dot and then we want to access the
function called screen point array this
is going to take in our mouse position
and it's going to convert it to array
that we shoot out in the direction that
we click we then want to store this ray
in another variable so we'll create a
variable of type Ray let's also call it
Ray and set it equal to whatever we get
from this function and before we
actually shoot out this Ray we want to
have a variable that we can use to store
information about what it hits to do
that we create a ray cast hit and let's
just call it hit so now we're ready to
shoot out the Ray to do this we write
physics dot ray cast will feed in the
Ray that we want to shoot and remember
we want to take the information about
what we hit and where we hit it and
store it inside of our hit variable so
we'll write out and then hit this is
going to shoot out our ray but we don't
actually want to move our agent unless
our Ray hits something if we just click
somewhere where there isn't an object
then we don't want our agent to do
anything this is in fact really easy to
do because physics that Ray cast will be
true if we hit something and false if we
didn't so we can actually turn this into
an if statement at the beginning here
we'll write if and we'll make sure to
close off the parentheses as well and
then we can open and close
if statement so what we're doing here is
basically checking to see if we click
our left mouse button if we do we take
our current mouse position and create a
ray in that direction within shooting
out this ray and we are gathering
information about what we hit in the hit
variable and in the event that our ray
actually hits something we're going to
continue into this if statement and so
this is where we want to go ahead and
move our agent and whenever we're
working with the navmesh system through
script we need to make sure to include
so at the top here we'll write using
unity engine dot AI we can also go and
remove our two namespaces at the top
because we won't be using those and now
to move our agent we of course need a
reference to him so at the top here
we'll write public
nav mesh agent and we'll just call it
agent then down here where we want to
move our agent will write agent and he
will use the function that we saw before
called set destination and the
destination that we want to set is the
point that we hit
so hit dot point and that should be all
of the code that we need to do so if we
now go into unity we now have two empty
fields under the player controller here
we'll drag in our main camera as well as
our nav mesh agent component and if we
now hit play we can see that we can
click anywhere on our level and our
agent will try and find the shortest
path there in fact we can even click
again to change direction while the
player is moving pretty awesome we can
also configure steering settings under
our nav mesh agent here we can change
the speed let's set that to eight the
angular speed which means how quickly it
rotates that set that to 180 the
acceleration which means how quickly it
starts moving or changes direction we're
gonna set that to 15 and finally the
stopping distance is how close we need
to get to the end of our path before the
agent stops moving I'm gonna set that to
point one if we play now we should see
that the agent moves around a lot
quicker and we now have a working demo
yay that's pretty much it for this video
