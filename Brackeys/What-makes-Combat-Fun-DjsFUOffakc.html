whether you're killing
computer-controlled zombies in left 4
dead or doing PvP in DotA combat can be
both exhilarating and fun now what makes
something fun can be a hard thing to
grasp everything came across a great
article by mag Birkhead which tries to
break this down so according to mic
player actions in combat is made up of
three steps first step is to form a goal
you then choose an intention which means
how you want to achieve this goal and
last you generate the sequence of
actions needed to realize the intention
so let's say your goal is to kill your
opponent your intention could then be to
use your sword to kill him and the
action sequence could be to pull out
your sword walk up to your opponent and
hit a tag a bunch of times now this
example might seem obvious and if all
combat in a game played out using these
exact steps it would quickly become
repetitive and boring so what do you do
to make this more interesting is provide
the player with multiple valid
intentions if the player has multiple
ways of solving a problem and reaching a
goal they will start to feel that the
game has more depth but providing the
player with more options is not enough
in itself just filling up your games
with empty mechanics will make it feel
bloated and tedious now this is where
constraints come in constraints are used
to strategically limit the amount of
valid intentions that player has in a
given situation in other words we are
making different intentions more likely
of success based on three types of
constraints the goal the environment and
the opponent let's have a look at an
example where these constraints play in
so if you ever played what the four
craft you probably know that the Warlock
class used to be provided with a large
number of spells in general this could
be split up into two major intentions
you could choose to focus on the damage
over time spells or you could focus on
the direct damage spells what intention
gave the best outcome completely
depended on the constraints if you are
facing a warrior the best way to avoid
dying was to keep a good distance here
could use the insta casts damage over
time spells while running away and
making sure to stay out of melee range
eventually the warrior would run out of
health and you could start spamming an
insult of your choosing if you are
facing a major on the other hand you had
to use a completely different tactic
which meant changing your intention here
the damage over time spells weren't
nearly as effective because the mage had
the ability to remove them instead it
was more effective to burst him down
using the heavy hitting direct damage
spells this is a good example of where
the type of opponent you're dealing
changes the intention but there are
other factors that play a big role in
what intention to choose so råsunda
facing worry was standing above him on a
Ledge now we're dealing with an
environmental context here could freely
cast your direct damage spells without
any fear of the warrior getting close
and what the major isn't bothered by you
standing on the ledge environment still
plays a big role here because the
warlock has a lot of instant cast
abilities it makes it easy to pop out
use a bunch of abilities and go back to
hiding this makes it really hard for a
mage to hit you in terrain with many
obstacles because he has to worry about
line of sight on his slow casting
abilities now that got a bit technical
but I think it's a great example of how
you have to consider both your opponent
and the environment in order to choose
the correct strategy what's great about
combat that takes this into
consideration is that it rewards
experienced players because of their
ability to make calculated decisions of
course when you add this type of
complexity to a game it can be hard for
new players to get started because they
simply don't have the knowledge of all
the classes and abilities that go into
choosing the right intention I consider
this both a weakness and a strength of
many modern date games especially games
like dota or League of Legends are known
for being notoriously hard to learn this
can make it extremely frustrating for
new players trying to learn the game but
also really rewarding for the more
experienced players but we also see
newer games that go in the opposite
direction instead for writing depth by
adding more opponent types and abilities
these games may come at interesting by
focusing on the coal or environment a
good example of this is rocket League of
course the overall goal is simple you
want to score as many goals on your
opponent as possible without them
scoring on you but depending on the
placement of the players in the
environment your goal and intentions
change drastically or any of your allies
close to you what is the placement of
your opponents where are you in relation
to the ball these are just a few
examples of questions you need to ask
about the environment before you can
decide on a goal and how to accomplish
it but rocket League also uses a
particular element really well I'm
talking about urgency because the game
is so centered around being at the right
place at the right time speed becomes
very important some goals might not be
very urgent like getting in position for
a good defense and allow you to pick up
boost along the way though a lot of the
time situations are very urgent so if
you're racing to get in position to
convert a good pass in to scoring a goal
so with this in mind we also have to
take in consideration
like what speed is the ball traveling at
and in what direction and do you have
enough boost to make it in time in
general shooters take good use of the
environment to add constraints if you
think your opponent is waiting for you
around a corner you might decide to
throw a flashbang before running out and
shooting him if you know a sniper is
lying in wait you probably want to stay
away from open areas and stay largely
hidden behind cover
I find that analyzing games in this way
can really help narrow down what's
important when designing combat for
games within a particular genre it's
definitely something that I'll keep in
mind next time I'm laying out a level or
adding a new ability to one of my own
games so if this video gave you some
ideas on how you can make combat fun in
your games feel free to share your own
ideas on the subject in the comments of
course this video is a bit unusual in
that it focuses on game design instead
of the more technical side definitely
let me know if you like this format and
if there's anything I could do to
improve it on that thanks watching and I
will see you in the next video thanks to
all the awesome patreon supporters who
donated in September and especially
thanks to do demand hence have tuned
