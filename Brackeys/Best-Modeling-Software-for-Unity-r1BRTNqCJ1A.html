programs for unity Dunbar brackets I am
the CEO of brackets and in this video we
are going to take a look at choosing a
modeling program to suit your unity
workflow keep in mind that this video is
based on my own personal experience and
therefore you might not agree with me
entirely though this should help you get
an idea of what software to pick I made
this video because a lot of you have
requested me to do so now let's get
started with what I like to use I prefer
a piece of software in the little more
expensive region called autodesk maya
the firm autodesk is huge in the city
computer graphics and similar sation
world and I personally like Maya because
it's well documented Etna has very few
limitations and also it works well with
unity but we'll get into that in a
second first I want to show you how the
interface and the UI looks and so here's
how it looks and first thing you will
notice is there are a lot and lots of
buttons and it can look even worse than
this but I think that the interface is
pretty intuitive and they is a logic to
it so once you get into the mindset of
Maya you will start to figure things out
though it's definitely not for the
complete beginners so let's move on to
talk about how it implements with unity
so the good thing about Maya is that I
don't even have to export the model into
an FBX and then import it into unity you
can just save it in Maya format directly
like you could see min doing here and
then and then just load it up in unity
and it will work and if you want to make
changes you can just double click the
file in the project pane and it will
then open up in Maya and you can make
changes and Maya can be very hard to
learn because it has so it is so complex
and has so many features
so for complete beginners - often too
much to take in an alternative Tamiya is
another Autodesk program called 3ds max
and we'll get into that in just a second
first of all I want to show you how Maya
exports into unity so you can see here
that in can save in the maya maya file
with both messages textures animation
data and wreaking or bones so you can
make a complete character in maya and
just export them directly into unity you
can also export to the FBX which is also
made by autodesk and it will also store
all of the different data though the
DAAD maya works completely fine - so
it's a little easier to handle now let's
move on to the 3ds max max is really
great and it's often considered to be
more effective for creating low polygon
models which is what you need in the
game industry both programs are great
though and it really depends on what
sued YouTube the best let's have a look
at the interface this is how it looks so
you can see it looks a little different
in this picture I wasn't working with
anything at all so it does look a little
more scraped but I would think that they
are pretty much on the same level my
personal opinion though is that 3ds max
is a little easier to learn for modeling
purposes it is still really expensive
though just like Maya you remember that
you can get unlimited trial time on that
website on both Max and Maya
but watch out it's only for educational
purposes you cannot use it to make a
profit so here's where you can where you
can download it on their website and
it's only for educational use now let's
move on to see how it exports into unity
just like Maya you can
exported in its own file format with
both meshes textures animation data and
raking and it also exports to FBX so um
it's really awesome to work with unity
and 3ds max at the same time and awesome
free alternative to all of the Autodesk
stuff is blender then there is an open
source modeling program and game as an
engine as well that means that it's free
and I've worked with blender a lot of
them in the past this is how it looks
and I found the modeling tools to be
really great for the more serious
modeler because the interface is very
hard to figure out I think it's pretty
cryptic and I couldn't really wrap my
head around it and also it can be very
distracting with having a game engine in
the same program that you're modeling
because there are a lot of buttons that
you don't want to use and stuff like
that so I keep in mind that for the
again complete beginner blender is often
too much and though it is really really
powerful and let's move on and see how
it exports with the unity so you can see
that it can export in its own blender
format with with all of the dates are
needed though it cannot export to FBX
anymore on that feature was removed a
couple of updates ago anyway let's move
on to the more easy to use software and
here we have wings 3d which is also free
and it's really really focusing on
modeling it's it's pretty much designed
to do modeling only and therefore it's
the easiest to learn and the interface
is Parrish grapes you the user don't
have to learn hundreds of key bindings
to do basic actions like inserting an
edge loop or extruding a face everything
is pretty much done through the
interface and that through hotkeys and
key bindings
the downside to wings 3d is that it
could be a pairing to do with later on
basically the only format that works
between unity and wings 3d is wavefront
or what's known as obj you can see it
here and it works without texture data
animation or reking so it's only
modeling it sets on the Unity website
though that it should be able to export
to FBX though I've never been able to
make it work because the creators of
wings later remove the feature wings is
really good for doing stuff like texture
work it's not it's really no good for
doing stuff like texture work or
animation either so it's recommended
that you do this in a separate program
wings is with all of the flaws the
faster program to modeling that's just
how it is so it's very fast here we have
a picture of a model that one of our 3d
modelers made and this was done in just
60 minutes and I don't know if this
picture really shows all of the detail
that went into this but it will get you
an idea of just how fast you can work in
wings now moving on to an alternative to
wings 3d also for the beginner
we have cheetah 3d which is one of the
cheaper modeling programs and it reminds
me a lot of wings 3d though without many
of the floors cheetah 3d is easy and fun
to use
it costs only $99 and here is the
interface so you can have a look you can
see that the the interface is very
scraped there's not much to it and I was
able to learn how to use this for basic
modeling in about an hour or so so
that's really really great though it is
Mac only so that's a bummer e for the
Windows users that was basically oh yeah
let's just talk about how exports it
exports in the cheetah 3d format with
every piece of data that you can think
of and I'm pretty sure it also exports
to the FBX so that's great for the
exporting purposes it will work fine
with unity that's it for the modeling
software overview let's just take a
quick walkthrough of what we have talked
about so to sum up my is great for
modeling texturing rigging and animating
but hard to learn and expensive if
you're not a student 3ds max is much
like maya though it suits some people
better and some people worse you'll have
to figure that out on your own blender
is some free and very deep program for
doing modeling but some guests get lost
in the many features wings 3d is the
easiest of them although it has its
limitations and cheetah 3d is really
good for beginners but unfortunately
only available for Mac users good luck
in choosing the right one for you I hope
you enjoyed the video and I'll see you
in the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
