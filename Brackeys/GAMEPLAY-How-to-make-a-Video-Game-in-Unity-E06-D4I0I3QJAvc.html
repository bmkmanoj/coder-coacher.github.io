some actual gameplay it's what it should
look like when we're done awesome so
let's get started so what we're going to
be doing here is pretty much creating a
level by hand using a bunch of prefab
this is also to really easily create
interesting levels and fine-tune each
part of the level to a good difficulty
setting the problem with this manual
approach is that you cannot have
infinite levels you're going to have a
start and an end point if you want to
create never-ending levels
I really suggest you watch my livestream
on creating a dodge the block type game
in that video we randomly spawn
obstacles from a few spawn points
however making things procedural is a
bit more difficult it does require some
coding and unless you are very skilled
with it it leaves you with very little
customization when it comes to creating
more deep and interesting levels anyway
let's take our obstacle and drag it into
a project what we just did was create a
prefab of that obstacle prefabs are used
whenever you want to have multiple
objects of the same type in our case we
want to have a lot of different
obstacles in our scene what we can now
do is take this prefab from the project
and drag it in anywhere into our scene
the cool thing is that if we now go to
our obstacle and change the settings say
the sides on the x-axis you can see it
updating on all of the objects at once
I'm just going to undo that we can also
edit one of these objects individually
so it's like the first object here and
change the mass we're going to go up
here and hit apply and it should now be
applied to all the other prefabs so we
can see indeed the mass has changed on
those as well remember to always hit
apply whenever you've changed something
on the prefab that you want to be
applied to the others again I'm going to
put that back too and hit apply the
first thing that we need to do is extend
our ground plane currently we can go for
a little bit and then we're going to
fall off of course there are ways of
making our ground plane follow the
position of our players one common thing
to do when creating endless-runners is
not actually move the players but
instead move all of the obstacles and
environment pieces closer to the player
as the game progresses this way we can
actually just have a stationary ground
element but in our case we want to have
some cool physics and that looks much
better if we move the actual player so I
think the solution here is a simple as
just scaling up the ground let's take
the ground give it a scale on the Z of
say 10,000 let's also move it over on
the Z let's set that to 4980 it should
make sure it begins in about the same
place as our player now of course we can
begin sketching out our level
few things we can do to make that easier
for us the first one is getting the
right view in the scene you notice how
we have different axes up here we can
actually click on those to shift our
view to that axis so let's click on the
Y or we're currently in perspective view
if we click on the center cube we can
switch to isometric it's flattens our
entire scene and allows us to set up our
level in kind of a 2d view you can also
go up here and disable stuff like skybox
fog and flares you can circle all of
those on and off by simply clicking the
environment here so I'm going to toggle
those off the grid I'm actually going to
leave in here but if you go into gift
notes you can disable that as well we
can also take our ground go up to layer
hit add layer and we can add a new layer
called something like ground or
environment fling then take our ground
plane and assign that layer now if you
go up to the layers toggle we can hit
the lock next to the environment this
now means that if we deselect our ground
we can't actually select it within our
scene we can still selected in the
hierarchy of course but it makes it so
much easier to select the objects we
want in our scene so now we can delete
our two obstacles here like the first
one and kind of move it forward a bit if
we drag on the green square here it
allows us to move it only in the X and
the position you can of course go ahead
and move these in freehand but I prefer
doing things on a grid we can go edit
snap settings to configure how objects
snap to the grid I'm going to put two on
the X 2 on the Y and two and the Z and
just leave scale and rotation as is we
in just close this now and that means
that if we now move this object and hold
down control it's going to snap to every
two units all right so let's begin with
this in the center and then press
control D or command T if you're on the
Mac to duplicate the object and move it
over while holding down control and you
can just repeat this process to create
an interesting level
all right so you can see I've created a
tiny bit of gameplay elements here of
course I did this very quickly and I'm
not always the most creative when it
comes to level design but you get just
how easy it is to place obstacles into
our scene we do of course pump this up
with a bunch of different kind of
objects you can put collectible coins in
here obstacles that move back and forth
stuff to jump over or grow beneath
there's plenty of opportunity and the
best thing about it is just how easily
we can play test it let's try and hit
play and see how difficult this level is
the first thing that I'm noticing is
that my controls feels really really
slow now that's not really a problem
with the level that's more a problem
with our movement script let's see what
we can do to edit that let's select a
player and double click on our player
movement now currently in order to move
our player forward we're adding a force
and I think that works fine but when
moving to the right and to the left
it feels very non-responsive that's
because when adding a force to an object
over time it slowly builds up momentum
and when we then change direction we
have to wait for the object to build up
in our force to do so this is where
force modes come in usually actually
allows us to specify in which way we
should add a force and we do that as a
fourth parameter first we have the force
on the X then we have the force in the Y
then on the Z and finally we have the
force mode let's put a comma here and
let's input force mode dot we can go
through and read about what the
different forces do the standard one is
Force which adds say continuous force to
the rigid body using its mass the one
that we want is velocity change this
directly edits the velocity of the
object and it completely ignores its
mass so make sure to add this to both of
the add four statements let's now save
and hit back into unity and I know by
experience that when using with us we
change we need much smaller numbers I
think something around 100 should be
fine so if we now hit play we can try
that out it already feels much more
responsive but I think it could be
better one thing we can do to make the
movement feel more snappy is up the drag
drag is basically air resistance so the
higher the drag the more quickly our
object is going to be stopped by air
that also means that we need to amp up
our forces in order to move at the same
speed but it should make everything feel
more responsive because the object is
quicker just slowed down so let's up the
drag to something like 1 let's leave the
same side wave force let's actually put
our forward force up quite a bit let's
try it out at
it's happened if we now hit play
everything feels so much better I think
this is a good forward force and I think
our controls feel really fluent by the
way a cool shortcut is that you can play
the game by hitting control P or command
P if you on the Mac so the devil already
feels pretty fun or it's not too hard to
see that this particular part is a bit
too difficult let's just go in here and
maybe add a tiny bit more distance
between the first obstacle and the next
one and we'll do the same thing with
these let's try it out again much better
the final thing that I wanted to add in
this video is FARC currently we can see
all the objects no matter how far away
they are that's not too pretty and it
also makes the game feel a lot less
interesting the neat thing about this
game is that it feels like the obstacles
are coming out of nothing and you never
know what to expect well we know but the
player shouldn't so let's go under your
window and select lighting we can then
take our lighting panel and dark it over
here by the inspector maybe you give it
a bit more space there are a bunch of
settings here to play around with stuff
like the intensity of our ambient light
how to calculate shadows and reflections
and finally we have the fog let's go
ahead and enable that
let's also expand it this allows us to
set a color of our fog you can choose
pretty much any color you'd like and
definitely get interesting with this but
I'm just going to go ahead and use the
color picker to get the color of our
background that makes it feel like
everything is blending in towards the
sky we then up the density a bit I'm
going to set it to something like point
zero two so now if we maximize our game
view by hitting shift space Chris play
we can see that our game actually starts
to feel like a game the level is
currently really short though so I
definitely recommend creating something
a bit larger and again you have most of
the stuff in place here to create
procedural levels don't be scared to
experiment that was pretty much it for
