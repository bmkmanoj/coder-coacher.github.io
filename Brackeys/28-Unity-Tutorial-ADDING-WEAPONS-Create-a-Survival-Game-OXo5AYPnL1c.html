number 28 in our survival game series
done by Black Keys I am the CEO of Brad
keys and in this video we are going to
be importing three new weapons to our
game made by some cool people I'm gonna
talk about in a sec and this is what
they look like so here you go and so
we're going to be importing them and
we're going to be building the base of
our updated melee system basically it's
going to allow the weapons to move with
the animation of our arms and it's also
going to be optimized for the upcoming
inventory system so that's really
awesome so basically let me just start
out with explaining the idea of what we
are going to be doing so again I excuse
my drawing skills but here we go in
paint the base is this so this is a top
view of our player capsule just ignore
the weapon for now
and we can see the tomb two arms going
out here they are kind of squarey
okay so we have this point on the right
hand arm and this is part of the rake
and the rake is basically the skeleton
that allows for the arms to animate and
that's what I made in blender and inside
of the rake or the skeleton I made an
empty game object that would always
follow the base of our hand and so we
can actually parent weapons to this game
object and then it will automatically
follow the animation so that's what that
is and in order for us to do this and we
would like to instantiate weapons to
this point whenever we pick something up
or equip something from from our
inventory and such so we would like to
just be able to instantiate in the in
basically a serial position and a serial
rotation
so we don't have to adjust the position
or rotation of the individual weapons
and in order to do this I had to Center
the pivot point or anchor point in all
of the weapons and that's what I've done
here so the anchor point on all of the
weapons is where we want to hold it so
that should all be aligned and so we can
have all the weapons just simply snap on
so there and that's the base of what we
are going to be doing today so first of
all I would like if you could download
the survival game asset spec from our
website if you want to use the arms or
the the arms or the weapons I'm using if
you're unaware on how to do this you can
go ahead and watch our bonus video
showing just that okay so open up the
folder go and the imports and then under
weapons we see a folder called old
weapons this were the video - old
weapons the mason the sword we're just
going to be ignoring those as they are
kind of outdated and they would just
placeholder art and let's start by
importing the ayran maze and that's that
one and this was made by some mean Eibon
from blend control and if you're looking
for some great free modelling work he's
he's really awesome check him out so
let's start by importing that and we
have both a blend file and a FBX file
I'm just going to be importing the
blended file because this allows me to
quickly open it up through unity and
make changes but if you don't have
blender you can just use the FBX you'll
get the same result so let's open up
unity and just navigate to the right
folder here so that we have our player
and then undo our imports we can go to
the weapons and then we will make a new
folder create folder and call this old
weapons then select the sword and the
Mason Jets try
take them under the old weapons now
let's make another folder and call this
ayran maze double-click it and then we
can just drag in the iron mace blend
file and the three textures and we have
it awesome
actually I'll quickly rename this to
maze handle defuse and then mace head
defuse I just like naming it defuse
because there are plenty of different
texture types and these are diffuse
awesome actually the Tucker is not only
but that will just ignore that for now
ok so now we can just drag in the iron
mace and see if the scale is proper it's
not it's a little bit too big so let's
select the iron mace in the inspector or
in the project pane and then go to the
inspector and change the scale factor
down to let's try 0.7 let's try that I
really don't know that's still way too
big so let's change this to 0.3 that
doesn't look too bad let's try to move
it up here we'll just go with that for
now and then we can make adjustments
later ok so what we are going to do now
is we are going to apply the texture so
just hit F to focus on it then
right-click the animator and hit remove
component or you can just go through the
iron mace go under your animations and
uncheck import animation hit apply go to
Rick generic and hit none apply go and
your model and then I want to and this
is this is a matter of preference you
can easily import the normal so you can
calculate them and its really different
whether what looks best actually I think
for this one we are going to import them
now I think that looks a little
bit better but again that's something we
can adjust along the way now let's
select the iron mace and now we can
start dragging in some textures so on
the mace handle the dragon the mace
handle defuse and change this to
completely white on the mace head we'll
drag in the mace head defuse completely
white and the same with the stand drag
it in completely wide that's awesome but
maybe for the mace head we would like it
to be a bit more shiny so if that's the
case you could go ahead and change mace
head shaded time from diffuse to
specular and now we can get that
specular detail on just that part of the
maze and that's why we have split it up
like this and you can of course adjust
the shininess and such variables to see
how it reflects light and how it
influences and so that's pretty awesome
now I like this a lot so let's now begin
to actually add this to the arms so what
we can do now is we can select our arms
hit F to focus on them then go under the
arms and now we will start browsing the
the rake so the armature and there are
going to be a lot of game objects under
this but you really can just ignore all
of them except for the ones I'm using
you so an armature master in arm right
because we want to crip to the right
hand I'm right hand right and then the
hold right and that's that's the one
we're going to be using though you will
notice if you just drag the mace under
the whole dried and then just zero out
the position and the rotation is not
really looking too great so what we can
do is we can make an empty game object
under the hold right that will be called
melee and we can make and we can rotate
that and so we can have all the weapons
be rotated if you don't understand this
yet that's
completely fine I'm sure you will figure
it out along the way so let's make an
empty game object by either going to
game object create empty or press ctrl
shift n let's call this melee and this
is basically going to be a route for the
whole melee system let's drag it under
the hold and let's drag the iron mace
under the melee now let's make sure the
melee is centered zero zero zero zero
and also that the iron mace is centered
on the melee zero zero oops that was
nine zero zero zero and zero now we can
take the melee object and just rotate it
and if you want you can also snap by
holding down control rail while rotating
and this can just allow for some pretty
nice snapping and now we can go in and
fine-tune this so I would like it to be
more to the right it's very very much at
an angle right now and maybe a bit back
like this zoom in some more so we can
see what we're doing move it a bit bit
upward and a bit out and that doesn't
look too bad let's see how it looks in
game so go in the game
and then hit play and we can see that
the maze is behind the hand even though
in our scene it looks just right and
that's because if you have watched
tutorial 20 number number 26 I believe
where we take care of weapon clipping we
made a secondary camera that will always
make sure our hands are drawn so that
they don't want clip through other
objects if collided but we we have to
add our weapon here to that layer so
what we're going to do is we're going to
go under melee and then change the layer
to draw always and let's say
yes change children and this will also
change our iron maze or anything else we
have on the media object though I'm
pretty sure if you drag something under
there now you'll still have to change
the layer okay so now let's have a look
again hit play and that looks really
awesome I think we could maybe scale
down the maze a bit to see more of the
top but that's really up to you I'm just
going to leave it here for now okay cool
so next up we are going to import yet
another weapon so go back to the weapons
folder hit create folder and then let's
call this X and this X was made by one
of the guys that we're working on your
game a really talented male called eagle
and we're going to have a link to his
portfolio as soon as we get it up but
that's the one there so let's go under
the weapons here under the X and then
select the blend file and the X diffuse
and just drag it under the X there let's
stop click it and there we have it so
let's drag this in and we can see this
is really really back so let's just go
ahead and select it in the project pane
change the scale factor to something
like 0.09 let's try with that just
guessing where we have it we have it
there so let's focus on it that wasn't
too bad actually I kind of like that
scale in my it's still too big yeah so
let's go and do use 300 point zero six
and that looks pretty good maybe 0.05
it's alright if the weapons are a little
bit too small it looks better when you
can see more of the weapon I think but
again it's up to you it's a matter of
preference of course
so now selected in the project pane and
then you can see let's see if we want
this
to be automatically imported I think we
would like to calculate this one yeah I
kind of like that better but we'll see
when we once we get the textures on go
to rig none and just try again then go
to animation and uncheck import
animation and hit apply ok great so now
that we have those set up let's get it
to fit our hand there so now we can just
go ahead and drag it under our melee and
we can remember to change the layer to
draw always then go to the position zero
add the variables also rotation zero
them out and now we should see that they
align though I see there are a small
problem here and what we can do is we
can simply take our melee object here
and just rotate it that way so now it
should be pointing forwards and when we
input our knife the blade should be too
great so you can see that these weapons
automatically align and so if we were to
disable the iron maze it's not looking
too bad of course he's never going to be
holding it just perfect but I think that
is really close okay so now let's drag
on the diffuse texture and change this
to completely white and there we have it
now we have our X in game also and
that's awesome okay so now let's let's
just quickly see how it looks in game
not too bad
also you might want to see that these
follow any kind of animation we're doing
so if we go under our animator you will
be able to see the setup we made in
making them in the last two tutorials
and if we had play we can do stuff like
whoops this is not working so what we
can do is we can go this might be the
wrong controller I've selected so let's
go into the arms hit the arms controller
there
much better and also remember that
Beckenham has a box so that's just
uncheck apply lube motion and now we can
see the animation playing and when we
hit the hit 1 you can see it start
swinging the weapon the same with hit 2
that looks great and when we run it also
follow the hands so that's awesome and
that is working great so now under the
melee let's import the last weapon so
let's go and do imports weapons and then
create new folder call this knife and
the knife was made by me and I am really
really good at modeling I think it's the
best one definitely ok so the knife here
are select the blend file and the knife
diffuse texture and let's just drag it
under the knife folder double-click the
knife folder to open it up there we have
it and then that's I don't know about
the tangents levels yet we'll see about
that
and the skill factor is probably off
though so let's try to drag it in there
no that's right
kidding okay so we can just bump down
the scale factor quite a bit let's try
0.1 that doesn't look too bad let's
focus on it guess we'll have to have him
hold it before we can really see but
that's actually not too bad so for some
reason this already has the texture
applied but you can of course go ahead
and just drag it on there change this
completely wide select it in the project
pane go on the rig select none' hit
apply animations uncheck import
animation and the model there ok so I
think the tangents are actually not too
bad though I don't really like this
shattering by the edge of the blade so
let's go ahead
and hit calculate and that should get
rid of it yes it did great now we can go
ahead and just drag it under the melee
and you know the progress just
throughout the positions throughout the
rotation and now it should look just
right and if we disable the axe we can
have a look at it in-game and whoops we
forgot one thing so like the knife go to
layer draw always and now it should look
just right
actually this might be a little bit too
low on the hand so of course what you
can do because this is a blend file is
you can just double click it and it will
open it up in blender and that's awesome
so now we can just move it up a tiny bit
in edit mode which won't affect our
pivot hit save and this is course done
in the version you're downloading and
now it should be perfectly centered yeah
there we go so that was basically it for
this video guys let's just quickly maybe
go ahead and make some prefabs out of
these if you want to I'm not going to do
that but you can do it if you want and
in the next one we are going to be
affecting the animation through
scripting so we are going to be learning
how to get this to play in game and we
are also thinking about doing some full
damage tutorials and maybe and then of
course the inventory system and upcoming
is also some more combat and there's a
lot of exciting things on the way don't
know when don't know how but uh it will
get some time so stay tuned and thank
