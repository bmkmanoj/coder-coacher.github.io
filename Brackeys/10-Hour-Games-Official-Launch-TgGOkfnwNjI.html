official launch of tener games I've been
working on this project for a while now
and I'm glad to finally get it started
before I explain to you exactly what ten
hour games is let me explain why it's
awesome you should participate in 10
hour games to inspire new developers
while putting your own skills to the
test many developers including myself
tend to spend way too much time thinking
about what games to make and how long
it's going to take to make them 10 hour
games is not a competition but a paper
away for people to stop thinking and
just get cracking on whatever game they
want to make I hope that people will be
able to try out a bunch of ideas and
discover more efficient techniques for
future projects
hence the tight deadlines so 10 hour
games is all about getting creative
collaborating with other developers
growing your skills and just having fun
the rules are simple
start a 10 hour countdown once
development kicks off and export the
final build when the timer runs out you
can use any software if you're liking
unity UDK game maker or whatever you can
also just pause the countdown and
continue at a later time as long as you
stick to the ten work hours of
development the idea of the event is
that it's not a competition but a way
for people to bring ideas to live in an
entertaining and educated way though to
kick things off I will feature the first
five games submitted and if you make
something really cool you have a chance
to get featured too if you feel you have
unanswered questions please visit
brackish calm / 10 hour games to read
more about the event you can also play
my own submission at brekkie Starcom /
flappy cow that was pretty much it so
good luck and I'm looking very much
forward to seeing what you come up with
thanks
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
