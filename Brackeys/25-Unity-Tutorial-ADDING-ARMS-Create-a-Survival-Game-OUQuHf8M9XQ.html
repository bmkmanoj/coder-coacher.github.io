number 25 in our survival game series
Tampa brackets I am the CEO of dry keys
and in this video we are going to take a
look at importing the arms for our game
I am included some in our survival asset
pack which we are going to take a look
at in a sec this video is just going to
be about the basic importing and setting
things up and then in later videos we
are going to focus on scripting the
animation to work with our game and
we're going to do this using the built
in unity mecha name system which was
introduced in unity 4 okay so let's get
started so if you want to use the arms I
have made or I've made a part of but
we'll talk about that in a sec then you
can download the survival assets from
our website and if you don't know how to
do that then you can of course go ahead
and watch our bonus video explaining
just that so when you have important and
extracted them you should be left with
this folder and if we open it up we can
go under imports then arms and here you
can see a few files I've included both
the blender file and an FBX file I
recommend you use the FBX file for
importing into unity but it's really up
to you what you want to use also the
texture which is of course UV unwrap so
it looked really weird here I've
included that in both a JPEG format for
just importing into unity but also a
Photoshop format if you want to create
different versions of the texture so you
can have a guy with gloves you can have
a guy with no gloves you can have darker
skin color whiter skin color and so on
and then I have a credit text document
because I actually didn't create the
model for this or the RIC those two
things along with one of the animations
were made by EI FG
and you can check them out here and also
I have a link to the license that
including how you can use this but
really all there is to it is that you
can use it commercially but you have to
create it the author so you have to say
that this was made partially by EI FG
don't need to mention me at any point
but feel free to do so if you want to
cool so now we have that out of the way
let's go ahead and import this into
unity so I have kind of made a I've kind
of set up a scene to show you what it is
we're going to be creating in the next
videos however many that might be so let
me just load up that scene and you can
see we have the the arms holding a sword
and if I go ahead and play the game
let's take a look at what we've got so
we have some punch animations and it is
completely random which one it plays
then we have the ability to switch
between different weapons so we can
switch to this one and then the hands
will actually hold the weapon and it
will follow us around and now if we
attack it plays different swing
animations and this can be used with a
variety of different weapons we also
have some new weapons coming soon so we
don't have to use these quite ugly ones
I made a back in the day so that's
basically what we're going to be making
now let's open up our original scene you
so you're back to normal and let me just
go ahead and explain what it is we are
going to be doing with this painting so
again
excuse my amazing drawing skills um but
but this is basically how everything
works together in unity when it comes to
animation and that's what it's really
about um so we have a player and
parented to a player we have our main
camera
this this you can see if we open up our
play we have the main camera under our
main camera we currently have the melee
this is something we're going to attach
to a game object in in our arms which
have made specifically for this so that
we can just parent a weapon to that and
then it will follow the animation but
that's something we're going to look at
in a second I haven't included it in our
painting yet but basically we have the
main camera and parented to that we're
going to have the arms so they will
follow us around no matter what we do on
the arms we have a component called
an animator and this animator is what
helps us this is what makes the engine
include makin em on the animator we have
two things we have an avatar which is
which defines how the rig is set up so
which bones and which bones are what so
basically if we have a hand bone the
avatar will help you need to figure out
that that is a hand and and so if we
were using a complete humanoid character
so a full character we could also read
target animation but that's a bit more
advanced then attached to the animator
we're going to have a animated
controller and this is what we are going
to use to play animations and blend
between them so we are going to do a
little bit of scripting but really most
of it is done using the controller so
this is just a quick preview of how a
controller might look and that's again
something we're going to cover later so
I won't go into that great so let's
import the arm so hit the project pane
hit create and then folder and let's
call this arms original and then double
click that to open it and now we can
just drag in the FBX file along with the
arms to fuse
there you go and this might take a
little while send it since it is pretty
advanced geometry it is game really
still down so now we have the arms five
here and you can go ahead and rename
that if you want but I'll just leave it
if we decide to make new versions in the
future and we have our arms diffuse
texture the diffuse texture is fine as
is so we're not going to play around
with that though our arms five we want
to change some settings so if we just
drag them into a scene you can have a
look at how they are now and they are
really tiny they are really really tiny
so let's go and select them in the
project pane and then change up the
scale factor let's try 0.4 and this is
really just something you have to play
around with whenever it comes to
animated and rect objects I don't like
changing the scale inside of unity I
really like only changing the scale
factor that looks much better
actually um we can go ahead and adjust
that once we get them in the view so
we'll just leave that for now maybe they
need to be a bit bigger no that's fine
okay so a mesh compression we want that
off normal tangents that is import
calculate and the material sure we can
do that under the rig this is pretty
important we want set this as generic
and the root node should be the arm
armature and then master so this one and
this will just help unity solve out the
animations and help it fade better so
that's really important you choose that
if you made the rake yourself I'm pretty
sure you know what what to pick so let's
hit apply on that and it will re
importance once again there we go so now
we can actually see it is in kind of a
battle stance there so that means that
the animation is working because
this doesn't look all kinds of weird
normally or not in doubt when something
is not working so let's hit the enemy
and if you don't know what bone it is
really just play around with it you
can't do anything well around let's go
into the animations are tapped now so we
want to of course import animation and
you can just leave these compression and
position errors and such as is so the
default take I see that's just an idle
but not really an idle we want we want
the normal idle here and the Iowa with
repin so we can go ahead and exclu
exclude this default take it might not
be in the blend file actually but let's
just exclude it from here so select it
and then hit the minus sign so now it
now it's gone and all these settings are
basically used for defining whether or
not an animation should loop and also
saying what kind of Clips we have so if
you made these animations yourself and
didn't create separate actions for them
that's what they're called in blender
then you might have to go in and define
what start and end frame the animations
have and that's really just about
selecting them and dragging around with
these sliders and such okay so let's
just preview the different animations so
you can see down here we have a preview
so I'll just drag that up a bit
drag it out so that looks good and we
can change the preview speed up here so
let's just make that one and let's have
a look at the idle that looks very fine
pretty subtle and soon we should start
seeing the fingers animating a bit there
so that looks good then we have the idol
with weapon now our hands are closed and
we can see that they bounce up and down
that doesn't look white right
so it's outside of the range of the soy
steak so let hits clam let's hit clamp
range that didn't change anything so
let's hit lube post and now it looks
good
awesome let's do the same with the idol
so clamp range and Lube pose and now
when we skip ahead to the end we can see
that it animates beautifully okay let's
have a look at the punch left clamp
range and that loops perfectly and the
punch right climb range that looks good
too
then we have the run animation clamp
range and whose true and remember you to
loop the pose that looks fine too then
we have the swing one clamp range and it
loops the swing to clamp range and it
looks perfect cool so this was just
setting up the import settings now we
can go ahead and hit apply and it being
ports awesome so what we want to do now
is we want to take the arms drag it onto
the main camera under the player then
maybe cero out the positions and now we
can go ahead and drag out the game view
here or maybe drag it let's see you can
go ahead and make it bigger like that
make it a separate window and now we can
adjust the position of our arms so if we
hit play now you can see that doesn't
look too bad let's actually go ahead and
disable our melee weapon so I'll just
drag that back so our melee system here
go ahead and disable that let's focus on
the arms a bit more we could also get it
to play and animation by default which I
think we should do so you can difference
the apply weird motion if you're having
a problem where the animation just jumps
or Wiggles or is laggy then try
unchecking this or checking it back on
because there are really still some box
with the Meccan em system and that
usually helps so you are going to get a
lot of errors or silly things happening
really just google it and try to figure
it out this is not an easy process okay
so the arms 5 now let's create a
controller for this and remember the
controller is what makes it actually
animate so this is what controls the
animation and the blending between them
so let's go down in the project pane hit
the right click hit create and then
animator controller and now let's rename
this to arms controller and now when we
select them in our scene view and drag
it in there we go we should be able to
double click this arms controller and it
will open up the animator so let's
maximize this and you can always get
this by going to window animator I like
to have it at the bottom so I can see
what we are doing in the top of the view
here so now let's just quickly get in an
animation here so we can see what is
happening let's just throw in the idle
on our animator so what we can do is we
can go through our project and then open
up our arms and you can see the
different stuff that is our arms and
then we could drag drag in one of these
animations so just take the idle for
example and drag it in but what I'm
going to do instead is go under the
animator right click create state empty
and a state is really just on well it's
better to explain it with examples a
state could be standing
it could be running it could be
attacking and such so it's really just
what the play is doing right now
and so we have an animation to display
that so this state is going to be called
idle or play isn't doing anything and
then the motion
that's the animation so let's hit that
little button right there and go into
the assets and let's find while there
are plenty of idle animations there so
it's good that we have the path at the
button so button so we can see where it
comes from and we want the asset arms
arms 5 fpx so that's the one we want
uncheck the foot I K and now when we
play the game because this is set to
default we can see that our arms are
playing the idle animation we should
however you see this animate we should
see a progress bar for that animation
and again this is just about unchecking
the apply wield motion and now we see it
there so you can see how far into the
animation we've got cool so that should
loop just fine now let's bring in our
arms quite a bit something like that
that looks a lot better I still think
they are quite big in the view whoops so
let's maybe bring them down a bit and
bring them closer yet and that's much
better so let's just maximize this and
have a look that looks really nice but
this is just preference or like them
being in these sides and at the bottom
of the view so it doesn't distract the
player but really just play around with
it until you get something that looks
nice let's just have a quick look and
see whether or not this loops right so
when the blue slider you here goes all
the way down we should see no bumping it
loops just fine
cool what we could do now is we could
apply the texture to get them looking
much better so under our arms we have
the arm amateur and this is just all of
the different bones and it just extends
out almost into infinity then we have
the mesh and then we have some objects
that are used to control the armature I
recommend you leave these be else you
are going to get some ropes my phone
went off there I recommend you leave
these be else you can get some annoying
areas in the console saying that they
are missing so just leave them okay so
if we select our unmess let's go ahead
and take a look at the material here and
so we can just go ahead and drag on the
arms to fuse texture there and change
the College completely wide so so now we
should see the textures working just
right that looks really great okay cool
so now that that's working I just want
to give out some cool tips and tricks
because you might experience what is
called clipping so if I just move these
even closer to the camera like this
maybe that's going to get it oh I moved
the whole camera there so just the arms
I'm just going to try to show an extreme
case there we go
this is called clipping and this is
whenever our mesh goes in within goes
within our camera render bounds so right
now our arms is too are too close to the
camera for it to render to adjust the
clipping planes which is exactly this
so how near an object can be for the
camera to render it we can select the
camera and go to the clipping planes and
then bump in the
the near variables so let's go to
something like 0.03 and this is just
much better now we can see the whole arm
though you might notice it notice a
problem with this we can now see the
cylinder that are attached to the
players so we can see this cylinder and
I would like to keep the cylinder there
since it's really nice for just quickly
finding the player and so I just want to
it to be invisible in game and to do
this let me just undo the position of
the arms here so they won't be all weird
there you go and then adjust the
clipping planes again so 0.032 hide this
in game what we can do is we can create
a separate layer for them so now let's
go ahead and select our graphics this is
the cylinder and let's go ahead and go
to layer and then hit add layer and
we're going to call this player cylinder
I've already done this earlier when I
wish we're playing around with this so
play your cylinder and then go back to
the graphics and select the layer so
play your cylinder now we can go under
the main camera to what's called culling
mask which is now set to everything and
if we then uncheck the player cylinder
we can see that the cylinder stops
drawing in game so now we have it
working and we have it positioned and
you can also have the arms get as close
to the camera as you want so that's
basically it for this tutorial guys I
hope you enjoyed it this was just
getting the arms set up to work in its
most basic form in the future we're
going to take a look at animating them
and making them work with weapons so
look forward to that thank you for
watching and I'll see you in the next
