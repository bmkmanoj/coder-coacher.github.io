started with your first video game what
you see on the screen now is what we're
going to be making through this
miniseries it's really simple and Acadie
but it's always easy to add more
gameplay elements and cooler graphics at
a later point right now let's just jump
into it let's begin by installing unity
if you've already done so you can just
give ahead in the video first we need to
go to unity 3d comm when we're here
we're going to click get unity now and
we can see all of the different versions
of unity unless you're a really
experienced developer and working in the
team I definitely just recommend the
personal version you can see that it
comes with all engine features all
platforms updates and it's solely
royalty-free so you can use it even to
create commercial games the other stuff
here is mostly some in the cloud
features and of course the ability to
customize your splash screen so let's go
ahead and hit download now let's also
download the Installer and it should be
very similar on both Windows and Mac go
ahead and open the file you just
download it so that guess and then we
can just skip through the Installer I'm
going to choose 64-bit if you want a
newer computer you should do the same
and this here is really neat this is our
shoot to customize what parts of unity
that you want to download because unity
might be fairly large I recommend you
download unity the documentation the
standard assets if you're on the windows
definitely check out Microsoft Visual
Studio tools for unity this will give
you a much better text editor then you
can of course choose the platforms that
you want to export to I'm just going to
select Mac and web PL we'll just go next
choose the folder to install to and it's
going to download unity and install for
you let's take a while let's hit finish
so you can see I'm using genetic 5.5
which is currently the newest version
but don't worry unity rarely changes
things really dramatically so now we can
just hit new to create a new project and
a unity project is basically just a
place to host all of our code and acid
it's pretty much our entire game before
you build it let's give it a name and
here you can decide whether you want to
build a 3d or 2d game however this is
pretty much just going to change the few
settings inside of unity that we can
change at a later point really really
easily so this decision here doesn't
matter too much for now let's just keep
that 3d let's pick a location for a
project and hit create
so is what unity looks like right when
you open it up you'll notice that I have
a dark skin for unity that's because I'm
using a paid version but other than the
color of the editor that's not going to
make any difference throughout the
videos so let's begin by exploring the
user interface so in the middle here we
have this scene view you can use the
mouse wheel to zoom in and out you can
use the middle mouse button to pan
around and if we hold down alt and
left-click we can then pivot around the
center of our view over here we have the
hierarchy this displays all the
different game objects that we have in
our scene
you can see here our scene is currently
untitled and it has two game objects the
main camera and the directional light
notice that when I click on an object
say the main camera the inspector will
display properties for that up here each
one of these collapsible things here are
called components components are what
makes objects do different things but
we'll get into that in a second you also
have the project panel down here which
shows all of our different game assets
that we can then drag into our scene
making them appear in the hierarchy you
can totally rearrange unity in any way
that you would like and drag around
panels and really go creative with this
but remember you can always go to the
top right corner and select default and
it's going to reopen to the default
layout and any window you don't already
have open you can go to window and
select it from here so let's start
building our game first off we want to
create a ground plane for a player to
stand on to do that let's go over to the
hierarchy right click you can also go
into create and select 3d objects keep
this spawns a new cube into our scene
again we can use the movement controls
to have a look at it we can always click
the focus on it by hovering over the
scene view selecting it and hitting F
now the cube currently is somewhere in
our scene and it's really hard to get a
look at where so what we'll do is just
go over to the transform here right
click and hit reset and that just
centers it you can see the position is
now we're on the X 0 and the y and so
you're on the set and gives it a scale
of one by one by one again hit F to
focus on it so if we go into a game view
we can now see our cube through our
camera if we want we can take our game
view here and dock it to the right so
that we can see both our scene and the
game view at the same time then we can
take our camera here and we can readjust
its position and you can see that
updating in real time I'm just going to
press ctrl Z to undo that and then going
to select the cube and scale it up let's
give it a scale of 15 on the X we keep
it at 1 on the Y and give it say 100 on
the Z if we zoom out now we can see just
how huge this ground plane
we can then go and rename it to ground
and we can simply drag on the blue arrow
here to move it over something like that
just so it starts about at the same
point as our camera then let's create
another object so right-click go 3d
object and then cube again let's reset
the transform so it's centered on the
scene we can then drag on this green
arrow to move it up let's again hit F to
focus on it and we can see that we now
have our new cube here standing on the
ground this cube is going to be a player
so let's go ahead and rename him to
player and it's also make him a bit more
visible because right now everything is
pretty boring white to do that we need
to assign a material to our player and
we create a new material in the project
panel let's right click down here go
create and then material will name this
material our player and then Matt
foreign material but that's optional
that's it enter now we can adjust
different properties on this material
stuff like how metallic it should be the
smoothness of the material and the color
up here so we'll make this some kind of
bright red and what we can do is then
simply drag our player matte onto our
cube and you can see it updating in
real-time so simply let go and it's
applied and any changes that we now make
to this material are going to update for
our player I think our camera is a bit
far away so let's also select our camera
and move it a bit closer again we can
move it over by simply dragging on this
arrow move it up a little bit and that
looks a lot better
so now if we were to hit play and
actually run our game not much happens
that's mostly because we haven't done
any programming yet and so we can't
really control the player but we also
need to add some physics into a game
right now if we exit play mode take our
player drag him up here and hit play
again he's just going to float in the
air he's not falling down the reason why
is that we need to tell this game object
to interact with the unity physics
system to do that we go out of play mode
and add a new component in our case we
want to add the physics rigidbody
component now when we hit play we should
see that our cube falls to the ground
and indeed it does right now it falls in
a bit boring way so let's try and rotate
our cube a bit to make it more
interesting to do that we switch to the
rotation tool notice how all of the
different tools are up here right now we
have the move tool selected we can also
shift to rotate
scale and then this one is for
manipulating 2d graphics which allows
you to easily do all of the different
things at the same time you can always
switch between these really quickly by
using Q W R and T so we're going to
press each rotate and I'm just going to
kind of rotate it in a random way here
so if we now hit play he's going to fall
down and we can now see that he has a
lot more advanced physics applied than
we were able to see before
so I'm just going to undo that rotation
by pressing control bit and I'm also
going to move him down here we can also
try duplicating him so let's press ctrl
D to duplicate let's move this one up
and over a bit and see how they interact
with each other
awesome so one really important thing to
understand is what is making these
objects behave this way and the answer
is of course components so if we now
exit out of play mode and select the
player here we can see that he has all
of these different components the first
one is something that you will see on
all game objects called the transform
component which just keeps track of
where the game object is in space how
it's rotated and its size you can see we
can adjust all of these and the game
object will be adjusted accordingly and
also if we go ahead and drag on the game
object you will see the transform
component updating the rest of them
though are all optional we have the mesh
renderer down here which is responsible
for drawing the object on the screen
then we go ahead and disable that it's
actually going to disappear it's still
in here you can see it's still in the
hierarchy and it still has this green
box and we can move it around but until
we enable the mesh renderer it's not
going to be visible then of course we
have the box Collider
without this we wouldn't be able to
collide with all the objects if I go
ahead and disable the box Collider and
then hit play this should just fall
through the ground but if we then go
ahead and re-enable the box Collider
you can see that it's now able to
collide with everything so remember to
get realistic physics we both need a
Collider and a rigidbody and in order to
see it we need a mesh renderer I of
course skip the mesh filter up here
that's not because it's super advanced
it's just that this is only responsible
for a very simple thing and that is
choosing the shape of object right now
you can see it has two cube selected we
can easily go in here and change it so
we simply click on the little bowl here
then we can change it to a capsule a
cylinder a plane a sphere and so on you
will notice that it's distorted but
that's just because we messed around
with the scale so we
change that to 1 and you will notice now
that it's a sphere of course a box
Collider is still a box so if we want
this to behave like a few years we'll
need to remove the box Collider so
right-click a remove component and
instead add a sphere Collider and notice
how I'm just using search here that just
makes things a lot easier so let's just
enter that and you can see now that it
has the sphere Collider so if we go
ahead and hit play it acts like a sphere
and this is of course more noticeable if
we move it over so that we can see it
hitting the box and it's going to go and
roll off our ground plane another thing
is you can also adjust values while
plane we could take our player here and
we're still playing and move them around
it might be a bit buggy sometimes when
using the physics system but we are able
to do it we can even go in here and say
disable the ground plane or three
different stuff like that but just know
that any adjustment that you make while
in the game and running are going to go
back as soon as you quit playing so make
sure not to do any important adjustments
while playing or at least remember your
settings oils you're just going to have
lost progress so the final thing I
wanted to do is just delete the bowl
here and maybe make this a bit prettier
by changing our sky box to do that we go
and select our main camera and as the
skybox here we're going to change it to
solid color and let's make the color
here a very wide grey not the most
exciting thing in the world but I think
it looks pretty simplistic and cold by
the way the way I just maximize the game
view here is something you're going to
see me do a lot of times that's by
hitting shift space finally to save your
game we can go ahead and hit ctrl s or
command S if you're on the Mac or go to
file/save seems that we need to name our
seen something and seems in unity are
basically just levels so we'll just go
ahead and call this one level one and
hit save you can see now that the scene
appears down here in the project panel
if we had multiple scenes we would be
able to shift between them by simply
double-clicking to load that level up so
that was pretty much all of the handy
tips that I could fit into this video I
know some things are probably really
confusing but really the best way for
you to learn some of this stuff is by
just messing around with it yourself and
then of course in the next video we'll
delve into some actual programming that
