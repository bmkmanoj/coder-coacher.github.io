everyone and welcome to part 7 in make a
game a cool series on making a video
game in unity so basically you should be
seeing two things on your screen right
now first of which is my twitter
username that's Breck he's tweet please
go ahead and tweet to me if you make
something cool using these tutorials so
if you've used them in any way please
tweet pictures or a download link and
there's a chance you might be featured
in the next video so I'll start
featuring projects and you'll also
you're also seeing a preview of what
we're going to be making which is
pickups or collectible items in this
case we're going to be making a coin so
we're going to do a little bit of
scripting and a bit of visual stuff also
so it's half half cool so let's just get
started so as always I've opened up
unity and first off let's create the
pickups on the visual side of it so
let's go to game object create other and
select sphere and we should see it
appearing here but let's just Center it
in our project so we know where it is so
0 0 0 in the transform then move it up
here and move it to the side just so we
have a good look of what's going on also
if if you don't see any shadows or
lighting
go up and click the Sun here in the top
of the scene view to get the lighting
turned on because what we're going to be
do doing is we're going to be making
this look really shiny and that means it
will not be affected that means that if
our light is not that powerful it should
still be shining somewhat so we are
going to be using lights let's rename
this bowl to coin and let's first off
change the shape of it just a bit so
let's scale it down on the x-axis to
something like 0.3 I'll just make it 0
point
three exactly so you can follow along
and we can already start seeing it
looking more like a coin and what we'll
do now is we will delete the sphere
Collider so right click on this and hit
remove component and basically what will
happen now if we hit this is we go right
through it and that's not really
something we want we wanted to disappear
as soon as we hit it so we're going to
add a new Collider we're going to press
add component physics and then box
Collider and you might be thinking well
this is not a box but the type of
collision we're going to be doing here
is simply checking whether or not our
ball has collected the coin and that
does not require any more complicated of
a shape than a box simply because we
can't roll in the Z direction and well
yeah that's not much of a difference
between the shape of the coin and the
shape of the box but yeah it should have
adjusted the box for us so it fits else
you can go ahead and adjust the century
and the size properties one thing we
have to remember to do and this is a
crucial step is to check the is trigger
because if we just go ahead and play now
we will collide with it and that's not
something we want we just want to be
able to check whether or not our ball
has entered the coin and that is type
done by checking the is triggered so now
that we have the is trigger enabled we
can start creating a script but before
we do so let's just make this look a
little more awesome so go down to the
project pane right click hit create and
then material so we're going to be
making a new material and remember in
one of the last videos I explained what
a material are what a texture are and a
material is what contains stuff like
textures and shaders so it's um a you
normally have just one material for each
object but you can have more this one is
just going to have a single one and
we're going to call this let's say glow
glowing and it won't actually be glowing
but we'll make it look like it we're
going to fake the effect will be
and what we're going to do is simply
just change the milling color to
something a little more dark I always do
this because when I then drag it onto
the coin we can see it changing like
this okay but this is not what we want
so bees basically select the material in
the project pane you can also select it
under the coin but then you're going to
have all this stuff in the way so I
don't recommend that just selected in
the project pane and what we're going to
be doing first is changing the shader
because no matter how bright we make
this or red or yellow or whatever it
doesn't really look that glowing and
interesting because this side is really
dark and what we're going to do to
change this is we're going to change the
shader we could change it to something
like a specular so we can add a little
bit of glow on this side here and that
helps definitely but this side is still
way too dark in my opinion so what we're
going to do is we instead going to go
down to self-illuminated and then select
diffuse self luminate it means that this
object even though it's in the shade
will still have light because it's
illuminating itself and you can also
have this emit light onto other objects
but you will have to bake that meaning
that we have to go through this whole
process of making sure this object
doesn't move and then making a texture
out of it and willing with our objects
and such it's not something we want to
do for this game for sure because it's
so simple so what we're going to do
instead is we're going to add a light to
it in a moment but basically that means
that we can leave the illumination map
off we can leave the emission light
memory as is and you can add a texture
if you want some texture in there I
don't think it's needed basically we can
just adjust the color of this until we
get a look at just right I want it to be
really yellow like this and maybe a
little more orange like that so we get a
little bit of a shaded effect so this
side is darker but it's not much and now
I think it actually looks pretty fine
but as we can see it's not shining on to
other objects so to achieve that this
let's add a light and center it on the
coin to do this go to game object create
other and then point light let's rename
this to coin light drag it onto the coin
and then Center the position variables
and now you might be thinking why does
this Centurion the coin and not the
center of the scene when its transform
is zero zero zero and that's because
whenever we drag an object onto another
one we do what is called parenting it so
if we take a closer look at what I did
to parent it up in the hierarchy I
selected the coin light and I dragged it
onto the coin see that right now in the
position variables are two point six
times one point two this is because it's
two point six in the X and one point two
in the Y so if we go ahead and Center
this now it will be in the center of the
scene though if we go ahead and drag
this under the coin it will be zero zero
and that's because it's now oriented
through the coin so if it's zero zero it
will be in the center of the coin that's
something that confuses a lot of people
but it's worth noticing cool now that we
have this in the center of the coin
let's just play a little bit around with
its light properties I think it's
emitting a pretty beautiful amount of
light it might be just a bit too much
but we're definitely going to change the
color just a bit and whenever you're
changing the color of light watch out it
doesn't get too much I think this is too
much we'll make it a little more whitish
so about half of half the way between
white and completely saturated and then
you add the orange color and we can just
bump down the intensity just a bit to
something by 0.7 let's try that 0.7 and
I think this looks
be awesome and now when we play the game
we can see the light affecting our ball
and its surroundings call what we can
also do is add an animation to this coin
but I think we're going to do that in a
later video since I want to take good
time explaining the animated window
we're also going to have a cool particle
effect whenever the ball picks up the
coin but in that is again for another
video so in this one we are just going
to make it disappear call now let's
finally create the script so select the
coin not the coin light hit add
component new script and let's call this
coin actually let's do coin pick up
there hit create an ad double-click it
to open it up in monodevelop
and we're just going to wait for it to
open up there we go
well basically now we have to use a
function that will trigger whenever our
ball enters our trigger Collider so to
do this unity has made a function for us
which functions perfectly big this is
called ontriggerenter so instead of
update we can just get rid of the
function stat instead of update we're
going to type on trigger enter this will
be called whenever something enters the
trigger on our ball or our coin so
basically what we want to do now is we
want to check what has entered because
if our coin is colliding with the ground
this could just be called all the time
so instead we want to check if it is
actually our ball collecting the coin so
do this we have to tell unity that we
want of information out of this
collision and we do that by first off
naming our information I'll just call it
info this is done in the parentheses
then we want to specify a type of
information and that's going to be of
type Collider this is just something you
have to remember it's not something that
I expect you to understand right away
since it's a little weird this
information gathering and such but
basically what we're doing is we're
saying if something enters till it tell
us more about what has entered and
called this information info then we
want to check if info that name is
actually equal to our Bowl so if info
that name is equal to and then what did
we just called it Bowl
so if info dot name is equal to bowl and
then we can go ahead and open up some
bracket keys and let's just go ahead and
check if this code works and we can do
this by using a debug dot log and then
open up parenthesis and say coin picked
up you can type whatever you want here
but basically debug logs are used to
check if code is working so if we go
under the console window down here and
now play the game we should see coin
picked up whenever you picked up pick up
this coin so if we roll in here you can
see it says coin picked up that's just
what we want but right now we are
checking for a name we could also be
even more convenient and check for a tag
if our let's say our game has multiple
players who should all be able to pick
up this coin it's better to use tag so
we'll use info tag and then it needs to
be able to check for player save this
and hit into unity this is not going to
work right away we can just check this
by clearing the error here or pressing
clear on play and then playing so if we
play once more here nothing happens when
we enter the coin
that's because we actually have to tag
our ball you do this by selecting it and
going to the inspector wet sets tag here
we can just select the player if you
want another tag hit add tag and add it
to the list then go into the bowl and
assign it I'm just going to go with
player since the ball is actually our
player now we can see that this is all
looking right and we have tagged our
player so let's select the console
window
and have a go at it and see if it works
it does great so now we don't really
just want the console to say current
picked up we want something to actually
happen first off we want the game object
to be destroyed so destroy and then in
the parenthesis here type game object
with the small G that's important so
whenever we do this destroy the
destroyed function is obviously used to
destroy things but game object when we
just type it like this means that it's
this object the script is sitting on
that will be destroyed so that means our
coin if we go ahead and test this oops
try again hit play and roll into our
coin hmm okay I'm back unity was having
some problems but it's gone now I
restarted it so let's hit play and now
we can simply roll into a coin and the
coin disappears and also the coin lights
because it's the its parented to the
coin so that disappears with it great
but that that's basically it for the
simple part of the script we could also
add a counter that gets bigger and
bigger whenever we pick up a coin so we
can keep track of how many coins we've
picked up we'll go ahead and do this in
a later video in a separate script but
basically to remember to make us
remember that we need to do this right
before we destroyed
game object let's put in the debug
deadlock saying that we should add some
functionality here let's just say add
coin counter here this is great if your
multiple people working on the project
or just for remembering things you need
to add now when we hit play the coin
disappears and it says add coin counter
here that's basically it for this video
guys I hope you enjoyed it and I really
look forward to seeing what you have
made using the tutorials again the if
you want to tweet to me do it add brad
keys tweet again brad keys treat thank
you for watching the video and i'll see
you in the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
