don't know where to start this video
should help on you in the right
direction making games is a complicated
subject let's try and break it down when
the big studios create games they do so
in large teams each person has a
specific role will that be 3d modeling
programming doing concept art by some
design in reality though most people
don't start with the team of
professionals while just a single laptop
and some good ideas let's at least how I
got into it
luckily over the last few years there's
been a big boom in the indie games
industry now small teams or even
individuals can make hugely popular
games such as super HUD fine details
just to name a few every video game runs
on what is called a game engine the
engine is what tells the components in
the computer stuff like how to render
graphics or play audio games such as
half-life 2 counter-strike and whorls
all run on the Source engine which is
also why they have so many things in
common when it comes to physics graphics
quality and gameplay previous these game
studios would have to spend a huge
amount of work creating an engine from
scratch or purchase a pre-existing one
from another studio which was not cheap
but these days a lot of independent
engines have been made with the sole
purpose of people using them to build
their games on top this brings us to the
first decision an aspiring game
developer has to make what engine should
I choose and the answer is well it
depends there are a lot of engines to
choose from and they each have their
strengths and weaknesses but here are
some of the most popular ones if you're
interested in making a 2-d game and want
to start with something not too
difficult I find that game maker is
pretty easy to pick up some examples of
games made using game maker are spelunky
undertale and inked game maker is
essentially free however some features
do require you to purchase a license I
don't find most of these too important
for beginners but do note that you can
only export to Windows using the free
version unity however allows you to
build games in both 2d and 3d that can
be exported to a variety of platforms
being currently the biggest player when
it comes to indie development unity has
powered games such as house clone super
HUD and Kerbal space program unity is
also used by a lot of mobile developers
Unreal Engine is probably the most
advanced of the three it's an amazing
engine for more experienced developers
who are looking to make 3d games but I
wouldn't recommend it as a starting
point it's known for powering some
really heavy games like Unreal
Tournament Gears of War and arcing lines
now some of you might know that I'm a
bit
I appear after all my entire YouTube
channel is build around unity but I do
believe that unity is the perfect
starting point for most survivors this
is not because it does everything
perfectly
no engine does but because of the
diversity unity supports both 2d and 3d
games and deploys to both the web
desktop mobile and consoles also when
programming in unity you can choose
between c-sharp and JavaScript two
widely adopted programming languages so
what you learn in unity can easily be
applied to other environments later down
the road so that's why I've decided to
make a short series on how it can make
your first game engine again the video
seems to teach a bit about everything so
that no matter if you want to become an
artist a level designer or programmer
you will hopefully find it useful so
click on the screen now to be taken to

pretty much it for this video if you
