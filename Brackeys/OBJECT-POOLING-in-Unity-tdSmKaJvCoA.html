bunch of objects without spending a lot
of processing power we'll do this using
a method called object pooling we'll get
into what it is and why it's useful in
just a sec but first this video is
sponsored by Skillshare Skillshare is an
online learning community with more than
18 thousand quality classes on tech
design and more and it's actually
something that I personally use and love
I recently came across this awesome
course on the fundamentals of creating
pixel art for games and I definitely
recommend you to check it out a premium
membership gives you unlimited access to
all classes for less than $10 a month so
to get started simply click the link in
the description and the first 500 people
to sign up will get their first two
months for only 99 cents and with that
let's get into the video so when making
a game you often want to spawn in
objects while playing of course unity
has a built-in function for this code
instantiate but using this function is
not very performant in many cases it's
much better to use an object Pole this
essentially means that when the game
starts we create a bunch of inactive
game objects in other words we make a
pool of objects when we then want to
spawn one of these objects instead of
creating the object from scratch we
simply take one of the objects from the
pool enable it and put it in the right
place if we run out of objects in the
pool we can either decide to grow it or
reuse all the objects all right but that
explanation let's jump right into unity
so here in unity I've set up a very
simple scene there's really only a
ground and a light and a bit of image
effects in here if we hit play you can
see that I've set up this cube spawner
that will just spit out a bunch of cube
objects and that's pretty much all
that's happening here you notice as this
go it spits out more and more cubes and
slowly fills up our hierarchy and it
will keep going until unity crashes if
we have a look at how this works it's
actually very simple I have a cube
spawning object and on this object I
have a cube spawner script all the
script does is that every fixed update
call it instantiates a cube and the cube
object is here it's just a rigidbody
with a cube script attached and all the
script does is calculate a random force
that it then adds to the rigidbody so
is a good example of a scene where we
can add object pooling to make it more
performant but before we start writing
our script there are a few things that
we need to understand so basically what
we want to be able to do is create
different object pools here we have
three pools 4 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 and we want each
of these pools to be responsible for
storing objects of a certain type might
have the first ones for circles the
second ones store squares and you get
the idea and I think the best way to go
about this is actually by using a
dictionary because the dictionary allows
us to create as many pools as we want to
and associate each pool with some kind
of tag in our case it's fairly simple we
could take the first pool and associate
it with circles and second one with
squares and the third one with well
something what this allows us to do is
encode access one of these pools using
its tag so if I wanted to access the
squares I'll simply put that in and this
would then give us the square pool then
I would store each of these objects
inside of the pool in what we call a
queue the good thing about a queue is
that it's basically like a list but it's
very very fast to get the first item and
we can also easily add new items to the
end of the queue we can imagine why this
is useful because if we wanted to go
ahead and instantiate or spawn one of
these objects we would simply take it
from the queue and put it inside of our
world and we would actually keep doing
this until the pool gets emptied the
smart thing about using a queue in this
instance is that if all of our objects
are actually currently active in the
world well we can still go ahead and
grab the first one in the queue and
that's just going to be the beginning
object so each time we move them from
the pool into the world we simply re add
them to the queue and so if we wanted to
go ahead and add a new object say up
here we would simply take the oldest
object in the world which is this one
and move it from that position into the
new one and we could just keep doing
that forever so now that we have a good
understanding of how dictionaries and
cues can be used to our advantage it's
time to start scripting it out to do
that let's create a new empty object in
our hierarchy let's reset the transform
on it and it's called an object polar
let's just drag it to the top so we can
always see it let's say I component and
let's create
a new script called object polar as well
we then double-click it to open it up in
Visual Studio I'm gonna remove the
update method here we won't be using it
and I'm then gonna go to the very top
here and I'm gonna create the dictionary
so we'll write public dictionary and
here the dictionary takes two types the
first one is going to be the tag that we
want to associate each pool with this is
also referred to as the key and this is
going to be of type string second we
want to have the actual pole and
remember we wanted to store that as say
Q so we'll go ahead and create a queue
here and whenever we create a queue we
also need to tell unity what we want to
store in the queue so we want to go
ahead and store a queue of game objects
and we'll call this dictionary pool
dictionary remember whenever you're
using dictionaries and queues you want
to make sure to be using system their
collections that generic so now in our
start method we can set pool dictionary
equal to a new dictionary and here we
can use autocomplete to make it just
fill out all of the types so now we have
a new empty dictionary to work with and
it's time to start filling it up with
pools of objects but instead of doing
this manually through code let's have
some way of configuring what pools we
want inside of the inspector to do this
that's go to the top here and let's
create our own class called pool so
we'll create a public class we'll call
it pool and we now choose what we want
to store in each pool first of all we
want to have a string with the tag of
the pool well then have a public game
object which is going to store the
prefab of the objects in that pool and
finally it will have a public int which
is going to store the total size of our
pool
that means at which point are we going
to start reusing objects instead of
spawning in new ones and to make sure
this will show up inside of the
inspector we have to mark it with an
attribute called system dot serializable
so now we've created this class and
let's go ahead and make a list so we'll
create a public list of pools that will
call pools if we now save this and head
into unity we can now see a list of
poles show up and we can go ahead and
add entries to this I'm just gonna add a
single one and now for the first element
here we can define a tag I'm gonna tag
this one as cube
the prefab I'm gonna drag in my cube
prefab and that's the size here I'm
gonna set that to something like a
hundred and fifty so we'll only have a
maximum of 150 active cubes at a time so
now that we have our list of poles we
need to start adding them to the
dictionary to do that we want to loop
through all of the pools so we'll go for
each pole and we'll call each item pool
in our pools list we want to go ahead
and create a queue of objects so we'll
create a queue here of game objects
we'll call it our object pool and we'll
set it equal to a new queue of game
objects and now we want to go through
and create each one of these objects so
we'll create another for loop here and
here we want to keep looping as long as
I is less than pool dot size in other
words we want to make sure that we fill
out our entire pool by instantiating as
many objects as we've defined in these
size so now for each one of these will
instantiate pull dot prefab and we'll
store a reference to this object that we
just created so game object we call it
object and now we can go object that set
active Falls to make sure to disable it
so we can't actually see it yet and
finally we can add it to the end of our
queue to do this all we need to write is
object pole dot and queue and then we'll
feed it our object and that's really all
so forage pool that we want to create we
create a queue full of objects we make
sure to add all the objects that we want
to add to the queue and finally we want
to add this pool to the dictionary so
we'll go pool Dictionary dot add and
here we first want to give it the tag so
pulled our tag and then a pool of
objects so object pool awesome so now we
should actually see that if we save this
go into unity and hit play it
immediately spawns 150 cubes that are
deactivated in our hierarchy these are
of course not the cubes that we're
seeing here they are added on top by the
cube spawner but we'll go ahead and
change that soon first we need to add
functionality for taking some of these
inactive cubes and spawning them into
our active Walt
to do that we'll create a new public
void and we'll call it spawn from pool
is first going to take in a string with
a tag which is of course the tag of the
object that we want to spawn and we also
want to take in a vector3 storing a
position this is where we want to spawn
our object as well as a quaternion for
the rotation now here we can get the
prefab that we want to spawn by simply
going pool dictionary and then feeding
it our tag just like I showed with these
squares in the example so this now gives
us the appropriate cue and then all we
need to do is go dot DQ in order to pull
out the first element in the queue we
then store this object so we'll create a
game object and we'll call it object to
spawn and set it equal to that object
and now we can configure our object to
spawn so we can set it to active so
enable it we can also set its position
object to spawn the transform dot
position is going to be equal to
position object to spawn dot transform
rotation is going to be equal to
rotation so we've actually now taken the
object that we want to spawn set it to
active moved it to the appropriate place
in the world and so it should be showing
and working just fine but we also want
to remember to add it back to our queue
so that it can be reused later to do
that we simply go pull dictionary and we
remember to pass in the tag dot NQ and
we feed it the object to spawn now there
are still some things that we can add
here to make it a tiny bit safer and
easier to use one of these is we can go
to the top here and check if whole
Dictionary dot contains key and this is
just to make sure that if we give it a
tag that it doesn't have a pool for we
don't go through and cause any errors so
if this is not true well then we simply
want to go ahead and throw a debug
deadlock warning saying that the pool
with tag and then we feed it the tag
doesn't exist there we go and then we
can simply return out of the function a
really nice feature of instantiate that
I use a lot so when we go and
instantiate an object is that it returns
the object that we just created so let's
do the same thing here we'll mark the
return type as game object and right at
the end of the function here we'll
return the object to spawn so now we can
always grab it
from the place where we spawn it and
here we simply want to return null in
the case that there is no object so that
should actually complete the main
functionality of our object polar script
but we still need a easy way to access
it from within our cube spawner to do
that we'll use a very simple singleton
pattern now this is not a true singleton
it's just a quick workaround and if
you've never heard of Singleton's before
or if you want to read more about them
I'll make sure to have a link for that
in the description all we're doing here
is just very easily allowing ourselves
to grab the object polar from the cube
spawner so I'm just gonna write a public
static object polar which we'll call
instance and then we'll create an awake
method and in here we'll simply set
instance equal to this and just to let
everyone know that this is an attempt at
a single turn will write singleton here
and we'll end the region down here this
doesn't do anything it just allows us to
collapse the code like this and we don't
have to look at it anymore so now we can
say that and now when we go into the
cube spawner what this allows us to do
is actually delete the variable right
here delete the instantiate call and
instead we can go object polar dot
instance dot and now we can simply call
the function from in here so we'll call
spawn from pull and then we can feed it
a tag and we'll use the tag cube I mean
feed it a position we'll just use
transformed our position as well as a
rotation we'll use criteria and dot
identity and there we go if you're going
to be calling this a lot like I'm doing
here I would recommend storing this in a
variable so we can just do that very
quickly we'll create an object polar
call it object polar and then inside of
the start method we can set object polar
equal to up click pull a thread instance
and now we can simply reference it here
that just makes things a tiny bit more
performing so if we now save this go
into unity and hit play we should see
that after we spawn 150 cubes it stops
but it hasn't actually stopped it's
still reusing cubes but for some reason
they aren't really moving anywhere
they're just all stacked on top of each
other the reason for this is that our
cube script is currently set
to only apply a force in the start
method and start it's only called once
when the object is actually instantiated
so what we need to do is create some
kind of way in order to notify this
object that it has just been reused in
other words we need to create our own
start method and a fairly easy way to do
this is using what we call an interface
now if we go into a project we can go
ahead and create a c-sharp script
because this is going to be an interface
we'll start it with an eye for interface
I will then call it pulled object let's
open it up in visual studio we don't
want this to derive from mana behavior
we want to remove both of the functions
we can basically remove all of the
namespaces and we don't want this to be
a class we want it to be an interface
now basically what an interface does is
allows you to specify some types and
functions that all objects that derive
from this interface have to implement so
in our case we can just write void on
object spawn and we'll just close it off
like this that's pretty much all we need
to write inside of our interface if we
now save this and go into our cube
script we want to make sure that our
cube derives from mana behavior and and
this is where we put a comma
I pulled object and you will see here
that it now lights red and the reason
why is that well now this class derives
from I pulled object but it doesn't
implement this on object spawn function
so we need to make sure to go in here
and instead of using start we want to
use on object spawn I'm also want to
mark it as public and right away we can
see that it no longer underlines with
red because we're now implementing the
function what we can then do is save
this and go into our object polar go
down to where we actually spawn an
object from the pole and in here we can
now get a component on the object that
we're spawning so object to spawn dark
get component of type I pulled object
that's right we can actually search for
interfaces we install this in a variable
so I pulled object and we'll call it
pulled object like this now it's not
certain that we want all objects
JavaScript that derives from this entry
face we want that to be optional so
we're going here and right cliff pulled
object is not equal to null well then we
can actually call a function on this
interface and we of course want to go
ahead and call on object spawn so this
should in fact search for the interface
check if it's not equal to null and if
it isn't it will go in access the
interface look for an implementation of
this method and then inside of the cube
actually call it and execute all of the
code so if we now save this go into
unity and play we can see that cubes are
now being properly reused yay definitely
pray about with this and have fun with
it you can easily go in and add multiple
pools we could go out and try and
increase the size here to 300 as well
and check out the results of course this
object pool it could be made more
performant one of the things that I
would do is definitely try and get rid
of the gate component call so definitely
have fun with it yourself also a cool
guy from the community sent me over this
script that he has made you can check
that out on github and also just quickly
search the asset store and found this
plugin that is currently free and looks
like it has most of the functionality
that you're going to need I'll of course
have link for both in the description
