and it looked super fun personally I was
bummed to find out that I couldn't
participate after a few days of moping I
decided enough is enough and I would
simply take some time to make a game of
my own for a long time I've been wanting
to do something using controller input
and we'd recently been playing a lot of
Super Smash Bros for the Nintendo 64
inspired by this idea of multi character
combat I started to sketch out a level I
thought I should stay in the little
diary mindset so I tried to keep
everything as simple as possible I took
the battlefield stage from the Wii U
game and recreated it using basic shapes
it wasn't pretty but I really wanted to
move on to something more important
movement and this is PI 5 the mechanic
that I spend the most time on
I had a few requirements I wanted the
movement to be smooth but responsive I
wanted a lot of movement on both the
horizontal and the vertical axis and
finally I needed the character movement
to blend nicely with combat now if you
ever tried creating physics based
movement in unity you know that
controlling a character using forces can
quickly make it feel sloppy and
unresponsive but I needed to use physics
because I wanted to combat between
players to be physics based the way I
ended up solving this problem was by
adjusting the amount of force applied to
a player depending on the current
velocity of the player in the given
direction this means that if you press
right and the character is already
moving quickly in that direction it's
not gonna apply that much force however
if you then push left it's going to
apply a great amount of force trying to
shift the character in the new direction
this approach was great because it gave
me full control over these snappiness of
the controls and I think they ended up
feeling pretty good to give the place
the feeling that they could move both
horizontally and vertically I add a
triple jump along with the ability to
control the characters while in mid-air
this is also the first time that I
changed the level to fit better with the
controls when the players are able to
move this freely the level needs to give
them space to do so so I made the
platform smaller and increase the
distance between them next I wanted
movement to blend with combat I was
really inspired by the way that Super
Smash Bros handles damage basically the
more you get hit the EC you are to knock
off the level I really wanted to
emphasize this mechanic but with more
focus on ranged shooting so I equipped
all the characters with weapons that
shout out spheres when a player got hit
by a sphere it would add a force
depending on their current weakness
level the weakness level would of course
also increase over time as the card hit
the only way to die in the game was to
get shot off the
platform I think this works really well
because it feels like you're always in
control if you get shot really hard you
squeeze the joystick and do everything
you can to time your jumps in an effort
to make it back I also add a visual
feedback on the current weakness level
of the characters by scaling them up as
they got weaker at this point the game
was playable and I started testing it
with my friends I quickly found out
however that a lot of stuff still needed
to be changed
of course I needed to tweak some values
like movement speed and damage but the
main problem was the layout of the level
but the level worked great in Super
Smash Bros it played really poorly in my
game I found that the big issue with the
use of floating platforms my game was
centered around shooting and the
platform's would often get in the way
this led to moments of in fairness where
players would randomly get saved by the
environment without even trying - it
also made it too hard to hit each other
because you could simply hide on the
other side of a platform so to fix this
I completely removed all platforms and
flattened out the level I also made it
wider and added lots of holes that
players could fall into at this point I
started picturing the level with some
actual art assets in it I decided to use
the Mayan temple pack from Devas it's to
make kind of an ancient underground
arena in the middle of the arena
I made a big full of lava where the
players can fight to push each other in
I like this idea in particular because
well I really wanted to make lava I
ended up using a free lava flowing
shader from the asset store as a base
and then added some particles and a
bunch of post-processing effects to help
tie everything together when I was happy
with the look of the game I once again
asked my friends for feedback this time
we played the game for a while and had a
whole bunch of fun but the combat still
needed more death so inspired by Simon's
ability to charge her attacks I had to
charge up to the spheres charging up an
attack increased both the size damage
and speed of the projectiles and help
make combat much more interesting now
each player had to decide in a given
situation whether to fire quick short
bursts or to charge up hoping for that
one big hit I also added strategies for
avoiding and blocking attacks I made it
so if you hit all the players bullets
they get destroyed and I'm also added
knock-back to the weapon so you could
use a powerful attack as a way to stop
yourself from falling in the lava at
this point I was happy with how combat
felt and I worked on polishing the game
a bit I added a camera that would
dynamically follow around and zoom in
and out to fit all the players and I
also added some effects for extra flare
using the Unity particle path and that's
pretty much where the game is in its
current state I've experimented with
adding power-ups but I still need to add
many more to make that
viable of course they'll have a bunch of
stuff that I'd like to do like add more
detail to the level and add moving
elements to make it more dynamic but
overall I'm happy with what I did
unfortunately it took away the pain of
not participating in Londonderry at
least some of it so that's pretty much
it for this video if you enjoyed it
maybe check out some of my other behind

watching and I will see you in the next
