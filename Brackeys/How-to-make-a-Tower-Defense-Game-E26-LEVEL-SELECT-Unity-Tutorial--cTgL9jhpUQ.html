want to welcome to this video in
creating a tower defense game in unity
today we are going to be creating a
level selector so some kind of menu that
will display the amount of levels that
we have in our game and then the user
can click on them to go to that level we
still don't transition between levels so
if you complete one level it won't
actually take you to the next one that's
something we'll add in a future video
and also all of these armed levels are
unlocked immediately we still have to do
some way of maybe unlocking levels as we
go that could be something really fun to
add and of course we also need more
levels but I thought we would start with
the level selector and then work from
there so let's just jump right into
unity and what I want to do is just base
this off one of the our already existing
scenes that we have whoops don't want to
save this one and I thought we would
just work off the main menu because it
has this background and that feels nice
and also we only have the scene fader
and not a lot else in here so let's just
duplicate the main menu and let's rename
this to level selector and or select or
whatever I'm just going to do a level
select actually and let's double click
on level select so you can see that the
one that's opened up now and we want to
delete pretty much everything in here we
want to remove the standard turret we
want to remove well we can actually keep
this background here to use as a
background for our UI and then just
build our UI on top of that or we could
have a flat color that's totally up to
you I think I'm just going to leave it
in here and just remove the main menu
objects so that we don't have the
functionality for our main menu in our
level select script cool so now we can
just save that and we can go ahead and
start building the UI so let's
right-click create UI canvas and we want
to rename this to something like UI
canvas or overlay canvas something like
that I think we want to change the UI
scale mode to scale with screen size so
that when we scale this up our UI is
going to scale with it and I don't want
to necessarily select pixel perfect
let's just go under the UI canvas in the
scene view here focus on it so we can
get a good view and make sure you're in
2d mode let's right-click
you I and let's start by maybe creating
some kind of text that is going to say
select level and we want to change this
to a Roboto maybe even the thin one and
we definitely want to scale this up
quite a bit I also want to anchor it to
the bottom here so the bottom left and
let's bump up the font size here so we
can actually see this in the game want
to change the color here to white and we
can maybe also add a shadow but for now
we'll just leave it as is and then we'll
see if that's necessary on later so I
think this already looks just fine and
we can maybe just move this up a tiny
bit to make room for our actual UI so
this is going to be our title and then
we can go here and go UI and then panel
and I want to create kind of a a panel
on for all of our level buttons to be in
so let's just make sure this doesn't
stretch with the scene I wanted instead
to just be centered or anchored in the
middle so just click there no holding
down alt or anything and we can simply
just scale this whole thing down so I
wanted to scale down on the Y here
wanted to go kind of far down something
like that and I want it to be about the
same size or have the same starting
point as our text so something like that
looks fine for now and remember we can
always tweak this later what I also want
to do is definitely change the color to
a black color and we can see what that
looks like in the game and I actually
want to bump down the outfit even more
so something like that I think that
looks quite decent and it's definitely
unusable so this here is going to be our
levels and on this is the own actual
background for our levels I also want to
have an object that is responsible for
laying out all of our level bodies so
some kind of grid I also want to have
another object that's responsible for
allowing us to scroll through levels so
let's say we have more levels that we
can show on the screen I want to use the
scroll rect so that we can actually
scroll through and we'll also add a
scroll bar over here for displaying the
rest of them so this is our
background so now we can go ahead and
create a new empty object under that
background we can just reset that and we
also want this to we actually we want
this to scale with our parent object so
we'll just um you know hold down alt
here and click in the bottom right and
this here is going to be kind of our
scroll our scroll rect and we can draw
maybe just give it a tiny bit on the
left here so it's like 20 on the left
top right and bottom just so we kind of
separated out from our background I
think that's going to look pretty nice
and and then we can go ahead and create
a new empty object under that as well
and this here is going to be our actual
grid or we could also just call it the
content so um we'll have just link all
of these up in a moment and it's kind of
confusing that you have to create the
hierarchy in this way but after having
done it a few times you're going to get
used to it and yeah it's with every as
with everything else in unity they have
their standards of doing things and once
you once you get used to them it
shouldn't really be an issue so what we
can do now is maybe um create a bottom
button for our content so let's just
size it up here and this is going to be
automatically sizing to fit our content
so that's why I don't really care about
the size here I just wanted to make it a
bit larger so that we can see our button
that we now are going to create and
let's just make this say 100 by 800 and
actually that doesn't matter because
what we'll go ahead and do right away is
add a grid layout to this content so
we'll go in here and we'll say we want a
grid layout group and that now allows us
if we duplicate this button here I'm
just going to make a bunch flip you can
see that it automatically lays them out
so that's a really really handy feature
in unity and what we'll do is we'll just
again anchor this to scale with our
scroll rect just to see how that looks
and you can see that already looks
pretty nice and what we can do is maybe
keep the cell size at a hundred but
definitely add some spacing so I want
something like maybe 13 on the X maybe a
bit less I do want there to be another
row so maybe 11 on the X there and let's
do the same thing on the Y so that
already looks quite decent and what we
can then do to our content here is we
can add a content size fitter and what
this will do and it will only do it in
just a second is it will automatically
resize this object to fit of the button
so in our case it would resize to fit
like this and then if we remove the
bottom button here it would
automatically just bump up here so
that's really really handy because our
scroll rect will orient this content
here um and depending on the size of the
content so if the content is larger than
the size of our scroll rect it's going
to of course allow us to scroll through
that so it's really really neat that we
can get our content to resize to fit the
actual size of all the buttons together
so in order to make it do this first off
I want to take the anchor point here and
bump it up to one on the Y just to make
sure that it will orient itself from the
bottom on center or from the upper
center so that it will scale in this way
a not scale and both down and up at the
same time oh and unity is messing around
here I think the unity a UI system is
really really awesome but sometimes you
just get weird behavior like these
warnings here and they're not actually
dangerous because they won't actually do
anything inside of the game but you can
see just how much they're messing
everything up right now so let's just
disable our content size fitter let's
try and scale this up and you can see
unity is just going completely crazy
here so I might have to restart and it's
a really really annoying thing that this
is happening I I really hope they're
working on it it looks like it kind of
stopped messing up their cool so yeah
it's just you need each UI system what
are you going to do so what we can do
now that we've anchored it up here
Riaan able the content size figure and
on the vertical fit we now want to put
preferred size and you can see now that
it automatically rescales so if we
delete this one it's going to snap up
there indeed it does
cool so that's already working so what
we want to do now is of course go in and
make these buttons a bit more
interesting and to do that on let's just
remove all of them except for one and
let's rename this to something like
level button and um we can definitely
mess around with some of these settings
the first thing that I want to do is
change the text object here to not say
button I want it to say the number of
our level so this is going to be our
first level and we can go in here and
bump up the font size quite a bit and
also want to change that to Roboto thin
I like that look something like that
looks pretty good already actually and
you can definitely just use white and
black in here but I also thought it
could be fun if we maybe are tinted this
button here in our in some kind of color
but it might just be yeah it doesn't
look better I think we should just stick
to the very minimalist theme but as
always I really recommend that you spend
some time on it play around with it
get it to look exactly the way that you
want it to so I'm also going to go into
our level button here and add a our
shadow and just to give it a tiny bit of
a 3d feel here to make it stand out and
I'm definitely going to decrease the
Alpha and that's that channel so you can
see that looks a little better it just
gives a tiny more detail so it doesn't
look too simple and dumb so yeah I
really like that and one thing we can
also do is maybe change the hover
animation and click but we can do that
in a second so now let's turn this
button here in to a prefab by going onto
the prefabs folder and dragging it in
there and now we can just freely
duplicate it as many times as we want
because now when we change of course a
level button down here they are all
going to update so that's really handy
and I thought we could um Mae
just see how this looks when we had play
at the moment so you can see that they
are currently extending beyond the
confines of our scroll rect and we
aren't actually able to drag them
anywhere we can click on them but
nothing will happen and also um you can
see that it doesn't cut off here we want
some kind of masking to happen so that
they won't just well be shown in places
that they shouldn't be shown so that's
maybe the first thing that we should add
is go to a scroll right here and add a
simple mask and we can make this a rect
mask to D just to make it simply square
and you can see that just cuts
everything off that is without the
confines of the scroll root scroll rect
so you can see there it cuts everything
off here it's just a very very simple
effect but it looks quite cool and then
what we can do is add some actual
scrolling so if we go to a scroll rect
and add a well you guessed it a scroll
rect we should be able to now drag in
our content and for the viewport that's
going to be the same as the scroll rect
component so we'll just drag in our
scroll right here and everything else we
should be able to leave as is we might
want to disable horizontal scrolling
because we only want to do that on the
vertical so now you should see that when
we go in here we should be able to click
and drag on these buttons and you can
even see how smooth that feels so a
really really simple and easy to make
effect and we can still click on all the
buttons to activate them so that's
really cool and you can even see a bit
of hardware animation in there so the
next thing that I wanted to do was maybe
spice up our spice up our hover
animation a tiny bit because I think the
tinting looks a bit boring so luckily in
some of the earlier videos we created
this cool hover animation for our
buttons and we can just go ahead and
reuse that so all we need to do is go to
transition and of course I've selected
our prefab to change all of them at the
same time so go to transition and select
animation and we want to turn off
navigation and undo arm and we want to
go down and hit
and add in an animator and this is where
we created the controller from earlier
called button and this is basically a
very very simple controller all it does
is it has a normal arm animation with a
scale of 1 1 1 then it has a highlighted
animation with a scale of 1 point 0 5
and we also have a tiny bit of hover
animation in there so you can see that
it actually does a bit of pulsating but
you can just put a single keyframe here
for the point one point zero five and we
do the same thing when we press it so we
wanted to go back to one one one cool so
yeah that's pretty much all that is so
you can quickly recreate that I'll go
back and watch the earlier videos if you
want to see how we did that so you can
see already that that looks just much
much better and feels much looser much
smoother cool so on next up what we can
do is link these buttons so that they
will actually transition to a new level
because currently nothing happens when
we click on them and in order to do that
let's go ahead and create a script that
we want to act as the central place for
doing logic when it comes to selecting
different levels in the beginning it's
just going to have a very simple public
method call something like select or
load the text in the name of the level
that we want to load and then we tell
the scene fader to fade into that level
but in the future it can handle stuff
like looking at what levels are locked
and showing a locked graphic checking if
you can actually play that level it
could also dynamically load all of the
levels that you have available from an
array or something and put them in here
so you don't have to add a new button
every time you make a new level you can
do a lot of stuff but for now we'll just
have it be really really simple so let's
create an empty object let's reset the
transform and let's call it a level
selector and we can go in here an add
component level selector and we can
double click on that to open it up in
visual studio and that's actually the
first scripting we're going to do
for this videos I'm excited I'm just
going to have a sip of water they're
awesome so what we can do in here is
just remove system duck elections and
system duck election startin Eric we're
not going to be using those and we'll go
in here and create a public void cold
let's just call it select actually and
the function is going to take in a
string with the level name that we want
to select or the name of the level that
we want to select and we could just go
in here and use our unity engine scene
manager
arm load level and then I load the level
directly but let's just utilize the fact
that we do have some functionality for
fading between scenes so in our case we
want to get a reference to our scene
fader now we can just call this fader
and then we can use fader fade to and
then put in the level name here so
that's just going to look a bit nicer
and now all we need to do is find our
level selector and drag in our scene
fader into the fader arm field there and
we can maybe just drag about level
selector to organize that at the top so
now we can go into our different buttons
and believe it or not that was all the
scripting that we needed to do for this
video so we can go into our first button
for example we can go down here and add
an on click event and all we need to do
is drag in the level selector go and do
the level selector script and select
choose select and the and we get a
string here that we can input and the
level that we want to load is something
like level one and we can do the same
one for the second one except for this
one we want to change the text to two
and we want to go in and add an on click
event
drag in our level selector go on to the
level selector script and choose select
and let's input now level two so it's
really really really simple and we can
maybe just delete all of the remaining
levels so that we don't have some that
will not work and they were just for
testing and what we can do now is create
these levels so we currently have our
main level let's rename this one to
level 1 and if we duplicate this level
it will automatically name it level 2
and if we now just jump into level 2 I
thought we would just quickly change
something about this level so that we
can easily see that um it's different so
for this level let's just go in and
change our start lives from 1 to 10 so
on level 1 our start lives are going to
be 1 and on level 2 our start lives is
going to be 10 so that should just give
us a clear idea of what level we're
currently on so now if we go back into
our select level hit play we should be
able to go to level 1 and indeed it says
one lives here and if we then restart
here and select level two it's going to
go to level 2 note and here we get an
error and that's because we haven't
added level 2 to the build settings and
this is something you need to do for all
scenes just you need to drag them under
the build settings so let's go to build
settings and let's drag in level 2 let's
also drag in level select because we're
going to be transitioning to that in
just a moment so I'm just going to drag
it up here but the order really doesn't
matter for us so we can hit save again
hit play and try and select level 2 now
and it's going to transition and it's
going to say 10:00 live so now we you
can just go completely nuts create as
many levels as you want to and add them
in here and yeah you're going to have a
lot of replay value so that's awesome of
course we also want to have a way of
going to or transitioning to this level
select level scene and we want to do
that from our main menu so I thought
when we hit play here instead of just
playing from level 1 let's just load up
the level select and then the user can
choose for himself what he wants to play
so let's undo our main menu instead of
having our main level as the level to
load let's go in here and have level
select so now when you go and hit play
you start at the main menu you hit play
it transitions to our levels
select and then you can choose either
one or two I'm going to select two and
it transitions are further and you can
even go back here if you had escaped go
to the menu hit play again we can select
maybe level one this time and it's going
to go in there instead so you can see
how nicely these scenes are tied
together the last thing that I wanted to
show you is under our level select and
what I wanted to do was just add a very
simple scroll bar in case you don't like
this a dragging around of the objects I
kind of like it but maybe it's not too
intuitive if people have never really
seen it before I mean on phones it's
it's really common but doing it with a
mouse is not really standard so what
we'll do instead is go in and let's just
create a bunch of test buttons here so
let's duplicate this one a bunch of
times and let's also go under our levels
this main object which has our
background let's go you eye and then
create a scroll bar and of course this
is currently centered to the horizontal
axis so let's go down here and change
from the direction from left to right
and then instead have it be bottom to
top and it's going to automatically
rescale it here
and then what we can do is maybe move it
over here somewhere there looks just
fine
we can also scale it up like that I
think that looks a lot better and of
course we need to reference this so we
need to go into a scroll rect and drag
our scroll bar into the vertical scroll
bar field and now you can see it
repositions itself and resizes itself in
such a way that it will fit on our
content and when we then scroll to the
bottom here you can see our content
Scrolls up and even we can still drag
like this
and it's just going to move the scroll
bars so they are both interlinked and
will not interact with each other so
that's awesome and we can even make our
scroll bar a bit prettier because I yeah
this is not to kid and we can maybe take
our the
is our background so we can take that
and make it kind of black and very very
transparent something like that just
very see-through and then we can find
our sliding area and then the handle and
we can change the color on this also to
be black but um add a bit more of
opacity to that one so now we should be
able to hit play and you can see that
looks just a little bit better I think
and we can also even use our scroll
wheel to on change it so that's awesome
and everything is working we can go
ahead and delete all of our buttons here
and you can see that when it's not
needed it's just going to be this um on
this um what should we call it uniformly
colored bar that you can really interact
with you can of course add the script if
you want it to fade out when it's not
needed but I like it being there like
this so that was pretty much all I
wanted to show you in this video I hope
you enjoyed it let me know what you want
to see next I want to do more with
levels definitely have some kind of way
of transitioning to a new level once
you've mastered the the previous one and
also some way of unlocking levels which
will give us a handy way of talking
about saving data inside of unity so I
thought that's pretty exciting but of
course let me know if I'm going off on a
tangent and no one no one really wants
to see this so yeah thanks for watching
and I will see you in the next video
