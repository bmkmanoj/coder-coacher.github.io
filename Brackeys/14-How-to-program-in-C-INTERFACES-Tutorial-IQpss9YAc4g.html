welcome to video number 14 in how to
program c-sharp course in today's video
we're going to have a look at interfaces
so an interface is basically like a
contract that you can sign with a class
saying what needs to be in that class so
if you look at an interface it's very
much like a structure of what methods
and properties needs need to be in that
class so that sounds may be a bit
abstract to you but basically you don't
have to get very far in programming
before interfaces become very useful for
making things simpler safer and a whole
lot cooler so that's going to be awesome
and we are a pretty good way into the
series here so I quickly want to mention
that if you go to Priya's comm I do have
a donate button here where you can
support Brad keys so you can simply
click on that and it will take you to
PayPal and you can donate any amount
that you want to all of the stuff that I
upload is free all of the assets on the
unity asset store is free and assets
pack so if you want me to keep doing
this for free you can of course help me
out by donating so I really wanted to
mention that it's of course not
something that you need to do and I
don't expect you to either but if it's
something that you feel like would would
feel would be a good idea
I'm not going to stop you oh cool so
let's dig right into today's video so
I've opened up Semoran studio here and
if we take a look at implementing a
simple interface we can basically
describe an interface as kind of saying
what should be in a class and then the
class itself describes how each method
is implemented so an example of an in
face we're going to create one here
could be lets say an item so we wanted
to have an item system and we wanted to
define the structure of all items well
then we create an instant interface for
those items and I'd like to begin all of
my interfaces with an I so here's going
to be AI item just so we can identify
them as interfaces and then we open and
close some brackets here and inside of
the interface itself
the syntax is are actually really simple
we don't need to do any kind of
availability layers so we can avoid the
public and private and all that and
basically we just need to define the
datatype for the property so we're going
to have a string with the name of the
item and you can't just close this off
this has to be marked as a property
meaning that we have to do get and set
that's just a formality but it's
something you're going to have to do and
then we can also maybe make an integer
with the gold value of this item and
that's also going to be a property so we
do the get set here and then we can
maybe make a couple of methods so first
off we're going to have Boyd and this
should of course we pull off load
depending on what you want to return so
we'll just say save void here and we'll
make this equip so we can equip our item
and another one for is selling it and
none of these are going to take in any
parameters either that's also something
you'll have to think about here so
that's a very simple interface and if we
wanted to implement this we could go in
here and define a class and we could
call this a sword and of course open and
close some curly brackets and in here we
could create a public
string name and again just simply that's
use the cost default get set and a
public integer gold value and again use
get set cool and then we could go ahead
and create a constructor so we'll make
this a public sword and we're going to
take in as an argument on the name so
string name so we can give it a name
once we create a sword and we're going
to set name equal to underscore name the
name passed in and we're going to set
gold value equal to 100 so we'll just
say that all swords in our game has a
goal value of 100 imaginary dollars and
coal so you can see here that we've now
implemented the two properties and that
we haven't yet implemented the methods
and the program is going to notify us of
this so if we save this and hit play you
can whoa this actually runs oh I know
why it's because we need to implement
the interface stupid me so this is very
central right now we just have a class
definition and an interface definition
but if we go ahead and actually inherit
from this interface just like we've
inherited from other classes before so
we can inherit from a item here
then you can see that when we hit play
it's going to say that it doesn't
implement the interface member equip and
if we click on this you can see that it
doesn't either implement the interface
net member sell and if we didn't have
these values or properties here it will
notify us to implement those two code so
and you might be thinking right now well
why don't we just use a base class and
the reason for this is that we can use
multiple interfaces that we can derive
from multiple interfaces and also this
allow
is to define how we how the actual
methods and properties are going to work
in on the derived class itself so now we
can simply go ahead and make is some
fairly simple methods here and equip
method and of course we don't have any
logic for a rhythm equiping items here
so we'll just write out that the name of
the item and then has been equipped and
actually we'll just say crypt shorter
and then we'll have another method
called sale and this one is just going
to say that console.writeline the name
of the item plus sold for plus the gold
value plus imaginary dollars cool and
now when we hit play here nothing is
going to happen but we don't get any
errors so now down here we can go ahead
and create a a new sword you can create
a sword and we'll just call this sword
as a reference and we'll they equally to
a new sword oops not an S fight a new
sword and we'll give it the name sword
of Destiny and then we can call methods
on so we can say that we want to equip
this sword and then we want to sell this
sword so now when we hit play you can
see that sword of Destiny was equipped
and sort of destiny was sold for a
hundred imaginary dollars cool so that's
the simplest use of an interface that I
can come up with and this works just
fine already but let's take this a step
further so I've drawn this thing in
paint I know it's the most
beautiful thing I've ever seen in my
life to you but bear with me so if we
look at interfaces as like tags that we
can apply to our objects because right
now we've tap tagged this class as an
item well we could also tag it as a
quality so we could basically say that
this item has some kind of quality level
and therefore should be able to be
damaged so we can add that kind of
dimension on to the class we would also
tag it as part of the quest so we could
create another interface for that and
then we can basically have different
items so we're going to have an sword
and an axe and both the sword and the
axe maybe has its tagged as an item of
course and we both want them to have
some kind of quality level and be able
to be destroyed when used and but maybe
only the sword is really important for
one of the quests the access to
something we picked picked up and
therefore something we can just sell no
matter what so this is you see some a
piece of logic that is available in
pretty much any RPG that I've played at
least because it allows us to very
dynamically use our code throughout our
game and then if we even go further with
this we can have an inventory with all
of these items so we can have an array
of items and then we can loop through
that array and check what items are
marked as part of a quest and those that
are that are we can call a method on
those items that only those items have
that we want to turn in the quest
turn in the quest items so this might
sound complicated but I think we'll go
ahead and implement this so first off
let's create the quality layer and
that's going or the quality tag and it's
going to act pretty much the same as our
item tag so we're going to have an
interface here I quality and I know the
name here is not perfect but
we'll just go with our quality and this
one is going to have some kind of
integer and we'll call this quality
level no we call this durability
actually instead of quality let's call
this a damageable I like that a lot
better I should have thought of that so
long ago
okay so interface I damageable and it's
going to have an int durability and it's
going to of course have a getter and a
setter and then we can create a method
that will us here that will say take
damage and it's going to take in an
integer amount and it's simply going to
say that durability minus equals and
then we'll say 20 oh no of course amount
amount cool so and the name of this
argument basically doesn't matter that's
completely irrelevant and of course this
is on the implementation side we just
want to finish this off I don't know I
got confused there sorry but basically
we we do this structure where we want to
have a void that takes damage and we
want to put in the amount as an integer
and it doesn't matter what you name this
here because we can just rename it or
name it something different down here
and it's not going to throw any kind of
errors or anything so now we have this
damageable tag which forces our objects
or our class to include a durability
variable and 88 damnit damage method so
let's now take this with high damage
ball and now we can create a public void
take damage
and it's going to take in the amount or
it could call this damage just to show
you that that would work I'm going to do
that and then we do the logic here and
of course now we want to name this a
damage and we also want to implement the
durability so we can say public integer
and and this is going to be called to
rapidly T and simply increment the cast
and normally it gets it and we could do
something here again with a private
variable underscored durability that
will make sure that durability doesn't
go below zero and all that which you've
seen in previous video so again we have
complete control over what this
durability variable actually does what
its value is and how we change it cool
and now down here we'll be able to we'll
say that we want to crip the sword and
then we want to damage the sword by 20
and whenever it takes damage
let's also print out that the name of
the item and then took damn or let's
just say damaged by and then we'll put
in the damage amount and then say it now
has a durability of and then put in the
durability cool yeah us
so let's save that and hit play whoops
expected a : am i missing I'm missing a
plus sign there hit play cool and it
says sort of testing equipped sort of
destiny damaged by 20 it now has a
durability of negative 20 sort of
distance so for a hundred imaginary
dollars cool so I for some reason
okay so durability of course defaults to
zero so up here in our constructor will
simply say that durability should be
equal to 30 by default and now you can
see that it says that it has a
durability of ten awesome so that's kind
of the idea that we can create these
tags and mark our items and if you just
take this whole sword class here and
copy it down here we can very very
easily create an X so it's again that's
going to derive from item and damageable
and this is also going to be X it's
going to take in the name it's going to
start with a gold value of 70 and a
durability of 50 and all of these
implementations are going to be the same
and then down here we can create an axe
call it X set it equal to a new axe and
set in its name to fury axe and then we
can maybe equip the X and we can of
course damage the damage the axe and
we're going to damage this by 10 and
finally we can sell the axe
so we can do all of the same stuff and
let's just make an empty line between
these simply write out console.writeline
and you can see that it does all the
stuff for the sword create an axe and
does all of this stuff for that too so
that's super cool but that's just adding
on to the amount of
like city that we have in our game next
up is the actual very very cool part of
this and that is marking these items as
Chryst's and then using that in our
actual game logic so if we should go
ahead and click create an interface here
that the idea is very simple we go ahead
and create an interface called a part of
quest and again we do all of the
brackets we then create and let's just
create a void we could have of course
some more information like the name of
the quest and all that but here we'll
simply force it to include a void called
turn M that will turn in the item and
that's basically all of this that this
interface is going to implement so or
all the classes deriving from this
interface is going to be forced to
implement I should say and now we can
make our sword derive from this but not
our axe so let's do a comma here and
implement I pod of quest and it's super
cool this idea that we can see all of
the attributes of our sword right here
it also makes it very easy to read the
code once it gets more complicated and
very easy to add functionality to a
class and then we simply want to include
the logic here so we'll make a public
void and we'll call this turn in and
it's not going to take in any arguments
we're simply going to say that console
the right line and then name of the item
turned in that's it cool so now down
here our sword will be able to call the
turn in method but our X won't so we
retry here X dot turn in you can see it
doesn't autocomplete and if we would get
an error if
tried that so now let's see what we can
actually do with this so down here we
can create an inventory and we simply
need to mark this we need to make the
type of a item so this is an array of
items meaning an array of classes that
derive from the eye item interface and
this is simply going to be called
inventory or items and we're going to
set that equal to a new item array which
is going to take us to be able to store
two elements and in the first element so
index zero we're going to set it equal
to this sword that we created and the
second index or the second spot in our
array meaning index one it's going to be
equal to X so both both of these or
these are different classes but they
derive from the same interface and
therefore we can add them into our array
and then we can loop through and turn in
all quest items so we can say for int I
equals 0 is less than inventory length I
plus plus so this is a symbol for loop I
hope you remember those if not go back
and watch the video because for loops
are kind of essential and then we simply
want to say that then we want to create
an eye part of quest and this is going
to store the quest item and we are going
to set it equal to inventory and then
the index and it's okay so let me just
explain what we're doing here so we're
creating an inventory and the that's
going to act
is an array of items and it's going to
have a total capacity of two the first
inventory item we set eager to a sword
because that derives from a item and the
second spot we said equal to ax and that
also derives from a item then we loop
through all of the elements and the
element that we are currently looking at
is called inventory to I so when we go
through the first time this is going to
be the first element which is the sword
it's going to say inventory zero here
and the second time it's going to be
inventory one which is the X and then we
try and put this into a variable of type
I part of quest and we call this the
quest item so if we just do this it's
going to give us an error because right
now the inventory item is of type a item
and the quest item is of type I part of
quest but we can cast this object into a
I part of Chryst by simply adding an as
I part of quests so now this is read as
create a variable of type I part of
quest and fill it with the inventory
item of index I as as an I part of quest
object so what this does is basically if
the inventory is marked with the I part
of quest tag if it derives from the
interface well then it's simply going to
be transformed into the quest item
available but if it doesn't which are ax
doesn't well then this is not going to
wear again a quest item is going to be
equal to 0 because the ax is not a quest
item and therefore and christum will be
null so now we can write if quest item
is not equal to null meaning if the
object that we are looking at indeed is
marked as a quest item
well then we can go ahead and make sure
then well then we assured that it has a
turnin method and therefore we can call
it so now we can say that we want to
call the turnin method on quest item so
that is completely right and this should
work for any number of items that we
decide to create so let's try and run
this and see if it's actually working so
let's hit play and that website just
want to quickly make some more room here
and now we play again and you can see
that we create a sword and we equip it
and it says that it was equipped then we
take some damage and it was damaged then
we sell it and it says it was sold let
me create an axe we equip it damage it
and sell it and then we create an
inventory array which is basically an
array of eye items then we fill in the
two items that we have then we loop
through it and we check and we try and
force these items into an a variable
called quest item of type I part of
quest and then we check if that
succeeded and if it did meaning it
wasn't equal to null then we turn it in
and you can see here that it says sort
of destiny turned in because that is
indeed marked as a quest item if we were
to go up here and mark the acts also so
I quest part of quest item and we were
to create a method called turn in again
we could just copy and paste the method
here or we could make this completely
different we can say that name here
turned in and then we can say it was it
was an axe
you can see we can change this how we
would like so now when we hit play here
it's going to go through and turn both
of the items in so when we play it says
sort of destiny turned in and fury acts
turned in parenthesis it was an axe cool
so that is basically all I wanted to
show you with interfaces both the really
simple way of looking at it as basically
a way of making your code look cleaner
and easier to follow and the other way
which is using the inventory to kind of
define how object objects should
interact cool so thanks for watching I
hope you enjoyed this video I hope you
could you were able to follow it even
though some of the stuff showed here is
actually fairly complex I'm very proud
if you've gotten this far into this
series so again thanks for watching and
I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
