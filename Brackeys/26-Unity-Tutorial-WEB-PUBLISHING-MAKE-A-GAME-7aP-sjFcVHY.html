welcome to video number 26 and make a
game a core series on making a video
game in unity so in today's video we're
going to take a look at uploading to the
web so this is the plan for today first
up we are going to take a look at
setting up the quality settings in unity
there's also some player settings that
we'll have to configure then we'll talk
about using the unity Web Player versus
exporting for WebGL
and finally we'll configure the HTM it's
your mail file meaning how your game is
presented and then be uploading to
either a site or our own site so I'll
show you a kind of your options on
distributing a web-based game cool so as
always if you have any questions
throughout this video head over to
farmed up practice comm where I'm sure
you'll get your questions answered
awesome so the very first thing was
quality settings so as always let's open
up unity and the player icon is not
going to be important
this time however we'll have to go to
edit project settings and then quality
and you can see our different quality
levels here I excluded them in the last
video because I thought that the default
settings were fine when it comes to a
standalone player however I will give
you the option to tweak this in a web
player so you can see that we have the
different build options here and we have
the different quality levels that you
can check for these and you can choose
the default for each of them here and it
will be highlighted in green so each
level here has some different settings
and you can see fraud for our web here
it uses the medium quality you can also
add a quality T or a quality level and
under the medium quality we see that we
use a pixel light count of 30 that means
that we can have 30 lights in the same
scene at the same time at maximum and
that's fine for us
text record is going to be full rest
which is great
antis tropic and isotropic textures is a
per texture
you can set this to force on if you want
to get rid of this blurring when viewing
textures from certain angles you can see
that it it kind of what that looks like
in the scene here when I change our
point of view and that might be
something that you will want to
prioritize with this game because we're
going to be viewing this from the side
at all times but again I'm just going to
leave it at per texture here so I'll
make so that I'm sure it will run fine
when I'm recording - anti-aliasing I
don't remember but 4x multi sampling on
this one it's if you don't know what an
CL I think does aliasing is it kind of
make sure that you get these smooth
smooth edges so if I just disable this
you can see that we get this these
blocky lines here kind of pixelated and
and harsh and if I bump this up to eight
you can see that it smooths that out
completely so too is decent and I think
it will suit us fine you can turn on
soft particle particles here but that's
not going to be needed for a game and
the rest will just ignore here and when
it comes to shadows I think our settings
are going to be fine I mean we are on
really viewing these shadows framing
from any crazy angles and it does give
us hard and soft shadows which is fine
cool so now that we've kind of set those
up we can also look at what settings it
chooses for our WebGL export here and
those are more moderate currently it's
set to half the resolution no
anti-aliasing you'll notice the pixel
light count is very low this time but
again that doesn't make a huge
difference for us only if we have like a
bunch of coins which all have lied on
them you
you'll notice that and you can also see
that the shadows are too hard shadow
Sony but this is really about playing
around and you can of course read a lot
about how you can optimize your game so
you can pump up these settings cool so
let's go to the player settings so let's
go under project settings and then
player and these can also be accessed
under file build settings and then
player settings from here so right now
you can see that I've go ahead and
changed our bill to WebGL so the default
one is P sigmak and Linux standalone and
if you want to switch platform you
simply select the platform you want to
switch to in my case I've selected WebGL
here and then click switch platform and
it's that easy you can see I could do
the same with Web Player I've just gone
ahead and done this before
IRA started the recording because it can
be a slow process especially if you have
a lot of assets in your scene cool so
you can see here we have a bunch of okay
just while remember this make sure all
of your scenes are in the scenes in
build list or they will not be loaded
and you'll have errors cool so these are
the settings for the WebGL export and
again I'll talk about differences in a
second and here you can see you can
adjust the resolution of the player and
that's something you can also edit at a
later time you can adjust burn that you
want this to be able to run in the
background and I think we'll just leave
that on and then you can choose an HTML
template and we're just going to use the
default one here icon and a splash image
I can pretty much be ignored if you do I
think this requires the pro version
still but you can disable the unity
splash screen that means the unity icon
showing at startup and then we have some
other settings here which I think we'll
just leave for now on the publishing
settings you also have some
configurational options but I think all
of this is a bit too advanced
step the default settings will work just
fine for us so just check that your
company name and product name is as you
want it to be and that the resolution
makes sense for your game then you can
go ahead and hit build and run over here
we don't want to check development build
and then you can choose a place to build
it I've gone ahead and made a builds
folder under the mega game project
folder where I have my Mac builds my
Windows builds and my WebGL builds here
and you can see that I've built this
already because WebGL is still in
preview and therefore might take a quite
a while and sometimes you'll even need
to restart the editor because something
goes wrong in the process so be aware
that this is not really a final solution
okay so I think it's time that we talk
about web player versus WebGL and we'll
take a look at the web player player
settings in a second
so I up till quite recently unity has
been using a plug-in the unity Web
Player plugin that in order to support
playing their games in a browser so you
have this possibility to export to a web
player and then you can upload it to any
kind of web server and all that the user
needs to do in order to play it is visit
the site and then download the plugin if
it isn't installed already
however this this unity plugin uses a
chrome API called the NP API oops I
wrote that wrong so I'll just write it
here the NP API and the NPR API is
basically an API for programming plugins
that Chrome has supported up until quite
recently in 2013 they announced that
this would be soon soon would be
deprecated and then entirely removed and
that forced unity to kind of read
and rethink how they wanted to do unit
games on the web so what this means for
us is that the web player currently
works just fine on Firefox and Internet
Explorer and other browsers but on
Chrome it will not work you can go ahead
and enable the NPAPI still even though
it's deprecated but yeah google has said
that they will entirely remove this
feature in a near future so since most
people are using Chrome the these days
you it's worth considering doing
something else and unity is doing so
they are adding support for WebGL based
games if you don't know WebGL is a
graphics API or it's more than that now
but it's another API for writing games
or graphics software on the browser and
there are a lot of good things about
WebGL first off you drastically reduce
load times you don't have this loading
bar it just jumps right in and also it's
it's now of course supported on Chrome
however WebGL is still in preview and
it's been so for quite a while now and
it's fair to say that WebGL is is pretty
unstable at this point so let me just
show you what this WebGL build looks
like in the browser you can see that
this can be opened in Chrome just go
ahead and do so just a moment here so
we'll open this in chrome oops it I get
an error here just give me one second
and I'll see what's wrong okay so I'm
back and I just quickly read up on what
was happening here well basically I
found this page in the unity
documentation and I'd completely
forgotten about this because it's been a
while since I've uploaded to WebGL
well if you go down here it will say
that you can view your WebGL player
directly in the Firefox browser by
simply opening the index.html file for
safety reasons most other browsers place
restrictions on scripts open from a
local file so this technique will not
work when you're going and build your
game using build and run and then open
it and set it to automatically opening
Chrome however it will work because then
it will temporarily set up and local
server and it did so with me it set up
this localhost five four nine one five
where I can access on my game and this
is going to be different for you but if
it does so that's great and you can open
your game here if not then I suggest you
test it in Firefox well you can see our
game is currently working here and I can
roll back and forward and kick change
the music and I'll go ahead and play the
game here and you can see that we can
also maximize the game and the game is
indeed working not as pretty as the Web
Player but it is indeed working so just
go ahead and die here and you can see
them that works just fine so again if it
didn't set up that localhost and then I
suggest just running it in Firefox when
testing it locally like this but know
that it is supported in the Chrome
browser you just have to host it in
order for people to play it so I'll just
open with Firefox here to show you that
this indeed does work so you can see
that I've opened it in Firefox here and
we'll just wait for it to load and you
can see that loading is much faster than
it would be on a web player I'm using
the plugin cool so that's it for WebGL
what do we do if you want to export to
the much more stable a web player I
think this is the best option so far I
know you're using losing a percentage of
the market but a lot of people play you
know
the games on Firefox and Internet
Explorer and that works just fine so if
we want to build for web player all we
have to do is change switch platform to
the web player and it's just going to
hold on for a second there and all of
these settings we can leave as is then
we'll go over here again we can change
the screen width and screen Heights and
we can change the template again icon
can be ignored the same with a splash
image and all of these other settings
can also be ignored now we'll go ahead
and hit build and run actually I'll just
hit build and then we can make a new
folder and we'll call this Web Player
and we'll just hit select folder and it
will start building so we'll just make
us wait a second here and if we open
this up inside of our Explorer and open
up the web player folder here we can
just check out the folder structure that
it will generate in a second or the file
structure I should say so you can see
here inside a web player it's created
only two files so you can see that
exporting to WebGL it creates this
fairly complicated hierarchy of folders
and files we have the compressed game
you have an HTML file that you use to
load the game in and all of this other
data whereas on in the web player folder
you only have two files you have the
HTML file which shows your game and you
have a dot unity3d file which is the
game itself so you can also see the size
difference between these two so if we
want to now a run our game we'll just
have to right-click and open with
Firefox and you can see that it now
displays right there and it actually
loaded really really quickly but I've
also been loading this game before so
that might be the reason why load times
will often be much lower so you can see
we can play our game here and it looks a
whole lot better than the web player or
the WebGL version
so far so the game is working cool but
what we can do is we can edit this HTML
file oops we can edit the html5 a file
to change the way that we present our
game so in order to do this and this is
very easy especially if you know HTML
we just need to right-click on this HTML
file and hit edit with notepad and this
might look a bit frightening but bear
with me here and you can do the same
thing with the WebGL export so we have
an HTML structure then we have some
JavaScript code we also have some CSS
and then finally we have some more HTML
so the first part here is all of the
HTML that shows above the actual player
the JavaScript is responsible for
loading the player in the CSS is
responsible for styling all of the
animal elements in our HTML and the last
HTML part here is responsible for what
is shown after the actual plugin and
this also contains an error if the web
player is not supported in the browser
isn't installed so we can actually just
go ahead and change a bunch of things
here so we for example change this from
unity Web Player mega came to as
something else if you want to do that we
can go down here and change the font
size and weight and all of that or maybe
since this is a brackish tutorial we
could add on to this so here it says
that it was created with unity you can
say and using the make a game tutorial
series from a from and then Frankie's
and we'll change the title here to go to
practice calm and we'll change the UIL
here to practice
so we can save this out and we can close
this we can run this with Firefox and
you can see that it loads in the game
and down here it says creative with
unity and using the mega game to tour
you'll see Ruiz from brackets and you
can click that there and it will go to
brackish comm so you can change that
file however you want it to be cool so
now that you have your game you've
chosen the option that you want to
export it that you want to use when
exporting you have chosen how you want
it to display now you have to choose how
you want it to be uploaded well before
we have this possibility of uploading
unity games using Dropbox but that has
gotten pretty clunky lately and it's not
even really an option for free Dropbox
accounts that are free so instead we are
going to have to look at two
possibilities the first one is uploading
to a site and if this is something you
want to do well then you can just
completely ignore your HTML file then
you'll go ahead and upload this unity3d
file and places to upload to could be
congregate or you could also upload to
something like what's it called it's
called new grounds or armor games there
are a bunch of places that you can place
your game if you don't want to host it
yourself so for example here you see the
congregate website where you can go and
you can see that I've uploaded a game
here called kill pill quite a long time
ago and you can go in here and simply
hit upload your game fill in some
information and a category and then
upload the unity3d file and all that so
that is definitely an option or if you
want to host this yourself well then you
can just if you're using WordPress or
whatever use some kind of
FTP client so FTP stands for File
transferring protocol I'm using the
program called FileZilla but this will
require some hosting so you will have to
kind of pay for a domain of course own
brackish comm so if I just quickly go
ahead and connect to my website here
there we go you can see all of the files
that are on the brackish com domain on
my hosting provider and I'm using
WordPress but most or pretty much all
web file structures has a public HTML
folder where you can place different
files that you want people to be able to
access without requiring a password or
getting through any kind of protection
and in here we can then create a
directory and we can maybe name this
make a game and we can double click that
and then we can simply drag our two
files into this so we'll maybe rename
this to make a game web build and we'll
rename this to the same drag those two
in there and actually let's just make
sure that we we probably need to yeah we
need to edit the name of the unity file
in here too so whenever you change the
file there you need to change it that
too because it initializes the plug-in
by loading this file so I think that's
all we need to do hopefully let's just
make sure that this is working by
running it in Firefox yep that was all
we needed to do and so we need to do the
same thing here you can simply remove
those two and drag in the new versions
there we go and now you should be able
to go to your domain so I'll type in
brackish com
/ make a game / make a game web build
dot HTML and you can see that it says
Chrome cannot run this app and if we do
the same thing in Firefox if we open
this up it should simply load the game
so you can now share this URL with all
your friends and they will be able to
unload that out-groups
leave that cool so that's basically how
you can export your game for the web you
have some different options there and
how you can upload it to a side of your
choosing I know that unity games on the
web is kind of on a weird middle ground
right now
where it's in the process of
transitioning from the web player to
WebGL but try and look at is added as a
lot of possibilities instead of a lot of
restrictions which is sometimes can feel
like so I hope you enjoyed this video
and found it informational and a lot of
these things depending on what you
choose to something that will require
you to search up on how to upload to
congregate or a guide on FTP uploading
to a server and all that because it's
simply too much for me to cover in one
video but you should get hopefully get
an understanding on how this work from
this video so that pretty much concludes
the make a game course I don't have much
more to show you when it comes to this
game and I hope you've enjoyed the
process and and learning some stuff with
me and well from this point I suggest
you check out some of the other courses
that are available on the brackish
YouTube channel there are a lot of stuff
on c-sharp programming both inside and
outside of unity which I suggest you
check out a cool thing to start doing
now with maybe learning from the how-to
Grahame in c-sharp course and then maybe
using that together with the how to make
a 2d platformer course in order to get a
deep understanding of how to program in
C sharp and how to apply more advanced
programming concepts to game development
in unity so that's really something I
suggest you check out now and that will
be some links on the screen here
so click on those and again thanks for
watching make sure you subscribe to stay
tuned for the next series that I will be
introducing which I hope will be super
cool and yeah thanks for watching and
I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
