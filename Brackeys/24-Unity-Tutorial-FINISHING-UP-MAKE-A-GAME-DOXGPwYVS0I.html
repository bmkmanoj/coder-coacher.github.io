welcome to video number 24 and make a
game eco series on making a video game
in unity so this video is called
finishing up and it's not going to be
the very last video in this series
because I want to do a couple of videos
at least on building your game and
exporting to different platforms but I
also wanted to do this video that just
took care of some loose ends and just
polish the result a little bit so the
stuff that we are going to be doing
today is first off we are going to just
adjust the controls because I think that
they are a bit annoying at the moment
then we're going to create an enemy
death sound and that's going to be
pretty much a powerup sound of some
sorts then we are just going to quickly
do some organisation and finally we're
going to add an icon to our game and the
software that I'm going to be using for
this is Photoshop because that's what
I'm most familiar with but pretty much
you can use any kind of 2d editing
software like GIMP which is free or you
could even go ahead and download UPA
toolkit from the unity asset store it's
an asset by me which allows you to
create pixel add really easily inside of
unity so if you wanted to make a cool
pixel art logo you could use that cool
so but the things I'm going to
explaining be explaining our pretty
general and I will also provide you with
the finished icon if you don't want to
make one yourself awesome so as always
if you have any questions throughout the
video go to firmed up practice comm and
now that we've said all that let's just
get started with today's video don't
mind me using the pro skin everything is
still going to apply to you okay so
first thing on the list here is controls
so if I just go out and play the game
right now and just turn off my monitors
you
the music down there doesn't feed into
my microphone you can see that I we have
a working menu with a music slide and
all that if we'd play game we can play
through the game and I've just made some
very few adjustments I've simply pulled
apart the platform's a bit so the
character doesn't get stuck between them
and also you can see here if we just
complete this level I've made a second
point and that's simply using all of the
same assets just one enemy we have some
coins placed in different places and all
I've done with this platform here simply
rotated in a bit around the z-axis but
this beat and yes it looks like I didn't
complete it there but if you and you can
see I've placed placed a I'm going to
loop to here a check point right there
and if you get down there it simply
takes you to the end level scene which
of course this place our score cool so
that's basically all there is to the
game right now and you can of course
expand on this but I think that's going
to be the finished state that I'm going
to export my built in or in my gaming so
let's start out by just adjusting these
controls so if we go under the ball and
go into the ball control script I first
off want to kind of make the controls
more snappy and a pretty easy way to do
this is bump up the angular drag angular
drag is basically the resistance on your
rotational movement so if we bump this
up all the way to 10 and then increase
our rotation speed to be 10 folds which
is 2000 and then bump up the mass to 2
we're going to get a lot of resistance
and a lot of we are going to need a lot
of power in order to rotate the
rigidbody but once we have that power
it's going to feel a lot more snappy
we're going to accelerate quicker more
quickly and we're going to be able to
erection more quickly so you can see
here what that does and it actually
makes it a lot more fun to play because
now you actually have a chance in
controlling whether or not you kid an
enemy
cool so that was the first thing next up
is the enemy Tet sound so if you haven't
already you can download the make it
game assets from brackish comm and I'm
just quickly going to show you how to do
that so of course brackish calm simply
go there go under projects select make a
game and simply download the scripts and
assets right there cool and once those
are downloaded it's simply a sip file so
you should be able to open it without an
extractor or if you have issues you can
use WinRAR then we go under your audio
and I've made this oil I've found this
powerup file and from a freesound.org
and I've made sure that the license is
Creative Commons zero so you can use it
in any way you wish also for commercial
projects so if I just play this quickly
uh wait a second let me just turn on my
monitors here
there we go so it's kind of this
rewarding sound that the player should
hear when he kills an enemy so let's
load that into our game so simply drag
it and hover over unity and simply drop
it under the audio folder and it should
rest in here so we can find the powerup
sound there and what we basically want
to do here is find our enemy object the
enemy center here and well this gets
deleted the second that we killed the
enemy it fine
I'm correct here so let's check that out
look in the hierarchy over here actually
it doesn't so that's perfect or remember
we did the death animation and all that
so all we need to do is basically just
attach a audio source here and drag in
the boobs what's the null reference
let's double click that to open it up in
in what should be monodevelop I see that
I've still configured this with visual
studio so I'm just going to change this
in the edit project nope preferences
external tools are quickly to switch
that to mono develop cool so let's try
and open that in monodevelop
and see what this error is all about
cool so it's trying to restart our level
but apparently it cannot find the
gamemaster is what it looks like so
we'll simply say that if game if game
master is not equal to null then we want
to restart our level and this is a very
handy thing that a lot of people don't
know if you hold down alt and press up
and down you can move lines like that so
that's super useful so let's try that
again
I'm just going to jump on him there we
go so now we don't have any issues okay
so basically what we want to do is
rename this audio source and we can drag
in the powerup clip and the audio is
just going to be the it's not going to
be anything in particular we don't need
any control over this and the volume
we're going to have to see about that
so basically let's uncheck play on awake
and let's find a way to trigger this
sound so let's double click on the enemy
and add some code onto this so let's
start by making a reference so death
particles also going to make a VAR death
sound of type audio source yeah that's
perfect and then under the die method we
want to instantiate death particles and
we want to say death sound
play and this takes in a parameter if
you want but that's a delay in samples
so that's not something we're going to
be needing a call and now we can simply
drag this audio source in there and
everything should be working you want to
make sure to set the spatial blend to 2d
if you wanted to play as normal but if
you want that 3d sound sense of
direction then you can of course use the
slider I want this to be entirely 2d
let's try that
that's perfect I didn't want this huge
sound just a small one to indicate that
we've done something great okay so let's
now just hit apply on that and all of
those settings should save and we can
also hit apply on our ball if we didn't
do that before which I don't think we
did so we are speeding through these
points today then next up is
organization because I want this project
to look a bit more needy so let's take
our current score destructable down hit
end point
enemy final score and kill on hit
scripts and drag them under the scripts
folder let's also make a scenes folder
so let's create a folder called scenes
and drag in our levels and our main menu
and next up we have these two materials
so let's drag them under the materials
folder great so now everything is just
as it should be one thing I like to do
is I like to have the opening scene
which would be our main menu in the root
assets folder this way people know what
to click if they download the project
and want to start from the very
beginning next up we go under file build
settings and make sure that all of your
scenes are in the build settings that's
very important cool so the final thing
that we need to do is just creating an
icon so let's do this we could use
several assets from the game in creating
this icon for example we could use on
this guy but since this guy is modeled
after a Mario character that might be a
bit too much so we could use the ball
here but I really like the look of our
coin right now so let's actually snap
take a snapshot of that so let's just
temporarily disable everything but that
a coin that is in the frame so let's
disable on the ball let's disable the
platform - there we go and now we can go
in here
we can turn off the skybox using this
button here we want the lighting to be
on because I like the lighting effect
that comes from the Sun being high a
heightened a bit and then we can turn
off all of these gizmos that are also in
the way we could do 3d icons and just
size them all the way down which i think
is what we're going to do we can also
turn off the grid and now we actually
have a clean background to use so let's
just zoom in on this - we'll get get a
pretty HD picture you can also
fullscreen this by using shift space
which I'm going to do and you will
notice that it is clear that this is a
fairly low poly object but I think that
will be fine for our case so now let's
go under our snipping tool some kind of
or Windows uses the snipping tool for
screenshots on Mac this would be command
shift 4 in order to take a screenshot
where you can select part of the screen
as as the image you want to take oops oh
well I did something crazy there so
let's zoom back in on the coin and we
need to find a good angle I think we
want it kind of from the side here so
something like that looks fairly decent
and whoops Jesus Christ but why does it
keep doing that so let's try and zoom in
on the corn here let's do this one last
time I think I I hit them some kind of
mouse button there okay so let's take
the snipping tool again command shift 4
on the Mac let's hit new let's just drag
around this fine now let's save this as
coin you can just save it on the desktop
so far and let's open up Photoshop
and just clean up my desktop here bit
cool so basically all we're going to do
is we are going to create a new image
and I like to make this a much larger
larger than it needs to be let's do 1920
by 1920 or actually 1080 by 1080 it's
going to be fine and we're going to call
this the make a game logo or icon and
let's just hit OK it's going to create
this image now let's double click on the
background rename this to BG and let's
drag in our coin call let's scale up
this coin and let's now remove this ugly
looking background so we can just use
the magic wand to do this let's just see
how that looks
first click to make a selection let's
then pressed ctrl shift I to invert that
selection and then click on the mask
down here the layer mask and it will
mask away all that so that actually
looks fairly good and we could do some
more stuff with this I think that we
should maybe do some kind of background
for this so let's go ahead and create a
rounded rectangle tool let's select a
color for this I am maybe some kind of a
deep blue could be fun here let's round
the corners a bit more than 10 pixels
let's try 40 pixels let's try and drag
this by pressing in the center then
holding shift and alt something like
this then let's Center this both this
and the coin by pressing ctrl and then
clicking on the
b:g here that will select our entire
screen we could also just use the
rectangular marquee tool here and just
mic everything off and then we want to
select this rounded rectangle go under
layer align layers to selection vertical
centers and layer align layers to
selection horizontal centers and we'll
do the same thing with our coin so let's
just drag this under our coin image or
layer align layers to selection vertical
layer align layers to a selection
horizontal just to make sure that it's
in the center now we can scale this up
to fit our entire screen cool and let's
see what do we want to do with this you
can see here that the mask hasn't been
perfect so let's just make sure to
delete simply select the mask over here
then hit M select all of this and just
delete that just to make sure that we
don't have any ugly edges once we export
this maybe it would have been a good
idea to like increase the radius on this
to something more but I think for now
we're just going to stick with the 40
here I'm doing this fairly quickly just
to demonstrate how you would go about
doing this so we can play around with
some different colors here I kind of
like this light blue which is also kind
of a a theme color for animega game
series so let's just stick with that and
we can maybe do some kind of
cool-looking edge on this so let's
duplicate the rounded rectangle and just
drag it in a bit and let's make this
darker and still give it a bit of blue
I'll show you something cool you can do
with this just in a moment and then we
can
click this and select inner shadow and
bump up the size on this and that really
add some depth to the picture and now we
can just change the color of our edge
here because I want it to be kind of
more bright that is pretty fine I want
the edge to be larger because the icon
is going to be fairly small and we can
also give the coin here a drop shadow so
drop shadow on that signs it up a bit
that looks fairly nice we could also
make it glow if you wanted to but I
think we are just going to not we could
also add a bevel to the outside here but
I think that's going to be a bit too
much however it would be pretty nice to
add some kind of gradient to that so
let's go into creating overlay and let's
change this to luminosity and let's
actually let's change this to overlay
instead and let's bump down the opacity
quite a bit on that so something like
this looks like a pretty cool icon it's
very simple and easy to just take an
element from your game which you think
is pretty central and then just kind of
make a background for it and whoops you
have an icon so I think we're just going
to stick with this it's not perfect but
I think it will be pretty good for now
so let's go on to file save as let's
locate our project folder actually I'm
just going to save this into our our
asset pack so let's go under Mac assets
here let's go and do textures I guess I
really want this to be named images
maybe actually let's just save this in
the root folder so make a game icon and
this is going to be the PSD version
save and also we'll make a JPEG version
for those of you who have not who don't
have Photoshop installed and now we can
simply open up uni we can go and simply
drag these into the root folder of unity
so I'm simply going to you know discard
my changes to the scene going to main
menu and hit don't save because we don't
want to save those changes and we can go
back in and enable all of the gizmos
here and show the grid again and whoops
we are back and let's just go under the
Mac assets let's go and drag in I'm just
going to drag in the PST in a unity and
you can see it imports the icon nicely
we're then going to change this from
texture to sprite and you can basically
leave all of these we want the filter
mode to be bilinear you could do
trilinear and we want it to be true
color and a maximum of 2048 just perfect
hit apply on that and now we can go and
simply insert this into our build
settings so if you go into build
settings select the platform you want to
go into player settings you can see that
we can change this to this company name
is Brad keys the product name is make a
game and you can simply drag in the
default icon and you can see it's scale
here so once you build this and I'm just
going to do a quick test build hope that
this works out or I'm going to go into
depth
way more depth with the build settings
in some of the next videos but now let's
just build this into the desk in to find
the Dropbox here Mac
make a game and let's create a separate
folder here called builds and let's call
this test build it's going to say that
and it's going to start building okay so
it's done building and you can see that
windows sometimes has this weird bug
where it shows the icon at really low
resolution but I find that sometimes if
you just move it from one folder to
another it refreshes and other times you
have to restart and that's I don't know
it's some weirdness but we're going to
look into making it into an installable
and all that in another video but just
for now if we hold down ctrl and zoom in
on this we can see that it's actually
pretty high resolution and that it looks
really nicely and if we open that it's
of course going to start up the game
cool so that was basically all for this
video I hope you enjoyed it and I'm
looking forward to finally building our
game properly in the next video so
thanks for watching and I hope you
enjoyed it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
