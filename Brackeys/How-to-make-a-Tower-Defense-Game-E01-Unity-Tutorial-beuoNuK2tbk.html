everyone and welcome to the first video
on creating a tower defense game in
unity I'm really really excited about
this video both because tower defense
games are awesome to make it's really
fun and I have a lot of stuff that I
want to show you but also because this
is the very first video I'm doing since
going full time with break YZ I'm taking
my chances and investing all of my time
into the channel that means that you
will see more new content such as this
and more content on this series we
already have growing such as the
multiplayer FPS and the 2d platformer
course so that's really really exciting
and to make all of this possible I've
started a patreon page because let's
face it I do have to pay rent where you
can donate monthly ah to support me on
my mission and that's really exciting
the page itself looks like this you can
click the screen now to be taking over
here I offer some humble rewards in
return and the first 25 or the first 5
people to donate $25 or more will get
whatever project they're working on
featured on Twitter Facebook and on the
forum so if you're excited about this
just as I am you should go here and at
least check it out if it's something for
you I I really appreciate it you are no
way forced to do this but it's awesome
and thanks to the people who have
already donated so without further ado
let's get right into today's video so
I've opened up unity and I'm using
version 5.3 point 5 but you can pretty
much use any version that you want to
it's not going to matter too much for
what we are going to be doing so to
create a new project we are going to hit
new then we are going to type in the
name of our project that's in my case
going to be tower defense tutorial you
can select the location and choose 3d
and the reason why is I recently sent
out a poll on Facebook and Twitter
asking whether or not the search should
be in 3d or 2d along with the question
of what programming language we should
be using and the result of the poll is
on the screen now and that was of course
3d and c-sharp so that's what we're
going to be doing
and then hit create project which I've
already done and opened it up in unity
and then it should look like this so the
first thing that I want to do here is
populate our scene with some of the
stuff that we are going to need in there
and these some of these graphics might
be temporary
but it's great to get something in there
that we can use and the basics of any
tower defense game is some kind of start
and end point for your enemies to walk
from one to another and then a path that
they take in getting there and also we
need some place where we can place
turrets in our case any turret is going
to be placed on a platform that we call
a node so let's go ahead and make a node
right now so right-click in the
hierarchy go to 3d object select cube
then we're going to reset the transform
do a scale of 4 by 1 5 4 and then hit F
to assume a nod so you can see here that
we are going to keep the box Collider
and the mesh renderer that's all very
fine and what we can then do is rename
this one to node and drag it down to in
the to the project to make it into a
prefab then we can create an empty game
object which we will also reach set the
transform on and rename to notes and
this is simply going to store all of our
node and all of our node objects as
children so that's perfect what we can
do now is we can simply duplicate this
node then we can move it over using ctrl
and I'm going to leave a small space
here and I just want a bunch of nodes
here that will be a bunch of places that
we can place turrets and also show the
confines of our map so let's go ahead
and make a grid of some of these nodes
and of course if you make your map too
big it's going to be very slow this
method of doing it that optimizations
that you can make but as long as you
give your map a reasonable size it's
really not going to be an issue
especially because unity has gotten so
good at handling a lot of
objects of the same type so let's select
these two by holding down shift hit
control D to duplicate and holding down
control again to move them over and keep
doing this in shifting direction so that
we end up with a complete square and we
I will just keep doing this just a few
more times to get a map of a reasonable
size and we can do this just once more
here in this direction and one time in
the other direction of course this if
this is going to be a mobile game you'll
have to think more about performance but
this here is going to be fine for any
reasonable desktop it's going to be just
fine so all of our notes are now in here
and the good thing is that we made it
into a prefab so if we change one all of
them will change so what we can do now
is simply collapse this nodes here and
then we will save our scene just to be
on the safe side and I'm going to call
this the main scene and what we can do
is now specify a path for enemies to
walk along so I want our enemies to
start up here so I'm going to select
this node and delete it and end down
here select that node and delete it and
we will not do the same with any notes
that these enemies should walk over and
then delete them and then instead create
some kind of ground object that they
will move along so let's go ahead and
make a path by simply selecting objects
here I want them to and again I'm
holding down shift to do this I warn
them - oops that was a wrong one are the
transform is getting in the way there so
I want them to walk down there then over
here and then up a bit then I want them
to walk over and then take a path down
again and this time I want them to go
way down here over here and then around
and we can make them go up a bit and
over and I
and over and then I want them to take
the straight path down here to their
final destination point so this is what
my path is going to look like you can of
course change yours to whatever you want
and make different levels in this way so
this is going to be the first level and
what I'm going to do now is create some
ground objects to fill out these empty
spaces so let's right-click go to 3d
objects select cube again reset the
transform on this and name this a ground
object then we can go ahead and maybe
move this over again holding down ctrl
make this a 4x4 by default you can watch
it here zoom in on it by hitting F let's
then create a new material for this so
create material and call this one ground
and we are going to drag it on there and
then let's change the albedo to
something a bit more dark grayish that
we can bump up the metallic Ness just a
bit and turn the smoothness all the way
down to make it a very matte material so
that looks kind of great and it's very
clear that this node is different from
the others so that's perfect and what we
can then do is you can of course go with
the same node design here but instead I
simply want to scale up this node to
fill out the entire path so in order to
do this that's maybe move it over
towards the center here of this small
area of the path then we can instead of
just scaling like this we can go in and
choose edit snap settings and here we
can adjust how our objects snap to the
grid and in this case we want the scale
to snap every one units so I'm going to
scale it up here and it looks like
everyone units actually wasn't perfect
because now we're getting this offset
which we don't want so let's choose 0.1
again here and then we can find adjust
this so let's do that's actually too
much so we can do point zero one or you
can simply type in the correct and
upload up here which I'm going to do so
let's try
twenty-nine here oops 29 and then move
this over with a tool and it's still
offset because our movement is now
offset so what we can simply do is set
the position here and you can see this
right here is the exposition to
seventeen point five and that's perfect
so now it's snapped correctly and that
looks fine then we can go ahead and
duplicate this object rotate it by 90
degrees move it down here again by
holding down control and you can see
again that this is snapped incorrectly
so maybe we should set these to 0.5 on
the X and Z so we can move it down there
and then we can scale it in and I want
to do this every 0.1 units and move it
over and you can just keep doing this to
fill out the entire level something like
that and then we can again duplicate
this and rotate it back and I'm just
going to do this to fill out the entire
path and when I'm done I'm going to be
back
okay so I'm done creating our map and
this looks just fine you could of course
spend more time on this than I do but
for the sake of the tutorial let's
continue and let's right-click in the
hierarchy to create another empty object
and I'm just going to reset this and
call this one environment and then we
can take all of our ground objects and
drag them into the environment and close
that off just like that then let's
create a object that will act as our
starting point and one that will act as
our ending point and again you know the
procedure 3d object cube reset it call
this one start and I'm going to do
capital letters on this one and yeah so
that's fine and let's go ahead and add a
material for this so actually this start
node here needs to be four by four on
the X and Z as well and then I'm
thinking four on the Y so what we can do
with this is that we can actually move
it up by two point five and then we can
drag it over to stand on our ground here
and I'm just going to drag it over so
it's x correctly something like that and
this is going to be the starting point
so I think this looks just fine and what
we can do with this is that we can then
change the material so let's create a
new material and this is going to be
this start and I'm just going to drag
that on there
and then change the albedo to something
um let's see let's change this to
something green so some kind of matte
green I think that color there looks
just fine let's again bump down the
smoothness quite a bit and maybe just a
bit of metallic no no metal Ignace on
this one and I don't want this to be on
too saturated so something like that
looks pretty nice I think and then we
can simply duplicate this node and then
drag it over here and make this one our
end node so there we go and this is
going to be our end and we are going to
create a
material for this I'm just going to
duplicate this start material and call
this one end let's drag it on there as
well and change the albedo to something
more red and we want this to be a bit
more saturated so it's very clear that
this is a red color great so it's going
to walk from this star that's maybe just
a bit too much something like that looks
nice on my screen at least so it's going
to walk from start and all the way along
this path over to our end node and we
should be able to remove the box
colliders on the start and end node
along with the colliders on all of our
ground objects so let's just remove the
box Collider on those and if you are
very smart you had made the ground
object into a prefab I did not think
about this you might as well do it if
you haven't created them yet but for now
unities multiple object selection works
just fine so let's save this scene and
this is pretty much going to include the
very first video on this in the next one
we are going to make this scene come to
life a bit more so I hope you enjoyed
this video I hope that you're looking as
much forward to future videos in this
series as I am and again thanks to all
of the amazing patreon supporters so
thanks for watching the video and I'll
see you in the next one thanks to all of
the awesome patreon supporters who have
donated so far and a special thanks to
