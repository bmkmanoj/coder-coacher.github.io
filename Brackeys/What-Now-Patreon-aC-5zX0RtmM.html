welcome to a video I've been looking
forward to making for a very long time
as some of you might know I'm now
finished with my education and ready to
go full time with practice that means
I'll be able to make more videos while
spending more time on each one
I currently get a bit of revenue from
YouTube ads however it's not enough to
pay the rent what I really want to avoid
is having to do more client work instead
of focusing on the YouTube channel so as
many of you have suggested me to do I've
started a patreon page so what is
patreon you might ask patreon is a way
for you to support brackets with a
monthly donation in return or for some
humble rewards depending on the amount
your pledge you can of course opt in and
out at any time
here are my plans for the future of this
channel regularly scheduled videos yes
that means more than one video a week
new exciting tutorial series are
suggested by the community I've already
begun work on a cool tower defense game
that I can't wait to show you and don't
worry you'll also see more videos on
this series we already have going live
streams curate sessions and maybe a set
up video more free assets to use in your
projects free source code for all the
tutorials so you can boot it up and play
around with it yourself development
locks I'll invite you inside my
development process to show you what I'm
working on I also have some secret
projects in the making I did not just
tell you that
so click the annotation on the screen to
be taken to the patreon page
let's pretty much it for now I can't
wait to see what we can do together to
make game development easier for
everyone and thanks for being the most
awesome community on the planet
