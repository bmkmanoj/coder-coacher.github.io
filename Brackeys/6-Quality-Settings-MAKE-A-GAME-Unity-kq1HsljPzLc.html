everyone and welcome to video number 6
and make a game a short series on making
a cool little video game in unity in
this one we are going to take a look at
quality settings or render settings
inside of unity those two are often
confused so I'm just going to clear that
up and we're going to talk about stuff
like anti-aliasing and how many lights
you can have in your scene and just
overall the adjusting the quality of our
game so let's dive right into it
actually before we do I just have a very
short sneak peek into the game I'm
developing at the moment called squid
soul and this is just a wallpaper I made
for it you haven't seen anything yet and
it's not coming soon in an alpha version
to PC &amp;amp; Mac and it's not called quick so
so let's continue with the video here so
first off let's open up unity as always
and to get to the quality settings go to
edit project settings and go to quality
and this is basically how advanced you
want the graphics to be for your game
and if you're making a game yet that
you're serious about you really want the
player to be able to select how good of
a quality the graphics should be so that
if they're on a computer who can handle
that much on they can change change it
up to make it run better on the hardware
so unity have made a really really nice
system for us to to adjust this and they
use what is called levels and basically
you can add some yourself and call them
whatever you want but these are quality
levels so that you can switch between
and you can standardize on different
platforms and make available on
different platforms so that once you
release the game to a lot of platforms
the users will be able to choose
their quality and let's just take a look
at the prefab they set up by default
that's like the fastest one we can see
now we don't have any shadows and the
anti-aliasing is completely off no and
an isotropic textures and the texture
quality is as horrible all of this is
just turned off and if you go to
fantastic we can see some much more
smooth edges still not that incredible
we can see some detail shadows and and
such so it changes up the way the
graphics are rendered and and this is
not that visible in our game because we
don't have that many graphics in there
but once you start to get more it
becomes very visible but basically I
think there are way too many levels for
our game so let's delete that's the
least lead fast let's delete simple and
let's delete beautiful so we have fast
good and we have fantastic and let's
rename the fastest - let's rename this
to fast or low-quality let's just say
low quality and let's adjust the
settings here so basically this is going
to run on the lowest quality devices and
pixel light count is how many lights can
be shown on one objects and this is
actually not that taxing on the computer
you can easily increase this to at least
10 on on a a older desktop computer if
you're on mobile devices you have to be
a lot more careful then I would lower it
by quite a bit but definitely for
computers you can always stay above 10
the texture quality let's make that half
resolution and now so a non isotropic
texture is let's make that pear texture
anti-aliasing
let's say that's completely disabled
soft particles is something that we will
just keep off shadows I think we should
enable shadows since they add quite a
lot to the game let's make hard shadows
only and they should be medium
resolution actually let's do low
resolution this is really up to you and
it depends completely on how much you
have in the scene because our level is
so simple we could easily bump this up
but I'm just going to assume that you
have made more than what I have here so
okay so the low resolution stable fit is
fine no Cascades and the shadow distance
let's increase that to 30 and that's
basically how far away you need or how
close you need to be to the subject
before the shadow shows and the
resolution is how edgy the shadow looks
so if we turn on the light here you can
see here there are some jagged edges and
that is removed by increasing the
resolution and hard and soft shadows
that's not something you need to worry
about if you have the free version of
unity now let's go back into the quality
settings here and let's adjust the
second layer let's call this medium
quality not all these fenced terms and
let's increase the light here to 50 and
that's way more than you're going to
need but that's okay we could also do 30
just to make it more realistic and the
texture quality now we want it to be
full resolution we want this to be per
texture still until lasting I think we
can easily bump that to at least 2 maybe
even 4 and the shadows both hard and
soft shadows definitely and medium
resolution you could do hi I'm just
going to stick to medium and fantastic
nuts and when we get to bump it up quite
a lot so let's make this high quality
and the pixel light count could be a
hundred a texture quality full
resolution forced on anti-aliasing
that up to eight soft particles are fine
the high-risk very high-resolution
shadows and that all looks really great
what you can do is add a make this a
little less expensive on the hardware
and then make an ultimate quality a
fantastic quality because there are
there is quite a gap between medium and
high quality but it's it's really it
doesn't make that great of a difference
but whenever we play tests you normally
want to be in the highest quality so you
can get all the detail right and then
later play test in low quality settings
and if you are your legs biking or
something because you both have to run
unity and the player you can bump it
down to something like medium but that
was basically it for the quality tab
I also mended mentioned the render
settings and these are often confused
you get to them by going to edit render
settings and now you can see we've been
here before in one of the previous
videos we just light the ambient light
how we liked it and that's done under
the reading render settings whoops I
jumped out there and this is where you
can add stuff like you can change
default skyboxes default textures of
different kinds flares and halo you
really don't need to tweak that this
that much in an audience ordinary game
you might add some not in our game
yet at least and you might add a default
skybox material but really you should
just leave this be ambient light though
it is very important and you should
definitely have a look at how you want
the ambient like to be cool and one
thing to mention the render settings are
scene oriented so if I make a new scene
and I want some fog in there I can just
turn that on and the old scene will
still have it disabled whereas the
quality settings are for the whole game
a cool so now let's make some defaults
on our different levels so
let's just assume that we're going to
run this as a standalone that means that
you build it for PC and Mac and let's
set the default level here by pressing
the arrow beneath the arrow which means
standalone and let's change this to high
quality so now that's going to be
selected by default and let's see the
phone here that must be an iPhone let's
change that to low quality the same with
the Android phone that's changed that to
low the BlackBerry definitely though
Windows Store apps that depends on where
they display let's say medium the WP
AIDS and the Windows Phone 8 low quality
and that one that must be the booyah
don't know that much about its hardware
I'm not I don't think you're going to be
publishing to that but er let's just
bump that up to high and then for the
web player let's make that medium
quality by default and hope they follow
along they're both web right so let's
just make that a medium quality and that
was pretty much it for this tutorial I
hope you enjoyed it and I'll see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
