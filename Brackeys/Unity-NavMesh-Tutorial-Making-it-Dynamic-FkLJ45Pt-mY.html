set up simple pathfinding in unity in
this video we'll go over how we can make
our navmesh dynamic so that it will
update to changes in game will use the
obstacle component to easily make moving
objects part of our navmesh we'll also
have a look at generating in navmesh at
runtime in the case that you don't know
the layout of your level beforehand also
this video is sponsored by unity so
let's jump right into it so here's an
even more stripped-down scene than the
previous video all we have is a ground
plane and a player the player has a nav
mesh component that we set up in the
previous video and we also have a nav
mesh object in here with a nav mesh
surface which we can go ahead and hit
bake on and we can see right away that
it bakes a nav mesh on our ground as
always you can use the link in the
description if you want to get the
example scenes as well as the nav mesh
components the thing that I'm using here
is example 2 so before we start diving
into obstacles and changing the nav mesh
in real time there's another feature
that I want to show you
it's called volume modifiers if we go
ahead and right click on a nav mesh and
hit create empty we now add a component
here and I'm gonna search for a nav mesh
modifier and I'm gonna select the nav
mesh modifier volume a volume modifier
is basically a way for us to mark a
certain part of our nav mesh with a
specific area type this way we don't
have to link it to a particular object
but we can just say that anything within
this bounding box will have some kind of
area type we can easily edit the volume
by clicking this edit volume button and
now we can drag on the sides here I'm
holding down alt to scale uniformly and
we also select what area type we want to
override with if we go ahead and select
not walkable and go back to the nav mesh
and hit bake right away we are going to
see a hole in our nav mesh so that's
just a really cool feature that I wanted
to show you but so far we've been
hitting bake every time we want to
change the nav mesh what if we have
moving elements in our scene that we
want to affect pathfinding for this we
use obstacles so that's rebec our scene
here let's go and create one of these
obstacles well right-click in the Harkey
go 3d object and select a cube let's
reset the transform on this cube let's
move it up by
on the Y and it's changed the scale to
two by one by two I've also prepared a
material that we can use under materials
and I'm gonna drag the same and then
gonna rename our cube to obstacle and as
expected if we select our navmesh it's
going to completely ignore our obstacle
to change this
we'll go and select our obstacle hit add
component and this time we want to add
the navmesh obstacle component if we
open this up we have a few different
settings the first one is the shape here
we can select between a box and a
capsule in our case we're using a box we
then change the center and size of our
obstacle but I'm just gonna leave all
those as is and now if we go and select
our navmesh we can see that for some
reason it's still not reacting to our
obstacle that's because of a very
important setting under our obstacle
called carve the reason for this setting
is that we have kind of two obstacle
modes this is because we can use
obstacles in two ways if we leave carve
unchecked
we'll just rely on what we referred to
as obstacle avoidance this is something
that our agent component does and we
actually have some settings for it right
here obstacle avoidance is when our
agent will do its best to avoid
obstacles that are nearby but it won't
actually include it in path finding so
whenever it's creating a path it won't
take our obstacles into consideration
only once it gets close to one will it
kind of try and stay away the second way
is using carve if we check this our
obstacle will actually go ahead and cut
out a piece of our navmesh and so our
agent will plan its route around our
obstacle from the very beginning to show
you the difference between these two
methods I've gone ahead and created a
bunch of obstacles each one of these
have a script that will animate them
back and forth as well as the navmesh
obstacle component currently carve is
set to false if we go ahead and play we
can see that the obstacles start moving
if we select our navmesh and hold down
control and select all player and go to
the top right of our game view to make
sure kids mouse is enabled we can
actually see that when we click around
the path that our player is calculating
is visible and because
the obstacles aren't set to carb we can
see that our agent won't actually
calculate a pass to try and avoid them
it will only kind of try and move out
the way once it gets close if we select
our player we actually have some
settings under the nav mesh agent that
configures this behavior if your game is
relying a lot on moving obstacles I
suggest to play around with these
settings here we can adjust the radius
and height of the agent as well as the
quality of the obstacle avoidance we can
see that by increasing the radius our
agent will now take a greater path
around the obstacles but of course there
is another way let's select all the
obstacles and enable carve we'll also
make sure to disable carve only
stationary if this is enabled the
obstacle won't carve out a piece of the
mesh if it's moving and since our
obstacles are moving all the time we
definitely want to disable this if you
then again select the player and the
navmesh
and hit play we can clearly see that our
obstacles are now changing the mesh and
if we press on some point on the map
that our path actually gets calculated
around these obstacles pretty cool so
that's how we can add obstacles to our
game but since we are editing the nav
mesh at runtime this isn't very
performant it's fine to use for a few
objects but we want to beg as much as
possible beforehand however sometimes we
don't know the full layout of our level
before the game starts this is often the
case if your procedurally generating a
level luckily we can easily generate a
nav mesh at runtime using this same
system so if we go and open up example 3
this scene is even simpler all we have
in here is a ground a nav mesh surface
and then I've gone ahead and created
this level generator script what this
will do is if we hit play it's going to
generate a random level and place our
players somewhere in this level but of
course a player is unable to move
because our agent is not placed on a nav
mesh so we want to make sure that our
nav mesh surface is updated after a
level is generated to do that I'll open
up my level generator script as you can
see I have a bunch of code in here but
mainly what I'm doing is in the start
method I'm calling a function called
generate level this function is down
here and it's basically just gonna loop
over a grid and determine whether or not
we want to spawn a wall for each point
on the grid
we also make sure to spawn in the player
but that's not really important the main
thing that we want to do is make sure
that we also update our navmesh after
our level has generated so under this
piece of code is where we want to update
our nav mesh to do this we first need a
reference to our nav mesh surface and
remember whenever we're dealing with nav
mesh through script we want to go to the
top and make sure that we're using Unity
engine dot AI then we can go and add a
variable which is gonna reference our
nav mesh surface so we'll create a
public nav mesh surface and we'll call
it surface then we can go to the point
where we want to update our nav mesh and
all we need to do here is write surface
dot build nav mesh and that's it this is
the only function that we need to call
in order for the surface to go ahead and
rebuild if we save this go into unity
and make sure to drag in our nav mesh
surface in the new surface field we then
go to our nav mesh and just hit bake
right now so now it's just an empty nav
mesh and if we then hit play we can see
that the nav mesh perfectly fits our
level and we can now start moving around
our agent in this procedurally generated
mates super core and we can regenerate
this as many times as we want and one of
the cool things about this is that it's
only going to cost us right when the
level is generated we aren't spending
processing power each frame on trying to
fit the nav mesh to the level we only do
it once so that's pretty cool that's
pretty much it for this video and the
next one will be covering how to create
links between nav meshes and will also
implement an animated character to
replace our temporary cylinder make sure
