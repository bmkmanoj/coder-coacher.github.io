lot of opinions and I think that's
mostly because of how vague the term
graphics really is I remember while back
watching a video from extra credits
talking about the difference between
graphics and aesthetics but graphics
define the visual fidelity of a game or
in other words the amount of detail and
aesthetics is the actual visual style of
the game now I will argue any day that
aesthetics is hugely more important than
graphics and I think there are countless
examples of games that manage to look
beautiful with very similar graphics
however it's definitely useful to know
what rendering techniques or graphics
help define a certain look Unreal Engine
is an example of an engine that for a
long time has been praised for its
amazing graphics something that unity
has often been critiqued on but unity
ants undergone a lot of changes recently
in terms of rendering capability and I
love the stuff that makes Unreal look
like unreal it's now available inside
the unity editor so here's a short guide
on how you can configure unity to give
more that realistic unreal look we'll be
taking this graphically simple scene and
turning it into this so let's get
started so the first thing that we want
to do is go to edit project settings and
player and here under the desktop
version we want to go to other settings
and this option is fairly hidden but we
can actually change the color space from
gamma to linear now this is probably the
one option that has the biggest impact
on the visual look of your game the cost
base determines the maths used by unity
when mixing colors in lighting
calculations or reading values from
textures a big advantage of using linear
color space is that the cult's applied
to shaders will brighten linearly as
light intensity increases with the
alternative gamma cos space brightness
will often begin to turn to white as the
values go up this often leads to a very
washed out learn next up we can go
window lighting and then settings and in
here I want to make sure that we have a
skybox selected if we have an outdoor
scene and if we do we can go under
environment lighting and change our
source to skybox now this is going to
add in some ambient light based on our
skybox you can see it helps everything
feel more part of the scene now this
scene is completely rendered in real
time however a lot of the detail
lighting you see in triple-a games it's
actually baked into the scene I won't go
into light my baking in this video but
I'll have a link in the description if
you want to learn more next we can go
and adjust our quality settings to that
we go edit project settings quality we
want to set this to ultra we leave the
pixel account at 4
team make sure to select full wrist and
forced on for the textures and we
actually want to get rid of the
anti-aliasing
that's because we'll apply this later as
a post-processing effect we make sure to
check all of these check boxes under
shadows will select very high resolution
and I'm actually going to increase the
shadow distance quite a bit now this is
very far for a shadow distance but I
think it works well for this scene we
then go select our camera here we want
to change the rendering path to deferred
in for rendering each object is rendered
in a pass for each light that affects it
therefore each object might be rendered
multiple times depending on how many
lights are within range with deferred
rendering however the render cost of
lighting is proportional to the number
of pixels the light illuminates instead
of the number of lights themselves as a
result you're no longer bound by the
amount of lights that you wish to render
on screen however deferred rendering
actually has a much bigger upfront
performance cost so what solution is
best for you completely depends on your
game in general if you're building a
desktop application and plan to have
lots of light in your scene go with
deferred if you're building for mobile
or VR and plan to have fewer lights in
your scene go with forward I'll have a
link in the description to where you can
learn more we then enable allow HDR and
disable MSAA dynamic range defines how
very bright or dark colors are captured
by cameras in your scene HDR stands for
high dynamic range and can be used to
capture colors with much greater
precision than the standard LDR or low
dynamic range this means that we don't
lose detail in over or underexposed
areas but we still have to define how
all of this color data maps to the much
lower range on our display this is done
with a post-processing effect called
tone mapping so you can see the visual
appearance of our scene has already
changed quite a bit but the very big
difference between a default scene in
unreal and one in unity is post
processing because by default unreal
applies a lot of post-processing effects
to get these in unity we go window asset
store here we'll search for the post
processing stack this is a series of
post-processing effects made by Unity
themselves let's hit download and import
of course have a link for this in the
description
let's hit import again you should now
see a post processing folder appear in
your project panel we then select our
main camera hit add component and search
for post processing and here we'll
select the post processing behavior
takes in a profile to create a profile
will right click in the project go
create post-processing profile we'll
just call this CC for color correction
we then select our main camera and drag
that in now if we select our CC profile
you can see all of the different effects
that we now have available to us the
first one we want to enable is color
grading under here we have the
possibility of adjusting or tone matter
tone mapping is where we decide how our
HDR color data will be displayed on
screen in unity we can either configure
this ourselves or use a preset provided
to us called filmic this uses the Asus
filmic tone mapping curve which is also
the default term mapping curve in Unreal
Engine 4 if you want to learn more about
the math behind this curve I will have a
link in the description and by default
we can choose from two profiles neutral
where we can adjust everything ourselves
or filmic and you can see right away our
scene just pops so much more next we can
enable eye adaptation while playing this
will mimic the effect of your eye
adjusting to a certain brightness level
by automatically changing the exposure
of the camera based on the brightness of
the scene after enabling the tone mapper
and iadapt ation you often have to go in
and adjust some of your brightness
levels I'm gonna go to lighting and bump
up the ambient light to two as well as
select my directional light and change
the intensity from four to seven let's
then go back to a post-processing and
the rest of the effects are fairly small
changes we of course want to add in some
motion blur you can control how much
motion blur you want using this slider
the bigger the number the more the
motion blur unreal also includes a
vignette by default let's enable this
and maybe bump down the intensity a bit
if you don't have the possibility of
breaking your lighting you'll often also
see ambient occlusion applied as
approach processing effect let's enable
it and you can see the shadowing that
now gets applied to objects that are
close to each other I mean of course
adjust stuff like the radius and the
intensity we can also add in a bit of
bloom I want this effect to be very
subtle I'll bump down the radius a bit
and the intensity as well finally we can
get rid of these ragged edges by
applying anti-aliasing by default this
is going to use a fairly light technique
called fast approximate anti-aliasing
let's just scale up our game view here
and hit play so you can see how that
looks now this definitely gets rid of
the ragged edges but you will see a lot
of flickering on the screen this is
something that I often see people
complaining about in unity but now with
the new post-processing stack we have
the possibility to fix this the same way
that unreal does by using another method
called temporal anti-aliasing
you
see this gets rid of almost all of the
jitter and makes the movement of the
camera feels so much more smooth and one
thing that I also want to do with a
quick is good to color grading and bump
up the post exposure a bit that
definitely looks a lot better if you
want to learn more about post-processing
I have a dedicated video on the subject
now that's about all the quick to apply
graphics settings I can think of now of
course a million other things that you
can do to amp up the graphical quality
of your game some that come to mind are
using reflection probes for real-time
reflections and emission maps combined
with bloom to get nice glowing surfaces
also most people primarily use the
standard shader that comes with unity
now this is a really good shader because
it allows you to very easily get PPR
materials in your game but it does have
a few limitations when it comes to
high-end rendering if you want stuff
like refraction translucency and dynamic
weather if things get a lot more tricky
luckily there's a great plugin available
on the unity asset store called the uber
shader it works in much the same way as
the standard shader but on steroids
now this asset is not free but I do
recommend it for anyone who's going for
a super realistic look that's pretty
much it for this video remember that you
can make super beautiful game with even
the simplest of technology as long as
you remember to have fun and get
creative also remember to subscribe for
more tutorial can 10th and other than
that thanks for watching and I will see
