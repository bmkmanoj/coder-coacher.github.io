everything that we can interact with in
the world we'll be laying the foundation
for items enemies chests stores pretty
much anything that you can think of also
make sure that we can focus an object
and follow it around let's get started
so the first thing that we want to do is
go to our scripts folder and define some
kind of interactable object let's create
a new script called interactable let's
open it up now the idea is that this
will be a base class that all objects
the player can interact with will derive
from and so we need to think about what
are interactable objects such as items
chests and enemies will have in common
let's start by deleting our two using
tags at the top and let's also delete
our two methods
instead I want to go ahead and add a
public float which we will call the
radius and we can default this to say
three units this is going to be the
distance that specifies how close our
player needs to get to the object in
order to interact with it whether that
be picking up an item or attacking an
enemy and the cool little trick here is
that we can actually visualize this in
the editor
all we need to do is create a function
called on draw gizmos selected and you
need to write this in the exact same way
because it's a callback function used by
unity and in here we can draw graphics
in the scene
first off let's set our color to a color
dot yellow and let's then use gizmo stud
draw wire sphere here we need a center
for a sphere which is just going to be
our current position so transform top
position and a radius and for that we'll
just use our radius so now when we save
this and head into unity we can go ahead
and create an interactive object let's
right click on a hierarchy go 3d object
and let's create a sphere let's then
snap to the top here and go into
orthographic view let's place this
somewhere on our bridge let's also look
at it from the side in order to place it
just above the bridge let's now add the
interactable component to this object
and you can see now in the scene view
that this wire sphere appears and it
will update as we change our radius so
now we've defined a way to turn an
object into an interactive object and
that means that we can actually go
inside of our player controller in here
we can go to the update method and at
the bottom of that we check for a right
mouse button click we want to check if
we hit an interactive all and we can now
do that we can use hid dark collider
dark
opponent and the component that we want
to check for is our new interactable
component we can then store this in a
variable so that's Megan interactable
let's just call it intractable as well
and set it equal to our K component call
and then here if we did hit an
injectable we want to set it as our
focus well we can check if we hit an
interactive by going if interactable is
not equal to null meaning if we actually
found an interactive component on what
we hit well then we want to set it as a
focus so let's create some kind of
method that will allow us to do that
let's put in a set focus method and
let's feed our interactable into that
then below our update method we can go
void set focus and as an argument we'll
take in and interactable let's call it
our new focus and how do we set our
focus well first let's go to the top
here and let's define a variable that
will keep track of what we currently
have focus so let's create a public
interactable and let's call this our
focus then when we set our focus we can
simply set focus equal to the new focus
in the same way we also want to be able
to be focus from objects we'll do that
whenever we press the left mouse button
let's up here when we press that mouse
we want to move to a certain point and
stop focusing in the objects and so
let's call another function here called
remove focus and we can go ahead and
create that as well
void remove focus and you will just set
our focus equal to null so let's go into
unity hit play and let's focus on our
player now you can see by default we
have no focus if now right-click on our
sphere you can see our sphere is set as
the focus and if we then start moving
it's set back to null but whenever we
focus something we also want to move our
player towards it to do that we'll have
to tell a player motor where to move now
you might think that we can simply go in
here and call motor dot move to point
and then move to the point of our new
focus however this will only move our
player once if our focus is an enemy he
might be moving as well and so we can't
just move to a single point instead
let's go into our motor and add support
for tracking a target let's create a
public void called follow target while
taking an interactive all which is going
to be our new target we'll also create
another
public void this one will be called
stopped following target so let's now go
to the top and add a variable for the
current target let's make this of type
transform and call it target whenever we
want to follow a target will now set our
target equal to the new target transform
and when we stop following it we want to
set target equal to null so now we
should be changing this variable to
whatever our focus is but we need to
also update our destination on our agent
if you want to be very performant you
could do that in a kuroh teen and so
only update the position a few times a
second another link for using kuroh
teens in the description in this example
we'll just use the update method here
we'll check if our target is not equal
to null and so if we have a target we
want to access our agent set the
destination for that agent and the point
that we want to use is our targets
current position so now our player motor
should have the functionality needed we
simply need to go into a player
controller and when we set a new focus
we want to call motor start follow
target and the target that we want to
follow is our new focus and inside of
remove focus we can go motor dot stop
following target now if we save these
scripts go into unity and hit play we
should be able to right click on a
sphere to focus it and our player will
move to it and if we take our sphere and
move it up player will follow you will
see however that our player only stops
once he's inside the sphere to get rid
of this error inside of our player motor
once we start following a target will
access the agent agent dot and here we
can set the stopping distance so we'll
set stopping distance equal to our new
targets radius and here we want to make
sure that we always get inside of the
radius not just on the border so we'll
just multiply this with something like
0.8 when we then stop following the
target we'll set our stopping distance
back to zero let's now save that go into
unity and hit play we should see that we
still move accurately when moving around
and when we then move to the sphere our
player stops at the appropriate distance
there is one slight problem with this
however and that is we can still move
our sphere inside of the stopping
distance and our player will not change
rotation until we get outside a certain
radius to fix this let's handle rotation
ourself whenever we are following a
target we can do that by going to the
agent and setting up date rotation equal
to false then when we stop following the
target we can set up date rotation back
to true then inside of our update method
whenever we set the destination for our
agent we'll also go ahead and face the
target and this of course involves a
tiny bit of math let's create a method
called face target here we want to get
the direction from our position to the
target position we'll create a vector
three called direction and we'll set it
equal to our targets position minus our
current position if this is confusing to
you I have a video on vector math that I
suggest you check out we then want to
normalize this vector then we'll turn
the direction into a rotation will store
this rotation in a quaternion called
look rotation and set it equal to
quaternion look rotation look rotation
takes a vector with a direction and
looks in that direction we could just
pass in direction here but I don't want
our player to look up and down to avoid
that will create a new vector3 where we
pass it our direction X then on the Y
we'll leave it at 0 and on the Z will
pass in Direction Z and finally we can
set transform rotation equal to our look
rotation directly or if you want to
smooth this out we can use quaternion
slurp slurp allows us to spherically
interpolate between two points we want
to go between our current rotation and
our look rotation I will do this using
time that delta time multiply it with a
speed and I'm just going to hard-code in
a 5 here again this part is fairly math
heavy we get a direction towards our
target we find out how we should rotate
ourselves in order to look in that
direction and we make sure to avoid any
changes in direction on the Y and we
then smoothly interpolate towards that
rotation let's now save this go into
unity and hit play and you should now
see that when I focus our sphere voila
it will always face our sphere even
though we aren't outside of our stopping
distance and it will also make sure to
do these changes in rotation smoothly so
now we can move towards our interactable
but we don't have much interaction going
to do that let's go inside of our
interactable script and in here we want
to know whether or not we're currently
focused this way we can check if the
player that's focusing this object is
close enough to interact with it so
let's create a bowl it's called it is
focused and set it to false by default
let's also create a transform called
player then we can create two methods
first a public void this is going to be
the unfocused and here we'll take in a
transform which is going to be the
player's transform inside of this method
we'll set is focused to true and we'll
set the player equal to our player
transform similarly we'll create a
public void called on be focused and
here we'll of course that is focused to
false and our player variable to know
then we'll create a update method and
here we can check if we are currently
being focused if we are well then we can
check for the distance to the player
let's create a float called distance set
it equal to vector three distance this
returns the distance between two points
the first point is going to be our
players position the second one is going
to be our current position so transform
dot position we can then check if our
players inside of the radius by going
gifts distance is less than or equal to
our radius and if it is well then we
want to go ahead and interact so let's
write out debug deadlock interact let's
save this going to the player controller
and here when we set the focus we want
to go new focus dot unfocused
I'm also make sure to pass in our
players transform when we then remove
the focus will go focus dot on the
focused
however it's that's one thing that we
need to remember and that is when we set
the focus we might already have a focus
and so we need to make sure to D focus
the previous one to do that we're going
to and right if new focus is not equal
to our current focus well then we'll
call on D focused on the previous one
and we actually only need to update all
these different things if our focus has
changed one thing that I do want to
leave out of this if statement is
calling the on focused method that's
because I want to notify our
interactable
every time we click on it and just in
case our previous focus is null we want
to go in here and say if focus is not
equal to null well then we want to
defocus it and we actually want to make
the same check down here so if focus
it's not equal to null well then we want
to tea focusing let's say that now go
into Jinnah tea and hit play we should
now be able to focus our sphere and once
we get close enough start interacting
and when we then move away we can see
that it stops of course we don't want
any interaction to happen a bunch of
times a frame to fix this let's go to
our interactive script let's add a new
boolean here called has interacted and
set this equal to false then in our
update method once we go ahead and
interact will set has interacted equal
to true and we actually only want to do
this distance check if we are currently
in focus and we haven't already
interacted we also make sure to set has
interactive to false inside of our on
focused method so every time we focus on
object we'll make sure to interact once
and just for good measure let's do the
same in the on defocused method let's
now save this go into unity hit play
focus let's fear and you will see now
that once we reach the stopping distance
it prints out one interact the fun thing
that we need annoying tracked script is
an actual method for interacting so at
the very top here let's create a public
virtual void called interact and down
here we'll simply call it so let's call
interact now what is a virtual method
and why are we using it here well
remember the grand plan for this script
is to have all objects such as items and
enemies derived from it whenever we do
that we inherit all of the fields and
all of the methods but one thing that we
don't want to be uniform across all of
them is how we interact with the object
in fact we want that to be different for
each one
that's why we've marked this method as
virtual that means that we can call it
from within this base class in other
words we can trigger this method but
inside of our enemy or item script we
will be able to override it and so we
can put in our own functionality for
each type of interactable so just write
here that this method is meant to be
overridden and by default we can just
write out a message saying debug lock
interacting with and then the name of
our transforms if we play you will see
that this works in the exact same way as
it did before but we've now laid the
solid foundation
all interactable x' in the game finally
at some point sebastian is going to be
adding some cool graphics for items and
when it does invite one control over
where we stand and look towards these
items for example if we have a chest in
the game we only want to be able to open
it from the front of the chests to do
this let's go in here let's create
another public variable this one is
going to be of type transform let's just
call it the interaction transform well
then insert this in all the places that
we're currently using transform so here
where we check for distance instead of
using transform that position will use
interaction transform table position
will also place it inside of our on draw
gizmo selected i'm also make sure to go
inside of our player motor and here when
we start following a new target we want
to use the new targets into action
transform instead
now instead of unity we can simply
select our sphere and in might throw a
single error because we currently have
no interaction transform if you want you
can use the transform of the same object
or we could go in here and create a new
empty and we could call this the
interaction point we then say move this
forward from the object and then when we
select the sphere we can drag in the
interaction transform you can now see
that we can control the point of
interaction for our sphere so if you
were creating a chest you would do
something like this and when we play a
player will try and go to that point but
for this object I'm just going to get
rid of it and set all the settings back
to default to wrap everything up let's
rename our sphere to interactable yay we
made it through that's pretty much it
