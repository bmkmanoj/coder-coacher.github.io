quick tips they all tricks that I
personally use and love do you know that
the list here is in no particular order
alright so let's jump into it number one
finding the editor while in play mode
now most of you probably know just how
annoying it is to make some changes to a
game that you're really happy with only
to realize that you were in play mode
the entire time and so your progress was
lost well that time come to an end
if you select edit preferences and then
color you can adjust the play mode
tint this makes the editor change color
when you play the game so you almost
can't help but notice number two
snapping to the grid a lot of people
don't know that you can snap objects to
the grid if you hold down control while
dragging on an object in fact you can
also get a bunch of extra control by
going edit snap settings here you can
change the size of the grid on the
different axes and even quickly snap the
selected objects into position number
three locking the inspector if you need
to select something but you don't want
your inspector to change away from what
you're currently viewing knocking the
inspector can be really handy this is
especially useful when adding multiple
objects to an array because it allows
you to simply select them and add them
all at once number four debug mode now
it's good practice to mic variables that
are only accessed within the same class
as private however this can be annoying
when debugging because we can't visibly
see the values of private variables in
the inspector of course we can always
insert some debug deadlock statements or
change the variables to be public but
much easier is just setting the
inspector to debug modes and all of a
sudden your private variables become
visible number five aligned with you
when you're setting up your camera for a
nice shot using unity move and rotate
tools can feel really clumsy now much
easier way is to find a good camera
angle in the scene view and then select
your camera and press ctrl shift F this
will take the position and rotation of
your scene view and paste it on to the
camera transform you can also go to game
object and click align with view number
six
range you can use the range attribute
before variable to give it a minimum and
maximum value this will draw a slider in
the unity inspector for easy tweaking
number seven saving changes in play
notes so if you're playing a game and
adjusting some settings on a component
you need to make sure that these changes
aren't lost when you stop playing to do
this you can right-click the component
select copy components then when you
stop playing simply right click on the
component once more and hit paste
component values this one should
can be a lifesaver number eight spaces
and headers if you're making a large
group with a lot of public variables you
can help organize them by inserting
attributes space will create a gap
between your variables and header allows
you to write a title number nine hide an
inspector staying on the subject of
being organized you can always hide a
variable by marking it would be hiding
inspect your attribute number ten
serialize field not all variables that
you want to set in the inspector should
be public in fact there's no reason to
make a variable public unless it needs
to be accessed from another class
instead create a private variable and
Mark it with sterilized field this will
make the variable show up in the
inspector while still being private that
was pretty much it for this video if you
