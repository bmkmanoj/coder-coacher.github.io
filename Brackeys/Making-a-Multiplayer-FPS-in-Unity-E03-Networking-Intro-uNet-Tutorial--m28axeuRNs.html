welcome to the third video on making a
multiplayer FPS in unity in this video
we're going to be putting aside making
the character for a bit to focus on
networking so we'll finally add some
networking functionality to our game
that means that we'll set up a network
manager and instantiate a player prefab
into a network scene I will also talk a
bit about local player authority and
those kind of concepts and on making it
be making a short presentation on how
you net actually works in terms of
programming and how clients connect to a
server and all that kind of stuff so
before we get started I quickly want to
mention that I've now added the
multiplayer FPS tutorial on project to
github so if you want to download any of
the files over the entire project you
can go here things as links are in the
description and if you want to have the
exact version that I'm currently on or a
previous version you can go under
commits here and I'll try and name these
these according to the video so there
should be a version saying video 3 video
4 and and so on and there is also a test
branch that you can use if you want to
see what I'm working on for future
videos also I've gone ahead and
completely redone the donate system I
thought it was really bad before and a
lot of you guys have said that you
wanted a better way to kind of support
the videos so you can go to break Easter
comes less donate and fill out the forms
here if you want to make a donation it
truly helps me out a lot and yeah so
thanks a lot and let's dive into today's
video so let me start by explaining a
bit about how unit actually works
so I've made this model here that
displays kind of how unit is split up
into two api's application programming
interfaces the first one is the high
level API and this is what we are going
to be using this provides a bunch of
classes and methods that we are going to
be using to apply networking to
game the high level API HL API is built
on top of what is called the transport
layer this is this is much more
bare-bones and low level and this takes
care of a bunch of stuff behind the
scenes so the transport layer can be
directly accessed but that's not
something we are going to be doing and
basically this takes care the high level
API connects to the transport layer and
takes care of stuff like distributed
object management and stake state
synchronization along with a lot of
other stuff like message queues and all
that so if that sounds very technical to
you well then you're in luck because
that's not something we need to care
about in our instance so the transport
layer gives great control but it's also
very technical and therefore will be
fine off by using the HL API so on top
of the HL API unity has gone ahead and
made some components for us for example
we have the network manager the network
identity the network transform component
and a bunch of others and these are
basically suggestions by unity of how
you could implement the HL API in your
game so these do a lot of stuff for us
and they are going to be need to be
customized in some kind of way so
basically what we are going to be doing
later not in this video is we are going
to override or extend these components
to create our own custom scripts that
has exactly the functionality that we
are going to be needing we might add on
to these components or decide to do
stuff in a different way that makes more
sense but basically these don't need to
be used at all you can create a game a
multiplayer game by only scripting or
making your own components that
communicate with the HL API so that's
kind of how the unit programming
functions and basically if we take a
look at how the networking in unity
actually works well unit is
based off of the principle that one of
the clients meaning one of the players
is the host so use you have seen this in
a lot of games for example Call of Duty
uses this principle of naming one of the
clients the host and if that clients the
client then leaves another client
becomes the host so this it's a pretty
neat way of doing things because
basically we have this client here
called the local client because that's
part of the host and we have also the
server sitting on the same machine and
this machine then has an IP address and
you have just used a sample IP address
this is what an IP address could look
like and then all of the clients or all
of the other players that want to
connect to this host well they basically
connect to that IP address to the server
which then connects locally to that
client if needed so let's say that this
client wants to shoot this client well
he connects to the IP address to the
server and the server connects back to
that client so if this client needed to
connect to this client well he maybe
shoot that client by going to the IP
address going through the server and
then the server will talk to the client
here so everything goes through the
server which sits on the hosts machine
cool so now that you have this
understanding I might present to you a
problems because well a lot of modern
games don't use this kind of IP address
you don't want to be typing in an IP
address every time you want to connect
to a player I mean if you want to play
over the Internet
you want some kind of matchmaking system
and when using this kind of setup we
have some issues with firewall
preventing connections and all that so
to solve this unity has created a
matchmaking service which is called the
unity relay server and here all of the
clients connect to a server that is
hosted by unity which then community
Cades to the host and that means that
unity takes care of IP matching and it
solves issues with firewall and net
configurations and you don't need to
know exactly what this means and how
it's sold but just know that we won't
have any issues with connecting that
will have to be solved by the clients
they can just connect and this is not
something we are going to be integrating
today it is something I hope to
integrate in a later video but basically
unity hasn't released or announced what
the prices on using this will be a very
common thing to do is have a limit on
the number of concurrent users that you
can have on this system before you need
to pay but unity hasn't released any
information on this so I won't go ahead
and say anything yet about what this
will cost and how many users you can
have for free if any so we'll see about
that but for now let's focus on setting
up some networking locally on this
machine so the first thing that we are
going to be doing here is adding this
central networking component by unity so
let's create an empty game object over
here and let's call this the network
manager and that's without a T let's
reset the transform on this and just
drag it to the top of the hierarchy
there let's go ahead and hit an add
component here and let's add the network
manager that's the one and this
basically is a component made by unity
that can do a bunch of different stuff
well it sets up the scene here to do
networking and you have a bunch of a
different info here on how you want this
set up and for now we can ignore this
and you also have the ability to use
this component for spawning in players
so you can add a player prefab here
which is what we are going to be doing
so we have this a network manager and we
also have a network manager HUD and what
this does is right now
when we hit play we see that well
nothing has really happened and we just
have this player and he's not on a
network in any way so let's just go
ahead and drag this player into a prefab
and then delete him from the scene and
now let's look at the network manager
what basically we need some way of
interfacing with the network manager
script and unity has created this
component that we can use while testing
called the network manager HUD so this
creates a hits head-up display and you
can enable it and disable it here and
you can also play with the offset if you
wanted someplace else on the screen and
this will just give us some some a UI
that will allow us to connect using the
network manager but we need to add a
camera here which will show the scene
when we are not playing so when we don't
have a player yet and we are in kind of
the lobby where we want to choose what
we want to connect to well then we want
to have some kind of camera that just
views our level so let's right click
here and hit create camera let's reset
the transform on this and let's rename
this to maybe scene camera let's also
make this the default camera so let's
let's tag this as main camera and let's
drag it up and out maybe up some more
and let's rotate it down to view our
scene and I'll just switch to global up
here and that looks ok oops I screwed up
the rotation here so that's 0 0 0 and
then rotate it down on the X something
like that and you can see in the game
view here how that looks and I think
that's going to be fine
for now I might drag it up a bit more
and then rotate it along the Y and I
think that looks just fine
and you can see here that our skybox
looks very boring here so let's change
this from skybox to solid color and
let's just make this some kind of
gray or deep blue here just temporarily
at least we'll make it look something
like that
it's going to be fine and this looks a
bit washed out but we'll have a little
get creating some more awesome graphics
later and we want an audio listener and
all of that on this component so now
that we have that here and we save the
scene here in hit play you can see that
this the network manager HUD is now
displayed here and we can choose to
either create an a host here or join as
a client and then we specify an e IP
address a local local host here is just
in the name of a certain IP address
meaning on the local system and you can
also choose server only which we are not
going to be messing with right now so
and you can see here we can enable the
matchmaker we'll get into all of that
stuff so now that we have that we can
create a select land host here but it
says that we have to add a player prefab
so let's go ahead and do that so inside
of our network manager we have this
spawn info tab and we have this player
prefab slot so let's go ahead and drag
in our player and it will give us an
error here it will say that the player
prefab must have a network identity so
this is another component created by
unity and the network identity is a
component that we add to all networked
objects in our scene so stuff that we
want to communicate on the network in
anyway are going to need a network
identity component so we add that and it
has two toggles here the first one is
server only we don't want that because
we're going to control this player so we
wanted to sit on the local client and
then we have local player Authority and
this makes sense for us because we are
controlling the player locally on a
system and then we are sending the move
information and other stuff out through
the server to the other clients so they
can update it on their systems and
therefore we want to check this local
player authority because we have the
authority of the movement locally and
that we send it out through the network
call so we can clear the console there
and that's basically all that we need to
add in order to add it to the network
manager slot so we'll just drag it in
there and the player prefab and we'll
have Auto create player prefab and we
have the ability to specify where we
want the player to be created because
right now it's just going to be created
on this zero zero zero mark so in the
middle of Icy
so let's instead add a few objects or at
least two for where our player will be
spawned so let's create an empty object
here and let's name this spawn point and
let's just add a component to this and
if we search Network here we find the
network start position and that's just
the only completely only component that
we need to add and let's also create a
gizmo for this so let's just select an
icon con here and maybe make that blue
and you can see now that it says spawn
point here so we'll just have it sit on
zero zero zero then set the Y to one
because we want him to spawn a bit up in
the air and let's the blue arrow here is
probably the way that the player is
going to be facing so let's give this an
X amount higher or I'm sorryi Z amount
of negative five duplicate this rename
this to spawn point two and let's rename
this to spawn point one I maybe just
drag this down so they're right by each
other we can maybe actually make them a
child of the network manager so spawn
point two here we are going to set the Z
to five and we are going to rotate him a
hundred and eighty degrees on the y
oops
and if we change this to local you can
see how that works so now these two
objects are facing each other and they
are 10 units they have a distance of 10
units so this way we can go into our
network manager and we can change the
player spawn method to round what robin
and this will basically first choose one
of the spawn points and then the next
player that creates will just choose the
next spawn point and the next one and
then loop so when we only have two this
will make sure that we will switch
between the two which is pretty cool
because then we will also always spawn
opposite of each other cool so now that
we have this in place we can go ahead
and hit play on this and we can select
land host and we are spawned into the
scene but we get a small warning here
saying that there are two audio
listeners in the scene and that's
because our scene camera is still active
and if we were to go ahead and try and
build this and let's actually do that
now and there will be a couple of issues
so if we go to a file build settings and
just add in our main level into the
builds list here and one second my phone
is going off so I'll just turn that off
so we add this to the list and now
basically we have to select the target
platform I'm going to build for Windows
86 and development build is fine and
then we can hit build and run and we can
choose some place to build it you can
see I've made a test build here already
but basically I've gone into my project
folder created a folder called builds
and just name this one build one now hit
save on that hit yes to it replace it
and it's just going to build here and it
should go pretty quickly and once it's
done it's going to open up on the window
here I'm just going to select windowed
and maybe a bit smaller of a client here
and then hit play
we get this window and now we can hit
play in the Z in unity here and these
basically represent each or two
different players or two different
computers or clients that want to play
with each other so I'm the first one
here in unity we can select hosts and we
get dropped into the scene and here we
can select client and you can see now
that we are facing each other and this
actually was rotated wrongly
but we are standing opposite of each
other and starring down each other's
barrel and that's awesome however you
can see in unity right now it's
complaining that there are three audio
listeners in the scene and that's
because we have on this a local client
here we have both a a camera on the one
player a camera on the other player and
the scene camera and that's another
issue with this and that is that the
player motor and controller is enabled
for both the players on both the systems
so when I go ahead and move here you can
see that the other player is moving too
so both players are responding to input
and that's of course something we need
to take care of but that's one more
issue because if we go in here neither
of the players have moved so what is
going wrong here well basically we need
to kind of disable the components that
sit on the other objects meaning the
ones that are not controlled by the
system so that we don't affect other
clients when without input and also we
need to kind of network how the movement
should go so we need to add some kind of
component that will transmit our
position and rotation over the network
so there's a bunch of stuff we need to
do here and in order to kind of set this
up we create a script and let's call
this the player setup script so under
the player here we'll add the player
set up new script and let's just make
that of type C sharp and in this script
if we double-click it to open it up in
Visual Studio basically we are going to
be creating some lists for objects and
components that we want to disable when
there for all other players in the scene
than the one that we control so I hope
that you can follow me on this so let's
just remove the using system collections
namespace we're not going to be needing
that and then let's just remove these
two methods for now so let's start by
creating a list of components that we
want to disable so let's make this an
array so all components in unity are
derived from behavior so if we want to
kind of make this very general we could
make the reference to the player motor
the player controller in each their
variable and then disable them but I'm
just going to create this array so we
can just add in any kind of component
and don't need to add anything to the
script each time so let's make a
behavior here and that's going to be an
array and let's call this our components
to disable and let's close that off and
then in our start method basically what
we want to do here is we want to check
if we are in the network or if we on the
local player so in order to do this we
need to access unity networking so first
off we need to include the namespace up
here we need to be using unity engine
networking and all of the high level API
sits within this namespace but we also
need to derive from network behavior so
this will allow us this script to act as
an object that is networked and will
have the API up
here so now basically all we need to do
is check if we are not is a local player
so if if is local player is equal to
fall so if we are not the player or if
this object isn't controlled by the
system well then we want to go ahead and
disable all of these components so we'll
just loop through that an array so we'll
say for int I equals 0 is less than
components to disable dot length I plus
plus and then we want to say components
to disable that enabled put done enabled
whoops we want to take the height and
set that equal to false so basically
what we're doing here is we are saying
in the start method when the player is
spawned we want to check if we are
controlling the player and if not well
then we want to disable all of these
components so we basically loop through
the list and set the component that
we're currently looking at enabled state
to false cool so that's basically all we
need to do in scripting here we could
also start disabling the camera but
let's do that in a sec so let's minimize
that and you can say that there's a
warning here saying that it will never
be assigned to you and that's because we
need to mark this as a serialized field
so that will allow us to access it in
the inspector here and assign stuff to
it so now the player setup when a multi
object editing is not supported there we
go
so that just needed to update you can
see that we have this network channel
and to extend interval information and
that comes when deriving from network
behavior that can just be ignored but we
also have this array and let's just
increase the size on this we want to
disable a bunch of things so if we are
not controlling on this object
well then we don't want to have a motor
and we don't want to have a controller
and we do not want to have some kind of
camera or so we want to disable the
camera component one audio listener so
those are the components that we need to
disable but these components sit on
another object so we need some kind of
way of dragging them in here and for the
camera that's pretty simple you can
simply drag the object in here or add
him to back into the scene and then
browse here and simply drag the camera
in and that will simply drag the first
component that sits on the object into
the slot but how do we access the audio
listener well that's actually pretty
simple we can go ahead and lock this
inspector so now then we said select
another object it's just going to stay
on that object and then we can create a
new inspector so we hit add tab
inspector and let's just drag it over
here and that is going to change unless
you log it so now we can go on the
camera here and we can take the audio
listener and drag it in there so you can
just keep the inspector here or you can
just close it here I don't think we're
going to be needing it again in this
tutorial and then we can unlock this so
now that we have these components to
disable added we can hit apply and we
can delete the player and we can try
this out but I assure you this should be
working so let's just go ahead and add
some functionality for disabling this
scene camera well basically when do we
want to disable the scene camera well we
only want to disable the camera if we
add the local player so we don't want to
disable or enable the camera each time
and by the player joints we want to
disable this local camera when we join
so therefore we can simply add an else
statement here where we disable the
camera because we marked it as a main
camera we remember we added the tag
there we can simply say
camera dot main dot game object dot set
active and set this to false so that
that's all we need to do and in the
future we're not going to be doing this
under the player setup because the
camera and the scene camera doesn't
really have anything to do with the
player but for now we can just add this
functionality here so that's basically
all we have to do but we also have to
rename alit once we disconnect so in
order to do that let's make a reference
to this camera first of all so let's
make a camera variable here and that's
just going to be private and let's call
this scene camera and then here in the
start will set whoops this okay I'm just
going to write this again we'll set
scene camera equal to camera dot main
and then down here will say that if
scene camera so if it's actually found a
camera it's not equal it's not going to
be equal to null and then we can simply
say scene camera dot game object dot
said active and then we can disable it
so this will make sure that even though
it doesn't find the camera we don't get
any errors and then if we want to
re-enable this we can use the handy
function provided by unity called
on disable and this is also called when
the object is destroyed and in here we
can simply say that if scene camera is
not equal to null well then we want to
say scene camera dot game object dot set
active and then true so then we enable
our the object again and this of course
uses set active we could also just
enable the component which might be
something that we want to do but on
enabling and disabling the whole object
we don't need to do anything with the
audio listeners so this is going to work
just fine so that was all for the player
setup script now let's save this
build this and building the play with
you and by the way the shortcut that I'm
using is a controlled B let's hit play
on this and play in the game and let's
select host and select client and we
need to turn here you can see now that
we are not getting any errors in the
console and if we inspect in the
hierarchy here the scene camera is
disabled and the player that we own has
both its player motor and the player
controller and it's camera but the other
player here doesn't have any of these
components enabled so this means that
when we now move in the game we are the
only one moving however it still doesn't
update so we need some kind of way of
sending this information over the
network and that's what we're going to
be looking at in the next video so that
was basically all for this video I hope
you enjoyed it a lot and we're able to
follow along with the concepts if not
you're going to get the hang of this
don't worry networking is very different
from other kinds of programming and can
be pretty hard to get a grasp on because
you have to kind of think of so many
different players connecting and
interacting with each other so I hope
that this made some kind of sense and if
you couldn't get the programming side to
work of course check out the github page
it's called multiplayer FPS tutorial and
there should be a link in the
description and if you enjoyed this
series a lot and want to support me of
course you can go to practice comm slash
donate and yeah make it a nation it
helps out a lot so I hope to go full
time in the near future and this is the
kind of stuff that helps me do that so
thanks a lot for watching this video and
I'm looking forward to seeing you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
