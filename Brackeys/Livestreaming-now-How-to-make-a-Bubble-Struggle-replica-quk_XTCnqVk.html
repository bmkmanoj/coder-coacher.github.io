I will be live-streaming in just a
moment over on Twitch it's going to be
really fun today I'm really looking
forward to it basically what we're going
to be making is kind of a bubble
struggle replicant if you're not
familiar with bubble struggle I'm just
gonna show you what it is we aim to
create so this is something that I just
prepared for this video and you can see
there's this ball jumping around and if
we hit it with our arrow here that we
can decide when we want to shoot it
we'll split in two and it will keep
doing that until we reach kind of the
final one that is small enough that we
can just pop it and if we get hit by one
of these balls it's just going to start
over and we lost the game and this is
something that's really really fun
because it's it's really really simple
to set up initially but you can do a lot
of things with it and there's a lot of
stuff that you can customize without
writing any code you can see here are my
four ball prefabs and they basically
just link to each other and we can have
several others in there you can
customize different properties such as
mass and speed and start forests and
colors all that to make the game varied
and fun and create a lot of levels
really quickly and of course we're going
to be creating some the basic player
controls setting everything up from
scraps scratch so I really hope to see
you over there at the end we are also
going to do a live Q&amp;amp;A as we've done the
other times it's always a blast so if
you're ending in any way interested
that's awesome and I look forward to
seeing you there in case you missed it
it will also be live on the YouTube
channel as soon as I kind of package it
up and maybe cut out a few embarrassing
pipes so yeah it will be on the channel
as well so yeah I look forward to seeing
you there and I'll see you in a second</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
