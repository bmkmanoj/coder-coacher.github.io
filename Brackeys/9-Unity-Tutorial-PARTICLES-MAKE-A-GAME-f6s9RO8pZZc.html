everyone and welcome to video number
nine and make a game a cool series on
making a video game in unity today we
are going to be taking a look at
particles they are so much fun to play
around with we're going to be adjusting
settings and making our coin emit
awesome shiny particles and we're going
to make everything look much more
awesome so as always I've opened up
unity and we are back and I'll make a
game scene and what we can see is we
have the coin ready with this coin pick
up scripts and basically how you would
do this is we won't want the coin when
we pick it up so when we roll into the
coin we wanted to emit a bunch of
particles and you do this by first
making a particle system and then
telling this coin to create this
particle system right before it destroys
itself so first off let's take care of
the awesome part which is making the
particles and after that we will make
the code but it's really simple it's
only like two lines of code so go to
game object create other and then
particle system and this is called the
shuriken particle system that is much
debate on how to pronounce that I'll say
shuriken I'm sorry if I'm offending
anyone but this is the new awesome
particle system in unity so what we are
going to do first is we're going to take
a look at the general settings so we can
just move this up a bit so we can see
what's going on and first off let's
adjust the duration and the duration is
basically how long it's going to emit
particles before it stops emitting and
you won't notice any change whenever I
change this right now because it's set
to loop and that basically means that
once the duration is has run out it will
just lube and so there's no difference
but if I set this to let's say 1 and
then turn off looping and hit stopped
down here with the party
to the effect so we can it simulate
again we can see the meeting for one
second and then it stops so basically we
want to set this to something like 0.2
let's just see how that looks so we just
get this single burst of particles and
that's basically the effect we are going
for so but just to play around with
things we're going to set it to loop
while we while we set this up so just
said loop and hit similar simulate now
pre-warm we don't want that that's if we
wanted not to start emitting particles
whenever it spawns but just wanted to
spawn with particles that's not
something we're going after the start
delay we'll just leave that at zero the
start life time this is how long when
the particles are going to live after
they are emitted so basically if we set
this to 1 we can see that they live for
one second if we set it higher we can
see them going much higher and basically
let's just try this off at one and we'll
see how it goes we might do something
like no actually let's try it off with
with one I think that's going to be
pretty great and they start speed I want
this to be maybe even more so we can
just adjust this to how everyone and I
want them to be shooting out right in
the beginning and and that looks pretty
fine this that size also looks ok we can
just leave that for now
the rotation also leave that the color
that's something we're going to change
down here because we want the color to
actually animate and not just be one
single color color the gravity multiply
this is if you want the particles to
start falling so we can bump this up but
but that's not really something I'm
going for they inherit velocity that's
just something we're going to leave for
now simulation space needs to be local
and it could be world - that doesn't
matter for us right now and the play on
awake we're just going to leave that on
that's important because that we want
our particles to play as soon as they
spawn
- if we set the simulation space here -
world maybe I can demonstrate this in
the editor I don't know if I can because
I would like to yeah okay so if we just
set the lifetime of these to something
pretty long right now the simulation
space is set to local so whenever we
remove this you can see we move all of
the particles but if we set this to
world it will only move the emitter so
the particles that are up here won't get
affected so that's basically the
difference there but we don't need it to
be anything other than local for this
great so let's just delve into some cool
animation actually right before that
let's take care of these two
so can just uncollapse these and all of
these are awesome components inside the
particle system where you can do
different things first off the emission
we're going to bump up the rate to make
it more to make it emit even more
particles so here you can see we got a
lot of particles going and the shape
we're going to change this to a sphere
so that they will emit out from a sphere
we could also actually we could make
this the same shape as the coin but then
we would need a mesh so we're not going
to play around with that but basically
let's just bump down the ratio or the
radius a bit and that looks just fine
and random direction now we're just
going to going to leave it as is and
then we can go down to the velocity over
lifetime and if we just play around with
this and bump it up on the x-axis for
example we can see that the particles
start floating in the x axis and if we
bump it down even more they get affected
so basically that makes them this is
great for simulating wind but it's not
really something we want right now what
we're going to do instead is we're going
to use the limit velocity over lifetime
and what we can do here is we can get
that really awesome dampening
effect and we can change the speed of
this just to how we want it and the
dampening effect so if that's at zero
they won't get affected at all I'm going
to do something like 0.3 there and the
speed of to something like this and the
color were lifetime and this is really
cool this we can go in here and now
instead of just choosing one single
color we can click this and we get the
gradient editor and this will allow us
to completely customize its color over
lifetime so what we can do is we can say
the start color should be pretty much
the same as the coin so we can use the
color picker to make it this yellowish
color something a little more orange
maybe like this and now we can see that
it all the particles start out
completely yellow and then I want them
to turn into something more not red
exactly but another yellow color and not
that saturated so they get that wide and
glowy feel and this looks pretty great
actually
but you can go ahead and play around
with it until you get something you're
satisfied with there so this looks
pretty awesome and what we can also do
is instead of just changing the color we
can also change the transparency so that
the particles will actually fade out so
that's up here these are the Alpha
channels so we're just going to select
this the one all the way to the right
and bump down the Alpha to something
like zero so now we can see them slowly
fading away and actually I want them to
start fading away a little later so what
we can do is we can double click here to
make a new alpha node and then we can
make this to a maximum amount which is
255 and then we can just drag this over
so that they will first start fading
away right before they they die great so
what we can also do is we can also
adjust the size over lifetime so if we
hit this we
get this awesome curve so if we click
this and go down in the right-hand
corner we can now adjust the size
parameters or if we want them to like
slowly get smaller I want just a bit of
a curve there so they don't stay exactly
the same size we could also make an
inverse effect so they get bigger that's
something pretty cool for that or
something like steam machines but we are
just going to make it like this to make
to give it the the glowy effect and
decides by speed we're going to leave
that external forces all of this we're
going to leave what we could do is we
could make what's called a salt emitter
and these are really cool because
basically we can make our particles
whenever they die we can make them emit
another particle system so you can
imagine this goes pretty crazy sometimes
but basically what we could do just to
try it out is we could add something
under the death here we could hit the
plus sign to create a new particle
system and now you can see it looks
completely crazy and it's it looks a
little bit like fireworks but that's
something you can play around with if
you want to so you can see over here in
the hierarchy it has created a sub
emitter under the particle system which
we can then change so we could set the
duration of this to one the emission and
the shape we could change this for
example the size this may be a little
bit crazy so we could bump that down the
duration is still too much because it's
looping so we can just make it go like
this like just 0.1 and looping and the
particle amount here in the burst
section we can change that to something
like 5 instead and then set the lifetime
to something like 1 and now it's much
more manageable and then we can maybe
make them red and now we got this crazy
effect going but that was just to
demonstrate this sublimator so I'll just
go ahead and delete that again and go
back because that's that's too much
simply so let's disable this up a media
in
and now if we go down under the renderer
this is where we can make it look really
great because right now these particles
don't have this shiny feel they are
simply a matte color but what we can do
is we can change the default particle to
something that looks much more glowy so
if we make simply a new material we can
have it we can give it this additive
blend mode so if we go down to the
project pane and hit and right-click
then go under creates and material we
can make this glow particle and we can
change the shader of this oh actually
let's just assign it to the particle
system first so we can go down here
under the renderer and drag it in there
and now we can see it looks really done
because this is not set up correctly so
we're going to go and change it from
diffuse to the effects know the
particles and then the additive I think
this is a really great effect and then
we can select the texture you should see
this default particle texture and now we
can see it looks like it's actually grow
or glowing and this can change the color
just a bit you can adjust the tint if
you think it's a bit too crazy there I'm
going to tint it just a bit to the red
side to give it some cool tending there
that looks pretty great so a gray is red
color and I'm pretty satisfied with this
result let's try and hit stop simulating
and turn off looping to see if we have
enough particles and that's just a nice
simple particle effect and I'm really
really glad with that maybe we can bump
up the rate just a bit to get some more
particles to something like 7d yeah that
looks really awesome and that feels
really great so let's just rename this
to coin effect and drag it down to the
project pane to make a peep reef
app and now we can delete it in the
inspector or the hierarchy I mean and
now we can select our coin go to the
coin pick up script double-click it to
open it up in monodevelop and we can see
it opening up and you might notice that
I'm using the new version of unity which
is unity 4.3 it has some awesome 2d
features we just I just published a
tutorial on those so checking it out
definitely and monodevelop here also
looks much more polished which is great
but basically what we're going to do now
is we're going to instantiate that means
spawn or create a the particle system
and to do this we need a variable we
need to know or we need to tell unity
what it needs to spawn and so we make a
new variable var and we're going to call
this coin effect and it's going to be of
type transform and this is just
something you need to remember and not
understand whenever we need to spawn
something we use the transform type and
now here where it says debug deadlock ad
count a coin counter here right beneath
that we are going to type instantiate
and it's really important that you do
this before destroying this object or it
won't get instantiated so instantiate
and then open up a parenthesis and now
you can see it needs a lot of input and
this looks confusing but it's really
simple actually the first thing it's
need it needs is just to know what
object it needs to spine
spawn and that's our coin effect and
then we need to tell it where so that's
our transform dot position just the
position of this game object and with
rot what rotation and that's just the
transform that rotation we can just have
it give it the same as this object and
that's basically it's so close it up and
parenthesis and semicolon and now when
we play the game
oh yeah actually we have to assign it
first so now you can see on the descript
that it has the coin effect so we can
just drag in our prefab there and now
hit play and when we roll into the coin
we should see particles emitting and it
feels much more natural now one thing
you could also do is you might notice
the light it just disappears so you
could attach a light under the coin
light or I mean under the coin effects
so that the light also fades slowly but
but that's another thing one thing we
want to do though is if we have a lot of
coins in our scene they will just keep
in stan changing these coin effects and
as you might notice in our hierarchy
when we roll over the coin we can see
the coin effect clone here and so the
hierarchy will just get cluttered with
these coin effects which are not doing
anything because they have already
played so what we can do is we can
simply tell it to destroy destroy this
app object after a certain amount of
seconds and to do this we are just going
to give it a name so before the
instantiate function we'll just call
this effect and we'll say equals
instantiate and we need to type variable
also so var effect equals substantiate
and what we can do now is we can say
that not only shall it destroy the game
object but before that it should also
destroy the effect like this but we need
to make it make it we need to tell it
that it has to wait a few seconds so we
just do comma and then maybe three
seconds and close it up so let's see if
this is working and hit play and now we
can see we roll in the coin effect place
we can see it here and it should
disappear in
three-two-one it should disappear oh we
get an error can destroy transform if
you want to destroy game object please
cut this Joe interesting okay so what we
can do is we can instead use destroy
effects dot game objects like this
hopefully this will work I'll have to
figure something out let's see if it
gets destroyed and that was so it gets
destroyed after three seconds just to
clean everything up so that was
basically it for this tutorial we can
just round it up by making our kind into
a prefab I think we have to serve this
now we can distribute it all over our
scene and we can have it appear all
kinds of places the next thing we are
going to be doing is maybe adding a coin
counter or I have plenty of ideas so
there are more coming up and thank you
for watching I'll see you in the next
