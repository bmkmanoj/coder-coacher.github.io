everyone and welcome to fading between
scenes in unity today we are going to be
taking a look at making a script that
will allow us to fade out change level
and then fade back in with just a couple
of lines of code that we can place
anywhere in our game so first off I'm
going to select an object this could be
any object I'm just going to use the GM
object and then I'm going to create a
new script here let's call this fading
it's going to be of type C sharp so
double click it to open it up in
monodevelop and let's start out by
adding some variables I excused the
quality of the recording it's not as
good as it as it normally is but we're
going to change that in the next video
don't worry
so the first variables is the texture 2d
we are going to call it fade-out texture
and this is just the image that will
overlay the screen in our case it's just
going to be black the next variable is a
public float with the fade speed this is
of course the speed we will fade in and
now that
then we're going to make a private
integer called draw depth and you're
going to set this to minus a thousand
this is the textures on the draw order
in the hierarchy meaning that it will be
drawn last and therefore it will render
on top so we're just making sure that
the black image we are going to fade in
and out is going to be on top of
everything else then we make a private
float with the Alpha and we just set
this as with a default to one so it's
going to start out by being completely
visible then we make a private int
called fate direction and we equal or
ridi for this to minus one this is the
direction to fade if it's equal to minus
one it will fade in and if it's equal to
one it will fade out let's just go ahead
and delete the two functions here and
make a new one called
on GUI and this is going to be good for
rendering different kinds of graphics so
this is unity function for rendering GUI
and then first we are going to fade in
and out the Alpha value using a
direction a speed and time.deltatime
which will convert the operation to
seconds so we do this by setting saying
alpha plus equals fake Direction times
fade speed times time Delta time next up
we force or what is called clamp the
value to be between zero and one this is
because that the GUI dot color uses a
alpha value between 0 and 1 so alpha
equals math clamp 1 because that will
clamp it between 0 and 1 and then we
input the Alpha next up let's set the
color of a GUI in this case our texture
or the black image and we really want
the color values to just stay the same
the only value we want to change just
the L fan this is included in the GUI
that color so do D UI color equals new
color and inside of this we're going to
pass it the GUI color dot R for red GUI
color dot G G for green and dot B for
blue and then we're going to type in the
alpha at last so here we are setting the
Alpha next up we are going to do i dot
depth and we're going to equal this to
our draw depth so here we are making
sure that the black texture will render
on top then we're saying GUI draw draw
texture and inside of this we are going
to type new rect which is four values
and inside of this rectangle you're
going to do zero comma zero screen dad
with come a screen dot height so that
means it will fill the whole screen it
will take the zero comma zero point
which is the top left corner and it will
extend through the width and the height
using the fade-out texture meaning that
we will overlay the fade-out texture on
the entire screen
so now we have actually written all the
logic we need in order for the image to
fade smoothly in and out now we just
need some functions that will set the
direction to fade in and we are going to
make these available from other scripts
also so here we are going to set the
fate direction to the direction
parameter making the scene fade in if
it's minus one and out if it's one so do
public float begin fade with the
parameter direction of type int the
reason why it's called a public float
and not a public void is because we want
it to return something the thing we
wanted to return the thing I've just
written is to fade speed this will allow
us in another script to have a variable
variable be equal to the fate speed and
therefore we can easily calculate the
time that it will takes to take to fade
out and therefore time the application
that load level so we don't load a new
level before it's faded out or wait too
long after all you need to know it that
that is that it returns this value
whenever the function is called I mean
we're going to see an example of how we
can use this in a sec next up we're
going to do an on level was loaded
function in order to call the begin fade
whenever a level loads so this way we're
just going to automate the fading
whenever a level is loaded and therefore
we're going to fade in every time we
play a new scene and of course we're
going to call the function with the
fading direction of minus one meaning
that we will fade in you could also set
the Alpha to one right before should
your alpha not be equal to one by
default or if you change it in other
ways that may be a good idea depending
on your game so if it's behaving weirdly
try that out now we can save the script
and we're actually ready to head over to
unity
so if we select the GM object you can
see that we have two new variables the
first one the fade-out texture we're
simply going to set to a black image
this image you can find on the internet
or you can create for yourself it's
really simple and you can see here the
import settings for my image it's just a
two-by-two texture meaning that it's
only two pixels wide the fade speed I'm
just going to leave at 0.8 and then now
let's take a look at the scripts on the
scripts all in my game is a pickup that
will change scenes whenever the player
collides with it so let's open up the
script for this in here there's a bunch
of logic all we need to worry about is
the function code changed level and
inside of this function there's only
three lines of code that handles the
fading out and the level changing so
this fades out the game and loads a new
level let's have a look at the first
line this statement uses game object art
find to find the object that the script
is sitting on it just finds the object
with called underscore GM if your object
is called something else
of course change this to your object's
name it's generally a bad idea to use
game object that find a lot because it's
taxing on the computer so if you need to
do this a whole bunch I recommend you do
it at this in the start of the game also
we then use get component to find the
fading script on that game object we're
going to change the fade to fading in
just a sec that was just a mistake then
we do dot begin fade to call the
function we can do this because we've
made the function public and therefore
it's accessible from this script then we
pass it the parameter one because we
wanted to fade out we also create a new
variable a float variable that stores
the fade time which was called fade
speed in the other script we can use
this to time when on D when the
application will actually load a new
level so we can use this simply to time
the yield statement that you see here so
this is a yield statement and it will
wait for amount at a certain amount of
seconds and here we wait for fade time
keep in mind that whenever you're using
a yield statement you can't do it inside
of the update function and you need to
create a separate function to store it
in next up we have the application that
load level this just loads the new level
this is where you pass it an index of
your level which we're going to take a
look in a sec when we are going to add
our level to the build settings so that
was all we needed to do now let's change
fate to failing to correct the mistake
and let's hit back into unity now this
is important go to file build settings
and here you can see all of the scenes
that will be included in your build
we're never changing scenes through code
they need to be in the build settings so
you can see we have the fading main
level one and two and over here on the
right is the index if your scene is not
on the list
hit add current and it will add the
selected scene so that was basically all
for now if you're interested in monster
