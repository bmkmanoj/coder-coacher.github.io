of procedural generation we'll be using
what we learned in the previous video
about purling noise to generate a
terrain in unity let's get started so
we're going to be generating our terrain
using the built in and fairly old
terrain engine why because it's super
easy to get working but it's also a big
clumsy we'll talk about alternative
options later in the video to create a
terrain that's right click in the
hierarchy go 3d object terrain we can
now see in our scene view that a huge
terrain has appeared by default if we go
under settings this is going to be 500
by 500 units I'll have a look at
changing this through script later but
now let's just go in here and add a new
component we can call it Perlin noise or
terrain generation I'm just going to
call it terrain generator let's double
click it to open it up in visual studio
let's delete the two using tags at the
top and both our methods for now first
off we're going to be needing a lot of
the same variables that we used in the
last video we're going to be using a
public int width and will default this
to 256 again the same thing for our
height but height here can mean
different things you can either mean the
length of our terrain with the depth
when viewed from above in our case this
is going to mean the length and then
we'll create another variable a public
integer that is going to specify the
depth meaning the height on the y axis
of our terrain I will just to fold this
to something like 20 now let's go and
make a start method in here we want to
get a reference to our terrain component
so that we can change the data of our
terrain to do that we use get component
of type terrain and we can go ahead and
store this in a variable so let's create
a terrain variable and it's also call it
terrain and whenever we want to change
properties of our terrain we have to
access what is called terrain data to do
that we go to rain dot terrain data and
if we now write dot you can see all of
the different things that we can modify
in here so let's go ahead and generate a
new terrain data using a separate
function which we are going to call
generate terrain so this generate
terrain method is of course going to
return a terrain data we're going to
call it generate terrain instead of
creating a terrain data from scratch
here let's use some of the settings that
we set up inside of the inspector to do
that we pass in here terrain dot terrain
data and we take this in as an argument
this is of course going to be terrain
data and we'll
all it terrain data as well so we are
saying that we want to set our terrain
data equal to a newly generated terrain
which is going to be based off of our
current terrain data and now in here we
can go and populate it so first off we
want to set the dimensions of our
terrain we do that by going to rain data
dot size we'll set that equal to a new
vector3 where the x is going to be our
with the Y is going to be our debt and
the Z is going to be our height and just
like our texture was made up of a whole
bunch of different colors one color for
each pixel or terrain data consists of a
two-dimensional array of floats where
each float is the height of our terrain
at a given point and we can modify these
heights really easily all we do is go to
rain data dot set Heights we then give
it the starting point which is going to
be 0 0 in our case and then we give it a
two-dimensional array of floats but of
course we want to generate this using
protein noise so we'll write another
function here we'll call it generate
Heights let's close that off and let's
begin creating our generate Heights
method this is going to return a
two-dimensional flow to Ray its name is
going to be generate height and that's
it now first we want to create a float
array to do that we write float Margar
that's a two-dimensional array we'll
give it a name let's just call it
heights and we'll set it equal to a new
float array where the width of our array
is going to be width and the height of
our array is going to be height so you
can now imagine this float array as a
grid of floats so that each point on our
map has a float associated to it and if
we now loop through each point we can
set the float value equal to assemble
from our Perlin noise so we go for int x
equals 0 we keep looping as long as X is
less than always and each time we'll
increment by 1 instead of this we want
to create another folder which is going
to loop through the Y's it keeps going
as long as Y is less than height and we
increment by 1 each time there as well
now in here we can say height at the x
and y position so the current X we're
looking at and the current Y we're
looking at is going to be equal to some
Perlin noise value and this is what
we'll generate and we'll do this in the
exact same way we did it in the last
video so we'll go here and call it
something like
calculate height and will input the
and the wine then we'll create a method
that returns a float called calculate
height it's going to take in an integer
X and an integer Y we're going to make
sure to calculate the noise coordinates
not as whole numbers but as decimal
place numbers so we'll write float X
cord equals
there we go X divided by width and the
same thing with our Y cord Y divided by
height and remember we multiply it both
of these with a scale in order to be
able to zoom in and out let's go up here
and add a public float called scale and
set it equal to something like 20 by
default and then we can multiply with
that after each calculation and will
then return a sample of our mass Perlin
noise at our X chord comma or Y chord
and now up here we are grabbing the
appropriate float and setting it into a
Heights array so up here we are
calculating our height at the X&amp;amp;Y
position we do that by taking our
coordinates and converting them into our
noisemap coordinates and then we are
returning the value of a Kirlian noise
function at those coordinates and we are
feeding it into our Heights array now
all that's left to do is return this
Heights array as soon as we're done
looping through it and so we are now
generating our Heights correctly and we
can also return our terrain data because
we have now both set these sides
correctly and populated it with a bunch
of pipe data and that means that up here
is now correctly generating the terrain
and feeding it into our terrain
component so if we now hit save we
should see that if we hit play inside of
unity it does indeed do something but
what's going on here well the first
thing is that it's only affecting a
quarter of our terrain that's because
that's one more value that we need to
adjust other than the size the other
thing is that well we aren't getting
that much data it looks like everything
is just clamped to a single value the
reason for that is that we forgot to
cast these values down here in true
floats so we'll write float in front of
both of those and up here before we set
terrain data size we're going to
in-state terrain data dot height map
resolution I will just set that equal to
our width plus 1 so now when we save go
into unity and hit play we should see
our terrain
correctly generating and it looks really
cool if we start playing here we can go
into scene view position our camera the
way we want it select our camera switch
to the scene view and hit ctrl shift F
or command shift if you're on the Mac so
now we should be able to see our terrain
in the game view we can then go into
visual studio and change this to the
update method and I don't recommend
doing this in the update method unless
for testing but if we now hit play and
switch to our terrain here go into a
terrain generated script we can see that
we can now update the scale in real time
and we can also update the depth which
is going to mean the influence of our
noise on the terrain and just like in
the last video if you want a random
terrain each time well then you're just
going to randomize the offset so we're
just going here and create a public
float offset X default that to a hundred
and we'll create one for the Y as well
then down here where we calculate our
coordinates on our noise map we'll add
offset X and offset Y and at the top
we'll create a void start where we set
off set X equal to random range between
0 and a great number and we do the same
thing with offset Y let's save that
hidden to unity they play and we can now
see that each time we play we get a
random terrain and that we can scroll
through this to create really
interesting effects in fact you could
have a look at animating this number
over time let's go into visual studio
into our update method and let's just
say that offset X plus equals time Delta
time and we can add a speed onto this
let's say 5 if we now say we should see
that every frame our terrain is going to
be moving and this actually already
works with colliders as well if we go in
here throw 3d object cue reset the
transform on this cube move it into
somewhat of the center of our scene I'm
going to drag it up and size it up as
well let's add a rigidbody to this and
we can see that it falls down and
collides with our terrain let's pretty
much it for this video if you want to
learn more about procedural generation
which I definitely think you should I
will have some good resources for you in
the description the primary things that
I would want to do difference is
probably creating a mesh from scratch
instead of using the
built-in terrain engine and also having
a look at how you can make the noise
more interesting a very common method is
layering multiple Perlin noise functions
with different frequencies on top of
each other to create the variety and
detail these different layers are
commonly referred to as octaves
sebastian lake has some really cool
tutorials on this and some other cool
stuff on procedural generation again
check out the links in the description
on that thanks for watching and I will
see you in the next video thanks to all
the awesome patreon supporters who
donated in April and a special thanks to
