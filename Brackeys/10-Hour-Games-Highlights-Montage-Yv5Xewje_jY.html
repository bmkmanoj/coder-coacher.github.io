showing off some of the coolest 10-hour
games so far so the first cool game is
the generic space shooter by a guy
called sir Eve the game was originally
made in XNA and then later rewritten in
unity for ten hour games the second game
was made by an entire team using the
unity 3d pro team licensed i specially
liked it for its cool 3d graphics this
is bullet time pigeon slaughtered by
James Napier it has an interesting glass
shader with a cool shattering effect now
this awesome game is the result of
collaboration between fellow youtuber
it's Hiskey and the game dev sat frozen
pixel studio the whole thing was live
streamed and they really tried to
include the viewers in the game
development process now skill cube is an
awesome web player game made by a single
guy whose name I'm not gonna try to
pronounce so it's in the description I
also heard that it might be coming to
the Google Play Store now as promised
here the first five games submitted to
10-hour games also in the top right hand
corner we have touched that pipe which I
just couldn't bear to exclude so that
was pretty much it for this round of
feature 10 hour games thank you to all
of you who've submitted and remember
that there's room for many more should
you still want to pick up the challenge</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
