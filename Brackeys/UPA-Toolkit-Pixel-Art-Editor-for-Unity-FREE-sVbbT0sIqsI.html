welcome to maybe the most exciting video
I've done in quite some time
so the last couple of weeks I've been
working on an editor extension for unity
and it just went live on the unity asset
store the editor extension is called
unity pixel art toolkit and it makes it
fast and easy to create pixel art
sprites without leaving the comfort of
unity so if you need to efficiently and
and quickly create some pixel art now
you don't even have to leave unity you
can just do it inside of unity itself so
you whoops
UPA toolkit is currently available for
free on the unity asset store and it
currently requires unity 4.6.1
or higher and that's the current version
as of the recording of this video but
I've just submitted a update that makes
it compatible all the way back to unity
4.3 so once that gets approved it should
be updated here and then you guys with
with a lower version can use it too but
enough set for now I will also quickly
say that it's available on github and
encourage you to leave a review because
it really helps out with getting noticed
on the asset story if you guys leave a
hopefully positive review but that's of
course up to you any review is better
than and nothing so I've rambled on way
too much let's get started so if you
click on the link in the description or
just go to the asset store and search
for uph toolkit you can see browse to it
and open up in unity simply click that
button there and I've already imported
it and all that it won't take long it's
it's under one megabyte the entire
toolkit so it's very fast to download
once you've downloaded it you will
notice that you have this new folder you
paid to a kit and inside of this is the
entire extension we have a readme that
dark with some documentation on how to
get started and some some
some stuff about the get up page and
also the shortcuts if you want to move
faster throughout the UI and then also
all of the c-sharp scripts and the
toolkit is written entirely in c-sharp
and all the code is of course publicly
available so you can just change
anything you want and if you want to
redistribute or help me develop this
this at this extension I suggest you
check out the github page and have a
look at the license file there is also a
a guide on how to contribute to the
project if you want me to improve on
this because there are of course still
improvements to be way made this is
still version 1.0 I'm showing you so
keep that in mind
cool now let's get started with creating
a pixel art sprite so to do this let's
go to window and you will notice that
that is now a new tab called pixel ID
editor or simply press ctrl shift P
you're going to click that and let's
just dark this up here by the scene and
game tabs and you can see that I've made
my UI ready for painting so we have this
huge area for painting which is really
nice then I'm going to go ahead and
click a new image it's going to pop up
with a dialog where I can change the
resolution width it's going to be 16 and
the height is also going to be 16 now we
create and you can name and place your
image anywhere you want this is not the
final image file this is the project
file sort of say and I'm going to name
this mushroom because I'm going to be
creating the mushroom from Mario that we
all love now hit save and you can see
that it opens up this canvas here on
this empty canvas that where the eye
almost entirely white cells represent
what is currently transparent and you
can see we have this toolbar where we
can zoom in and out or using these
buttons we can open other images or
create new ones or expert
when we done select the color we have
three tools paint erase and you will
notice if we click box fill this is
currently in development I'm working as
hard as I can on that then we can use
WASD or the up and down arrow keys to
navigate if that's what you want is
simply centered on the view and then we
can switch between black and white
gridlines so if you're making something
that is quite black you can change this
to white cool so I'm just going to go
ahead and quickly paint on some stuff
here and I'm going to speed through it
and I'll see you when I'm done
you
okay so I'm done with creating my
mushroom here I think it looks quite
like the Mario games and now I can
simply hit export up here it's going to
select itself then we can change the
save as type notice that if you save as
a JPEG you will lose transparency and
this also requires 4.5 to work so most
of the time I don't see in the reason
why you wouldn't use PNG but the option
is there and then we have the texture
type where you can simply change between
a sprite which the four-point-three
system uses where texture if you want to
apply it to a game object now we can
simply hit export and we can change
where we want to save this or whatever
I'm simply going to save it under the
assets folder and I call it mushroom now
it's save and you will notice that our
mushroom appears down here and it set up
all the import settings so it works with
pixel art you can of course change the
pixels per unit the pivot point on that
if you're not satisfied one thing you
will have to do in this current version
is change it from compressed to true
color just to make sure that the colors
I write if not they might look a bit odd
and that's something I'm going to change
it to do automatically of course in a
version to come so now we can simply go
into the scene view and the project here
I mean is the one from the 2d platformer
series so check that out if you're
interested and then we can simply drag
it into our scene and there you go
you've created a pixel add sprite that
you can use inside your scene like any
other object we could maybe add a fixed
physics component here rigidbody and a
circle Collider and he'll play and you
will notice that it simply just works it
will fall to the ground here we could
push it over and it's part of the scene
and if we want to make any changes and
this is where the system here becomes
incredibly useful we simply go back to
the pixel art editor make the change we
want let's say we want something in here
to be blue don't know why we would do
this but we're doing it like
we can simply hit export again export
and just override it and now it's
updated in the scene view and it will
wake so it's so so fast and easy to do
of course if you want to do more
advanced stuff you can also use this PNG
just open it up in Photoshop if you want
to do if you think a tool is missing or
something but really if you have any
features you want to request go to the
brackets forum go to the github page I
should be possible to reach and I really
want to know what you guys would like
this tool to be and how you would like
to see it grow in the future
so thanks for watching this introduction
video to UPA toolkit version 1.0 I hope
you enjoyed it and please again leave a
review it helps out a lot I've shared
this asset for free in hopes that it
will reach as many people as possible
and maybe makes their lives a tiny bit
easier so just leave a review it it's
it's crazy how much it helps so again
thanks for watching I hope you enjoyed
it and I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
