of recording this video it's still in
public beta but I expected to be out
sometime in December all right let's see
what it has to offer
the first feature worth mentioning is
the panoramic 2d and 3d video this
allows for playback a full 360-degree
video onto the scene skybox especially
cool fall of the VR enthusiasts in 2017
point 3 unit is also introducing a new
transform tool the new tool combines the
functionality of the standard transform
controls this means that you can easily
move rotate and scale game objects using
the same tool personally I've been using
the keyboard shortcuts for quite a while
now but I think the new tool could be
really nice for beginners with the new
version we also seeing the introduction
of assembly definition files this might
sound really scaring but it's actually a
really cool feature for anyone working
on a larger game project you see
normally unity automatically defines how
scripts compiled to manage the
assemblies this means that code in your
scripts gets outputted to files defined
by unity typically as you add more
scripts it will take longer for the
editor to compile these files this can
lead to annoying wait times as your
project gets bigger now however you can
define your own managed assemblies this
means that you can choose which scripts
compile to what file this way only the
required assemblies are rebuild when
making changes to a script and this can
greatly reduce the amount of time you
need to wait for combination as always
with the view update comes some nice
improvements to the particle system the
velocity over lifetime module now
contains a new setting which modifies
the speed of the particles over time
this makes it much easier to control
particle speeds without affecting their
direction on top of that you can now
also create ribbon eyes particle trails
using the particle system this allows
particles to be connected based on their
age instead of each particle leaving a
trail behind it this is cool because we
can now add effects between the
different particles but the biggest
change to the particle system is
probably the brand new standard particle
shaders unity is releasing two standard
shaders for use with particles surface
and unlit these shaders provide all the
core particle functionality that you
would expect but using an interface
similar to the existing standard shader
this makes it easy to configure stuff
like blend modes alpha thresholds soft
particle settings and so on and finally
we're seeing some nice changes to the
particle editor
this includes the ability to preview
other looping effects instead of just
the selected one the profiler is also
getting an update most of its internal
but the changes should make the system
more scalable and performant and a side
effect of the changes include the added
ability to profile custom threads using
a c-sharp API the cloth component has
also been improved
we finally have cloth soft collision you
can now paint constraints onto the cloth
using a brush based method and with the
new update you can also enable inter
collision to have different cloth
effects collide with each other I really
can't explain to you how happy I am that
someone did that for me they're really
way too many changes to cover in this
video here's a list of some of them
finally mm 17.3 of course comes with a
number of smaller changes and bug fixes
you can download the beta today using

haven't had your fill with all the new
stuff I'll have a link to the release
notes as well or if you like this series
