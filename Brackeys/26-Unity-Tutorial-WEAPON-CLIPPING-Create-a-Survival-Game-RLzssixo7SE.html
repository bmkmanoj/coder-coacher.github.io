our survival game series done by
practice I'm the CEO of Brad keys and
this video is going to be a rather short
one we're gonna take a look at
preventing weapon clipping so making it
so that our weapon or our arms and and
other you stuff attached to our player
will not go through objects so that can
be seen at any time and we also going to
be making a few minor tweaks and fixes
here and there so let's open up a unity
as always first of all I just want to
select my player and under here we have
our main camera and under there we have
our arms and it's these arms I want to
make a separate layer then we can have a
second camera just render that layer and
then we can set it to depth only which
will mean that they will be rendered no
matter what no matter matter what so
even though they're inside another
object or behind another object we will
still be able to see them so that's
really cool so what we're going to do
now is we are just going to take a look
at what's inside our arms because
everything that are inside of our arms
will also be set to this layer and that
means whenever we are going to equipped
weapons to these arms that will also be
be rendered by this cigarette be
rendered by the secondary camera okay
cool so what we're going to do now is
we're going to select our player hit
game object create other and then where
we have it that camera and now let's
like this too and rename it to something
like weapon camera I'm gonna type draw
always
and then I'm going to drag that under
the main camera and center the position
and the rotation so that's really
important you do that else everything is
going to look pretty weird now we go to
our clear flags and set this to depth
only and the culling mask is something
we're going to play with in a sec so now
we can go ahead and select our arms go
to the lair hit add layer call this draw
always then select our arms again go up
on the layer select our draw always
layer hit yes change children and
remember you have to do this with all
the weapons too so set them to the layer
draw always now we go and our main
camera to make sure that it won't be
drawn by our main camera because we
won't do it won't we don't want to draw
this two times so go under the culling
mask and this is basically what it's
going to draw and by drawing I of course
mean a show and then we want to disable
the draw always so now we see them
disabled under the main camera here so
if we were to go ahead and play the game
right now you can see that it's not
really working and it's all also pretty
hard on the computer because we have two
cameras drawing both things anyway so
now we go under our draw always and then
we want to disable these components
because we don't need them we want them
to be handled by our main camera so just
remove component flour layer GUI layer
and audio listener now we want to go
under our depth and we want to change
this to something higher than our main
camera to one then we can go under our
culling mask it's like nothing and then
select the draw always and now it will
only
our hands as we can see here and now it
should be working so if we hit play we
can see our hands are being drawn and we
have no error saying that there are more
than one audio listening the scene they
are only being drawn once and if we now
run into a post or anything like that we
can see that they are not clipping
through so we can always see your hands
and this is really something that has
been standardized in the industry for a
long long time because if we were to
disable this camera go in the main
camera and put back on the draw always
you can see the arms going through
objects so let's hit this back on main
camera and then draw a long ways off
okay cool so now that we had that setup
I'm just going to make a few changes the
first one I want to make is select our
player select the graphics and then I
want to apply a red color to this so
that I can always find our player or any
color you might like so now we go into
our materials and I hit create material
I'm going to call this maybe we should
do a blue actually so blue then select
our player graphics drag in the blue and
now we can change the main color to blue
and you can really pick whatever your
color you want actually let's go with
the black keys color so let's change
this to purple or leather or yeah let's
go with that that's really girly but
that's what we're going to go with for
now that just makes it easier to quickly
fund I play out if we view it from a
distance
the last change I want to make is
something you have been asking me to do
and that's showing how to hide the
slider you're up here if you're done
with testing I think it's really nice to
have it there whenever you're testing
out levels because then you can quickly
view them at different points in time
but I'm just going to show you how to
disable it so if we go on our day night
cycle then under time of day we have our
time of day script we can go ahead and
open that up and it will load in
monodevelop
this is taking quite a while so let's
just try this one more time there we
have it and oh these are some scripts
are used to make the inventory which is
something we're going to cover in future
videos the next one is probably going to
be about making them so look forward to
that but in the future we will get to
the inventory I promise so now undo
function on GUI we have the slider
equals GUI horizontal slider and so on
this is something you can just go ahead
and delete or comment out so I'm just
going to make these two dash signs and
now when we save this and whoops we open
two instances of monodevelop that so
when we save this and hidden hit play
you can see that it's not being drawn
and the time of day will still change
okay so now I'm going to show you how
you can change the editor the script
editor so if you are not interested in
using monodevelop but would rather use
something like notepad plus plus this is
how you do it so you of course you start
out by downloading the program and
whenever you have it installed and this
is what you do so you go to edit and
then you go to preferences then you go
to external tools
then there you see the external script
editor then we can click on this
monodevelop and if it's not well in here
you go to browse and then you find the
location where you have installed it I
think I installed mine on 2d programs
then you find the notepad plus plus I
actually might have installed it on the
C program files notepad plus plus there
you have it and then you select the
application XE so we hit open and now we
can see that that is a chosen here so we
can go ahead and delete this for close
this down and now when we go ahead to
open the script so let's go into the
scripts folder and let's just open up
the advanced di you can see that's what
opens up so now it opens up in notepad
plus plus so that's pretty much it for
this tutorial I know it was a short one
but this was just a bunch of requests I
have done V you guys I just thought I
would clear up and get out of the way
before we continue with the makin in
parts so I hope you enjoyed it and I'll
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
