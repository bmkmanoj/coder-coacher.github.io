unity I did a poll asking what language
you guys would like to see and the
results were well conclusive so today
we'll be creating our first script we'll
have a look at how you can change
properties and even add forces to an
object so I'm really excited let's just
jump right into it so whenever we want
to program in unity we create what is
called a script to do this we click on
the object that we wanted to sit on in
our case we player and we hit add
component then we go down here select
new script and we can give a name to our
script in our case it's going to be
something like player movement but you
can really choose anything you'd like
and we select the language in our case
that's going to be C sharp so create an
ad and you can see that unity adds a new
component and that's because scripts and
unity are pretty much just custom
components that we get to tell what to
do it's also created a script file down
here in the project panel and that means
that we can add it to other objects as
well so if we now select our ground we
can drag our player movement onto that
in order to make it affect the ground as
well but we don't want to do that so
let's just right click on it and hit
remove component so if we go back to our
player and double-click on our player
movement script it's going to open up in
your script editor if you're on Windows
that's either going to be visual studio
which is what I'm using or monodevelop
which is also what you're going to be
using on the Mac it's really up to
personal preference and you're going to
be able to follow along just fine with
either so this is what a script looks
like just when we create it that's a lot
of scary stuff going on here the thing
about learning to program is that at
first you're just going to have to
ignore most of the stuff that's going on
to clean it up a little bit we can go
ahead and delete the two using tags up
here and really the only thing that you
should focus on right now is these two
functions where it says void start and
void update and these are created by
unity automatically so let's have a look
at the start function up here the neat
thing about the start function is that
it will run when your game starts that
means that whatever code you put between
this curly bracket and this curly
bracket that means in here it's going to
be executed when you start the game do
note that in c-sharp it doesn't matter
how many spaces you have you can really
space it out any way you want you can
even put it on separate lines as long as
you don't split up a void like this
let's just try and see if this is
working by displaying a message to
ourselves to do that we write debug
does log and make sure to have capital
letters the same places that I do
because c-sharp is cap
sensitive then we open up a parenthesis
and you can see that it automatically
closes one as well then in quotation
marks we get to write a message in our
case we'll just write something like
hello world make sure you end this line
with a semicolon you're going to be
doing that a lot whenever you write a
command you're going to end it with a
semicolon if we now save this by hitting
ctrl s you can see that it saves up here
head back into unity and hit play
nothing is really going to happen in our
game view however if we go ahead and
look at the console here you can see
that it now says hello world if you
don't already have the console open you
can go window and then console so the
console here is used by us to debug our
code it allows us to write messages by
using debug dialog followed by our
message and it also displays warnings
and errors about the code to rewrite so
we really have a love-hate relationship
to the console if something isn't
working in your game make sure to check
the console and see if there's any
errors or warnings they might help you
troubleshoot the problem all right
so writing hello world in the console is
a bit boring let's have a look at what
else we can do well in fact we can do
pretty much anything in unity we can
modify values we can add forces to
objects we can add explosions create
game timers and menus the possibilities
are pretty much endless and that's also
kind of what makes programming scary is
that you have a lot of functionality
available to you but let's try and focus
on a specific problem so let's say that
we want to go into a rigidbody and
disable gravity for that object to do
that we need first of all to reference
this rigidbody component and you need to
make that really easy if we go into our
script and go above our functions on
this empty space here create some new
lines and then write public then the
name of our component our component is
called rigidbody then the name of the
component that we want to modify in our
case rigidbody and now we need to give
this reference and name that we'll use
internally so we can call it something
like RB for rigidbody if we save that
and hit back into unity we should now
see an empty slot here with the name of
RB we can then take our rigidbody and
drag it into that slot so now whenever
we write our B in our script it's going
to refer to this particular rigid body
that means that if we go back into
visual studio and instead of writing
debug that lock here write something
like RB
use gravity we can sled that equal to
either true or false in our case we're
going to set it to false and then of
course end with a semicolon so say that
that said in a unity and let's see if
this value isn't going to change when we
hit play so let's hit play and indeed
the used gravity changes to false we can
see that our cube here is hovering in
the air and if we were to duplicate him
so that the two would collide you can
see just how cool of an effect that
already gives us but this is just
editing a tiny little property we can
also make a rigidbody do different
things if we quit playing go back into
visual studio we can actually add a
force to that rigidbody so instead of
writing RB I use gravity let's write RB
add force and again we open a
parenthesis close the parentheses and
then end with the semicolon however you
can currently see that this is
displaying red and the reason why is
that we need to specify a few things
these are called function arguments the
add force method wants to know how much
force it should add in the different
directions so we could start with 0 on
the x-axis we could do something like
200 on the Y and maybe 500 on the Z
notice how I separate each number with a
comma we can then hit save go back into
unity and when we now play we should see
a force being applied to this object
awesome so let's stop playing head back
into visual studio and what we want to
do is not only add a force in the
beginning of the game we want to add a
constant force in order to move our
object forward to do that we can't use
the start method remember this is only
called once right when we start the game
however our update function is called
once per frame that means that whenever
the computer draws a new image and it
does this multiple times a second this
function is going to run so let's again
put this on a new line to make things a
bit easier to see and we can then write
RB dot add force just like we did up
here we can input 0 on the X 0 on the Y
let's try 200 on the Z again remember to
close it with a semicolon let's also
take our entire start function up here
and remove it so now we hit save go back
into unity hit play and we should see
our cube just launching into the
distance and indeed we do however even
though our game currently runs just fine
and we get no errors in the console we
do actually have an error in our code if
we stop playing head back into visual
studio we can see that everything looks
just fine but that's one
and that is if this method is called
once per frame and we add a fixed amount
of force each frame how much force we
add over a second is actually going to
totally depend on a frame rate that
means if you have a really good computer
that is drawing a bunch of frames a
second the cube is going to travel
faster than on a slower computer that
doesn't run as many frames per second
and the frame rate can even vary on the
same computer if a bunch of stuff is
going on on the screen the computer
usually slows down a bit in order to
handle everything or if something is
happening in the background that might
also change your frame rate so in order
to even out these differences what we do
is we multiply this value the 200 here
with what is called time.deltatime
this is a bit confusing but basically
what time delta time is is the amount of
seconds simply computer drew the last
frame so the update is running 10 times
the second this value is going to be 0.1
and if it's running 20 times a second
this value is going to be point zero
five so the higher the frame rate the
lower this value is going to get and
therefore it's going to even out the
advantage that you would get if you were
running on a good computer if you don't
get this right away that's totally
understandable I sure didn't the first
time just right after me for now so if
we now save this and go back into unity
we should actually see a pretty big
difference that is our cube is not
moving now at all and that's because in
my system it's drawing a lot of frames
and so overall the value gets a lot
smaller than it was before the
workaround for this is super simple we
just need to go into our script and make
this value bigger I'm just going to add
another zero save that going to unity
hit play and we should see him just
storming off here it doesn't look like
much of a difference but now we could at
least know that it looks the same way on
all systems
the final thing we're going to do is yet
another one of those it doesn't look
like it's wrong but it's actually a
little wrong kind of thing and that is
that unity really likes it if we use
what is called fixed update instead of
update for calculating physics and in
our case we are using the unity physics
system so just make sure that whenever
you do physics stuff if you're adding
forces or changing velocity to it inside
the fixed update unity likes that a lot
better and it's going to make everything
look a lot smoother when you collide
with stuff also if you find all this
confusing I totally get it
one thing that you can do is use the
fact that we can make comments inside of
our code so you can see this line here
is grayed out that's because it's marked
with these two slashes whenever you
create two slashes and follow it up with
some text
that text is not going to be included in
your code and so it allows you to say
stuff like this so just go through your
code and add some comments to help you
out you can even add comments at the end
of a line also see a lot of beginners
using spaces to indent their code
I find it a lot easier to just use tap
but it's something programmers have
argued about for decades so let's just
save our code a final time and enjoy the
result until the next video you can of
course play around with this by adding
more objects into the game let's add
another cube here for example and this
already has a box Collider so it should
actually collide
