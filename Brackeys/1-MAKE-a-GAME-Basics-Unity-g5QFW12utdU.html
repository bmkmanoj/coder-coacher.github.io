video in make a game a short series
where I'm going to cover the basics of
making a video game and it's going to be
a lot of fun so this is for you who
thought hmmm I want to make a game I've
got a cool idea I want to get into the
business it sounds cool anything like
that you don't need any knowledge to
begin out with on the matarese so we'll
cover everything and it's going to be a
lot of fun so let's get started in this
video I'll just explain what tool we are
going to be using and why and then I'll
move on to showing you where you can get
it and we'll also be starting up a
project and just getting the basic
elements in there so just really really
the basics of everything cool so first
off we are going to be using unity 3d or
it's not really called 3d by unity and
the reason why is that it's a very well
known so you're going to be able to find
lots of documentation onto how on how to
do several things it's also very
beginner friendly and still a lot of
experts and professionals use it because
it's fast and it can create really
powerful things in a very short amount
of time so it's really the engine of fun
if you still want to do a lot and maybe
even do some scripting unity is really
really great and lot of it can be
achieved using visual stuff cool so
let's go to unity 3d comm then head
under the download section hit download
okay so now we can just go ahead and hit
download unity 4.2 it might have changed
since this video and we are going to be
using the free version of unity which is
still really powerful but there is also
a pro version with the black skin here
which has more advanced features but for
beginners and even intermediate users
most likely
that's not something you're going to
need that bad so hit the download unity
4.2 and it will download I already have
the have it installed so let's just
close this and I've opened up unity
already and this is just a quick preview
of what kind of game you're going to be
making it's a ball rolling game and if
we just hit play here you can see that I
can roll the ball to each side and the
camera will follow and I can jump and
that's the basics of what we are going
to be making in the next few tutorials
we might expand onto that we're
definitely going to create some more
interesting level design this is really
boring but that's really the basics of
the game okay so go up to file hit new
project and you might be prompted to do
this when opening unity then you can
select the project location I'm going to
do browse here and then go into Dropbox
I like to store everything in Dropbox so
I can keep a backup of my project then
make a new folder and call this make a
game select that and now we get to
select what packages we want to include
these are other default packages these
contain stuff like a first-person
controller for first-person games which
you can just import into the game and it
will work already without any scripting
so these are just packages unity made
for us which we don't have to make on
our own I have a little more than usual
but that's because I've downloaded some
extra from the unity asset store ok so
right now we are fine with what we have
we have we might use the physics
materials in a future tutorial
along with stuff like sky boxes but we
can always import these later I like to
keep the project clean and tight now
let's hit create now unity is going
to load up all of the files running in
the background and this is how it should
look we can see that there are a bunch
of different windows I'm just going to
go over them quickly as I don't want to
get this to get too boring first off we
have the scene view this is where we can
see all objects and navigate around to
navigate a route the scene view I use
the alt button this is really going to
do all navigation for you so if you hold
down old we can click and if and drag
and we can pan around stuff if we use
alt and shift or holding ctrl sorry we
can drag and if we use the zoom scroll
wheel we can zoom in on things if you
find that you get lost in the scene view
we can go up to the right hand side and
click the center of the cube this will
change from perspective to ISO and so on
if you are not familiar with camera
technology you can just ignore this then
we have the different axes which we can
click to quickly snap to side views
front views and so on cool over here on
the left hand side we have the hierarchy
this is all this this shows all of the
objects in our scene right now we only
have the main camera and that's just
drawing drawing a blue color then we
have the game view and this is where we
want to be when we are testing out our
game then we have the inspector which
shows all of the different things you
can change once you have something
selected in the hierarchy or the project
pane so that's basically the settings
tab then we have failed to load which we
are just can ignore then we have we have
the project pane and then here we are
going to see all of the different things
in our project which we can choose to
have inside of this particular scene
scenes are like levels so this stores
data for all the levels and this is from
this particular level
then we have stuff like the console
where you can see error messages if you
have made mistakes and scripts and the
animator which we are going to ignore
for now cool you can also switch between
different kinds of tools over here in
the left hand side to get this grid
showing you can click on this landscape
and disable it and enable it once this
is enabled the grid will disappear cool
now let's actually get started creating
an object so let's go to game object
create other and then let's choose the
cube we can see over here in the right
hand side on the transform that our cube
currently has a position of 3.9 on the X
0.1 on the Y and 5.6 on the Z we want to
just zero out this transform so simply
type 0 0 and 0 in those three fields we
can also hit F while hovering over the
scene view to focus on our cube this is
handy for quickly finding items because
we can just select them in our hierarchy
and then hit F to focus on them now that
the position of our cube is centered we
should be able to see it in the game
view it's very boring at the moment then
it's just a square and also it doesn't
have any light applied to it let's
change the scale of this to make it more
exciting and then apply lights so if we
go back to the scene view we can change
the scale to 10 on the X 1 on the Y and
1 on the Z we're going to look at it
from the side so we don't really want
too much going on on the z axis the blue
one and the y is fine with one now we
can add a sphere which is going to be
our main character
our ball so go to game object create
other select sphere now let's zero out
the position x y and z and then just
drag it up to rest on top of the cube
give it a little more than necessary
so we assure it won't drop through now
that we have this set up let's rename
the objects to stay organized so go over
in the hierarchy right click on the
objects and hit rename or select them
and go to the inspector over here by
this check box the check box is where we
can disable and enable objects now let's
type out a name we're going to call this
ball you can call it whatever you want
make sure that you notice that unity is
kept sensitive so that you don't leave
spaces all around and that you are you
are consistent with when you put a
capital letter and a small letter now
select the cube hit rename for that also
let's call this ground then our main
camera we can also rename this oops
wrong one the main camera I'm just going
to do main camera but without the space
now that we have this setup we can go
ahead and play our game but nothing will
happen so that's not that exciting still
so let's add a light so we can finally
see what's going on this looks all very
two-dimensional so go to game object
create other point light there are many
different types of lights point lights
emit from one single point in space out
through this radius also called the
range it has different properties like
color and intensity which you can feel
free to mess around with shadows are not
going to work unless you have the probe
they only work for directional lights
and they only work in hard shadows but
that's fine to play around with so let's
just move this to make it look a little
bit eerie so first let's Center it so
make sure we know where it is in space
then let's drag it up and a bit out
towards the camera so you can see more
what's going on you can also drag on
these dots to adjust the range it's a
good idea to keep it soft and nice
looking like this now that we have that
we can also rename that so let's call
this light zero one you're probably
going to have many lights in our scene
before we done so this was the basics of
unity3d we're also going to talk about
what is a component what's a game object
and of course through some simple
scripting to get our ball moving and
unfolding we're also going to expand on
the level design and maybe even do
something with coins or pickups or
something so collectible objects are
always fun stay tuned for future videos
and I hope you enjoyed it I'll see you
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
