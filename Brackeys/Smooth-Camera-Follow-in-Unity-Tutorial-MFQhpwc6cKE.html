at creating a smooth camera follow
script this is something that I see a
lot of beginners having trouble with a
lot of people either get weird controls
or jittery movement and are just
confused about the whole situation in
general so hopefully you will find this
video useful also special thanks to
Commander Firestone 38 for his support
on patreon if you want to support these
videos you can go to patreon.com/scishow
let's get started so I have the scene
setup with a simple cube that we can
control around the platforms but the
camera of course is currently stationary
let's change this by selecting the
camera going add component and we want
to create a script called camera follow
let's to C sharp and they create an app
let's double click it to open it up in
Visual Studio now first off we can go
ahead and delete the two using tags at
the top and we can also delete both our
methods the first thing that we need is
a reference to what we want to follow in
our case that's going to be the player
let's go ahead and create a public
transform remember we use transform
whenever we want to get information
about position rotation and scale and we
can call this variable our target will
also need a variable that defines how
quickly our camera will snap to the
target because we'll be smoothing out
our camera movement we need to be able
to adjust to smooth amount so right
below this will create an oddly public
variable this one is going to be of type
float and let's call it our smooth speed
so the higher this value is the faster
our camera is going to log on to our
target and so the smaller it is the more
time we are going to spend smoothing you
want to place this somewhere between
zero and one I'm just going to default
it to 0.125 so let's start locking onto
a target we want to do that inside of a
method so let's go void and this is
where I see a lot of people going wrong
especially people new to unity because
the logic here goes well I want to snap
my camera to the target and I don't want
to do this only in start because if our
target moves well then we want the
camera to move with it and so the
reasoning goes let's do this every frame
and so people right update here the
problem with this however is that our
targets position is often also edited in
the update method and so we get a
situation where the target and camera is
kind of competing to go first and that
results in weird jittery behavior what
we can do instead is actually change
this to something called late update
late update is the exact same thing as
update except it's run right
after and so now we know by the time
that this function is called our target
has already done all its movement so
let's test this out by first setting
transform position our cameras current
position equal to our targets position
so target dot position and when we now
save this and head into unity we can see
our two variables appear in the
inspector let's take our player and drag
it into the target slot now when we hit
play we should see that our camera snaps
directly to the position of our player
so our camera is currently inside of our
plate this is not really something we
want we definitely want to offset the
position of our camera but you can see
that it does follow the play around and
that everything feels very smooth so
let's go and add an offset let's create
our offset as a variable so that we can
easily tweak it in the inspector will
create a public lecture 3 and the reason
that I'm creating a victor 3 here is
that I want to be able to offset our
camera on all three axes want to be able
to pull it back on the Z move it up on
the wire a little bit and maybe even
play with the X so let's call this
variable offset and we don't need to put
in any defaults here then down here
where we set our current position equal
to our target position we can actually
just add our offset onto that position
so we simply write plus offset if you're
unfamiliar with vector math this might
seem weird we're not adding two numbers
here we're adding two vectors but this
actually works out in this simplest way
possible when adding two vectors
together we simply add together each
component so we add the X of our target
position with the X of our offset and
the same thing with Y &amp;amp; Z so now when we
save this and go into unity and hit play
we have an offset variable and we can
control this at run time so I'm just
going to take my Z value here and bring
it back and you can notice our camera
zooming out I can do the same thing with
my Y and with my ex I'm going to set my
X to 0 Y to 2 and Z to negative 10 we
can then right click on the component
hit copy component exit play mode right
click again and hit paste component
values and now when we play we should
actually already have a nice camera
follow script but we have just a few
things missing we still need to make our
camera smoothly lag behind our player we
also need our camera to always face the
player because right now if I increase
the Y well then we lose track of our
player to smooth out our movement let's
take the position of our target
plus the offset and store this in
another variable will make this of type
vector three and we can call this
desired position and so if we don't want
any smoothing we can simply set
transform drop position equal to the
desired position directly and if you
want to smooth with simply add another
step in here we create another vector
three we call this the smooth position
and set it equal to vector three loop
loop stands for linear interpolation and
is the process of smoothly going from
one point point a to another point B so
this method first off takes in our
current position which is our starting
point for that we'll right transform dot
position it then takes in our desired
position our end point let's put in our
desired position and finally it takes in
a float called T its called T here
because we often want to loop over time
but T is actually just any value between
zero and one when it's zero this method
is going to give us the first position
which is currently transformed our
position when it's one it's going to
give us the second position which is
currently desired position and if it's
anywhere in between well then it's going
to give us a mix of the two so what we
want to do here is actually input or
smooth speed I'm going to set our
current position equal to our smooth
position so what's happening now is that
every frame we get the position that we
want to snap to we use vector three dead
lope to get a bit closer to that
position and how much closer we get
depends on a smooth speed if our smooth
speed was one well then we would move
the entire way on one frame if it was
point five well then we would move half
the way each frame if this is hard to
wrap your head around I totally
understand it definitely was for me at
first I think we should just try it out
in unity and you can see what it looks
like now depending on the way that
you're currently handling movement this
might turn out really smooth or you
might get a bid of kicker emotion I've
searched around the farms trying to
figure out why this happens
according to unity documentation later
updates should always be called after
everything else I did however find a
solution to this if we go into visual
studio we're instantly going and replace
late with fixed update and so now we're
actually updating our position in the
fixed update physics loop don't ask me
why this works but when we now hit play
you can see just how smooth that is
if anyone has a good explanation for
this please post it in the comments
finally we can have our camera always
look at our player this is super simple
to do we simply want to call transform
look at and the object that we want to
look at is our target this way unity
will do all of the rotational
calculation for us let's say that go
into unity hit play and voila a smooth
follow script it's working and we can
see just how easy it is to update the
way that we view our player there of
course a million ways that you can
expand upon this system if you want you
can also pick up a camera solution from
the unity asset store some of these
allow you to do much more advanced
camera stuff like having multiple
targets setting up framing camera shakes
transitions all that stuff I'll have
some links in the description
