beta start already and the full version
will be released to 31st this month a
lot of exciting stuff so let's get into
it so the first improvements are three
features that will definitely speed up
the lighting workflow the light Explorer
is a brand new window that gives an
overview of all the lights in the scene
you know how light can either be baked
into a light map or updated in real time
well now you know this reintroducing mix
mode and mix between faked and real-time
lighting for static objects the light is
baked into the light map but dynamic
objects to cast real-time shadows
progressive light mapper energy now
quickly breaks a low resolution light
map for the part of the scene you're
looking at this allows you to see
changes almost immediately and then the
light map increases in quality until
it's fully baked this feature is not
part of the beta but will be out with
the full release flex 5 pence extra set
out to improve AI pathfinding with a
rework navmesh system from now on you
can have multiple math measures in the
scene and orient them in any given
direction in addition the path can now
be updated in real time which is great
for dynamic terrain or procedurally
generated levels of course 5.6 also
comes with a bunch of graphical
improvements such as GPU instancing and
metal compute shaders along with a
performance increase for the particle
system oh and unity finally got support
from Vulcan looking at the graphics API
that is really efficient at taking
advantage of multiple CPU cores which
means that it can free up processing
power on some platforms Vulcans will run
on Android Windows Linux and Titan the
video player has been rebuilt from
scratch to play 4k videos which is great
for 360 VR a debug view for physics
geometry has been added features that
improve 2-d game making include access
distance sort which helps solves the
access sorting problems by enabling you
to set the transparency sort mode to a
custom access you can use the sort
include component to render a set of
objects separately from others on the
same sorting layer 2d physics
improvements where the biggest one for
me is probably the composite Collider 2d
which allows you to merge different
types of kaleidos into one in real time
and to the duty artists rejoice we now
have nine slice if you don't know nine
slice is a technique for stretching or
repeating defined areas of the sprite
this means that we can create very small
textures that can be easily manipulated
and resize the graceful platform
other than that the beta now includes
Google daydream and cardboard VR support
you also be able to deploy your projects
to the new Facebook game room desktop
app for Windows or to facebook.com using
your movies WebGL support unity
collaborate is unities relatively new
cloud base
that allows small teams to sing and
share project it's basically just unity
sound version control system and so far
it's been lacking but they are now
introducing partial publish and the
ability to roll back changes it probably
won't get me to leave gate just yet but
we're getting closer finally and this is
something that I'm super excited about
unity is working on implementing the
public editor extension text mesh pro
into unity as an avid txt much pro user
it's great to see unity accepting that
their text editing tools are really
support also text most Pro is now free
on the App Store that's pretty much it
for version 526 along with a bunch of
smaller changes and bug fixes of course
however unity has also teased two new
features that will be coming sometime in
2017
the first one is timeline its cinematic
sequence it's all timeline allows you to
easily create interactive cutscenes or
scripted events with access to some
really nice camera tools so far timeline
looks really interesting and well done
the second feature is something that has
only been discussed pretty vaguely it's
a fully multi-threaded job system
enabling better use of multi-core CPUs a
lot of unanswered questions on this one
I'm excited to see where unity will take
it it could definitely lead to some
really nice performance improvements if
you want to read more about 5.6 timeline
or anything else i've talked about in
this video I will have links in the
description this video is of course a
bit different from the usual tutorial so
please let me know if you like it and
want to see more thanks for watching and
I will see you in the next video thanks
of the awesome people who donated in
February and a special thanks to Derek
huge jerk face bone marrow 5 James
Callaghan and Jason Latino if you want
to become a picture in yourself you can
do so a pitching becomes less Preki
thanks a lot guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
