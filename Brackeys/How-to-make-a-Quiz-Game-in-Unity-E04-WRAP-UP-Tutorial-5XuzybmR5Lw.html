welcome to the fourth and final video on
making a quit scam in unity so it's
already come time to wrap up this short
series it's been a lot of fun and I've
showed you pretty much what I wanted to
show you from the beginning however
there's still lots of stuff you can do
to improve this game on your own the
first thing that comes to mind for me is
maybe adding some audio to the game so
if that's something you're interested in
I really suggest you check out the 2d
platformer course which has a cool
couple of videos on making an audio
manager and adding some sounds to it and
making them play so if that's something
you're interested it it interested in
definitely check that out so in this
video we are going to be building a cool
icon for the game we quickly be going to
be hopping into Photoshop and sketching
it out however you can use whatever
program you want to and then we're going
to set up some basic player settings and
I'm going to show you how to quickly
build this as a standalone for either
Windows and Mac if you want to go more
in depth on how to publish your game
stuff like turning it into a on setup
file that you will run and then it
installs on the computer and you have
the ability to uninstall and all that or
if you want to publish it to the
internet and maybe upload it and all
that stuff well then I really suggest
you check out video 25 to 26 in the mega
game course where I cover a lot of that
stuff I really also want to make some a
standalone videos on how to export and
some good techniques and all that so if
that's something you want to see
definitely let me know in the comments
and I'll have a look at creating some
very generalized videos on that topic so
that would be super fun without further
ado let's just dig right into today's
video so you can see that I am here on
my desktop and let's just open up unity
point 5 point 3 point 5 which is the
version I'm going to be using today so
I've updated a bit since we started and
the first thing that I want to do here
is maybe just clean up our project a
little bit so let's just right click
here and going to create folder and
make a folder for our scripts let's
select the game manager and the question
and drag them under there and let's also
make another folder and this is going to
be our sprites folder and whoops our
sprites folder and this is pretty much
only going to host our game icon then we
can go under our main our scene here
just to make sure that everything looks
and plays as it should and we can just
hit play here and see that everything is
working so that's perfect and the first
thing I want to do is go under the edit
project settings and then player and
this allows us to change all kind of
stuff for how we export the game so the
first thing we are able to do is change
the company name and I'm going to change
that to Rockies then we can also select
the product name and I'm going to rise
right quiz game example here the default
icon we are going to be making that in a
second and then you can see I have three
different tabs here you might only have
two you might have five or six it
depends on how many modules you
installed when you install unity so
before unity basically came with a lot
of different opportunities for exporting
your game however the new way they're
doing is it doing it is they have
modulized
how exporting works so when you install
unity you get to choose what platforms
you will be able to build for and i've
chosen that i want to be able to build
for standalone web GL web player and
then of course for under the standalone
for both PC and Mac but if you haven't
chosen this and haven't checked these
boxes you can just rerun the installer
and install them this time so i really
suggest you do that and those are the
basic platforms that you almost always
want to have so um if you don't see your
tabs here that is why you can just rerun
the Installer so next up we have the
resolution options I don't want the
default to be fullscreen instead I want
this to have some kind of fairly small
window it's a very casual game we've
made here and so I don't want to clutter
the entire screen with it it's
it should only take up as much space as
necessary and therefore I'm going to set
the default width to something like 650
and the default screen height to
something like 550 so it will almost be
a square it will be a bit wider and it
won't take up too much space then next
up we have the ability to display a
resolution dialog when we run the game
that will allow the user to change input
choose the right resolution and change
the quality settings of the game that's
not something I want the user to decide
we've decided that beforehand so I'm
just going to be disabling that you can
also of course turn this into resizable
window that's probably going to work
fine with our game because of the way we
have set up the UI but again not going
to allow the user to do that then we can
override some settings for the
standalone when it comes to the icon we
are not going to be doing that we are
not going to be changing this splash
image either or any of the other
settings then we can move on to the web
player on the resolution and
presentation you can select a template
here and a width and height I'm just
going to leave all of this be and the
same with the WebGL just to leave all of
these settings so cool now we can go
ahead and maybe create an icon so I'm
going to again be using a Photoshop that
is my default image editor of choice
however you can pretty much use anything
a very good free alternative is skimp
and that's going to work just fine and
this is not a Photoshop tutorial this is
just showing you kind of how I sketch
out my icons and I'm also going to be
making this available to you if you want
to use this that's fine and it will be
available to even though also for
commercial use and all that so first off
let's make a new file by pressing ctrl n
or command N and this is going to be the
quiz game icon and I'm going to make it
1080 by 1080 pixels so completely Square
and let's double click on the background
here to choose a new name for it I'm
going to choose a BG then we can go over
here under our shapes tool
click and hold to select the rounded
rectangle - and then we want to set the
radius to a hundred pixels then I want
to drag from one corner to the other and
what we can do is then hit control T and
then we can make sure that this is
accurate by snapping the sides here to
the actual sides of the canvas this will
just make sure that we don't have any
overlapping or missing an etch or
something like that then we can disable
our background and we can choose another
color for this and I want this to be a
very light red very similar to the one
that we have chosen inside of unity cool
then I want to duplicate this layer by
pressing ctrl J and then press ctrl T to
scale this hold or drag from the corner
hold down alt and shift to scale
uniformly and from the center and that
we can just release that something like
that and we can now make this a blue
color instead some kind of light blue
almost watery and now you can see we
have a border and we have some kind of
background image and to give this a bit
more depth I'm going to add a shadow
from the border onto the background but
I won't don't want a shadow around the
border so what we're going to be doing
is right or double clicking on the blue
image and then choosing in in the shadow
and then we can just scale this up a bit
and you can see that that gives us some
nice depth very easily we are also going
to be adding gradient to this and I want
to change this to overlay so we can
still see the blue color and then I'm
simply to bump down the opacity a bit so
it's not too much that looks very nice
and then we can take our border here
double click on that as well and maybe
add a bit of a gradient to this as well
so again I'm going to be changing this
to overlay actually let's do a soft
light and bump down the opacity quite a
bit on this one I don't want it to be
too apparent cool so now we have this
cool icon filled then we can add some
kind of content to this from something
that stands out in the middle and
here I want to add some kind of question
mark because it is a quiz game that we
are making and therefore I think it
makes sense to make a question mark so
I'm going to proceed to bring up our
text control here and I don't want to
click inside of this because you can see
that there is a circle around my cursor
and that means that it will format the
text to stay inside of these and that's
not something I want so I'm just going
to press out here where it's a square
I'm simply going to make a question mark
and you can see it before dragging in
here I'm going to move this on top of
all of the other layers so we can see it
clearly and you can see the fun I'm
using here is myriad Pro and I want the
both typeface we can use any formula or
any arm font you want and then we can
press ctrl T scale this up again alt
shift something like that to Center this
we can press control and then select the
rounded rectangle over here so that will
select that area and then we can choose
our question mark
and then we can go on the layer align
layers to selection and then choose
vertical centers and then again layer
align layers to selection horizontal
centers so that will Center our question
mark on this layer and that's perfect
then we can double click this question
mark and let's first give it a color
overlay and select the red color over
here that's going to be fine then let's
give it a shadow so a drop shadow a
widen the size a bit and maybe give it a
bit of distance to offset the shadow
then we can go on to bevel and emboss
and we can maybe drag down the shadow
mode so pasady to zero and then just
bump up the size so that will just make
a light fall upon the question mark to
make it stand out a bit and we can also
add a quick in a glow to make it really
pop so we'll make this a fairly large
let's make it red and then a very light
red and then maybe bump down the opacity
a bit so if I turn that on and off you
can see it really makes the icons stand
out good so that's pretty much all I
wanted to do for this icon it's not the
prettiest in the world you can
definitely do more and you should
definitely spend more time than me
this but I think it will do for now so
let's press ctrl s to save this let's
save it under our quiz game assets
sprites and I'm just going to save it as
a Photoshop file if you're using GIMP or
something else you should save it as a
PNG file because that is pretty much
last list so let's say that hit OK and
let's hit back into unity go under
stripes and you can see it's now
appeared here and let's just change this
to true color and leave everything else
as is then hit apply and that should
work just fine
good so what we can then do is go into
edit project settings and then player
and we will lock the inspector here go
back on the on the sprites and drag the
quiz game icon under the default icon
and that will now be used for when we
export the game so that is something we
are now ready to do so let's go ahead
and actually do that let's go on to file
build settings and you can see that I
have currently unselected the WebGL
platform however I want to export to the
PC so in order to change this I need to
select the PC and we want this unity
icon to switch over to the PC we do that
by hitting the switch platform unity
will reconfigure the project this might
take a long time if you have a lot of
assets but if we if you don't which we
don't you can see it's almost instant so
it's switch over now and this button is
now grayed out that means that unity
editor is now configured to work as if
it was playing on a PC good and then we
can choose the target platform forum
we're going to select Windows you can of
course select Mac OSX and again if you
don't see the Mac OSX here on the
Windows platform rerun the installer
make sure to choose the module good and
the architecture 86 means 32-bit and 86
64 means 64-bit all computers run 32-bit
some only some computers run 64 however
in modern ages if your computer is less
than five years old that's a really good
chance that it runs sixty four-bit
however for a similar game like this the
architecture is not going to make much
of a difference and every run can run 32
so if you don't want to rub are worried
about this
just choose 86 and be done with it
that's fine for our case and that's what
we're going to be doing and then before
we build we want to make sure that the
scenes in build include our current
scene so if it's not there drag it in or
add the open scenes then let's hit built
let's go under quiz game let's add a new
folder cold builds let's double click
that let's add another folder and we'll
call this Windows double click on that
and then we can make a file name and
this is going to be the quiz game
example and then I'm going to just
indicate that this is 32-bit let's say
that and unity is going to build this
it's going to do that fairly quickly
because again we don't have many assets
and it's going to open up the windows
folders you can see here on the built
windows we now have all of this
different content this has the XE file
it has some debug files and it has a
data folder with all of the armed
resources needed by the exe file to run
the game you need to include all of this
stuff when you shared with your friend
so simply take this entire folder and
you can compress it to a sip file and
send it over if you want to deploy the
game I recommend creating a setup file
that you run that installs all of this
on the computer and maybe adds a
shortcut to the desktop and to the Start
menu and an all uninstall feature again
if you want to see all of that along
with exporting to the web check out make
it game video number 25 and 26 on the
subject so without further ado let's try
and boot up our new game here and see it
opens up this window and that is
actually not the correct resolution that
is not one on one and I think this is
too large but however we can just check
this out so you can see if I true here
it is indeed working so let's just go
ahead and find our edit project settings
player here and I don't believe that
this is the default and I
think the reason why it's not using the
default is before I ran the game when I
was testing out with a different default
screen width and height and I think that
it saved that locally but if you run
this on your computer it should be much
smaller so just keep that in mind this
only the default screen and width and
they can be a bit annoying in Windows so
that's bigger that's why windows
remember that I ran it in that
resolution and so it did that again you
can of course refresh that there are
plenty of stuff written about this on
the internet so that is exporting your
game to Windows that is kind of wrapping
it up and all of the different player
settings and stuff like that I really
hope that you enjoyed this series I
really want to do more kind of smaller
series to show you different concepts of
what it's like making different games I
think spending a lot of time on one
series is great and I definitely want to
keep doing that as well but it kind of
you kind of get stuck on maybe some very
specific things and and and you don't
have time to cover the very wide concept
of game development so I think if you
want to see more of these short series
definitely let me know I really want to
make more for you so that's basically it
for this video I hope you enjoyed it and
I'll see you in some of the other
courses</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
