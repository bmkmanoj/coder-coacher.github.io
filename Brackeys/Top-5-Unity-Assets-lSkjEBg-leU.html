get asked is what assets I use when I
make games and for good reason picking
up a good editor extension or model pack
can save you countless hours of
development time so I hopped on Twitter
and asked you guys if you wanted to see
a video on the assets that I use the
most and the response was overwhelming
so here they are my favorite unity
assets first off we have pro builder pro
builder is an awesome tool for building
and editing geometry inside of unity in
my opinion it's actually the best
prototyping tools you've ever hit the
stored just because you can so easily
sketch out a level Pro Bowler comes in
two versions basic which is free and
advanced the free version has all the
basic mesh editing tools but without a
lot of the stuff that you expect to see
in a dedicated modeling software so if
you want stuff like editing movies mesh
mirroring and export to obj you will
have to upgrade fun fact one of the
games that I'm looking forward to the
most at the moment manifold garden is
actually built entirely using pro
builder next it's a free asset by unity
that has for some reason gone under the
radar a little bit I'm talking about the
unity particle pack this pack is filled
with explosions fire lightning rain and
all kinds of cool effects it's really
nice to see a particle effects pack of
this quality and I've already used it in
a bunch of projects now it's time for
the only paid asset on the list
Odin Odin basically just makes sure
inspector much more powerful with Odin
you can serialize anything from
dictionaries to delicates and it has to
be 50 attributes for adding stuff like
buttons color palettes and tabs if your
program is looking to improve your
workflow
I really recommend picking up Odin as
our fourth asset we have another editor
extension text mesh Pro Tex much pro is
a complete revamp of anything text in
unity it makes your text render nicer
it's super performant and it has a lot
of layout and styling controls I
actually have a video on setting up and
using text much bro spoiler alert it's
really easy Tex Mex pro was recently
acquired by unity and is now free of
charge so that's pretty awesome
and the final asset on the list rock and
boulders
now this pack rocks if you ever designed
an outdoor scene you know that something
you pretty much always need is rocks and
I have never seen as nice-looking rocks
as these of course this acid is also
free that's pretty much my list of
favorite assets I've created a list on
the asset store with all of them and a
few others that I couldn't squeeze into
the video on the link for that in the
description now really try to keep this
video short but I have so many more
assets that I want to share with you if
you want to see more videos on the
subject definitely let me know in the
comments we could maybe do assets in a
particular category next time so if you
have a category that you would like to
see definitely let me know as well find
that thanks for watching and I will see
you in the next video thanks of the
awesome patreon supporters who donated
