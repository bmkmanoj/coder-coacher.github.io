welcome to video number 11 in the how to
program in c-sharp course today's video
we are going to take a look at
inheritance basically deriving classes
from other classes and what inheritance
means we'll get into in a second but
first of all I just want to explain that
inheritance isn't an extremely important
subject and it's considered one of the
three pillars or primary characteristics
of the object-oriented programming
language because basically what
inheritance allows us to do and I've
made this horrible looking graphic here
but it will do for now
is it will allow us to share code
between classes basically if you have a
base class imagining that we are making
an RPG and we have the space class
called our hero and he has different
properties that are general for all
heroes such as a a health amount a may
be a strength amount a amount of
intelligence and all of that and then we
have some derived classes that basically
share all of those properties but also
add on some new ones so a derived
derived class could be a shaman and he
might have some abilities and another
one could be a warrior he might be able
to yield a specific kind of weapon all
those kind of things can be derived from
the same base class and then basically
what we do is we instance the derived
class so when we then change this
instance it's not going to be the base
values are not going to be changed for
all of the instances that's not the
point the point is just reusing the code
so let's try this out so let's open up
examine studio and I've started with a
clean slate here and we're going to
start up by creating our base class and
we do that just as with any other class
and we are going to call this animal
stick to the same
that kind of idea that we've been using
so far this concept of an animal that
then has some different properties and
that's going to be a public string which
will be the name we're not going to
default it to anything a public public
integer which is going to be the age in
a public float which is going to be the
happiness I think these values will be
pretty general and will pretty much
apply to any kind of animal so other
than that we can also give it a method
so we're going to do a public law right
and this method is going to simply print
the base values so this could also be
something that alters maybe we could
call this age to make it actually age
and so simply just add one on to the
AIDS value we could call it be happy and
we could add on to the happiness value
we could print out only the name we
could do a bunch of things with this but
for now we are simply going to print all
of the base values and in here is simply
going to do a console dot write line
name and then plus your name we're going
to do console dot write line H whoops H
and then the H and finally we're going
to write out the happiness cool so this
is going to be our base class and you
will notice that we don't give this a
keyword to say that this is our base
class and the reason why is we don't
really need to specify that classes can
derived from other classes that derive
from other classes so the term with it a
base and a derived class is relative so
next up we're going to create our
derived class and this is going to be
called dark and it's going to derive
from and therefore we do a colon animal
like this now
the dark class will share all of the
base values here or the base fields with
the animal class so inside of this we
could maybe do a public integer then
this is just what we want to add on to
it and this could be on the spot count
the number of spots that it has on its
body and also we could do maybe a method
in here just to show that that will work
too and we're simply going to call this
bike and what this will do is it will
simply print out a wolf awesome and we
can something to just copy this change
this to a to a cat which is also going
to derive from animal and this is going
to have a different property here or the
point wouldn't be so this could maybe be
a float of cuteness and I know that dark
you can be cute of a hump but stick with
me here and this is going to have a meow
method and then in here we simply do
turned out yeah cool so basically this
is kind of the base of inheritance what
we can do now is simply use this so it's
it's very easy to use I mean it doesn't
require that much more syntax but it can
really help organize your program make
it easier to read minimize errors and
definitely minimize redundancy you don't
want to do the same thing over and over
and inheritance will definitely help you
on that I mean this is central to many
different kinds of programs you can
write an entire program without using
inheritance though that would normally
be not a very good idea I mean if you're
making an RPG you cannot get through
that without using inheritance so now
inside of our main method we can start
instantiating these derived classes so
now we have if we go back to our graph
we have a base class called animal we
have a derived class called cat and
another one called
dark and I will instance these and we'll
see what we can do with that so let's
start out by making a dark and we're
going to call this one spotty and we go
set him to in new dark and first off
let's set his name whoops
spotty dot name equal to spotty will set
his age equal to what are we going to do
we are going to say four years old
you're going to set his happiness to 0.8
and next up we can access the values
that are specific to this derived
instance so the spot count and you will
notice that we of course can't access
the cuteness because that's specific to
the cat but we can access the spot count
and we're going to set that equal to 25
hence his name and finally we're going
to say spuddy
dad oops Spidey dad and we are going to
print a space and then we can maybe I
make him bike so if we just test this
and hit play here oops
of course we need and it's just going to
say that this is going to always have a
default value of zero because we're not
using it and that's on your warning so
we can just ignore it for now we're
going to be using it in a sec so for now
we can just do cancel that rekey here so
it won't quit immediately so let's try
that again and you can see that it
prints out the names body is four years
old he has a happiness of 0.8 and he can
say woof great so let's see let's say
that inside of this derived class we
want to access one of the parameters
inside of the animal class so basically
we can do this by simply typing and this
is very easy
personally typing
happiness and now we've accessed that
parameter so it's simply going to do
that for us but let's say we had a value
of happiness here and a value of having
us here but don't know why you would do
this but sometimes you need to do this
if especially this can be customized if
you're passing in some arguments and you
want to set the base class through the
derived class and then this can be a
normal thing but basically if you have
happiness here and happiness here you
can make sure that this is the one
you're accessing by doing base that
happiness and some people like to do
this even though it's not necessary to
be very to be very thorough and show
that the value that we're accessing is
not actually a member of this class but
of the base class so if we say that we
want our happiness to go up with zero
point one every time we wolf then we can
simply do that there and then we can
print out down here we can print out his
new happiness and that's going to be
equal to spotty
done happiness now that we've parked so
let's try that again and you can see
that his happiness goes up with zero
point one so we've accessed and changed
a value in the base class so let's just
before I just to show you this let's
make an instance of the cat also and we
are simply going to call this Heisenberg
and we are equal it's going to equal him
to a new cat we're then going to say
Heisenberg
dot name equals Heisenberg Heisenberg
dot h equals and we're going to make him
old so I'm going to live 13 his
happiness is unfortunately not too high
it's an old grumpy cat and his cuteness
is not too high either so that's maybe
why he's grumpy and then we're going to
print out the base and we're going to
make him do a meow comb and in in
between these sesame want to make some
space here so that's just Megan empty
blind they're awesome and and this arrow
should go away when we run and you can
see now that it first prints out all of
the data about thee and dark and then it
goes on to print out data about the cat
so that was basically it for this
tutorial it was kind of a quick one
compared to some of the others but I
thought that I would really just
encapsulate this in one single video I
mean there's much more to talk about
when it comes to inheritance and how it
can be used especially when it comes to
kind of protection levels but I think
that this is what we're going to stick
for stick to for now I don't think we're
going to need to kind of delve into more
until we get a little more advanced with
c-sharp so that's basically it for this
video I will just quickly go through
exactly what happened what is happening
here if you haven't got it if you feel
like you've got this covered you can
just skip this so basically what we're
doing is we're creating the base class
called animal we are giving him some
different properties and we are making
sure that these are public so that we
can access them we are also making a
method called print' base that will just
print all of the values in our base
class then we are creating a class
called doc that derives from the animal
based class this basically takes all of
these parameters and copies them in at
the top here including our method and
what this will allow us to do is some of
the add-on to these values a spot count
and a method for backing and we do the
same with the cat it basically derived
so from this class meaning that all of
these are just covered in here and then
we add on a cuteness level and a method
for saying meow then down here we are
creating an instance of the dark we are
naming this buddy we're filling out a
bunch of different parameters for spotty
we're then printing out his space we are
backing and then we are on checking our
new happiness so when we run this and
you can see the result of that and
that's basically all the stearic so that
was it for today's video I hope you
enjoyed it and I'll see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
