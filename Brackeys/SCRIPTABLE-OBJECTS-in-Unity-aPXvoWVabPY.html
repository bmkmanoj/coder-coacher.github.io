Say if you're making
an rpg
You need to make a whole
bunch of items, each with their own stats and properties
Of course you could create an item prefab and then make copies of it
with different values, but this is both brought to error
and very inconvenient. So instead we use scriptable objects
*heaven choir*
Scriptable objects are basically just data containers
First, you create a template that defines what information
each object should hold and then you create
objects from that template. So in this video we'll learn
how to use scriptable objects by looking at the example:
creating cards for hearthstone. Alright
Let's go. So here's a simple scene with an empty card. If we have
a look at it in the hierarchy, we can see that I have all
of these different UI elements. I have a text object for
the name, description, mana, attack and health
As well as an image for an artwork
And I've made sure to mask it out so it fits the card
Let's now create a scriptable object that contains all of this
information. To do that, we go to the project -&amp;gt; right click
Create, C# script
and let's call it 'card'. Let's now click to open it
Now we want to delete both our methods
and this time we don't want to derive from MonoBehaviour
Because this script is not gonna be sitting on another object
It's more going to act as a template for all of the
data that we want to store. To do that we want to derive from
ScriptableObject. And now we're ready to define what values
we want these objects to store
And this is pretty simple: we want a string with the name
of our cards, so we'll call this 'name'. We also want
a string with the description of our card, we'll call that
'description'. Now we also wanna be able to define the artwork for our card
So this is going to be some kind of image
So we create a public sprite
And we'll call it 'artwork'. And then finally we need the gameplay stuff
So we need a public int with the
mana cost, a public int for the attack value
and a public int for the health
and here we have all information that each card
will contain. Notice how we have a green line under the 'name'
That's because by default any object
has a variable called 'name'. So we can either rename this
to say 'cardName' or we can just tell the object to use
this definition of name from here on out
To do that, we write 'public new' string. And now every time
we write card.name, this is what it'll use
So if we're now save this and go into unity
Not much will happen here. You'll notice that I don't
have any cards in the project. If I select this script
it just shows the script here and for some reason we have a field
for the artwork here, but none of the other stuff.
Remember, this script is only the template for our cards.
So how do we go ahead and create a card from this template?
Well that's exactly what we need to define
Unity makes this really easy with an attribute
called 'CreateAssetMenu'.
We need to always put this right above our class
This will basically tell Unity to make
it possible to create this object through the create asset menu
Which means every time you right click in the project and go
Create. So we're basically now adding a new object
To this list. Now we need to define a few things here.
Set default file name to something like 'New Card'.
As well as the MenuName to something like 'Card'
And if you have multiple cards you can create a submenu by going
'Cards' and then '/' . And then you can have all the specific cards in here
But we only have one so we'll stick to Card.
If we now save this and go to Unity (wait for the editor to
compile here) and if we then right click
go create, you can now see that there's indeed a card here
If we press it, it's going to create an object.
By default it says 'New Card'. Let's call this one 'Edwin'
Then at the top here we can set the name to 'Edwin'
We can create a description: 'the
baddest guy in town'. Select some artwork I'm gonna open up here. I've already imported a sprite that we can use
Set the manacost, I'm gonna set that to 3, and attack value
And the health value. So here we go. We've now created an
object that is as simple as can be
All it does: it stores information about a given card. And we can go ahead
And create as many as these as we want. We can right click again.
Go Create, 'Card'. This time we can create Tirion.
His name is going to be 'Tirion', his description is going to be:
'His light shall burn you!'. We can select
some artwork. A manacost, let's set that
to 6, an attack value, and some health
so now we've defined these two cards. But currently they're just sitting inside
of the editor. We need some way of putting these cards
Into the game.
In other words we need to display them on the UI I've created here
To do that we need another script. So let's select our card
Add Component, and
let's call this one 'CardDisplay'. Let's again
click C# and create and open up visual studio
This time we want to delete our update method
But let's leave our start method in here because it sets the start of the game
that we want to setup our card
But in order to do this, we first need a reference to the scriptable object
That we want to display. To do that, we'll simply create a 'public'
'Card'. And we'll call it 'card' with a non-capital 'c'.
And it's actually that easy.
Now inside of Unity we get this empty field where we can take any
of our two scriptable objects. I'm gonna take Edwin here and drag
him in. And now inside of our script we can access
all of the data that we stored inside of this object
So if we want it, we can just print out the name of the card
By going 'card.name'. If we now save this
and play the game, it's going to show
'Edwin' in the console. So that's really cool.
In fact we can also add symbol methods to our scriptable objects.
We can go in here and create a public void
called 'Print'
And this method will simply show some of the card information
in the console. So we'll throw a Debug.Log
And here we'll print the name of the card, followed by
a description. So, a description on the card
And then we can print, say, the manacost, so we'll go
The card costs
and then the manacost. So if we save that and go
into CardDisplay, we can simply call
call.Print();
And if we save this and hit play
It's going to print: 'Edwin, the baddest guy in town'
The card costs 3. Awesome! But we can do better
Instead of just showing this stuff in the console
Let's show it on the UI
To do that, instead of printing the card to the console, let's
go and reference all of our UI elements
To do that, we need to be using
'UnityEngine.UI; and now we can create a public
text. This is going to be our nameText
We'll also create a public text 'descriptionText'
then we need a public Image
this is going to be our artwork image
And then a public text manaText
manaText. public text
attackText. And you guessed it,
a healthText. Then in Unity we'll setup these references
So we'll put name into the nameText slot
Then description, then the artwork image
is under here, so there's an artwork image
the manaText, the attackText
and the healthText. And now in the start method, we can simply set
nameText.text
equals to card.name;
and descriptionText.text = card.description;
we can really just continue this way for the artwork image
We need to make sure to access the sprite
And set it equal to card.artwork. And for
the manaText we'll go manaText.text
equals card.manaCost. But we remember
that manaCost is a number, it's an integer, so we need to convert
this to a string. To do that, we simply call .toString();
And we do the same thing for the attack and health.
[long musical break, go make a tea]
And there we go! That should be all of the code that
we need. If we now save this and try and play
the game. We can see all of our UI elements
get updated to show Edwin's information.
And we can input any scriptable object here
If you want to show Tirion instead, we simply drag in Tirion
and hit play, and there we go! Our card
is now Tirion. In fact, we can easily copy this card
and place them side by side, let's make one
of them Tirion and the other one Edwin. When we now play the game
We can see our two cards. And right now we're just doing
This in the start method. You can easily update this
while the game is running. Because we're just swapping out
symbol information. And each of these scriptable objects are
extremely small. You can see both Edwin
and Tirion is only 1 Kb.
So yea, scriptable objects are super cool.
That's pretty much it for this video. If you enjoyed it, make sure to

Happy New Years, and I'm looking forward to an awesome 2018
With plenty of game dev goodness! On that, thanks for watching!
And I will see you in the next video.
