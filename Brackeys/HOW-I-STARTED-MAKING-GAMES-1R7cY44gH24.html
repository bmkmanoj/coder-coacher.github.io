games especially the ones without any
clear objective my favorite kind was
sandbox games because they wouldn't tell
you what to do instead you had to come
up with ideas on your own and often
these games would give a glimpse into
what it might feel like to make it game
yourself I remember spending hours upon
hours in Garry's Mod trying to figure
out the intricacies of how the engine
worked to this day I still considered
one of the greatest games ever made
exactly because it wasn't a game it was
something more I was always on the
lookout for a new sandbox game or mod
that I could delve into I went from
powder game - Gary smart to Warcraft 3
World Editor
he has spent months making custom
tower-defense maps and just goofing
around with the engine but I still
wanted to make a game of my own and it's
fun as some of these tools were I just
wanted something simple that would allow
me to do that so I downloaded unity
thanks to have the awesome pigeon all
right the story is not over unity was
still in early stages at this point and
no one had really heard about it instead
I picked up game maker not game maker
studio as you know it back then it was
well different game maker was fun but I
quickly found myself searching for
something more especially because I
wanted to experiment with 3d for this
reason I started using blender now those
of you who've been following this
channel for a while probably know that
I'm a terrible 3d modeler seriously it's
bad so instead of failing at making
realistic renders I embarked upon
blenders visual scripting solution and
actually succeeded in making a few
smaller games of course the visuals were
made up of cubes but still we all have
to start somewhere but something about
programming visually didn't feel right
this was probably mostly because of how
limited blenders no they did it was back
then regardless I couldn't get the idea
of writing real code out of my head so I
experimented with Python Visual Basic
and HTML but at this point I didn't
really get programming in fact it seemed
unnecessarily hard and I always ended up
feeling bored by it
I wished like many others before me that
I could make a game without having to
think about programming so I teamed up
with some friends we've all beginners
back then in fact we were still kids but
we had ideas and weren't afraid to try
them out together we had a 3d modeler
a Java programmer a character artist and
then of course me I wanted to be the one
that brought it all together and since
we decided on using unity there was no
other way than to learn how to use it
ironically I started by watching YouTube
tutorials back then the biggest channel
making videos on unity was tornado twins
some of you might remember these guys
with that help I was able to put
together a prototype for a first game
awake an ambitious ambience based 3d
side scroller with puzzles and
platforming mechanics of course to no
one's surprise spin complete beginners
we might have bit off more than we could
chew
so having learned nothing from our
mistake we moved on to an even bigger
project your game inspired by a love for
sandbox games we set out to make a game
where the players make their own games
this time we managed to get the core
gameplay working and I was starting to
really enjoy scripting finally
programming was beginning to make sense
for me now I still couldn't write two
lines of code without a gazillion errors
but hey I still wrote those two lines of
code and working on your game is
actually also how I got into making
tutorials back then we didn't have a
marketing budget in fact we didn't have
a budget at all so we needed a way to
let people know about our game once it
got released so I thought what better
way to build an audience of people
interested in sandbox games than by
making tutorials so I started my first
series on creating a survival game in
unity completely unknowing that my first
video ever would have over a million
views only a few years later and in
truth I had no idea what I was doing
back then but I think out of all game
developers that's the most common thing
learning as you go game development is a
bit like jumping into the water before
knowing how to swim all you can do is
hope that somehow you find a way to
float but that's also what makes it so
exciting all projects are different and
with each one comes to a new set of
challenges that are even more
complicated than the previous ones
it's exciting but it's also easy to lose
track sometimes you just have to remind
yourself to look back at how far you've
come I still remember the thrill of
getting the character moving around the
screen in fact I still get some of that
thrill when I do the same thing now but
thankfully the end result is a lot
better and in five years I'll probably
look back at the games I've made lately
and think of a million ways they could
be improved
I guess we'll just have to wait and see
