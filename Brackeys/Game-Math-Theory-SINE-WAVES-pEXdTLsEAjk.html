over comes this video in game math
theory a series that covers essential
mathematical concepts that you will
definitely run into during your game
development career today we'll be
looking at sine waves the topic of sine
waves is one of those fundamental
mathematical phenomenons that has
fascinated developers for a long time
because of their simple organic nature
they're used in a number of ways in
totally different aspects of development
such as making waves in the ocean moving
around enemies or even generating sound
so what is a sine wave
a sine wave is a function if we observe
a sine wave shown on a coordinate system
we can see that if we input any value
which we call X into the function sine
we will get some value that's called
that Y if for example we insert the
value 1 into the function we get a value
of 0.8 as we insert values of increasing
size we can see that the resulting Y
value smoothly goes from 0 to 1 to 0 to
minus 1 and then back to 0 we say that
the function oscillates between 1 and
minus 1 from the graph it becomes clear
that the function repeats itself in fact
we can keep zooming out from the graph
and the sine wave will always repeat to
understand why this is happening we have
to look at how a sine wave is
constructed we begin by drawing a circle
in the center of our coordinate system
and giving it a radius of exactly 1 unit
you'll never guess what the circle is
called that's right the unit circle I
need to get out more if we then draw a
line from the center of the circle to a
point on the circle we can create a
right angle triangle where line will act
as the hypotenuse now what if I told you
that the angle in the left-hand corner
of the triangle is actually the x value
that we input into the function and that
the y coordinate of the upper corner of
the triangle which we can just read off
the y axis is in fact the resulting
value of the function so if we begin at
an x value of 0 meaning that the angle
will be 0 degrees and then start to
increase that number we see that the
height of the triangle slowly moves
towards 1 then back to 0 and as our
angle goes above 180 degrees the Y value
becomes minus 1 and then completes the
loop by going back to 0 here's how it
looks together with the graph because
the total number of degrees in a circle
is 360 our function will repeat in
intervals of exactly 360 which we also
see on the graph one thing
we have to be careful with when dealing
with the sign function is that because
it uses an angle as input we have to
decide what unit of measurement we want
to use most people are familiar with
using degrees to measure angles but it's
just as common to use radians the only
difference is that instead of going from
zero degrees to 360 degrees the angle
goes from zero radians to two pi radians
pi of course being the number 3.14 so
let's have a look at a practical example
where sine waves come in handy say that
we want to create a cool hover animation
for a coin well whenever we want to
animate something over time we simply
use the amount of seconds passed since
we started the game as input for our
sine function so in this case we could
set the Y position of our coin equal to
the sine of T where T is time that means
that the coin starts with the Y position
of zero and then smoothly moves up and
down as time goes by if you want to
increase the speed of our animation we
would multiply our time variable with
some number multiplying by two will make
the animation go twice as fast
just as multiplying with 0.5 will make
the animation go twice as slow we can
also influence how far the coin moves up
and down to do this we simply multiply
the entire function sine of T by a
number so if you want the coin to move
two units up and two units down we would
multiply it by two and again we can
reduce the distance that the coin moves
by multiplying with a small number but
hey that's just a theory
at game maths the bonus fact that beep
sound is made with the sine wave
remember the coin is just one example of
where you can insert sine functions to
create repeating behaviors and hopefully
this video has given you some ideas of
how you can play with sine waves
yourself if you make something cool or
have any questions make sure to share it
on the brakus forum that's pretty much
all I have to show for this video if
you're interested in learning more about
sine waves that's a link for that in the
description I hope you enjoyed this
