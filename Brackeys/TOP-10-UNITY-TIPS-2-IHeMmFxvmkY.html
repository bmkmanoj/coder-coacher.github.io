previous unity tips were received I love
you guys we're asking for more so here
are my top ten unity quick to cue point
oh alright let's go number one
maximizing windows you can click the
maximize and minimize windows and unity
by hovering over them and hitting shift
space this is particularly useful for
the scene and game view and sometimes
even the animator if you're working on a
large controller number two locking
layers sometimes when you're working on
the scene with a lot of objects it can
be hard to select the right one
thankfully unity allows you to create a
layer assigned objects you don't want to
click on to that layer and then lock it
it even works for sorting layers as well
now you can click away without a care in
the world
number three quick focus now most people
have been using unity for a little while
probably know that you can quickly focus
on an object by selecting it hovering
over the scene view and hitting F but
something that a lot of people miss is
that if you double tap the F key you
will lock onto that object so this is
really useful if you want to inspect
moving objects number four tooltips
in the last video we looked at using
headers and spaces to better organize
your script but if you want to be a
hundred percent on top of your inspector
game you can use the tooltip attribute
to write a variable description that
will appear when hovering over it number
five Auto statements when writing for
loop there's quite a bit of syntax that
you need to get right luckily in Visual
Studio you can simply write for and then
press the tab key twice this will
automatically generate a folio you can
now just tap through and fill out the
desired information then hit enter to
complete it this also works with if for
each while and switch statements number
six region for some reason I see very
few people using regions when
programming and unity personally I
couldn't do a day without it we didn't
allow you to mark a certain part of your
code this way if you sometimes write
monstrously large scripts like I do you
can easily collapse parts of your code
to focus on the important bits to begin
a section simply write hashtag region
and insert hashtag and region to close
it
number seven documentation shortcut ever
wondered what a component does or what
one of the variables mean well you can
quickly navigate to the documentation
for component by simply hitting the book
in the upper right corner this is a lot
faster than doing a Google search
number eight expand and collapse all if
you're holding down old while expanding
an object in the hierarchy it will
expand all child objects as well the
same thing happens when collapsing
number nine color picking again most
people
they know that you can send McCullers
using the color picker one neat thing
about this though is that you can
actually pick colors from outside the
unity editor number ten
undocking the preview if you're
inspecting a model or animation and want
to get a closer look you can right click
in the upper part of the preview John
