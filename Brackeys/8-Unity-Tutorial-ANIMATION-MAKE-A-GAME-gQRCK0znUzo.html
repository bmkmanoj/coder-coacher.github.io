welcome to video number 8 in make a game
a cool series on making a video game in
unity today's subject is animation so
we're going to do everything in the
animation window and we'll go into that
in just a sec but before then what
you're seeing is today's featured
project
it's called moonwalk and it's made by
Jakob games using these tutorials are
very well done if you want to get
featured next week or have a chance to
get featured you can write to me at
brekkie suite on twitter that's also on
the screen or if you want to know more
about moon walk you can click the link
or the annotation on the screen and see
the video and download the game it's
it's very well done congratulations
Jacob Games okay so let's take right
into today's subject
first off let's go ahead and just sort
some of these things out I think we have
a little too many objects here so in the
project pane so let's right click hit
create folder and let's make a material
folder so we're going to call this
materials try again there so and select
all of the materials using holding down
ctrl I'm pretty sure it's command on a
Mac and then drag them onto the
materials folder just to clear up some
space cool what we're going to be
animating today is the coin object we
made in the last video basically we want
this to rotate all the time until it
gets picked up and then it disappears
you can see here what we laid make made
last basically when we roll into it it
just disappears in the next video we're
going to do some particles that makes it
look really cool when everybody get up
but before we go ahead and animate it
let's just select the poll and I really
want to bump up the rotation speed I
think it's simply too slow so I'm going
to double that up to 200 hit play and
see if this feels right yeah it's much
more responsive now and feels a lot more
to control grade well basically there
are multiple ways to do animation in
unity and the three ways I can think of
right now are first of which through
scripting so basically instead of
animating it visually you can go in and
make a script that says for example if
we wanted to rotate that it should
rotate a little bit each frame on a
certain axis though that's too
complicated for what we're going to do
now it's much easier to just make an
animation so that's what we are going to
do but you could also make an animation
in another program and then use unities
new animation system called makin 'm and
that's using the animator here which is
now grayed out and that's also a more
complicated thing you use that if you
want to like animate characters and such
but that's really difficult so we're not
going to get into that if you want to
know more about that you can watch our
survival games tutorial series but
basically what we are going to do today
is use the basic animation component so
we can just select the coin go to add
component go to miscellaneous and hit
animation not animator but animation
click that and now we can add an
animation clip but in order to do that
we'll have to first make a clip so let's
go to window animation or press control
6 to open it up and this is how it looks
I really like to dock the animation
panel down here by the project and then
just drag it up quite a bit what we can
do now is we can make our game view sit
by the side of our scene view by simply
dragging it over and dark it by the side
here so we can see changing in both the
game view and the scene view okay great
so basically what we are going to be
doing now is we're going to be changing
the transform of the objects and there
is a new animation system coming in 4.3
this is version 4.2 so things might have
changed just a bit since then but
basically what we're going to need is
the transform component here there's
going to be a add add animation thing
button right here and what you need to
add is to transform that's all we need
to change its the transform
great so what we're going to do is we're
going to press this red button and
that's going to allow us to create an
animation call it whatever we want and
we're going to call this um coin rotates
like that and now you can see we can
start changing the different variables
here and the animation editor is really
cool because you can change pretty much
any value on to the stored on the game
object so that could be a we could
change the trigger or we could change a
light or we could change every can
change anything you can also go down to
the chilled
children of the object and change some
of them but again we're going to do the
transform here and what we want is the
rotation Y and the reason why is because
this green arrow here that's the Y you
can also see it up here in the right
hand of the scene view and and basically
if we rotate around that use that as a
pivot it will rotate around this way so
if we go ahead and try to just change
the Y over here on the right hand side
in the inspector we can see rotating the
right way but yeah so basically this
needs to start at zero so let's make
sure that the rotation Y is at zero and
then you can see this little thing this
little key that you can press on the
right-hand side of the Y let's just
press that and hit add key now that we
have done this it's made what is called
a keyframe and that's basically saying
that when we are at this point in time
the rotation should be this variable and
you can see now here that we can change
a timeline here so we can scrub through
time and you can see that this is one
second I'm pretty sure that's once again
we can go ahead play it there so right
now we don't have any movement because
it always states at zero but let's go
ahead and just zoom out to two seconds
here you consume using the old and
scroll wheel so soon out to two seconds
and let's now change the rotation Y to
360 so 360 and now we can scrub through
this and see our kind rotating and once
it gets to this point it will stop so
basically we can hit play and see
rotating and right now it's actually
looping but let's just make sure that
it's looping correctly by used going
down here it wets this default and
selecting loop so now select loop and
let's hit play and I think the rotation
looked just fine maybe we should just
make it a little bit more slow so let's
do something like 2.4 try again but this
is really up to do I think this looks
just perfect so let's go ahead and stop
the recording here and now we just need
to add it to the object so let's just
drag in this coin rotate wherever you
saved it in the project and drag it onto
the non animation clip here to add it
and now when we make sure that it says
play automatically and again that if we
select it it says loop not default we
can go ahead and hit play let's just
bring up the game view here go ahead and
hit play and we can see the coin
rotating infinitely so this looks really
awesome and that space that's the basics
of using the animation window in unity I
hope you enjoyed this video and I look
forward to seeing what every project you
are making thanks for watching and I'll
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
