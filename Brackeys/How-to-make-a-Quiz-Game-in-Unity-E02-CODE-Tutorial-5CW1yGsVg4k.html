everyone and welcome to this second
video on making a quiz game in unity in
this video we're going to start
programming the game in c-sharp and
today we are only going to be
programming the back-end some of the
actual functionality and then in the
next video we'll have a look at showing
this on the UI so today we'll only be
using our visual studio to programming
you can of course use monodevelop that
comes with unity
it doesn't matter that's just the script
editor and then we'll be using the Unity
console to display what we're making so
that's all so without further ado let's
jump right into unity here and you can
see the project is exactly as we left at
the last time and if I go in the
material UI you can see that we use the
start is seen here I now want to rename
this to our main level and I want to
take this and drag it under the assets
folder just so we have our main level
seen here
you could also just call it main or
whatever actually I'm just going to call
it main since the idea of levels is not
something we're working with in this
game now let's go ahead and create an
empty object by right-clicking in the
hierarchy and select create empty let's
drag this to the top let's reset the
transform and rename this to game
manager and this is going to host the
central script containing all of the
logic that our game needs and one second
let me just move wire out of the way
here so the game manager containing all
of the game logic it will loading
questions it will choose a random
question it will check whether or not
it's true or false and it will unload
the next question so that's what that
will do and then we are also going to
add a separate script down here so right
click create c-sharp script and we're
going to call this one a question
because this is going to be storing what
information we want to have for each
question and now we can go ahead and
double click this and you can see again
mine is opening in Visual Studio if
yours is opening in monodevelop
that's just fine it's not going to make
in
actual difference it's just going to
look a tiny bit different here so you
can see here on that we can first off
delete these two using tags because we
are not going to be using either unity
engine or system duct collections we can
delete the derived from monobehaviour
and we can delete these two starting
methods so we just have an empty class
and c-sharp is of course an
object-oriented programming language and
that means that we have the ability to
sketch out and describe different
objects in our game and the first object
we are creating here is a question and
that's not only the question itself I
mean that could be is them water on Mars
that's just a simple string we also need
to have some kind of understanding of an
answer so that could be one example or
multiple answer options should also be
within this question class so whatever
information is associated with a single
question is something we are going to
store in here and the first thing I want
to do here is I want to tag this as a
system dot serializable and all this
means is that it will notify unity and
the system that this class can be saved
and store information and the cool thing
that this will allow us to do is edit it
in the inspector when we implemented
later so we can make all of our
different questions not in here but
inside of unity and that's going to be a
true luxury so the first thing that we
want to do here is make a public string
this is this of course being some kind
of text and this string is going to be
called fact because in my game I want on
to display a series of facts that are
either true or false and then the user
you can guess whether or not they're
true or false so the question here is
going to be the fact it could also be
the actual question you can't do
question here and then simply call it by
saying question the question well I'm
going to call this fact and then we are
going to have a public boolean that is
either true or false and this
is going to store whether or not the
fact is true so this is just going to be
called is true I notice that I'm not
setting any defaults for this I'm not
setting them to any particular values
I'm just saying that this is what needs
to be inside of the question class now
we can move on to the other script we
created which is the game manager script
and here we can keep both unity engine
and system data collections we are going
to be needing them both and derived from
monobehaviour
however we are going to remove these two
methods and the first thing that we want
to create here is some kind of list of
questions more specifically we're going
to be using an array remember in c-sharp
we have two different ways on that
primarily two different ways of storing
a series of data and those are called
arrays and lists and they both list just
a bunch of data that are associated with
a number in the list but the array is
used when we don't need to resize the
list and the list is used when we do
need to resize it at runtime so you can
see here because we are always going to
have a fixed set of questions that we
specify beforehand before running the
game we can use an array and so declare
an array we do a public question so we
don't want this to be a single question
we want this to be an array so we go
like that and then we call this
questions so this is a list of questions
are specified by the question class then
inside of our start method this is
called whenever we start the game or we
reload the scene well we want to have
some kind of well right now we have an a
list that stores all of the different
questions we've created and if we go out
and minimize visual studio and go back
into unity and select the game manager
you can see here that it's already
appeared in the inspector again you need
to make sure that you've tagged the
question classes system that
serializable or it's not going to appear
if we go over here now we have this
array and we can make this a size of
three and we now have three different
element three different questions in
here that we can configure so the first
fact could be I am a genius and I
apparently don't seem to be because I
can't spell genius so I am super cool
and this of course just happens to be
true we have another fact which is
violets are red and that's not that's
not true and then we have on the final
statement or fact and that is that two
plus two equals four and that happens to
be true also so now we have created
three different questions and we've
specified whether or not they're true we
can simply collapse these and now we
know they are there so that is what is
stored inside of this questions array
however when running the game we want to
keep track of which questions we have
already answered and the way that I want
to pick questions is I want to pick a
random question but I don't want to be
able to pick the same one twice and
therefore we need a private and now we
don't need an array we need a list
because I want this list to contain all
of the different questions in the
beginning and then as we answer more and
more questions I want to remove them
from the list so this is going to be a
private and then it's going to be a
static and the reason why I'm making
this a static question is because I want
this question list to persist between
scenes so when we reload the scene to
load in the next question on this it's
going to remember what is stored so I
want to make a private static and in
order to use a list we are going to go
up here and say using system dot
collections dot generic and now we have
access to lists so a private static list
and the syntax is a bit different here
and then we're going to put in the
question like that and then close it off
or of course we need a name so the name
here should be unanswered unanswered
this is not correct there we go
unanswered questions and simply close
that off then in this dark method when
we start our game we want to load in all
of the different questions into the
unanswered question so that when we
begin our game for the first time all of
the questions that we have available
will be on answered but we only want to
do this when starting up the game we
don't want this when changing seems and
start is loaded every time we change the
scene or we reload a scene and therefore
we need some kind of method for checking
whether or not we've already done this
when we haven't done this meaning by
default before we load these questions
in there is nothing in this list
therefore it is marked as null so what
we can simply do is check if unanswered
questions is equal to null meaning
there's nothing in the unanswered
questions list well then we can go ahead
and say that unanswered questions equals
questions however there is a tiny
problem with this and I'll show you that
in a second the first thing that I want
to point out is that it is actually
possible for there to be whoops looks
like I hit a button there for there to
be um zero elements in the list but for
it to not be marked as null and that is
if we have have answered all of the
questions meaning that we've done this
step and then gone through all the
questions then the amounts of questions
in the list will be zero but it has
still been declared so it's not equal to
null and therefore we need to also check
if um if unanswered questions dot count
meaning the elements
the number of elements in the list is
equal to zero then we just want to start
over and this is of course the or so
we'll do this step if this is true or if
this is true then down here we can't
directly set a list equal to an array we
simply want to take all the things in
the array and load it into the list and
in order to do that easily we can go up
here and say using system dot link and
what this does is it offers a bunch of
methods to make stuff like this very
easy so we have now have the abilities
to say questions dot to lists and it's
going to be a questions list and top
that off and that will do that step four
so to wrap up what we've done here is
we've created a an array of questions
that we fill in in the inspector then
when we begin the game for the very
first time here we make sure to load
those questions into a list of
unanswered questions so the next task
would be to get some kind of random
question and the current question that
we are the user can answer is something
that we are going to store in a private
variable so we're going to have a
private question and this is singular
because it's only one question at a time
that the user can answer and this
private our question is going to be a
cold current question there we go and
then down here we simply say a pick
random question choose random question
get random question whatever you want to
do I'm just going to say get random
question is what we want to do here and
now we need to specify what that means
so we'll say void get random question
we're going to make a function here that
does this for us so in here what we need
to do is we need to choose a random
number between zero and the number of
elements in the unanswered questions
list this way we get an index a random
index that points to an a random element
in the list and we'll store this as an
integer so this is going to be the went
rain
question index and it's going to be
equal to random range this will give us
random dot dot range there we go this
will give us a random integer between 0
and the number of elements in the
unanswered questions list with which is
unanswered questions count there we go
and round that off and what we can do
now is we can temporarily we can set
current question equal to and then
unanswered questions and then we want
the element at index random question
index there we go so let's say right now
we have three elements in the list this
will get a either 0 1 or 2 to access
that element let's say we get a 1 here
this is going to be now 1 then it's
going to take element number 1 out of
the list and put it into current
question so we can access it up here or
from where we want inside the script the
cool thing now is that we can simply go
ahead and remove that same question so
from the list now it's already answered
actually it's just loaded in but we'll
just pretend like we've already answered
it it's going to be basically the same
thing the only edge case would be if we
went to a menu of some sorts when right
when this was happening before we
actually answered it but that's some
great behavior that we are not going to
be thinking about so the next thing we
want to do here is we want to say and
not unanswered questions don't remove
add and it this means that we specify an
index of an element that we want to
remove and that's of course going to be
the random question index and now it's
gone from the list it's same thing
simply like it was never there and we
can make sure this way that we don't
pick the same question twice good so now
that we've gotten a random question
let's just try and print this out in the
console so we can see that this is
actually working so let's say debug
dialog and again we are going to be
displaying this in the UI in in a later
video right now I simply want to see if
this is working so we're going to print
out a current question dot fact and then
+ and I'm just going to make a space and
then say is space + current question dot
is true so we're going to print out the
fact and whether or not it's true let's
try that for a second and we are going
to do this every time we hit play so if
we go to the console here it should show
one of these and the corresponding
boolean value so you can see here it
says violets are red is false and if we
go there you can see it's marked as
false
we now simply restart the game here it
picked the same one we can try that
again
now it says I am supercool is true and
indeed we set that to true however true
it might actually be and now you can see
it actually chose the last one here so
it says two plus two equals four and
that is true so you can see that it's
now correctly choosing a random question
it's not it does sometimes change the
same quiz or choose the same question
over and over but that's because we are
actually right now restarting the game
and not just reloading the level when we
get to the actual level reloading you
will see this working so that was
basically it for on this video in the
next one we'll have a look at
implementing this with the UI to make it
more responsive we'll implement what is
going to happen whenever we choose
whether or not it's true or false and
maybe even displayed this in some way so
we'll have a look at that yeah so I hope
you enjoyed this video if you like this
format please let me know in the
comments and also I have a lot more
coming don't worry so thanks for
watching and I'll see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
