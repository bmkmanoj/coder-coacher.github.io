everyone and welcome to this video this
is a live stream on creating a kind of
bubble travel bubble struggle or replica
inside of unity what we're going to be
making is this and if we just hit play
here I'm just going to show you how it
works and we have some character
movement we have a ball jumping around
and when we hit that ball using this
chain arrow shooty thing you can see
that the ball splits into two and it
will keep doing that until we get to the
final stage which is these little green
ones and once we hit those and you can
see if the ball hit us the level
restarts and so the goal of the game is
of course to clear out all of the balls
without getting hit yourself and I'm
really really bad at this that
especially when are streaming I just
tend to crumble in terms of gameplay I
would never be able to make it as a
professional gamer so but that's what
we're going to be doing today so really
exciting stuff and yeah let's just go
ahead and get started so let's begin by
creating a new project inside of unity
so let's go file new project and I'm
just going to be naming this something
like bubble struggle I'll rip the cap
and we can go and save it under my
project that's fine and we'll select 2d
as a standard doesn't really matter and
let's also create a project there and
unit is just going to go ahead and
create all of the necessary files in
order to make the project run in the
background and I'll have a sip of water
while we wait for that and again I can
see in the chat on this will be on
youtube so don't worry about that and
later we'll do a Q&amp;amp;A so that's super
that's going to be super fun so we have
this clear unity Pro project here and
what I want to do is begin by just
creating ourselves a level so let's
start by saving the scene ctrl s or
command as if you're on the Mac let's
just save this as main level let's also
kind of sketch out what we need to have
in here we need a player we need
balls jumping around and we need some
walls to kind of encapsulate our level
and maybe some kind of background as
well so in terms of creating the player
and walls in the background I want to
use very very simple sprites for this
actually I just want to use squares
which are white so that we can tint them
inside of unity and we could just go
inside Photoshop GIMP go on google
search for white square that's so much
there but I've prepared some here just
in case so we have a square here and
again it's just a 2x2 white rectangle
really really easy and in case it's too
hard for you to create a 2x2 rectangle
you can always get this off github later
so let's drag this inside of the project
panel and then directly inside of the
hierarchy and we now have it in our
scene and this is going to act as our
wall so let's just go ahead and rename
this to wall let's also give this a box
Collider 2d and we don't want that to be
trigger but I do actually want to mark
it as a rigidbody 2d which is going to
be kinematic and the reason for that is
later when we handle collision detection
it's going to be really nice to have
this mic as rigidbody to DS because then
we don't need to do it on our chain and
it will make things easier but we'll
talk about that later for now just add
this component and follow along with me
and the next thing is of course on
scaling this so I want to give it a Y
position of negative let's say 4.5
something like that just make sure it's
in within the confines of our screen and
I also want to scale this up so we can
scale it up to maybe something like 75
it's going to look quite okay I think
yeah I think that looks just fine so we
can take this wall here and we can turn
it in to a prefab down here and that
means that we can just easily duplicate
it and we can move this one up so we're
just going to do force positive for
point five and we can maybe I'll rename
these so this first one is going to be
wall on the square bottom could also
call it ground if you wanted to we're
going to have wall underscore
and we can duplicate this boil wall
underscore tub and we can rotate it by
90 degree on the z axis so just flip it
over so make it into sidewall and we
want to zero the Y and we can drag it
over on the X and I don't know exactly
how much we're going to need this to be
but I think something like negative six
is going to look fine yeah that looks
just fine and then we can change the
scale a bit here so maybe bump it down
to I don't know exactly how much I think
57 might be good actually not totally so
we might need to do 0.5 that's too much
that's kind of annoying we can do 57 on
that and we can take the other ones here
the top and the bottom and we can maybe
adjust those let's see um if we just
need to drag those over there so that's
76 for those and that's the whole number
that's a lot better something like that
that looks perfect cool so we can take
this sidewall now and we can rename that
to wall left we can duplicate it
rename it to wall right and then flip
that x position so we're just going to
make this from a negative 6 to 8
positive 6 so now you can see we have
the frame for a level and let's just see
how the chat is doing you guys are being
immature again I'm just going to ignore
that and then we can maybe drag in a
background here as well so let's take
our square drag it in as a new thing we
don't want to have this with any
colliders or anything like that this
just needs to be a sprite renderer and
we can go ahead and add a sorting layer
here so that we will draw it behind
everything else and that means that the
layer needs to be drawn or placed on top
because then it will be drawn first and
then everything else will be placed on
top of that so on the background that's
awesome and then we can mark that as the
background we can also change the color
we'll do that in a sec first let's scale
this up so let's just have a little get
it in here see we can bump up the X oops
that's too much
was it I believe it was 76 awesome that
looks good and on the Y here
it was 65 what was it it was 657 Jesus
all right 57 ah they're awesome and now
when we change the color of this of
course it's not going to blend together
so that's perfect so we can just make it
kind of a darker or gray and we can take
our walls this wall and change the color
of those and I'm just going to change
the color on the prefab to affect all of
them directly so I wanted to do kind of
a greenish feel for this one because we
haven't done much with green maybe even
blueish actually I want it to be kind of
green and um we can take our main camera
and change the background to something
that looks like it so let's just first
off color pick this one and you can
totally I'll use this I mean that looks
just fine but I want it to be a bit
darker and less saturate it just to make
the actual level part stand out and give
it this nice edge so that already looks
quite decent and I mean currently we
don't have any gameplay in here but that
is really our environment so to say
we've pretty much done everything we
need to do for that so let's just rename
this one to your background
let's also clean it up by creating a new
empty object and that's just
control-shift-n
or command shift end to create a new
empty object let's reset the transform
and that's called this one walls and we
can take all of our four walls and drag
those and to be a child of the walls
object just to clean things up in the
hierarchy just simply looks nicer
awesome everything else yes this is a
duty game and I am going to be using the
Unity physics engine definitely and yeah
awesome we can just go ahead and
continue so the next thing that we need
in here is of course some player
controls so let's just go in here and I
actually want to duplicate this square
to create a new one and you might ask
why don't we just drag in the square
here and use that to create our player
and the reason why is I want this Square
to have a pivot in the very center I
wanted to
be anchored in the center of the square
however if our player was going to be
standing on the ground I would like him
to have a pivot at the very foot of the
character so that when we Ciro him out
or at least place him on here that's
what the coordinate system is going to
be oriented towards and that's going to
help us later
so let's just go ahead and rename this
one to player as player square or
something let's just do player and um in
here we simply want to change the pivot
from centre to bottom nets bottom center
and we can hit apply and that should
pretty much be it so now when we go in
here you can see that our anchor is
indeed down there so that's perfect and
we definitely want to scale him up he's
very tiny so let's do something like 4
on the Y and 2 on the X it's going to
look just fine we can rename him player
and we can also definitely just drag him
down on the Y here we want to place him
just on top something like that and he s
is actually going to have gravity so we
can place him with a bit of distance
here and then he will fall onto the
ground once we hit play so let's now go
in here add a box Collider 2d and that
is just going to auto scale to fit I
believe yep looks good it might be hard
to see on the livestream but I can
definitely see a green box there and um
we shouldn't need to edit that might
need to string it a little bit but that
shouldn't be too much maybe let's just
do that right away so 0.15 on the X
point 1 5 on the Y I just think that
unity tends to exaggerate their
collisions and it looks better if you
shrink the Collider it's a tiny bit and
next up we need a rigid body so let's do
a rigidbody 2d and someone asked what
the difficulty rating of this tutorial
is I would say it's somewhere between a
beginner and intermediate mostly
beginner really we are going to be doing
some C sharp scripting of course so if
that really scares you um you'll just
have to kind of follow along and take my
explanation for what it is and then you
can copy my code and get it to work that
way but what we are going
to be programming isn't super advanced
we're going to be instantiated we're
going to be changing some positions
adding a bit of force doing a bit with
triggers that's pretty much it so yeah
so now we have our rigidbody 2d on here
and let's see we can pretty much leave
all of the different values exactly as
is and we do actually want it to be
dynamic as well sometimes with player
characters you want them to use
kinematics so you have full control over
their movement but we wanted to react to
our colliders on the side walls and
therefore I'll just leave it as dynamic
one thing that we do want to do is add
some constraints because we don't want
to be able to rotate on the Z in that
case our player would be able to fall
over which would look super weird and
you can also freeze the position on the
y-axis but I'm not going to be doing
that because you might want to have your
player on different levels I mean you
can have say platforms where he's able
to move as well and from where you can
shoot his arrow thingy and that should
work just fine and I know that the
bubble struggle games that I played
utilize that in order to create smaller
distances where the balls jump to give
the impression that it balls jump faster
because there's not as much room and you
you get scared and it's it's a whole
crazy thing so yeah so we'll put a
constraint on only the rotation so now
when we hit play we should see that our
plate just falls to the ground awesome
everything looks good but we can't move
him in any way so let's go in here and
add a tiny bit of movement to our player
in order to do that let's select our
player hit add component and let's
create a new script called let's just
call it player actually and some of you
guys requested some cat action and the
reason for my type over there was that
one of them just laid his head upon the
keyboard because he fell asleep so I
just moved in over here and maybe when
he wakes up we can get him on camera so
umm awesome so we have a player here and
let's double-click on the player script
and let's have that open up in visual
studio and I can see that I currently
have two instances that's
thing that happens when you create a new
project sometimes visuals do you want
open that it's going to open it in a new
instance so just yeah remove the other
one there and we're not going to be
using systems or collections or
collections generic so we can just
remove those we're actually only going
to be using unity engine and the first
thing that I want to do is create a
variable of type float that is going to
store our players speed so let's just do
a speed here and to fold it to something
like for in the original games that I
played
the speed of the player was actually
quite low and that definitely made the
games more difficult because you had to
time it better because you weren't able
to escape out of really tricky
situations you simply weren't fast
enough but I think the game just feels
in place nicer when you have a higher
speed I thought the old speed limit was
a bit frustrating so I'm just going to
put it at four which is a bit higher but
you can definitely go in and edit that
to suit your needs
um cool so I don't think we need to do
anything in this start method really but
we do need a reference to a rigidbody
and we can just do that by making a
public rigidbody 2d variable and calling
it something like RB and then when we
save that head into unity here that
gives us a slot but we can then drag in
that rigidbody TD so that now means that
we have a reference to this component
that allows us to change things on this
component and utilize its functions by
simply referencing the RB name that we
just declared and we could call this
anything just don't call it rigidbody
with non capital letters because that is
a unity shortcut that means something
else and then you're going to have a
conflict and it's going to throw a weird
warning and just stay away from that and
call it something like RB or anything
really and yeah cool and I'm just going
to check check here to make sure that
I'm not going totally on off on a
tangent or anything um yeah everything
looks good
cool so on now inside of the update
method what we will do is we will
there is some input and again we've done
this before in previous live streams
unity has a really really easy way of
getting some input and that's using
input dot get access raw and this
basically allows us to specify whether
or not we want to get input for the
horizontal or the vertical axis and if
we just write horizontal here and it
needs to be in quotes this here if you
just write this it's basically going to
give us a value between minus 1 and 1
and if it's 0 that's if the user hasn't
pressed any buttons if it's minus 1 that
is if the user has pressed to the left
and that means either the a key if
you're using past the left arrow key or
using a controller that he points to the
left and it's going to be 1 if he points
to the right so if you press this D
right arrow or a controller where he
points to the right so this here is a
value that represents in which direction
our player wants to move so all we need
to do is now store this in some variable
and then we can use it to add forces or
move that player so let's store it in a
private float variable and let's call
this one movement and we can set it
equal to zero by default then in here we
simply set movement equal to input get
access wrong but again this is going to
be always between minus 1 and 1 so if we
want to control the speed at which our
player moves we're going to have to
multiply that with our speed value so
now if we multiply this and the user
wants to go to the left it's going to be
minus 4 You've wants to go to the right
it's going to be 4 because our speed
value is 4 and 1 times 4 is 4 code then
in the separate loop here and this is
why okay so we need to write fixed
update here and the reason why we're not
doing the actual movement inside of the
update I mean the logic is fine every
frame we want to move a little bit so
let's just move the player inside the
update is that unities physics system
really likes if movement is done in
fixed update because the physics system
itself uses that to do all of its
calculations so that's why we gather all
of our input inside of the update
that it feels really responsive and then
we do the actual movement the action
moving of our character inside the
fixedupdate because that's where unity
wants to calculate physics so in here
we're going to say something like RB
which is our rigidbody dot move position
and this is a function again that moves
the rigidbody to a certain position and
the position is given by two values
which means a victor - that has an
x-axis and a y-axis and x position and
the Y position so the two values that we
want to give aren't just zero and two we
want to give our current position plus
our movement so in that case what we'll
do is kind of there's several ways that
you can do this actually I just want to
go our beat up position and then we can
add on to that our vector two dot right
multiplied with movement so basically
what we're doing here and this is the
exact same as actually I should maybe be
a bit more clear this is the exact same
thing as saying our BW session Plus
vector two and then as the first
coordinate we specify movement and then
serum so what we're saying is we want to
move to a new position and the position
that we want to move to is our current
position plus a bit of movement on the X
and no movement on the Y so that's
currently what we're doing and if you
think this is a bit confusing that's
because this is about vectors and
vectors are a whole mathematical concept
that you kind of had to have to get in
order to fully understand what's going
on here so if you want to learn more
about that I actually have a video in
the game math theory course on vectors I
believe it was the first video actually
so if you just go to the YouTube channel
youtube.com slash perky's you can go in
there find the video game math theory
forces and learn a lot more about how
this actually works but for now you can
just copy after me and the final thing
that we need to do is actually not use
movement but multiplied with time dot
fixed Delta time as well and that's
because this fixed update here run
at a fixed interval and we just
multiplied with that interval in order
to have it be consistent on different
systems so no matter the rate that this
our function runs ad we're going to have
the same amount of movement so it's just
something that you're going to have to
do and when you do that all the time if
you want to do movement over time
awesome I believe that was pretty much
all we needed to do for movement so now
we should be able to go into unity here
and we should be able to hit play and
let's just move to the left here you can
see that works and to the right that's
awesome and I can both use a and D and
left them all right on the arrow keys
and when we hit a wall you can see we
bump into it and it doesn't work so we
do actually have collision here but it's
in a very controlled way and you can see
just how snappy the movement is I think
that feels really really good
cool so that was play movement and I'm
going to take a sip of water here and
I'm also just going to have a look in
the chat and let's see here yeah someone
says if um we want this to be smooth
instead of really really snappy movement
we can go in here and remove the raw
part so just get access will also give
you a value between minus 1 and 1 but it
will smooth it out so that when you
press a key you can see that it slowly
starts and interpolates as it's called
to the desired direction that's also
super nice for a lot of games but I am
an old-school guy and I'd like the raw
emotion so we're just going to do that
for this game at least but again you're
totally fine just changing that and then
continuing with the tutorial um so yeah
cool so the next thing that we want to
look at is having some bouncy balls in
here so let's go ahead and create them
so again I'm going to be using a very
very simple sprite that I just created
in Photoshop I basically just took the
circle tool created a circle exported it
and that's it and if we um go out to my
desktop here you can see that I've
prepared it here
it's just a circle don't mind that it's
in Photoshop format it could you P P&amp;amp;G
as well just make sure that it has
transparency and all we want to do here
is maybe change the pixels per unit to
something higher just to make it a bit
smaller and I also want to change the
max size to 64 I believe I exported at a
128 and that's just too high we don't
need it so let's now drag this inside of
a game and we can see that that already
looks really good in terms of size for
kind of them medium sized ball so we'll
call this one ball and we'll go in here
and um maybe play around with this a bit
so I want the color of this ball to be a
yellow this variation can be can be
yellow I think it's going to look good
inside the game yeah that looks just
fine and we want to of course add some
properties to it so the first thing is a
Collider I think we want to use a circle
Collider 2d and if you focus on it you
can see that the radius fits exactly the
way that it should but I do actually
wanted to decrease this a tiny bit again
again I think it just produces better
results so let's just try that and if it
looks like it's clipping through the
ground of course we'll just bump that
back up so now that we have our circle
Collider we also want a rigidbody
component again rigidbody 2d of course
and all we really need to do here is
nothing I believe this should work just
fine
at least for now I'll show you a glitch
with this so if we just go ahead and hit
the play hit play now you can see that
it's already working
however it's not really bouncing
anywhere so what we need to do is add
bounciness to the ball and we do that by
adding a physics material that defines
how um the collider and the rigidbody
acts in physics space that has two
properties it has bounciness and
friction so let's go ahead and create
that create a new physics material 2d
let's just call this one ball will
select the ball and drag in our new
physics 2d material there we go and that
sits under the collider not on the dr
rigid but actually you can do it under
the rigidbody as well I didn't know that
I believe that's a new thing doesn't
really matter this works fine then we
can select the bowl we can pump down the
friction to zero we don't want any kind
of forces acting there and then we can
bump the bounciness all the way up to
one so now we can just hit play and we
should see that the ball jumps so that's
awesome
one problem with this is that I tested
it and I just left it there jumping
around and actually it was increasing in
height and you might be able to see this
on stream or it might not be happening
because we are not applying force it's
actually it looks like it is and for
some reason when our bouncing is this
one it should bounce to the exact same
height you can see it is actually
jumping higher and higher and the moment
it's going to hit the ceiling we have
the bounciness that one why is it
gaining momentum that shouldn't be
possible for this ball to jump higher
and higher we're defying all laws of
physics right now and just creating new
force out of nothing but yeah it's
really interesting behavior and the
reason for this really is that if we
just go ahead and pass it we might be
able to see it happen even go
frame-by-frame you can see just how far
the ball actually goes into the ground I
mean it's not because of the collider
adjustment that I made you can see it
goes way below the wall and it's
actually going into the wall and it's
bouncing a bit there and it's creating
this negative force that shoots it right
back and that allows it to gain momentum
so in order to fix that what we need to
do is select our ball and change the
collision detection from discreet to
continuous and this just means that when
it's going to collide against other on
static colliders or things that don't
move which our walls do not it's going
to do it in a much more precise way and
I could of course leave this running for
a long time to show you that in one do
it again but just trust me the dynamic
collision actually works or at least I
haven't had any problems with it
whatsoever it's something that not a lot
of people know but it's a really really
handy trick so what we need to do now is
add
start force to our ball in order to
actually make it kind of move across our
level because it's not really on that
exciting that it's just bouncing up and
down in one place so to do this let's go
ahead and create a new script and we'll
call this one the ball c-sharp script
and we'll double click it to open it up
in Visual Studio and um we can delete
all the systems our collection things
and let's go ahead and create a new
variable and this is going to be a
public vector two and this is going to
be our start force so basically what
this allows us to do is now inside of
unity and this is one of the really
nicely things that unity does is
allowing us to edit vector twos and make
the three threes inside of our scripts
inside of the inspector so in here we
can now say that we want this to start
with the force of positive 2 on the X
and zero on the Y and then of course we
need to also script this so that means
that we want to apply this force inside
of the start method so when we start we
want to do
of course when we're applying a force we
need a reference to our rigidbody
and again we can just do that by
creating a public rigidbody 2d our be
saving that going into unity here and
dragging in the appropriate rigidbody
and that should work fine there we go
whoops back into visual studio now we
just go our b dot add force and the
force that we want to add is our start
force which currently is two on the X
and zero on the Y and we comes to forces
it can be a bit confusing as to how big
does the force need to be in order to
gain on this much movement and stuff
like that because it's not really using
in units we don't have any units on this
it's not using using Newton's or
anything like that but really just play
around with it one thing that I will say
is we need to go in here and specify the
force mode to D to be force mode 2 T to
be in not forced but impulse and this
basically means that it on the values
will need to be much much smaller in
order to actually move
boy you use impulse for one time force
ads such as in the start method say in
an explosion stuff like that you want to
use the impulse mode and you use force
if you want to use a continuous force
application such as for a thruster on a
plane or stuff like that
so we can say that now and we should see
that when we just head in here hit play
the ball should actually be yeah it's it
just shoots over and it keeps going
until something stops it such as our
player and you can see that you can even
interact with our player without any
issue so I'm just going to move this
over here so we won't get hit by it
right away but it's going to do a bit of
bouncing first but it is coming to get
us
cool so um that was kind of the basic
functionality for our ball next up we
need to do something in order to be able
to shoot out some kind of grappling hook
or a harpoon that chain that your sole
Michoud straight up in the air earlier
when I was demonstrating the game and
before we go ahead and do that I'm just
again going to have a quick look in the
chat to see how everyone is doing are
you fine um everything looks good um
let's see here everything looks good
cool yeah so let's just continue so um
what we need to do is of course create
some graphics for this so let's start by
creating a new empty game object again
control-shift-n
and it's called this one chain and I
want this to be the parent object just
sit in the middle at the moment and for
this chain we can drag in a square which
is going to be the graphics of our chain
and I want the skill heat here to be
something like point three on the X I
think it's it should just be really
really thin and basically what I wanted
to do was move or change here down to
kind of the same level as our players so
just let's imagine that it's sitting on
top just on top of our ground here and
let's
move it over and basically why I've
nested these objects is so that we can
have the chain we can give the chain a
pivot point down here and then we can
have the square here move that up and
extend all the way up and you can see
the chain still has a pivot down here so
make sure you're viewing that in pivot
and not Center and that just allows us
to now if we are say scale this up a bit
here so just scale it up here to simply
change the Y scale of our chain in order
to edit that graphic and if we then go
on to a square here and even add a box
Collider 2d and that should
automatically snap onto it here that's
going to scale with it and that might be
hard to see in the video on the stream
but I can actually see that we have the
screen wrapped round so that's awesome
so now we can take our square here and
basically I want when this has a y-value
of 1 I would like this to be go from the
bottom of a screen to the top just to
kind of give ourselves an impression of
what how the sizes are values need to be
in order to reach the top of our level
so I'm just going to drag this up here
and you need to be careful when doing
this that you don't miss whoops messed
things up I was just saying it here and
of course this doesn't need to be
perfect because the way that we're going
to be are checking if our wave should be
pulled back is not by saying if our
chain is that one but instead by
checking for collision collisions with
either the balls or on the top wall here
the ceiling cool so this is going to be
our off I don't know you can do this
chain what do we need to call this chain
graphics but it also has a Collider is
that's not really fitting let's just
call this one chain pivot and then we
can just call that one chain I think
that's actually best I don't like it
let's call this one chain and let's call
this one chain
graphics there we go that's how we're
going to do it and yes it has a Collider
so it's not only graphics and it's also
going to have a script but quite dumb
people I don't know what to call it
awesome so on what we can do now is of
course add a script onto this chain in
order to actually make it interactive
all inside the game so let's go ahead
and add a new c-sharp component and
let's call it chain let's keep it simple
and we can double click this to open it
up in Visual Studio as well and what I
want to do is um start by creating a
public static boolean called is fired or
is firing is doing something whatever is
active something to indicate whether or
not we fired our chain or if it's
waiting to be fired and we want to
default that to false and because this
is a static boolean meaning that it can
be accessed from all other places
without needing a reference to the
instance of the class but only the type
that's very technical explanation I'm
going to show you what that means in a
second but because it's marked as static
it's going to move or keep its value
when we change scenes so when we reload
our level and if this is true it's also
going to be true in the next one so what
we need to do is instead of our start
set is fired to false to force it to be
false even though we've changed levels
and we can therefore remove that one up
there that's unnecessary so I know I
start we're just always going to set it
to false cool then in our update we can
say that if the chain is fired well then
we want to do one thing and if it's not
then we want to do another thing let's
have a look at what we want to do in
these two cases so if it's fired we want
it to stay still and slowly animate
upwards which means that we want to
animate our wire scale and if it um is
if it isn't fired we wanted to just snap
to the position and follow the position
of our character so let's start by doing
exactly that so um in order to follow
around our player will need a reference
to our player and that means we need a
public transform and let's just call
this one player then inside of our
update if we aren't firing or if it
isn't fired we can go ahead and say
player or we could say on our current
position so transform dot position
equals player duck position and because
we've gone in and solved all of the
problems with our pivot points because
the change here has a pivot at the very
bottom and because our player also
because we went in and created a
separate object has a pivot on at the
bottom Center we can just say transform
the position Eagles player that position
then we don't need to differentiate
between all the coordinates we can just
have all the coordinates be the same and
that just makes everything so much
easier
awesome so when we aren't firing we just
want it to snap to the position of our
player and let's just see if that works
so I'm just going to leave it at one the
change here and that's fine and we can
drag in our player and we can hit play
and it should snap over awesome so I
don't know what's going on with a player
here okay so the reason why a player
just went created their I want
I'm not holding down anything and you
can see it still just goes crazy if the
is because we currently have a collision
between our chain and our player and we
don't want that and in general this game
depends a lot on collision so we are
going to take a look at the collision
matrix
dun-dun-dun I believe that's worth
taking a sip of water far yeah so
basically the collision matrix it's a
way to control what layers and you can
assign layers to an object by simply
going up here and selecting a layer you
can add new ones what layer is which
meaning what groups of objects can
collide with other layers and the thing
on that this is really handy for is that
you can do stuff like disable internal
collisions so if you have a lot of balls
which are all in the layer ball
well then you can disable balls
collision with other balls and that
means that they can just move around
freely without any weird behavior the
same way we can go in here and assign a
layer to our player we can also let's
just create one for our chain and create
one for the wall and let's create one
for ball and we can go into a player
assign the player go into our chain
assign the chain and yes which you do
want to change the children not that it
really matters actually here it does
because our children is the one with the
Collider so that's really important and
in our Bowl we'll change that to ball
and our walls here I want to change all
of them except the bottom one and the
reason for that too whoa so we'll just
go in there change all of them to wall
actually I want to go into this one and
then change this one back to the fold I
think that's cleaner cool so the reason
why I don't want to change the bottom
one to wall is because I want to enable
collisions between the player and the
walls um but actually what was my
reasoning I think I've I I know we know
too wide to do this but I can't really
figure out why it okay so we'll just
leave that a default for now and we'll
find out why it was that I knew that we
should do that at a later point this is
the good thing about doing things over
and over is that at some point you just
do them and you don't really know why
but you don't really care so it just
works ok so what we're going to do now
is go and do edit project settings and
then physics 2d and I reveal to you the
layer collision matrix and it looks
scary really scary and it is because you
always are going to mess this up if
you're anything like me on but it's it's
just so handy so the first thing here is
you can see we have a ball here and we
also have a ball here so this is our
ball with ball collision and we're going
to disable that because we don't want
those to bump each into each other we
also have our wall with water
we don't want our walls to collide we
want our ball to collide with walls
that's totally fine we don't want our
chain arm we want to change the collide
with poles that's totally fine as well
we want our change our collide with
walls and this is why this is why that I
don't did not mark the bottom wall as a
wall and that's because we don't want
our chain to collide with that part we
don't want that because that would mean
that it would sometimes trigger as soon
as it's sent out and that would mean
that it would return even though we
don't see it and things would look super
weird so we don't want our chain to
collide with that particular wall put
all other walls but we do want it to
collide with on objects tagged us or in
the wall layer and we don't want the
chain to collide with itself we don't
want the player to collide with the
chain and we don't want the player to
collide with the player so you can just
go through here and do all kinds of
things we don't want our ball to collide
with the fold up yes we do we don't want
our wall to collide with the fold
objects we don't want our chain to
collide with the fold objects but we do
want to player to do that so this is how
your layer collision matrix should be
set up it's super confusing and you can
see why it's so easy to mess this up but
really it's also really really easy to
change and this is just an awesome part
of unity I really like this because it
allows you to do so much with physics
without needing to code all of this
functionality in and change it in the
code if you just change around some
layers you can just go in here have a
visual representation of what's going on
even though it might be a bit confusing
and yeah it's just really really nice so
um we should be able to now hit play and
not explode and we we are able to do
that and you can see I can hit the ball
here with the UM with our chain and one
thing I want to do is go under a chain
and change this to a trigger I don't
think that's any reason why this should
be applying forces or anything like that
we just want this to be
to notice whenever it's hit so that we
can reset and do stuff like that ah cool
so that was the initial part of our
chain that was on what is going to
happen when we aren't firing and one
thing that we want to do here is well is
just set our local scale on the y equal
to zero so we can see transform dot
local scale equals a new vector3 armed
with 1 0 &amp;amp; 1 so 1 on the x 0 on the y
and 1 on the Z and this is also a handy
part where nesting these is that we can
set this X to 1 and still remain if the
fact that we have 0.3 on the X of the
graphics good so and that should mean
that when we now play this down sizes
and we can't actually see it you can see
here that it is down here but it's so
tiny that we cannot see it it's scaled
to 0 it's lit Y scale Y 55 oh it's this
one cool yeah I'm confusing myself
already so what we can do now is go
under our visual studio and we can have
a look at what's going to happen when we
do actually fire but first let's
actually create some user input that
allows us to do that so let's go in here
create an if statement say if input dot
input dot get bottom down and if we get
a button called fire one then we want to
say is fired equals true that's all we
still want to pass through to handle all
of the rest and the coolest thing cool
thing about this input Duquette button
fire one is that it allows us currently
to use on the mouse for clicking but we
can go in here and go edit project
settings and then input we can find the
fire one and we can add alternative
buttons on here as well you can see it
has a positive button here called Mouse
zero which is our left click and you can
also do it using left ctrl I want to
change that to space so now when we go
in here we should be able to and you can
really see this click and use
but again not visible so that's actually
going to make this visible so if we are
firing what we want to do is add a bit
on to the y scale of our object each
frame so we just want to slowly increase
this number and the way that we do that
is by going transform dot local scale is
equal to our current transform dot local
scale and then plus vector three dot up
multiplied with time.deltatime that
fixed up time here yeah cool so
basically what we're saying here is that
we want to have the same one or the same
x coordinate as we've already always had
want to have the same y coordinate but
or the coordinate but our y coordinate
should slowly increase and the rate at
which it should do that is from zero to
one at one second so one unit a second
and if you want to speed this up what we
could do is add a speed up here public
float on speed for the chain and set
that equal to say two and that means now
that when we go down here and multiply
that in so multiply with speed we are
will now shoot a lot faster so let me
just show you that this is actually
working
so we can go in here we should be able
to hit play and when I now click you can
see that our chain goes up we can set
the speed to 1 instead and we should see
it go half the speed and it does then we
can of course also go below 1 here if
you want some really slow chain awesome
so that's working and also you can see
that we can move away from the chain
once it's fired so that's a really
important part of the script you will
also notice that the chain doesn't reset
when it hits the ceiling it just keeps
going or whenever a ball bounce is
centered that simply nothing happens and
that's because of course we marked it as
trigger but also we haven't implemented
any code for actually resetting this is
fired variable that's just going to
remain true so what we go and do now is
add a bit of collision detection or
trigger detection on our chain graphics
object and then we simply reset that
variable so that's the next part of this
whole thing and we are getting closer to
actually having a game here the next
thing that we're going to be doing after
that is actually splitting the balls
into and spawning that and that's
actually the most fun part if you ask me
so don't worry if we're getting to it
just in a moment so again water and you
guys are being awesome in chat really
awesome to see so many people in here um
and people are still talking about AHA
Ludum dare a that's awesome and yeah I
think we're just going to go ahead and
continue cool so yeah the next part is
of course on registering when some
object enters this trick chain trigger
and to do that lets add a new component
let's call this something like chain
collision or chain trigger chain event
ah you can do a lot of stuff this with
this let's just call it chain collision
let's double click it again to open it
up in visual studio and now we can go in
here and we can have just a single
function here the function that we want
and we can delete these as well there we
go the function that we want is a void
on trigger enter 2d there we go and you
need to write this out the exact same
way that I've done it here no
improvising on capital letters or
anything like that because this is a
unity callback just like start awake
update fixed update this is called by
unity when unity side the unity decides
to do so
in our case this function is going to
call whenever a collider so that means
our ball for example or on our walls hit
the trigger Collider on our chain then
this method is going to call but only
once only when it's actually hit when
another Collider enters the trigger
so this basically allows us to
just throw out a debug the lock
statement when this happens so something
hit the chain they're going this should
actually wake them right away we don't
do any checking on what what hit it but
you can see right off the bat it says
something hit the chain and I'm not
totally sure what hit the chain but
something did and we can we can go ahead
and hit and fired him you can see when
it hits the wall it says something hit
the chain it should also do so when our
um yeah it does so when our ball does it
as well so you can see that that is
working and it shouldn't be a problem
that something hits it in the very
beginning I don't quite know what it is
it that it's colliding with because it
shouldn't be able to oh it might be the
top here before we reset the position so
that could be it we just going through
and set the y scale to zero just to test
this just to test this out you can see
that disappears so that's why it it
triggered right off the bat so what we
can do now is go in here and every time
something hits this trigger on with Jim
simply going to reset our chain and we
don't need to check if it was a ball or
a wall because that's the only things
that our chain is able to collide with
because of our physics trigger our
physics layer physics collision matrix
thing cool so what we can do is simply
say chain dot is fired equals false and
that's it and that's the awesome part
about using a static boolean is because
we only have one player in here one
chain we can use this static one to
control this instance here without any
issues I mean if we had multiple people
we couldn't do it this way because on
that would reset the chain for all of
the players but it just allows us to say
chain that is fired and we don't need to
reference this particular object so
that's really cool and also I actually
want to change the I here to a capital I
not like it's not a capital S and just
to make things make it clear that this
is a static variable that's a naming
convention that I like to use and the
way that I quickly renamed everything
here and it's also going to rename in
the other script is by using control our
control arts so you need to do that
twice
and that forces our unity forces visual
visual studio to do refract ring so and
also right-click I believe you can go
something like rename here you can see
that it's called refraction awesome
so that should actually reset our chain
and when we go in and hit play now we
should see that working so if I just
let's try hitting the wall awesome
resets it and the same thing when we hit
a bulb of course nothing is currently
happening to our Bowl so on before we
make that happen I'm just going to go in
here and change the color of on this
chain here I don't think it's too pretty
just want to tend it the same color
actually as on our border I think that
looks good so I'll just use the color
picker to do that and I'm pretty pleased
with that so we can change that back to
syrup and yeah good so the next thing is
of course we need to check if what we've
hit is actually a bowl because we are
both colliding with walls and balls and
so we need to check if it's the one it's
if it's one or the other
and the way to do this is we gather
information about what we hit by
creating a variable up here Collider 2d
and we're just going to call this our
coal for Collider and what we can then
do is say no matter what we want to set
changer this five to false but we can
then check if coal dots a tag is equal
to bulb a world in which case we want to
do some stuff on with the ball we want
to split it so debug the log split ball
in to there we go
and all we need to do in order to
trigger this is now go into our ball
object and change the tag here to a new
one that we're going to be making cold
you guessed it ball cool so we'll just
tag that ass ball we can also drag this
down to make a prefab out of it that's
going to be yeah let's just good
practice and now we should see that when
we hit play when we hit our roof here
nothing happens when we hit a ball it
says split ball in two and that is the
next thing that we will be doing so let
me just see everything is going on well
a lot of discussion about Visual Studio
in monodevelop I mean it's really about
what you're comfortable with but um I
will say if you're on Windows and have
free access to visual studios I don't
see a lot of reasons to use monodevelop
maybe the simplicity and that's of
course a good reason if you're starting
out but Visual Studio just has so many
nice features it's so extendable and
it's just really solid monodevelop
has a lot of issues in terms of crashing
and stuff like that but then to be fair
I haven't been using model developed for
a year now so I don't really know what
the current state of the software is but
yeah just wanted to comment on that
cool so um yeah the next thing is
splitting the bowl into and what we want
to do here is create a script actually
we already have a script but we want to
modify our bol script a bit what I want
to do is create a public function a
public void which means that we will be
able to call it from in within our chain
collision script whenever this happened
we'll be able to grab the bowl and call
the function this function on it and
it's going to be called something like
split and on what we need to do here is
of course destroy the current object so
we want to destroy our ball and we do
that by simply calling destroy and then
giving a game object with the
non-capital G which refers to this game
object that the script is sitting on
which is our ball but we of course we
don't want to do this first because then
the rest of the code won't be called so
we want to do some stuff and then
destroy the ball and what we want to do
is instantiate some new ones in case
there are any more odd to instantiate at
least so let's create up here a public
game object and this is going to be a
reference to the next ball prefab so
let's just call that next ball and that
allows us now to go in here and you can
see that it's an empty slot where we can
drag in the prefab of the next ball that
we want to spawn we can even drag in our
own prefab which means that each time
this ball gets hit it's just going to
spawn two copies of itself that's
already pretty fun so let's just
actually
try that now it's going to be an
infinite game but and hit apply on the
prefab and that's an important part it's
going to be an infinite game but it's
going to be fun so what we can do then
is if our next ball is not equal to null
so if we've actually dragged something
in there if we haven't that means that
it's the last ball or we forgot but it
should be mean on that it's the last
ball and therefore we simply want to
destroy it so that we can continue on to
the next level but if we have something
in there we want to instantiate next
ball and we want to instantiate it at
our current position which means our B
dot position and the reason why I'm
using our B deposition and not transform
that position here is because our B
double position gives us our position in
X&amp;amp;Y and ignores the Z component so as a
vector - but transformed our position
always gives the vector three which is
annoying so we'll just use our B
deposition and then on we can use
quaternion dot identity because we don't
want any rotation on this and we can go
ahead and duplicate on this entire thing
and um I want them to be spawn at
slightly different positions I don't
want them to be spawn totally on top of
each other
you can do that and it's going to look
fine but I think in the original games
that they offset them a bit so that they
start a bit to the right and a bit to
the left and to do that we simply add on
to here vector two dot right and then we
can maybe / say four so that we don't um
offset them by a full unit but on your
fourth of it you're good and we can do
the same thing here so plus vector three
and then dot left divided by four so
just offsetting them a tiny tiny bit and
this should already work if we go in
here and hit play we should see that
when we hit this ball it destroys itself
whoops of course we also need to call
the method so now we need to go into our
chain collision and we need to go in
here and use the fact that we have a
reference to the collider so our ball is
currently cold cold and then we need to
get the our ball script on that object
so this here
this ball object is called coal here
it's de Collider and we need need to get
this particular script so we can call a
function in that script and we do that
by going call that get component of type
ball and then you do dot in order to
access all things on in that ball script
and we then go split the fuck the split
method and we call that particular
method so again when something enters
out chain we're going to collect a bit
of information about what intuited we're
going to say that we are no longer
firing we're going to check if the thing
that enters had a tag of ball and if it
does we're going to get the ball script
off or component off that object and
call the split method on that which is
going to go in here or not in here and
actually check if we have another ball
to spawn if we do it's going to spawn to
and destroy the current one cool so now
we should be able to play here and
things should work so let's see there
you can see it's instantiates two new
balls but you can see our forces here
are acting really weird I mean they're
going all over the place and we do not
want that one we want instead is of
course reset or start first down here we
want that to be zero and then on this
particular ball here that we placed in
the level we want that to be two so for
now on we want all of the poles in the
project to have zero and then we can
change them for the individual instances
but without hitting apply then what we
can do is control the start force of the
balls that spawn inside the script and
we do that by first getting a reference
to the objects that we've instantiated
themselves so the whole entire game
objects and we do that by first saying
game object and then creating kind of a
temporary variable to store it in and
this is going to be full on one actually
I'm just going to do one like that and
we are going to set that equal to what
we just instantiated what we just
spawned we're going to create a second
one here called ball two and said that
equal to the second bowl that we just
spawned what we can then do is use
getcomponent on both of these so ball
one get component of type ball just in
the same way that we did our chain
collision here we want to do get
component ball and what we can then do
is set the start force on these bowls so
we can set start force here equal to and
new vector2
and the first coordinate needs to be
something like two it's going to be fine
and I also want to give them a bit of
force on the y-axis and this allows them
to kind of get that nice bouncing to
direct chair trajectory whatever how you
say that where they kind of bounce
upwards and over so they apply a bit of
upwards momentum each time we split them
in half and that just gives a bit of
liveliness to the game and I want to set
that to something like five on the Y so
we can now duplicate this entire thing
and we can change the this to be bold
too and here we want to apply negative
two on the X so that this will go in the
opposite direction and that should
actually work so I believe that pretty
much all of the core functionality that
we need in here now it's just a matter
of setting it up in unity
and maybe also adding an in condition so
if we hit play here we should see that
when we hit the ball awesome it splits
in two and it's just going to keep doing
this infinitely so this is another
example of how you can take this same
concept and these same mechanics to
create a fun little minigame kind of a
spin off to the original series and you
can see that I currently cannot die so
this is just happy times where we can
keep doing this until the computer gets
really tired and maybe crashes but it is
definitely fun so we won't worry about
that and you can see here how important
it is that we used our layer collision
matrix to make the balls not collide
with each other but yeah that was kind
of the base of what we need to do so
before we continue on and actually make
this into a playable game let me just
have
can a quickly looking they are in the
chart here let's see no need to get
component because I'm already in the
ball script that's not totally true
because this ball script here refers to
the bowl that is currently being split
in half and that's a separate object
from the two balls that we want to
create so what we do is actually spawn
two balls from this uh this ball from
the current ball being split in half and
then we have references to each
individual ball and we get their
individual versions of the ball script
and change their start force not the
start force for all of them but their
particular start for so that's why we
need to use get component and that's
kind of the base of understanding the
difference between the type which is our
class up here which is a ball type and
the fact that we can have multiple balls
in there different instances of that
type so yeah I can see why you're
getting confused because the naming is
the same but now we are not talking
about a type we are talking about a
particular instance a particular
creation a particular ball so yeah
that's the difference there really good
question though
all right so um where to go from here I
think we need to link up all the bolts
and then we need to do and a game over
condition so the first thing is it's
really really easy and it's really
something that you should just go nuts
with in terms of imagination and just
figuring out exactly what you want to do
I'm just going to create a bowl let's
make this ball four
and I'm going to do ball 0 4 here and we
can duplicate this inside of the
inspector here and we can so this is
ball 5 and you can see how unity
automatically named sits it it names it
it's totally awesome and we can take a
ball 4 and drag it into the next bowl of
a ball 5 and that means that we're not
both 5 splits in half it's going to
split into both 4 and yeah
you get the drill and we can change the
color of this ball and actually that's
just getting inside the inspector so we
can see what's going on
so this is Paula five we can change the
color of this to something red to
indicate that this is really large and
dangerous and it's also bump up the size
to say I'm 1.5 and that looks just just
fine actually and the pole four is fine
we can duplicate that and we can rename
this one to ball three because we want
them to get increasingly smaller now and
we can make this one ah say blue I
believe I made a blue in the video let's
do the same thing here and we can bump
down the scale to say point six on all
the axes and that's going to look fine
notice how the collider follows our
scaling so that's really really nice we
don't have to worry about scaling that
um separately and I change that inside
of the game itself I want to change it
in here instead so 0.6 on all the axes
there we go but really we could just hit
apply makes no difference
awesome and we want to not drag in both
three here we want to have our ball for
reference the pole three and we want to
have a both three reference ball to
which we're going to be creating now
let's create a new ball here ball 2 and
we can just keep going with this to
create as many stages of these balls
that we want to so I'm just going to
have pole two in here and on this one
again let's drag it into the scene this
one I would like to be on green so let's
make it green here and on we're going to
make it even smaller something like
point three I think it's good that might
be too small because we want one to be
even smaller than this so maybe 0.45
it's going to be good and we can make
that green that's cool and we want to
reference that under the ball three of
course something like that again I'm
creating one more level than or level
one more ball type than what I did for
the video but I just thought that I
would show you how easy this is to do we
can create ball one now as well I drag
that inside the inspector have this be
on some other maybe even just gray could
be fine because it needs to be so small
but
still it's really dangerous when they
they're this small because it they are
really hard to hit but we can make this
say 0.2 on all the axes I think that's
kind of fun to have a really small
little devil in there and actually want
them to maybe be yeah let's just make it
great and we need to reference that in
bold too so bold to references 401 and
bold 1 doesn't reference anything so
that will actually pop and that should
work just fine so you can see how that
set up and apply on that we apply this
we apply that the bowl for here we don't
want to apply the stark force we want
that to be zero apply that we delete all
of them except for the biggest one which
is our bowl five move that somewhere
over here for example and now we should
see that this is working so let's hit
play and try the game out so okay so we
need to start force on that so bowl five
here we can set two on the X for the
start force and we should be able to see
them splitting and that's awesome so you
can see how that looks
and again when we kill off the grey ones
and they are indeed going to disappear
so this is actually quite difficult
luckily I'm not able to die yet we
haven't implemented that yet but it's
still whoo not totally easy but I feel
that this is already a pretty nice spin
off game and it's actually a lot more
fast-paced and action-packed because
everything moves a lot quicker and the
player does as well so yeah it's a lot
of fun
so the last thing that I wanted to do
was just implement the on the game over
and in order to do this we just have to
look we just have to have a look at our
player we can double click on a player
we can create a new on trigger actually
this is going to be and this is going to
be an on Collider in term because this
is a Collider so on Collider
enter 2d again this is not a trigger so
we are have a collision that's not a
trigger enter and we don't want to use
collided 2d because we actually get more
information we get
in 2d and this is the same as Collider
2d but instead of just having a
reference to what we collided with we
also get some information about how the
collision went so the force at which
they collided and the point at which
they hit and stuff like that so we
simply get some physics information that
you don't get when using a trigger um
and whoops what we do I turned on insert
there we go and so what we do here is
simply go coal as well and then we say
if our coal dot tag dot Collider dot is
equal to our ball well then we want to
restart so we can just throw a debug
deadlock here saying game let's do it
more dramatic one game over and in order
to restart our current level we're
simply going to unity we import Unity
engine Unity engine soared dot scene
management there we go and down here we
simply go scene manager dot load scene
and the scene that we want to load is
the currently active scene so we go
scene manager dot get active scene and
then we need to do either dot name or
dub build index because we can't feed
the actual scene we need to feed it
either a build index or a name that's
the exact same thing and that should
actually be it I believe that's all um
we needed to do on clothes not on
Collider enter it needs to be on
collision enter like that yes good that
wouldn't have worked thank you to the
chat for the people to Skype text with
just saying that on I would totally have
been started that on that for a long
time it's the worst so um yeah we should
see now that when we get hit by a ball
it's a scam over and it just quits the
game and you can easily add a
slow-motion effect or something cool in
here on to make the game over look
better you can add some UI and then
delay so that it doesn't just restart
immediately check out the Dodge the
blocks tutorial it's on the YouTube
channel that was also
recorded live livestream again dodge the
blocks if you want to see that kind of a
bullet time slow-mo when you get hit by
something and and then it restarts so I
think that was all one thing that I just
noticed is that our chain is in front of
a player but all we need to do here is
simply change the order and layer to
something smaller than our players so we
could just do -2 there and that is now
fixed so that's the entire game everyone
I hope you enjoyed it
I really don't have anything more to add
I'm just going to attempt a playthrough
here now that we are finally done with
the game and then we can go ahead and do
some Q&amp;amp;A so prepare your questions
actually just span them in the chat
already and we can kind of transition to
that part I really hope that you enjoyed
this again if you missed out on
something if there's something that you
find difficult right after the stream
this is going to be available in the arm
twitch archive I'm also going to upload
it to YouTube
as soon as possible and um I'm also
going to be uploading the project to
github at the same time that I upload to
youtube so you can get your hands on all
of the code all of the really super high
advanced graphics and the full unity
project so I'm just going to hit play
here and let's have a playthrough and
let's see how this goes so I'm just
going to attempt attempt to beat the
game and it's not going to happen I can
promise you that I think we need to
start with some of the smaller ones
instead of splitting up some of the
others ah immediately or else we're just
going to have a lot of things flying
around this is actually going a lot
better than I expected
and I know that right after saying that
oh that should have done that no no no
this is where the decision-making
crumbles ah
it's actually going whoa Jesus all right
so these live gameplays also always
really scary
I cannot believe people yeah I messed it
up I'm sorry we didn't get to the end of
the game ah I will never ever do a
separate gaming channel don't worry I
it's just embarrassing
cool so let's change to some questions
and answers and for this part I'm going
to change over to the chat switch layout
so you can see the chat on YouTube as
well and yeah give me some questions so
um why don't I use autocomplete I do use
autocomplete
I don't know if it's just turned off and
visual studio right now sometimes it
bugs out no no it's here I use that all
the time sometimes I just write it out
if I'm too lazy to actually select it on
the list but I do that a lot is it easy
to get the line to go to the mouse
position so um do you mean that the line
should just follow around the mouse you
can definitely do that quite easily you
just need to use input duck get Mouse
position and then you can do some things
on the camera to taint turn that into a
from a screen coordinate thing into a
world position thing and there's a lot
of stuff on that on both the practice
from the unity forum that's a lot of
tutorials on that it should be
relatively simple um I will not stream
at Ludum dare eh unfortunately I will be
participating but I cannot really say
how much I'm time I'm able to dedicate
yet and so setting up streams and all
that it's both really time-consuming and
frankly quite taxing especially if you
need to to stream for so long so I'm I'm
really sorry but I'm not going to be
streaming it on this time I am however
going to be recording my progress on the
game and unless it turns out really
really bad I'm going to make a
post-mortem video the same way that I
did digging where it's kind of behind
the scenes and I show the creation of it
that was just really really fun I think
it's one of the best videos on the
channel if I if I may say so myself I
think it's it's just a lot of fun
because it combines a lot of subjects
and shows kind of the full process of
game development at least the fun
process
cool so um
um yeah so on someone asks keywords like
rigidbody are being called obsolete by
unity I know it's for downwards
compatibility but how old is this why
don't they just remove them they also
change networking stuff so old projects
don't work anymore
why keep this old not working stuff I
think um yeah that one is a tiny bit
silly I mean what they do is they have
this automatic patcher that just takes
all your code and makes it used modern
unity standards and that worked a lot
when they did a big API change in the
beginning of five unity five I think
really what they did to the API is a lot
better and so I don't use those
absolutely obsolete things anymore it is
for backwards compatibility and some
people are just too used to it and needs
some time but yeah I mean it's not
really helping me but again if I had a
huge unity project that would be kind of
annoyed if they didn't support it for at
least some months or a year so but I'm
sure they'll remove it at some point
it's also really nice for tutorial
channels like my own that they keep
stuff like that working just so that
when people watch it tutorial that might
be a tiny bit dated um they can actually
use the code it's not just going to
break and they get an error and they say
well if this I'm out this I don't want
to do game development it's just a
warning saying that you're not using it
totally optimally but frankly bikinis
don't care about what's optimal so I
actually kind of like that they support
that stuff in terms of being able to
follow along with with the turtles um
all you guys are giving me compliments
that's so that's so thick I'm so
thankful for that um what kind of probe
products do I use for my beard I
actually use nothing I don't use any
kind of products I use soap uh and I
trim it a bit and that's it
if it looks like I'm using product I
don't know if I need to take that as a
compliment but I'm sorry I don't really
use anything and Sophia is laughing over
here she's having a blast so let me see
what else we have do I still need a
model designer I'm actually it's kind of
an ongoing project and I'm always
looking for 3d artists and it's
something that I wanted to talk about
here I don't want to say what it is that
I'm doing just yet but if you are a 3d
artist and have some experience
especially if you I mean
modeling and texturing spiriax perience
is pretty much required it's really nice
if you can do concept art if you know
how to do character design and rigging
and animation but all of those are just
plus extra things that are really nice
to have but if you know how to do 3d
models and have some experience feel
free to just throw me an email ad apply
at brackish comm again apply a practiced
I'm just going to put that in the chat
apply a Bragg kiss calm and yeah it
would be super awesome to work with you
guys we already have a lot of people
working on the project and it's just
it's so much fun so feel free to throw
me an email right away after the stream
ends with a link and make sure you
include a link to a portfolio or
previous works I'm not going to I
consider you unless you actually show me
some of your work because this is an
artistic thing and I need to see some
some work so that I know we've kind of
been dying in terms of ah yeah you know
um cool so what else are is going on
here
how much knowledge in C++ do I have
unlimited amount I know my way around
C++ I can read I love C++ I don't feel
fluent but I I feel like I know the
language pretty well but then again
Super Plus is such a huge language so
it's just really something that I feel
that I know this surface of but I can
code a bit in C++ but don't hire me I
say proficient C++ code II just just
saying don't do that cool um do I watch
The Walking Dead um I have watched it I
don't anymore I watched I believe three
or four
seasons fun show really in a decline of
quality I think I think the first season
was really exciting then the second one
was there and then it just got worse so
I kind of lost interest but yeah fun
show um let's see what sells what else
is going on here am i planning on
starting a bit more advanced series on
YouTube and RTS would be amazing again I
would say that an RTS would be really
fun as well it's just one of the most
code heavy things that you can do at all
and I would like to do some more
advanced stuff but it really depends on
kind of what most of my audience one is
see if you guys a lot of you guys want
to see some advanced stuff that's
awesome but in terms of engagement I
feel like most of you or most of my
subscribers at least maybe not all the
ones who are here but you guys are
probably more hardcore and then the
average subscriber but most of the
subscribers I feel want to see more
beginner related stuff but I of course
want to do some advanced stuff and of
course we are going to do that at some
point I also want to do maybe not quite
as long series but more tailored towards
a specific subject for a long time I
really wanted to do like realistic car
movement now for like racing games and
stuff like that that could be so fun
so I'm going to create some mini series
of standalone tutorials as well and
though one of those might be really
advanced I mean we could look into that
do I have any advice for young game
developers um I'm fourteen years old
yeah just keep at it man just keep
making stuff try and on set realistic
goals for yourself so don't try to
create these huge projects where you get
burned out and really what you learn
most doing is just small finished
projects even though it's maybe just
something like this just getting some
core on mechanics in there trying to
make it fun trying to make it work
choosing the colors even though it feels
really simple and might not have our
tribal area a fix or a huge networking
system or anything like that
just try and make something that you
know that you can complete because
finishing a game and getting the
experience of putting it out there and
getting a friends to play it's one of
the most important parts I mean it's
something that you are going to need
experience in if you decide to do a
project that's larger and will require
multiple years of development so that
you don't make mistakes on the later
stages of development and also giant
kind of just to put fuel on the fire so
that you don't lose interest I mean that
would just be really really not cool so
yeah just practice man it's it's a lot
of fun find some friends who want to do
it with you and make some games with
them that's sometimes the most fun part
um what is programming ah Jesus
programming is getting to do computers
to do stuff that you want them to do
it's pretty much my best explanation I
think and you often have to do that by
telling them really obvious and stupid
things um so let me see um how cost is
uh to call the component of an object I
assume you mean finding a component
using getcomponent or calling a function
on the component that's two separate
things
it's not to cost the unity has really
optimized finding game objects and
finding components a lot since they
started of course it does require tiny
bit of time but really if you want to
see how costly it is and it totally
depends on the scale of the game object
if it's a huge game object with 200
components it's going to be really slow
so they do optimize it in that way but
really you can just open the profiler
and have a look at how long it takes um
see am i planning to do a 2d terrain
generation series like the terrain in
the 2d physics based car game on that
wasn't actually generated that was just
me jumping in photo
shopping creating and ridiculously large
paths and then just filling it up with
color it's only because I never showed
you kind of the confines of the level
that you would think that that was
actually generated
I mean if enough guys enough of you guys
suggested I definitely could look into
that it's kind of advanced but it could
also be really really fun so again I
pretty much want to do anything guys
as long as enough of you guys want to
see it I'm up for it
I mean programming is fun and trying to
do stuff that I maybe hadn't thought of
myself is always a challenge so it's
awesome um let's see on next episode of
game a theory when what is about and a
quaternion explanation yeah next episode
of game a theory is going to come don't
worry it's not over when I don't know
when I get time on this side project
that I haven't told you about yet which
is the reason why I'm looking for I this
is taking up a lot of time I'm sorry but
I definitely want to do more getting my
theory I think it's probably some of the
videos I have the most fun creating but
they are also huge the time are a few
times followers I mean it took me about
five to six seven times as long to do
just one of those videos as a normal
video so it's it's really a lot but and
what is it about I have some ideas
quaternions might be in there that could
be pretty fun I've seen a lot of you
guys suggested but also catonian sees a
more difficult subject than what some of
the other videos entail and it kind of
requires some understanding of some
fields that I don't feel like I've
covered yet so I might want to do other
videos first and then we can always look
into quaternions later but I'm still
figuring that out it depends on how much
I can feel like I can squeeze into a
video without having it be like too much
to to follow along with um let's see
mm-hmm can I make
to play RPG again I'm sorry I'm not
going to be making a multiplayer RPG
it's simply too heavy both when it comes
to code it comes to art sound everything
in a multiplayer RPG is I just requires
a lot I mean maybe not a massively
online multiplayer RPG that's for sure
maybe an RPG
maybe multiplayer I don't know I don't
want to say never I mean if all of you
guys just suddenly started saying mega
multiply RPG you would have one tomorrow
kidding I would be able to do that
but I would definitely do my best to to
kind of crammed everything I could into
to toriel what was my first programming
language my first non visual programming
language was on visual basic I didn't
like it not one bit um I also tried to
kind of read some Python because I
played about the blender game engine and
that had some visual scripting but also
I also Python but yeah the first
programming language that I really fell
in love with was I was JavaScript and
then C sharp is now my I feel like my
main main language um make a MOBA in the
next livestream ya know in the project
do I need animators and riggers um yeah
I mean not as many as I need modelers
and and people who can texture but if
you feel like you want to be part and if
you're I mean it would have to be
combined so you would have to know both
breaking in animation
I wouldn't include just an animator just
a regular unfortunately because we work
in smaller teams and so yeah how we
would have to you would have to know
both do any low poly or detail 3d models
I actually need both so yeah you can
just submit and show me your work and I
will let you know if if it works um any
advice on starting a YouTube channel
that's interest
this is not the sort of thing that you
guys normally ask me yeah do I have any
advice I think the greatest advice is
kind of figuring out your niche it's
figuring out who is actually going to be
interested in these videos and once you
have that who how are they actually
going to discover it I mean it's two
core question and it it might sound
obvious but I I think a lot of people
find I'll make some really really
interesting videos and I follow a lot of
youtubers who make awesome content but
the problem is that no one is
discovering it and that's the whole
thing with tutorials is you could go
ahead and make a how to make a
multiplayer FPS series or you could go
make in how to make a cyberpunk RPG FPS
for beginners only and the targets a
certain limit you want it to be as
specific as general as possible but
while without being well annoying you
still want to answer the questions that
you're saying tie a little bit and not
use clickbait I don't do that at least I
don't think so
but yeah you want to kind of figure out
something that people will actually be
searching for especially if you do
tutorials you want people to discover it
through search so yeah but again I'm not
the one to give YouTube advice I mean
I'm a tutorial maker more than I feel
like I'm a youtuber so yeah um yeah so
how would you find multiple game objects
with a specific tag in a range yeah
game game object I'd find game objects
with tag will give you an array of all
of the game objects with a specific tag
then you need to sort through that array
so loop through it with a for or for
each loop and then you want to check the
distance from your current object to
that object and if it's greater than
your range discarded if it's less than
the range well then you can use that so
that's that's how you do it it's not
performant but it's hard to get that
stuff really really fast
um dddd dddd I'm sure having a really
hard time keeping up with all the
questions here let's see ah to do today
advice for turn-based fighting system
I've never created a turn-based fighting
system I'm sorry that's not something I
have experience in so I wouldn't really
know um any specific advice for this
genre uh yeah um RPG game basics will be
awesome I mean that could be really fun
I mean we can definitely do something
with um some RPG basic mechanics that's
totally possible again it quickly
becomes very feature heavy these RPGs
and very content heavy especially but we
could stick to the basics and just get
something working on there that's
totally possible even make it
multiplayer but that adds some
development time yeah
do I understand shaders depends on the
shading shader language but I feel like
I know most of what it requires to on
write and understand shaders but really
it's really nice that unity standard
shader does so much now I feel like it
does really ninety maybe even 95 percent
of what I need when when creating
graphics for Iran for a game for 3d game
that's just so many texture maps so many
settings I mean it's PBR so that's
awesome if you don't know PBR stands for
physically based rendering and it
basically means that you calculate how
the light on actually interacts with the
object based on properties that you
would find in real like like roughnecks
roughness metallic Ness and stuff like
that color emission and the really cool
thing about that is when you have PBR on
rendered materials and textures you can
take one object make it look awesome in
one scene in one lighting condition and
then take it into another scene in
enough
the lighting condition and it will still
look great because we're actually
calculating it based on real values and
not just paid based on some made-up
hacky way so yeah looks a lot better um
yeah so I think we're kind of getting to
the end of this dream now I am and my
voice is almost giving up and also I
feel like we've covered a lot so if you
have any final questions ask away now
we'll just take a few more minutes I had
so much fun guys really I think the
result of the game it turned out awesome
and again this will be on the YouTube
channel it will be immediately available
as a twitch archive and um it will also
arm ya the project will also be uploaded
to github so that's um
yeah you have all of it they're
accessible afterwards in case you missed
something so let me just see the final
questions here um
can you have played teams to your
multiplayer phase buildings and modes
like CTF and team deathmatch um that
would be interesting it also requires a
lot of code changing so I might not do
that right now just thinking about what
it will require at least I have some
things that I want to do first I want to
do weapon switching it's a really
important one also kind of wanted to do
a sniper with scope and stuff like that
also wanted to add some more weapons so
yeah as I have some other things that I
want to do first
how about NPC's in the multiplayer piss
I think if I'm going to do something
with NPCs and AI it should be for a
separate video because NPCs and
pathfinding and stuff like that
this really um it's really quite I mean
if you're just going to have someone
follow the player just have an enemy
follow the play and use pathfinding it's
really a general thing you can you can
reuse those sorts of scripts in a lot of
different places and I don't think it's
too specific for the multiplayer FPS
especially because you know all you need
to do to make a network this put a
transform component on it
we're transformed and it will
synchronize or you could have them move
independently so yeah I think that
that's not what its not highest on the
priority list but again just suggest it
I'll write it down I keep track of what
you guys suggest and I'll figure out
what we should do next
um practice would you consider doing a
new a sharp algorithm series that's more
adjustable I know there are a few but
they all have some flaws totally true I
would definitely consider that if a lot
of you guys want to see that was just
what I was touching on as well I mean a
star path path finding is awesome and
it's really easy to use I also know that
Sebastian Lake has some awesome videos
on scripting pathfinding and stuff like
that yourself I think he both has using
a library like a star and also from
scratch but you can check that out
that's the best in Lake so yeah shout
out to him he makes awesome content um
yeah so I guess we will wrap up the
stream right here thank you so much to
all of the people who were here and to
those of you viewing afterwards I had so
much fun really successful stream and
thank you to all the guys asking
questions and stuff like that if you
have a burning question you don't feel
like with answered you can go to forum
break is calm make a post there and a
lot of awesome you guys some of them in
here who is ready to answer your
questions and I'm also on there once in
a while I'm sorry if I don't spend too
much there but I do have a youtube
channel to make videos for or you guys
will get really mad so yeah lady tonight
um I think I'm gonna have a new video up
so that's awesome
and also I just wanted to mention that I
am on a fixed video schedule now so that
means that when it stays and Sundays is
when I upload new videos so if you don't
see a video on Wednesday on Sunday ping
me let me know what's going on or ask
what's going on because then there's
something wrong so yeah that's pretty
much it thank you so much for watching
this dream I had a blast if you want to
