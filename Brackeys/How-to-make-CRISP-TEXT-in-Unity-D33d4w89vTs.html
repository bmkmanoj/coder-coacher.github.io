features in 4.61 area that has really
been lacking is text not going to be one
of my favorite editor extensions text
match Pro has now been acquired by unity
and so we should see this ability be
made of the unity standard editor until
then tex mex pro it's available for free
on the asset store and if you haven't
picked it up yet well you're really
missing out yes it uses a technique
called signed distance field to make
your text renders so much crisper it
also has a bunch of tools for layout in
your text and lots of cool buttons for
styling it so in this video we'll just
dive in and start using some of these
features let's get into it the most
important part for me is how crisp it
text renders here we see a comparison
between the standard text immunity and a
Tex Mex object I hope this is clear from
the recording but even at this distance
there's a huge difference and if we now
go to the scene view and start zooming
in the difference becomes so much
clearer in fact we can keep zooming in
on the text mesh object and it will
remain crisp well if we do this on unity
standard text not so much so to get text
message window assets store and then
search for text mesh Pro you can just
use the link in the description will
then import it for free let's hit import
again and that's it now we're ready to
get started creating text and text match
Pro works in the same way that it
normally does
we'll simply right click in the
hierarchy go UI instead of choosing text
we'll choose text much Pro text as you
can see this creates a canvas and our
text much pro object and we can
configure it in the inspector we can
choose the text itself we can also scale
up our box here and choose how it should
be layout it in it we can choose the
font by changing the font asset you
should get a few ones by default we can
choose some styling options and if you
go to material preset there are some
pre-made styles to choose from but
before we delve into styling let's have
a look at importing our own fonts to do
that we first want to find the font I'm
just going to search for Roboto this is
on google fonts I'm going to select this
font
I'm then going to take the font family
and download it finally you can open
this up in a sip file make sure to
extract the zip file and let's now take
Roboto regular TTFN and simply drag it
into the unity project now this is a
regular font and so this is not going to
render in the crisp way that takes mesh
Pro does to make this use
detects mesh probe we go window text
mesh bro and we open up the font asset
creator this allows us to take a regular
font we'll take in our newly imported
font and drag it into the font source
slot and turn it into a font adlets
using signed distance field
in most cases you can leave all the
settings as is and hit generate font
address and it should look something
like this now we can hit save text match
profond asset you can choose the
location in your project and I'm just
going to call it Roboto
dot acid it's now hit safe we can close
down the font at the Creator and boom we
now have a font asset we can then select
our text message Pro object drag in our
new font asset and there we go we've now
changed the font of our text now if we
scroll down in the inspector we can see
all of the different knots and dials
that will allow us to style our text in
most cases however you just want fairly
simple text controls and we don't want
to spend performance and all these
options that we want use so we go to
shader and change this to text mesh
and then distance field this only has
options for the face outline and an
underlay such as the shadow so to add a
shadow to a text we enable our underlay
let's open up the settings let's offset
it on the X and y and let's add some
softness and there we go
we've now created white text with a
black shadow but that's so much more we
can do if you go into the text much pro
folder on the examples then scenes there
are almost 30 different scenes here
showing different aspects of text mesh I
really recommend going through all these
each feature can be super useful let's
try and open up number 25 the text mesh
and I'll just hit don't save now you can
see some text working with lighting if
you go ahead and disable one of the
lights or text will update let's select
the two text objects here and disable
them let's create one on our own by
right-clicking going 3d object and
selecting text mesh pro text let's then
find it in the scene you let's drag it
up a bit and it's change the font asset
to our Roboto text however this styling
is super boring but instead of
overriding our current style let's go
ahead and create a new one this option
can be a bit hard to find but what we
need to do is actually right click on
our material down here hit create
material preset this is going to take us
to the
place where our fond asset is stored and
create a material right by the side of
it the default material the first one
we're using right now can be found on
the defined asset itself so let's name
our new material
Roboto let's call it coal let's then
select our text object make sure our
robotic cool material is selected and
let's switch out of this mobile shader
to text mesh browser ffice now you can
see that the light in our scene is
already affecting our text so if we
change the lighting what text will
change with it let's make our text bold
let's give it a bit more room let's
Center it in our text box make sure to
move it over to Center it in our game
view let's also add some spacing between
the characters let's scroll down for
face let's dilate the text a bit and
here we can of course choose a color but
we can also put a texture
let's hit select and when importing text
mesh Pro it's also going to import some
materials I'm going to take the floor
cement and I'm also going to add some
gloss this is not going to change
however before we go down here and on
the lighting increase our specular color
and now you can see that we're adding in
glass on our text let's then create an
outline to do that we'll increase the
thickness let's add some glass here as
well let's select a white color and we
have the option to add a texture here as
well for this one I'm going to select
the fruit jelly and we can maybe tint
this a bit let's say orange or maybe a
bluish tone now we can adjust a bevel we
can play around with the offset width
the width the amount and we can even
kind of round it out let's also add a
bump map to our text under the texture
here that select sand normal and let's
make this really apparent on the face
and also give it a tiny bit on the
outline find these air options for
adding environment Maps if you want
reflections and even glow to your text I
think I'm going to add an orange glow
now this does not look good but I'm sure
that's more the artist than the tool
from here on I recommend you check out
some of the example scenes if you get
lost in a particular setting there's
also the user guide and in the
description you will also see a link to
a youtube channel by the guy who made
this asset that's a lot of in-depth
information there so
really there's no excuse to not have fun
with this let's pretty much it for this
video if you enjoyed it make sure to
subscribe so dome it's a future one so
thanks for watching I will see you in
