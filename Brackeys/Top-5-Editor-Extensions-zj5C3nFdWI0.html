years now and I've only recently started
to make good use of some of the editing
extensions on the asset store a man do I
feel dumb these assets have already
saved me so much time and I honestly
don't know why it took me so long to
start using them so I've made a list of
my favorite editing extensions to help
you guys avoid making the same mistake
the first asset on the list is editor
console Pro in the console Pro is a
powerful replacement for the standard
console window you can group together
messages you can assign colors and icons
and even preview the source code
surrounding each method call in the
stack but most importantly you can now
search for entries and hide the ones
that you don't want to see finally no
more going through scripts to comment
out debug box a the console Pro is paid
but in my opinion it is super worth it
next it's a free asset called do tween
I've tried a few different tweening
engines from the store but I definitely
think two tween is the most easy and
stable do tween allows you to easily add
cool animations to your game objects and
UI elements I must use it to spice up my
UI with some fancy animation deuteron
also has a pro version which adds a
visual path and animation editor a 3rd
asset is for those of you who aren't too
excited about programming in c-sharp
luckily for you playmaker is a powerful
visual scripting solution it allows
artists designers and also programmers
to create advanced logic within a
node-based editor this asset is paid but
if you're looking for a way to make
games without writing code playmaker is
really great now a common issue when
making games for mobile is setting up
some good on-screen controls CN controls
is a free asset that helps you do
exactly that the package contains a
bunch of different controls from
joystick to d-pad and it allows you to
customize the controls to suit the look
of your game and the best part is it's
free and now the final asset on the list
the amplifi shader editor this asset
allows you to create shaders using a
visual node editor some of the coolest
effects I've seen this year have been
made using this asset it's easy to use
and it comes with a bunch of examples to
help you get started it is paid on the
story but if you're serious about
graphics I definitely recommend picking
this up and that's pretty much my list
of top editor extensions I've created a
list on the asset store which contains
all them as well as a few ones that I
could squeeze into the video one of them
is final I K which definitely deserves a
mention so
in the description to check them out now
there are a few great assets that I
haven't included like CRO builder text
mesh and Odin but that's because I've
already mentioned them in my list of
all-time favorite assets if you want you
can check out that video as well feel
free to share your personal list of
assets in the comments but let me know
if there's another category that you'd
like to see next
