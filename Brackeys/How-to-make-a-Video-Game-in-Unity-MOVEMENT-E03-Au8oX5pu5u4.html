up play a move to do that we'll have a
look at variables if statements and
player input so if you want to make
games in unity this video is pretty much
essential I'm ready are you ready let's
go before we get started I just want to
mention that you can now download the
project files and the scripts from each
video over at dev assets so if we go to
dev assets comm this is a website I
created where you can download really
high quality 3d models such as this
Western props pack we have a modern
weapons bundle some cool-looking sci-fi
vehicles and a lot more if we go to
browse scroll down to the bottom here
and click how to make a game we get to
this page where you can download all of
this stuff I've seen a lot of tutorial
makers make their project files paid but
I don't really think that's fair to you
guys instead as with everything on the
side here I've made it play what you
want so you can of course go ahead and
grab it for free or choose to support me
with some amount you can just click the
one that you can afford here and then
hit the blue button and you're good to
go so back to the video and the last one
we made our cube fly forward by adding a
force right now a primary issue with
this is that our player doesn't stay on
the ground he just starts rotating and
jumping and goes crazy one way to fix
this is to go to the player find the
rigidbody and add some constraints we
could for example freeze the rotation on
the x-axis and that should result in
smooth movement however we do want our
cube to be able to rotate so that when
he collides with something is going to
look cold let's uncheck that and instead
let's create a physics material the
reason for the cube jumping around is
that by default there's friction between
the cube and the ground or using a
physics material we can choose how much
friction we want let's right click in
the project go create and then select
physic material we can rename this to
something like slippery and we can set
both knee dynamic and the static
friction to zero then we can drag this
on to a ground and you can't see it
being applied but if we go ahead and
select our ground we can see that the
material under the box Collider is now
set to slippery but that means that if
we hit play now there's no friction
between the cube in the ground and he's
just going to slide off and that's
without restraining his rotation so if
we now select the player and
double-click on a player movement script
on this line we're adding a forward
force of 2000 and then of course
multiplied with time that delta time
however it would be really really neat
if we were able to modify this value in
the inspector instead of just hard
coding this into the line to do that we
use variables in c-sharp relax
variables like containers just like you
can store items in the box you can store
data in a variable in the beginning we
focus on storing simple values like
numbers or text the variables can be
used to store way more complicated data
each variable is given a name this
pretty much just means slobbing a label
on the container so that each time we
use that name it refers to the data of
the variable we also have to specify
what type of data we want to store for
status you should learn and memorize the
four fundamental data types
Institute we just write int this stores
the whole number it can also be negative
slowed the stores the number with
decimals string this stores a piece of
text and bullion we just write bold and
this is the simplest of all the data
types because it can only have two
values true or false
the creating variable looks like this
unity also allows us to edit a variable
in the inspector to do that we mark it
as public however this variable is
currently unassigned it has no value we
can assign the variable a default value
by simply typing equals and then the
value to get the value of the variable
in code we simply write its name like
here where we are printing the value 10
to the console we can of course also
edit the value of variable here we set
it equal to 5 and here we add 1 on to
the current value making it 6 so if we
want to turn this number into a variable
that we can edit in the inspector we'll
go up here and create some space will
write public floats because we want the
number that we can fine-tune with
decimal places then we need a name in
our case we could do something like
forward force and we can set the default
value in our case we will just set that
to the same mm then we can substitute
this number with forward force so we'll
just take the forward force here and
paste it down there if we now say go
back into unity we can see that we are
now able to adjust the forward force in
the inspector we could set it to 4,000
or to a thousand if you click and drag
on it you can even find cheering like
this and you can even edit it while
playing so now of course we need to
change this comment here instead we'll
change it to something like add a
forward force and it's time to have a
look at doing some player input now the
fundamental thing to understand when
doing player input is the if statement
if you make some room the needs our add
force method here we can write F open X
close the parenthesis and then open and
close some curly brackets this is the
basic structure of an it statement if
statements allow you to only execute
code
certain condition is met this is where
you put your code and insert these two
parenthesis is where you put your
condition sometimes it's really simple
say comparing two numbers we could write
if 3 is bigger than 2 of course this is
always going to be true and so this will
always be called we can also say if 3 is
equal to 2 and this is of course false
so this code will not be called we can
also write other stuff say if 1 is equal
to 2 minus 1 this is of course true or
we could put not equal to you and now
it's false but this is only the stuff we
can do with numbers we can also put
other stuff in here if we want to check
if the usage pressing a certain key on
the keyboard will go input get key and
here will also open and close the
parentheses and in here in quotation
marks we write the key we want so in our
case we want D to go to the right and
now everything we put inside of these
two curly brackets it's only called when
the user process D so we could of course
just go ahead and add some more forces
here let's say our be dead add force and
in this case we don't want to add a
force on the z axis we want to do it on
the X meaning rather than left so we can
go in here and add some numbers say 500
will then do cero on the Y and Sewer on
the Z remember to close to the Alpha
system I : of course we want to multiply
our 500 with time.deltatime just like we
do up here if we now save this I'll just
set the forward force to something
pretty low just our cube doesn't go
flying off we can hit play and we should
see that when we hold down D our cube
will indeed move so we can go back and
add this to the other direction as well
to do this we simply copy our code paste
it right beneath instead of checking for
the D key we'll check for a and we still
want to add a force on the x-axis but we
want to do so in the opposite direction
so let's just input a minus here again
we can save this play the game and see
that we can now move in both direction
in fact why don't we go ahead and make
our movement speed adjustable in the
inspector the same way we did with
forward force to do that we just add a
new public float up here and we'll call
this something like sideways force let's
just default that to 500 by the way when
we're dealing with float variables you
will notice me writing an F at the end
of the number
this just signifies that we're talking
about a float number in some cases we
can leave it out like here but other
times unity will complain so it's a good
idea to get in the habit of
doing it every time again this only
applies to floats not integers so now we
can take our sideways force and paste it
instead of the 500 here and instead of
this 500 here 12 you'll notice that it's
still fine putting a minus here when we
run the game this is just going to be
equal to 500 or what we said in the
inspector let's say this go back into
unity and we can now see that we can
adjust the sideways force as well let's
try setting before word force to
something like a thousand and the
sideways force to something like 600 and
it already starts to feel like a game if
you are able to follow along with this
really good job programming the movement
of the player is definitely not the
easiest thing that you can do in unity
and so it's always annoying that it's
really the first thing that you have to
do in most cases but I hope you learned
something and remember you don't have to
understand and definitely not remember
all this the first time I will just
mention that the way that we're handling
player movement here is not the most
efficient way but no one expects you to
write perfect code right off the bat I
just want to let you know how this could
be improved there's two main problems
here the first one is how we're getting
player input now using input get key
here is totally fine and in our case it
works perfectly but as soon as we want
to do stuff like smoothing player input
supporting alternative keys or maybe
even a controller unity has some much
better ways to handle the player input
so you can definitely look into that if
you want to improve it also we are
currently checking for input inside the
fixed update well it's fine in our case
because what we're doing is movement and
that's usually a fairly smooth thing
it's definitely not a good idea to do
for stuff like jumping or the one-off
events the reason for this is that input
is updated in the update method and if
the fixed update runs slower you might
have a situation where you actually miss
some play into it first that would just
mean that the input gets slightly
delayed and that's why I think it's fine
here but the recommended thing to do is
check for input in the update method
then store that input in some sort of
variable up here in our case I could
just be too boolean called something
like move right and move left that you
set the true if the keys pressed and
false if the keys released and then
check if those variables are true or
false down here to add a force but it
really wouldn't worry too much about
that right now
let's pretty much it for this video if
