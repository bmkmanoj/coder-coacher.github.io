luckily that means there is a bunch of
new indie games waiting to come out and
of course as a fellow developer it's
always great to see what others are
working on in this video I want to share
the indie games that I'm most excited
about in 2018 so let's jump into first
up we have Griff Lance this is one of
those games that you take one look at
and you immediately want to play made by
the people behind don't starve the art
style of gift lands is pretty similar it
has an extremely put together look Griff
dance is a turn-based RPG taking place
in a bracket sci-fi world and with
fighting animations like these I'm
definitely excited about it
next we have manifold garden manifold
garden is a first-person exploration
game and it's actually made by a friend
of mine William sure inspired by this
real architecture of MC Escher
manifold Gardens level design is a short
force stretching as far as the eye can
see and then some manifold garden just
looks inherently interesting so yeah I'm
looking forward to this one another
beautiful game is the last night all the
sprites are incredibly detailed and
paired with the strange beauty of the
dystopian backgrounds this game's
atmosphere looks amazing the last night
revolves around storytelling and making
the players decisions count it's always
interesting to see developers try and
give their players real influence on the
game also the cute 2d platformers bill
donkey is finally getting a sequel the
trailer doesn't give much away but if
it's anything like the original it's
definitely going to be worth playing now
as some of you might know I'm a huge fan
of Ori and the blind forest which is why
I was absolutely stoked to find out that
there's going to be a sequel
orientable of the wisps has much to live
up to since I consider the original the
greatest platformer ever made judging by
the trailer will if the wisps looks just
as beautiful but of course when it comes
to the gameplay we'll just have to wait
and see this is definitely the game that
I'm looking forward to the most this
year also getting a sequel is the
much-loved classic Super Meat Boy back
when it came out Super Meat Boy
pioneered a new era in indie titles and
help show how popular indie games could
become as for its sequel Super Meat Boy
forever would be an adventure to
translate market debate just like the
original this game will be focused on
fast paced gameplay and is probably
going to be crazy hard but we all know
which game is truly the most anticipated
in the title of 2018 I'm of course
talking about call of duty known among
indie devs as the mother of indie games
can can add another title to its range
this year being a small studio I'm
personally impressed that tragus able to
publish a game so shortly after their
last one
all right on a more serious note I wanna
mention Frost Punk made by the creators
of this war of mine frost Punk gives you
the power to rule over a population in a
bleak frozen future you might even say
that this game looks seriously cold
frost Punk is definitely going to test
your moral compass and your ability to
prioritize so sign me up a game I'm
personally really excited about it's
octahedron a 2d platformer with an
absolutely amazing color palette the
soundtrack is also found to be awesome
as its partially made by the artist
behind the music for super hexagon which
is an old favorite of mine and just like
super hexagon I expect octahedron to
rely heavily on its music
this game is made by the one-man studio
demi-monde a and is to be released in
January lastly I want to mention a fun
game that's also created by a friend of
mine nor nor isn't as much a game as
it's a tool that enables you to do
something very important play with your
food I'm definitely looking forward to
playing around with it so that pretty
much sums up my most anticipated in the
games of 2018 actually there's so many
awesome indie titles coming this year
that it was impossible to fit them all
into this video so bear in mind that
this is just my personal pics feel free
to leave a comment stating the indie
game that you just can't wait to play on
that thanks for watching and I will see
you in the next video thanks to of the
awesome patreon supporters who donated
in December and a special thanks to
