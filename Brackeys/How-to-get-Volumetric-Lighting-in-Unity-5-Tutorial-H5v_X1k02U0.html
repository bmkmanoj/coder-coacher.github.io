on volumetric lights in unity today we
are going to be taking this scene and
turning it into this and before we get
started if you guys haven't watched my
latest video I just launched a new
website it's called dev assets it's a
place you can go to download high
quality asset packs it's pay what you
want and I think it's pretty awesome so
go to dev assets comm if you want to
check it out and let's just jump right
into today's video so here's the scene
we're going to be working with today
some of you might recognize it because
it's the same one I used in the deficits
video to showcase some of these
cool-looking sci-fi vehicles we of
course going to be adding some
volumetric lights to the scene but I
also want to show you kind of how I put
this whole thing together because a lot
of you guys were curious in the comments
and so I thought I would give you a
quick rundown of what we have in here
but first let's talk about what
volumetric lights really are so here's
an example of volumetric lights working
inside an engine this photo is from
killzone which runs on the deck Emma
engine and it's a really good example
because not only do we see the effects
of the light on a surface and a bit of
bloom we also see very clearly this rays
coming from the light and how these are
affected by a bit of noise giving the
impression that we have some dust and
particles Florent floating in the air
that the light is hitting and then
reflecting off of and therefore we are
able to see the light scattering through
the air so that's what we're going to be
making inside of unity however unity
doesn't have this feature build in so we
have to look to third-party alternatives
and I searched around a bit and I found
something that I thought was really
really cool
so here's volumetric lights for unity
it's an open source project created by a
guy called Michael and it uses the same
technique that Killzone does for
calculating these lighting effects it
currently supports both point lights
spotlights
and directional lights so it really has
all the features that you're going to
need in most pretty much all your
projects and the cool thing about it is
again it's open source and freely
available so you can see here that will
be a link to the github page in the
description where you can of course
clone or download the project but it's
set up as a unity project so I thought I
would go ahead and compile a unit
package and I've done this so if you
just go in the description that will be
a link for that as well when you open
that up you get a folder called
volumetric light switch inside it has a
volumetric lights unity package and this
allows us to just double click this it's
going to prepare the package and you can
see I already have some of the stuff in
the project but not the volumetric
lights folder we can just hit import and
it's going to set everything up for you
so that's really easy and the warnings
down here are not generated by the
volumetric lights on package they are
generated by some other stuff I have in
the project already because yeah it's a
bit messy in here but just ignore those
you should not get any warnings when
doing it so now we have a volumetric
lights folder in our project and if we
open that up there are a bunch of
example scenes that I definitely
recommend you check out if you want to
know how you can set some of this up for
your own project but specifically you
should check out some of the Sun labeled
ones because they show how to set up
directional lights to work with fog and
Hayes's and stuff like that alright so
let's get started by having a look at
what's currently in our scene of course
we have this main light which is our Sun
a directional light with a fairly high
intensity which has a kind of reddish
tint and you can see just how important
this light is if I disable it and
re-enable it we also have an accent
light a blue light shining from the
opposite direction you can see it
hitting the car right here it has a much
lower intensity and is tinted in a blue
color to really help bring some depth
into the scene you can see if I disable
this now that everything looks very
bland and green so that's a really
important thing to have I've also turned
up the ambient or intensity of our
ambient light quite a bit so that our
skybox will illuminate the scene from
all angles you can see I've turned it up
to 1.66 the reason why is I looked at
some reference photos from Mars and saw
that the light was getting bounced
around a lot we had this really bright
illuminated seems so I thought it would
replicate that by just bumping up the
ambient light awesome so on that in here
we of course have a terrain that's just
a unity terrain which I can enable and
disable we have a few rocks that I've
just scattered
any Rock pack will do and we also have a
dust storm and this is actually just
taking from the standard assets
I simply tweaked it by changing the size
around a bit to make it look a bit
better but that's really it and that
gives this scene one thing that does
make this scene look a lot better is all
of the image effects that I have applied
and if we go have a look at my main
camera here you can see just what those
are so first of all we have a global fog
which just helps blow out the background
a bit and apps in this bright color here
I also have a depth of field width which
is of course blowing the background and
the foreground and leaving only the
middle part here this the vehicle in the
center in focus we also have the color
correction curves here and I do a lot of
heavy color correction on this image you
can see if I disable that just how much
of a difference that makes I really
bring out the reds and yellows and try
and suppress some of the greens and you
can see I have some blue in there but
it's not overwhelming so that really
helps a lot with bringing this mars-like
feel into the scene and not just having
it look like a desert environment or
yeah you definitely don't want a lot of
green on Mars then we also have a bloom
which just helps blur out some of the
highlights in the scene and we have some
vignette and chromatic aberration but
that's very very solid you can see if I
disable that it's just a very very
subtle vignette we have going on here
and a bit of chromatic aberration as
well just at 0.5 finally the most
important part of the scene is of course
the sci-fi vehicles themselves you can
see them here we have our main vehicle
here in front and then we have to
supporting vehicles back here and they
are part of this sci-fi vehicles pack if
you want to get them for yourself you
can just go and open your browser type
in dev assets calm that will also be a
link for that in the description go to
sci-fi vehicles choose the price that
works for you if you are totally unable
to pay we even have a free option
because we understand what that's like
and then you just hit pay what you want
it's going to download as a zip file
with a unity package and everything is
going to be set up for you so you can
just drag in the vehicles and you're
good to go
so that's pretty much all for our scene
let's start looking at some lights to
get started let's go ahead and find our
vehicle in front here or whatever you
want to apply lights to and let's
right-click and go light and then select
spotlight because I want a light shining
in a particular direction with a an
angle and a range which really works for
these kind of lights so let's just move
this up a bit and position it on the top
light here and we'll do that one first
we'll do the two other ones as well but
I thought we would make this one D on
brightest one and so we'll do that one
first let's also rotate this one on the
x-axis and make sure you're in local
when doing some rotation it just makes
it easier and I'll just rotate it about
90 degrees doesn't have to be totally um
precise and let's go ahead and bump up
the range here to something like 20 and
that just means that it will shine
further and brighter and we'll also bump
up the spot angle I think the anger that
unity uses by default is very very
narrow and you won't see this on a lot
of lights what you see instead is a
fairly broad spot angle where the light
source actually hits pretty close I
don't think this is totally unrealistic
I want to see it hit the car and hit the
ground a little bit as well and if we
disable it you can see that's exactly
what is happening so that's awesome
let's go ahead and change the color of
the light to a light blue just to give
some contrast to a overall feel of the
scene and for some reason our lighting
just didn't are baked correctly there
but you can just enable and disable the
light if that happens to you I also want
to bump up the intensity because we have
so many intense lights and I've seen we
have to compete with this one so we'll
just bump that up to 3 but that's going
to depend totally on your scene I'm also
going to put some hard shadows in here
you can see what that does I wouldn't
recommend using soft shadows for a lot
of point lights that will quickly make
your scene very very hard to run but
having some hard shadows on this slide
is not going to do anything at least not
when we have this few things in our
scene so now we've added our light and
we are ready to make it volumetric in
order to do this
go hit add component we search for
volumetric light and add this volumetric
light script and you can see nothing is
happening inside of a game or a scene
view that's because of two reasons
primarily because this is not going to
show unless we hit play and if I hit
play it's still not going to show and
the reason why is that we have to go and
select our main camera hit add component
and add the volumetric light renderer
and this is what actually shows a light
so now we need to go to the default spot
cookie and we just need to input the
spot which is part of the volumetric
lights pack so let's just double click
that and now things should actually be
working it might not be too clear but
when we hit play we do actually have a
bit of volumetric Ness to this light but
it's not really showing to make it more
clear what we'll do is go and bump up
the scattering coefficient and you can
see once I do this it becomes very clear
that our light is now shining we get
these nice rays then this nice blooming
effect it just looks a whole lot better
but one thing that doesn't look too good
about our light is how static it feels
if we go ahead and disable our dust
storm you can see that our light is
indeed showing but it isn't really
effected by any kind of dust or
disturbance in the air or anything like
that to make it feel more random and
lifelike we'll go and select the spot
light and will enable the noise and this
is basically a way to add some
randomness to our light but right off
the bat you can see just almost disables
it that's because we have to bump up the
noise intensity I think we can go for
something like 4.5 yeah that looks a lot
better but our noise is still not too
visible that's because our noise scale
is too small if we go ahead and drag on
our noise scale here and increase it we
can actually see that the noise screams
themselves become a lot smaller so you
want definitely you definitely
a large noise scale but you don't want
it too big because then it cannot be
seen and you don't want it too small
because then it's going to look like
you've just overlaid a noise map and
you're just scrolling through it and
that looks super weird so I think
something like point one two so point
twelve looks pretty good for our case
the final thing that we need to edit a
bit is the noise velocity and that is
just the speed at which our noise will
scroll through so if I edit this to say
20 on the X you can see just what that
does I think we want the X to be around
1 so just a bit of movement there and
then our Y should be about negative 3
because our dust is moving towards our
from the right side of our screen to the
left side so I think that's going to
look a lot better if it's in line with
our dust storm so now make sure that you
copy these settings on this arm
component so hit copy component and then
we exit out of play mode make sure you
do this before you exit play mode or
your settings are going to be lost so
now we exit play mode we right click and
we hit paste component values to save
all of our arm configurations back in so
now what we can do is maybe take this
light here and we can rename it to our
top light then we can duplicate it and
we can add one to these down here as
well so in our scene view we'll just go
ahead and move this one down move it
over a bit and move it forward and we'll
just have to position it until we are
happy with it something like that
actually looks pretty good and we'll
also probably want to tilt it downwards
a bit because this lamp is pointing a
bit down towards the ground something
like that looks good and I definitely
also want to edit the color so let's
just go and take the color here and make
it a bit more yellow orange-ish
something like this and I don't want it
to be too saturated so if we go in here
and hit play now we should see that this
is currently really really blown out I
definitely want to bump the intensity
down to say one maybe 1.5 ad max and I
want to have the range decrease to
something like 15 and we can maybe even
deke
use the spud angle but I actually think
we should leave it as is and finally
when we hit play we might also want to
mess around with the coefficient a bit
just to make it a tiny bit more clear to
see or we could of course bump up the
noise intensity but I think what we
really want is maybe yeah to just bump
up the scattering coefficient a tiny bit
something like that just make it a bit
clearer will copy the component again
we'll exit out of play mode and we'll
paste it back in and now we can just
take this light rename it to something
like front light and then we'll do on
the scroll right duplicate it move it
over and it should fit right away and
we'll do front light left comb so that's
pretty much all I wanted to show you so
now when we hit play we should see all
of the lights working and nicely and it
just adds a lot of depth to our scene it
really makes everything pop it makes it
feel more lifelike you can see what a
difference this make if I go ahead and
disable the lights
it feels very static now and very 3d ish
and if I go in here and just move our
camera a bit I've created this camera
pivot where we can just rotate over our
camera you can see how cool this looks
when viewed from front as well and from
the other side here so it just looks
really really nice from all angles and
what we can even do is maybe tilt our
camera down so we look from underneath
here and you can see just how cool of a
dramatic effect this gives us I'm just
going to show you something really cool
about these vehicles and that's the fact
that they are totally modular so if we
have a look here this cabin here will
rotate separately of the body we have
all the wheels which will rotate
separately as well so you can easily set
it up with a vehicle controller inside
of unity and we also have the turrets
here which will also aim independently
and finally some of these vehicles also
have this top part here where you can
put something like a turret
or you can swap it out and simply use
the radar that we have on the other
vehicle here so you can really customize
these to look the way you want them to
and of course they are optimized for a
PBR workflow so we have both an albedo a
specular normal map height map occlusion
map and emission so all of the maps that
you could desire are in here so again if
you like it and you want to support it
go to the dev acid website grab it and
hopefully pay a bit if you're able to
and if not that's totally fine as well
let's pretty much it for this video I
