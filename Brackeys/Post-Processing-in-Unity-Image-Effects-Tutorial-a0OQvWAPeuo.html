different image effects in the new
post-processing stack we'll talk about
what they do and how we can use them
this video is also the first sponsored
video on this channel however today's
sponsor is actually something that I
personally use and love it's called
Skillshare it's an online learning
community and it's a place where you can
go to learn all sorts of creative skills
I've been using it to learn more about
graphics programming actually found this
really cool course on making generative
art it's really in-depth and the author
is a super funny guy so a lot of you
guys have been asking me to do
procedurally generated stuff well go
check that out go share has over 15,000
classes for you to choose from and
that's especially a lot of cool design
stuff like illustrated tips and app
design using sketch 3 Premium Membership
begins around $10 a month for unlimited
access but I have a link for you in the
description where you can get two months
for free I like free stuff too all right
enough about Skillshare let's get into
it so first off we want to import the
post processing stack I imagine this
will be integrated into the editor very
soon but for now we'll just go window
asset store let's search for post
processing and let's select the post
processing stack I'll also have a link
to this in the description it's now hit
import when this window pops up we'll
hit import again and you should not see
that a folder called post processing has
appeared in your project panel now in
order to get this working inside of our
game we have to select our main camera
we're going to add a new component and
the component we want to add is the post
processing behavior we need this on
every camera that we want to apply post
processing effects to and this takes in
a post processing profile a profile is
basically just the data pic where we can
adjust our effects so we'll go into the
project panel right click create and
we'll select post processing profile I'm
just going to call this one CC for color
correction and you can see that when we
select this object we have all of these
different effects available to us
remember to also select the camera and
drag in the profile you just created now
we're actually ready to apply effects
however there are a few settings on our
camera that I recommend you said if you
want to get the most quality out of your
game the first one is the rendering path
we can change this from forward to
deferred this will give us a lot more
lighting fidelity but it is also harder
on the hardware and not supported on
some platforms whenever we select the
firt here we also have to dis
dissemble anti-aliasing we'll have a
look at anti-aliasing in just a second
on top of this we'll also go under edit
project settings quality and in here
make sure to disable anti-aliasing we'll
add this through an image effect in just
a second and finally we can go to a
camera and select allow HDR HDR stands
for high dynamic range and it's a way of
packing more color data into your image
this gives us greater control over the
look of the scene when we start applying
image effects and helps us avoid
clipping where you lose color
information in very bright or dark spots
now that all of our camera settings are
correct we can go to a cc object and
start messing around with the image
effects let's begin at the very top here
with anti-aliasing anti-aliasing is the
process of reducing jagged edges
it adds interpolation to try and smooth
out stair-step like lines let's enable
it and you can see immediately what this
does to our edges it really helps smooth
them out not only here we actually have
the ability to choose between two
methods the fast approximate with the
temporal fast approximate is faster but
a bit lower quality and temporal is of
course the opposite higher quality but
also more expensive I find that a very
rarely used the temporal anti-aliasing
but it is here and offers a lot more
settings however you need 5.6 I have
found that it sometimes causes some
weird behavior normally you just have to
kind of enable it rename it maybe change
some settings until it draws right well
now I'll be sticking to the fast
approximate and in here you also have
the ability to choose between quality
and performance so next is ambient
occlusion ambient occlusion dark and
serious were two surfaces intersect to
create shadows and places where light
would have a hard time escaping from
this can be done very precisely by
breaking the lighting into a light map
or on the fly with post-processing using
a technique called SSAO
screen space ambient occlusion let's
enable it and you can see the shadows
being applied here to the places where
two surfaces meet now this is a good one
to adjust a bit the intensity is pretty
self-explanatory I like to keep this
pretty high when I'm setting all the
other settings just to make everything
visible then we have the radius this is
how close we want the shadows to be so
if we decrease this we can see that we
are kind of shrinking in the shadows and
we can of course also increase them for
this game here I'm going to set them to
something like point one two maybe I
think that looks alright actually they
might bump it up to point two then we
have the sample count this is the number
of em in occlusion samples for each
pixel on the screen and determines the
smoothness of the
I find the medium often works pretty
well you can see the difference too high
here but since we're zoomed in so far I
actually think I'm going to increase
high in this case gets rid of some of
that weird banding we can also disable
down sampling down sampling we'll have
the resolution of the effect in order to
save on performance what I find you can
just gain so much visual fidelity by
disabling it you will however have a big
cost in performance here so it's always
a matter of what you can do for your
gain and the platform you're targeting
now I almost never use the next settings
here so I'm just going to bump down the
intensity here and we can move on next
up a screen space reflection this effect
computes reflections based on the
surface roughness it cannot make
materials feel more lifelike because
they actually reflect the surrounding
environment so in a current scene here
we don't really have any objects that
would be influenced by screen space
reflection if we enable it you can see
it doesn't make too much of a difference
let's just for fun take our ground here
and add some kind of reflective material
to it I've just gone ahead and created a
material here with a fairly high
metallic value and a fairly high
smoothness and you can see now that our
ground is indeed creating reflections
from the object and I've seen if we go
and select our color correction object
and go into the screen space reflection
tab you can see there's a lot of
settings here here's how it looks
without you can definitely play around
with a lot of these most of the time
you'll probably want physically-based
reflection you can set the quality
between high and low
I find that low it's often good enough
you also have the max distance until you
cannot see reflections anymore most of
the time the iteration count is fine as
is same thing with the step size and
width modifier here you can decide how
much you want to blur out different
selections you can choose whether or not
you want to reflect back faces I would
leave this off in cases where you use
mostly horizontal surfaces but enable it
if you have a lot of vertical
reflections the reflection multiply
allows us to boost the reflections the
distance at which the reflection should
start fading and then we have the final
fade you can see these two sliders
adjust how the reflections look the
further we get away from the surface
then we have depth of field this effect
simulates the properties of a real
camera lens meaning that it applies
focus only to objects with a certain
distance from the camera the rest of the
image is blurred and bright spots get
highlighted with circular artifacts
which we refer to as bouquet let's
enable that and in our case we can't
actually see this effect yet that's
because we have to adjust some settings
here now a lot of people really get
confused about what these terms mean at
least if you're not really into
photography
the focus distance is fairly
self-explanatory this is the distance
from the camera where we put our focus
point over the aperture and focal
lengths are a bit more technical our
focal length and camera terms represents
the distance between our lens and the
film a graded focal length means more
blurring this is also why you get more
blur when you zoom in with the camera
than when zoomed out so if we go ahead
and bump this up to something like 70 we
can't actually see too much growing yet
that's because there's another value
that has effect on how much we blur
that's the aperture or often refers to
as f-stop this is effectively how much
we open our lens in order to let light
in the lower the value the wider we open
the lens and the wider we open the lens
the more blurry we get so if you just
decrease this you can see that we should
start blurring things and I've seen of
course you don't want to go overboard
with this but we can easily put it at
around say 1 we can then take our focus
distance and decrease it to place it
around our barrel and wheels so think
that looks pretty decent if we want this
kind of macro shot we could also go
ahead and increase the f-stop if we want
to see more of the background or
decrease the focal length I think these
settings look pretty fine for now then
we have motion blur motion blur well
Louis motion in real life a camera takes
in light over small periods of time if
the camera moves during these periods
the image gets stretched out creating
motion blur I think it's pretty much a
must-have effects of fast-moving games
so to test out our motion blur I've gone
ahead and added an FPS controller to our
scene this way we can move around and
see the motion blur in action if we then
enable motion blur under our color
correction it should actually already be
working just fine if I go ahead and hit
play we can see that when I move around
the image indeed gets blurred and it
makes everything look much smoother
especially if you turn it off in
comparison the two main sliders to worry
about here is the shutter angle in the
sample count the higher the shutter
angle the more the motion blur I'm just
going to put this to something like 300
now how are the same account the more
smooth the motion blur gets this will
also have an impact on performance so I
think leaving it at 10 is 5 in most
cases you can also use the multiple
frame blending this is mostly used for
artistic purposes if you want to get the
drunk effect let me go and turn it up to
1 here so you can see what that looks
like
we also have eye adaption this effect
adjust the exposure of the image at the
game is running
creating the illusion of an eye
adjusting itself to a lighting
environment at the time of making this
video the eye adapt
documentation is pretty sparse and I
don't want to just assume what the
different parameters mean for me to work
fine so far without having to tweak
anything I'll have a link to the
documentation in the description as well
now we have an effect that can really
help make your game pop which is also
why it's so overused
it's called bloom bloom makes light from
a bright source bleed into surrounding
objects in other words that allows us to
add glow to bright spots let's enable it
and you can see immediately that it
really helps spring a fire to life the
effect gives us a few settings the first
one is the intensity and this is just
the brightness on the stuff that we want
to bloom I think a value of 0.5 is
pretty okay here then we have the
threshold this defines how bright a
pixel should be in order to be
registered by the effect so if we set
this to a very low number you can see
that we bloom pretty much the entire
scene and if we increase it only the
brightest of bright spots will get
bloomed I think in our case the value of
around 1.4 is going to be cried all
right the soft needs how it blends from
things under the threshold to things
over the threshold you can see what that
does here I normally just leave that at
0.5 we didn't have the radius this is
how much we want to go ahead and blur
the lighting from the original pixel
kind of the size of the effect be
careful not to overdo this one sometimes
when you have a moving camera you can
get some really weird flickering if you
check the anti flicker it will help
prevent that finally you can also apply
a dirt texture on top of the camera the
post-processing stack comes with a few
ones that you can try out I normally
don't use these too much the next one is
really important it's color grading
color grading is without a doubt the
largest of the effects because it allows
us to control the overall look of our
image in terms of exposure color and
contrast let's check it and you'll see
immediately that it really flattens out
our image that's because it's currently
using the tone mapper
now I want to be explicit about this you
only want to use the tone mapper meaning
having this set to neutral or filmic if
you're using HDR if you have HDR
unchecked you should go ahead and select
none the neutral tone map is going to
lay out your colors and brightness
values so that they look really flat
this allows you to apply very hard color
correction on top of that it just make
sure that we don't lose a lot of color
data so that we can pretty much go in
any direction with the image that we
want you go ahead and adjust some of the
settings for the tone mapper here but
I'm actually pretty satisfied with this
so I'm instead going to go down and
apply some color correction first up we
have the exposure this is the old world
brightness
the scene then we have stuff like
temperature tint hue shift saturation
contrast I want to apply a bit of
contrast here probably also bump up the
exposure a bit I think I'm going to
leave the temperature that may be tended
slightly magenta we can also shift the
hue here which gives a pretty dramatic
change and the saturation I think I'm
pretty much just going to leave as is we
then have the channel mixer here which
allows you to change properties for the
different colors and you can also use
the trackball switch I like to do I'm
going to give it a bit of RIT in the
high end here some more green in the mid
and some blue in the darks if you
right-click one of these it's going to
reset it we also have a curves
adjustment here if you want to go in
here you can add keys in order to bump
up say the brightness here
and maybe decrease it a bit on the low
ends we can go in and select another
channel say the red channel here add a
key here and you can change that around
as well so it's really easy to do color
adjustments in here I'm satisfied with
the look of this you can see what it
looks like before and after instead of
doing the color grading in the engine
itself you can also use the user lot lot
stands for lookup texture it's an
optimized way of performing color
grading because you grade your image
beforehand in another program such as
Photoshop and then export the color data
into a lot that is then read by unity if
that's something you want to use you put
in the texture here and you can also
adjust the blending factor here but
we'll just be using the building color
grading then we have some of the more
niche artistic effects
the first one is chromatic aberration
this filter simulates chromatic
distortions at the edges of the screen
chromatic aberration is often seen in
lower quality camera lenses if we enable
this and bump up the intensity we can
immediately see the effects actually
they think it's pretty cool to have in
here but this is way too much let's
leave it at around 0.15 you can also set
a spectral texture which is going to
shift the hue of the chromatic
aberration by default it generates one
for you but there also some available
under textures spectral dots and we can
just try out one of the other ones here
say the blue red we bump up the
intensity now you can see that looks a
bit different I actually like this one
even better then of grain this effects
from the absol a of grain to stimulate
filmic noise let's enable that I don't
think this particularly suits our scene
here but we have an intensity slider we
have the size of the grains and how much
they should be affected by the luminance
of our scene you can also choose where
not you want them to have
I'm just going to disable this 4rc then
we have vignette a vignette can be used
to darken the edges and corners of an
image this is often visible when lenses
are sumed in and can be used to great
dramatic effect if we enable this we can
see that by default the effect is pretty
strong I definitely like this for a
scene because it helps draw attention to
whatever is in the center but I think we
should decrease it a little bit we're
going to just stuff like the center
point the color of the vignette the
smoothness the roundness which is easier
to see if we go ahead and bump up the
intensity and you can choose whether or
not you want this to be rounded that
means should it be completely circular
or should it be kind of adjusted to fit
the aspect ratio of our screen and see
that on and off here you can also change
the mode from classic to masked and this
allows you to input your own
black-and-white texture to use as the
vignette it can be cool if you want to
do stuff like dirt or blood on your
screen I'm just going to go with classic
and I want to bump down the smoothness a
tiny bit but also increase the intensity
so I like that a lot
finally we have did ring dithering is
the process of reducing banding in
gradient areas by introducing some
controls noise to the image we won't be
using this effect here but here's an
example of an image with and without
diddling so that concludes all of the
different image effects that you can
apply to your game if we go ahead and
hit play now we can see the effects of
these as the game is running and if we
select our main camera we can see what
it looks like with and without so really
a huge bump up in quality just by
adjusting a few knots that's pretty much
