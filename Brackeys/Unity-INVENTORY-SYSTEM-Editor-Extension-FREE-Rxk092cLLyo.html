introduction video to the new inventory
system for unity I am really excited to
finally get to show you guys what I've
been making and of course all of this is
available for free on the asset store so
let's get going with the demo here so
first let's open up the inventory window
and just start it by the inspector panel
and you can see that it tells me to
select the play and so once we do that a
bunch of settings will appear and this
is where you can customize the basics of
the inventory system and then simply hit
the set it up button and the editor
extension does the rest so now it's
already working in game and you can see
that it tells us that it set it up under
a new game object called inventory and
if we select this game object we can see
all of the different scripts components
and assets that makes the inventory
system work and all of this is 100%
customizable and fully documented in
code so if we now play the game and hit
I to bring up our inventory and
character window we can see that by
default they can be dragged around and
if we now click on an item we can see
the appearing inside of our inventory
window so that's really cool and for
equipping items if we crypt to the wrong
slot it won't work if we equip to the
right one we can see it appearing in the
turntable I made there and we also have
an auto equip function if you
double-click the item and also a drop
function where it will fall to the
ground you can also enable gizmos to
quickly find items and such here you see
it's set up in a first-person game so
it's really adaptable to whatever kind
of game you're making here we press the
e button to pick up items and once we
open the width
a window the game will pause and the
mouse will appear so we can equip items
and once we have them equipped we can
see our hands holding the weapon and
also in the left hand corner it is set
up with the weapon switching script so
we can easily switch between weapons we
have equipped by using the number keys
and the scroll wheel you can also easily
switch scenes and still keep items in
your inventory so here you see me
switching scene and that's just done by
using the don't destroy onload function
we also have an example script for that
which you can choose to include the last
demo I'm going to show you is for
consumable items so if we pick up a few
potions here and hit AI we can see that
they are stacked i've set the max tag of
these potions to be 5 so once we exceed
that number a new stack is created we
can also click it to use the effect
which will make a message appear in our
console window saying that we can insert
an effect there so if we double click it
it will bring up the script in
monodevelop
and highlight the code where we can
insert our effect an effect example
could be adding health to our player
here's a preview of the documentation I
hope you enjoyed the video and remember
you can get the acid on the unity asset
store I'll leave you with a cheesy outro
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
