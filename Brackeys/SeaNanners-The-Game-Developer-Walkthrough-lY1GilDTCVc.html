the game walkthrough video done by
practice i am the sea of bran keys and
today we are going to talk about some of
the techniques that I used in the
development of this game and just some
all tips and tricks and how I pieced
everything together so on basically this
game I was the only one developing it
the rest of the team is basically doing
something else they are busy developing
a iOS game called your game and
hopefully it will be out in the end of
March but until then let's create this
video so I've opened up unity and let's
start by covering the main menu so as
you can see that we have quite a few
elements here piecing together in the
hierarchy first of all we have the
banana and this is the exact same model
as used in the game itself so basically
I found the model on the internet and
then I just created a texture for it if
you can find something copyright free
while to free feel free to do it man
there's no reason to do extra work just
because some people say that everything
should be done yourself
that's just stressing it so I created a
texture and I played around with it and
lowered the resolution so I came up with
this and if we take a look at the
material so I select the material you
can see that it's just not it's not just
a basic diffuse shader I have chosen an
unlit texture and this allows for the
glowy kind of feel this makes the player
want to pick up the banana a lot more so
this helps provide the wonderful feeling
when picking up the banana the rewarding
part of the game so if I just
go ahead and change this to diffuse you
can clearly see the difference okay so
that's it for the bananas the the planks
themselves the wooden planks they are
basically just a cube with a texture on
them and it was a tileable that I found
and then manipulated too so it would fit
well and it just has a simple box
collider and in game it also has a rigid
body attached to it but if we go ahead
and play the game you can see that the
banana is rotating this is a very very
basic animation very where I simply
rotated the banana over the course of
ten seconds on the y-axis so then just
set it to loop that's not soon as the
game the text itself was we created
inside of cinema 4d and it was basically
just a flat text that I then which are
then extruded so a hypernurb that I just
which is just extruded ounce and cleaned
up something some of the Polly's would
you want to optimize this even more you
can you could go ahead and delete the
back faces but challenge when it's this
low rest
that's no need to the water you can
simply get this by right-clicking in the
assets panel import package and then
choosing just the default
mordioux one water basic or if you have
pro water pro so I think that the water
basic looks alright the pro is of course
a lot better and then at last the text
Dario Dario Dario brackish con and this
was just text created inside of unity by
going to game object create other and
then GUI text and it's a custom font
that I downloaded from the App Store in
the computer pack and it's called
Lilliput steps so basically one
to import a fun - this is a really good
trick be aware that it might be very low
quality and this is because this size is
completely wrong so play around with the
size in the in the import settings to
get the much more smoother looking text
there are some great articles on it you
can just google it if you have them
having trouble with it I know I had the
first time I tried to do this ok the
skybox default skybox from unity and
let's take a hood look at the GUI so if
we play you can see the do I elements
that I created through scripting pop up
on the screen and this allows for
changing the player simply changing the
background so I just created these in
Photoshop for fun and so this is a
charcoal and we have the slider with the
rotation speed how fast is the camera
can move the difficulty assembly how
fast is how many kiddies are going to be
thrown after you and the camera rise
whether or not the camera should move
upwards and down again we have the quit
button and we have the play so on now
that we know how all the elements work
let's go ahead and find the script so I
make a scripts folder and it is of
course the one called main menu so if I
go ahead and open up this one in
monodevelop so you can see that these
scripts requires a lot of different
things it requires the different
textures for the different faces
requires some sounds for it to make the
the menu a lot more interactive assembly
the menu reacts with sounds on what
settings to choose and the material I'm
not quite sure it might just have been
for debarking okay so
if we go in here and take a look I won't
go into too much detail but basically
the the important parts happen in the
function on GUI and inside of this we I
create a tackle I create a slider
another slider and a toolbar so that's
basically it for the main menu ok so
let's go ahead and open up the scene
with the gameplay itself so if we go in
and hit play this is how it looks in
game and you are able to move and the
movement is relative to the camera which
makes it a little bit harder every
platform has a written buddy attached to
it the water itself has a simple script
saying that if it collides with the
player kill him and bring up the ending
menu where you can basically restart or
quit or go to the main menu and change
more settings on top of that pillar is
yet another banana this one is big and
it can basically give you even more
points it's worth 5 points instead of
just one down here is the counter and
that's basically it so let's go ahead
and stop the game and open the same no
we don't want to save anything and this
is how it looks in unity so we could
start out by taking a look at the huge
banana so every banana in game has a
light applied to them so this makes it
look a lot more fun and glowing so if I
go ahead and delete that or just turn
off the light you can see that it's not
nearly as exciting when it comes to
power-ups or things that you want the
player to collect you can really go over
the top with all the effects
it it's just so rewarding they don't
always have to be pretty or realistic
please make them big bright and awesome
so the player definitely wants to pick
them up for hours and hours or just
mittens but ours so do that so it has a
Collider and this is the script that
checks for collision with the player so
if we go ahead and open up the script
the pick up script you can see that on
the trigger enter it creates this
variable or changes the variable
Collider to the tank of the collided
object so basically after we have done
this we can check if the tank is equal
to play and in doing tag instead of a
name just take some pressure off of the
CPU on the computer so do this for if
the task is going to be repeated many
times Collider that name is a little
more heavy so check if it's is the play
if it is it goes to the counter script
and just and takes the points variable
and make it one more or just the
variable plus point so it plus equals
plus points or plus de plus points
variable which in this case is one it
then instantiates some particles to make
it even more awesome and more bright and
it then destroys the banana right so if
we go ahead back just test out how the
logic works oh and we pick it up you can
see the port you'll spawn and it got
destroyed so the reason why all the
kitties spawned in this in this current
event is that the variable saying how
many kittens spawning is set in the main
menu so if you go ahead and play this
scene directly it will just be zero and
it will draw out at least one every
rain so that's why it went completely
bananas and okay enough with the bat
humor so I have all the platforms in one
game object judge just to keep it clean
and so this is how I reached the desired
effect of the bananas we could go ahead
and take a look at the the banana
particles so if I bring this in can see
wow it's it's quite a huge effect it's
bright it's yellow and it's awesome so
if I go into the particle system you can
see that I have turned off the looping
to make this exploding effect and I have
quite some particles emitting at the
same time so if I turn on the the
looping you can see just how many
particles I'm actually emitting I've set
the particles material to glowing so
that way to additive so this way they
will look more shiny and they are just
emitting from a basic spheric shape okay
so let's go ahead and delete this prefab
once again and take a look at the player
and his properties so the player getting
the player to react the way I wondered
was quite a challenge throughout I've
made many changes with the entire
process so but the the mechanics I ended
up with was basically I took a a simple
first person controller and put it in I
made the cylinder a lot longer so we
could get the it to fit with the head as
good as possible and on the the the the
parent game object the player one we
have the character controller we have
the character mode we have the FPS input
control
all of these comes with the FPS
character controller preset this smooth
look was just something I played around
with and we have an animation because
not only the camera is rotating also
this guy is rotating with the camera so
if we go ahead and play this you can see
that he's slowly rotating in the angle
of the camera alright so that's it for
that game object that's is of course set
to loop and this animation along with
the cameras this speed of the animations
is changed again based on what you
choose in the main menu so if we go
ahead and select the other game object
that is a child of it we have the player
graphics which is basically just a plane
generated in unity and it has an unlit
and transparent picture on it so that is
set you I also experimented with some
foots to put under his face but I ended
up not going with that I've made a lot
of different types of of player controls
but this is really the one that works
best also getting him to rotate with the
camera was quite a challenge I ended up
just doing the animation but I really
wanted to have done it through scripting
so that we could do something creation
crazy with the the camera button alright
so we have the scene and we have some
preferences that are set in the same I
like to store them in one object so that
we can we can simply um we can simply
take them through other scripts and
other objects so we can just reference
them in scripts and we have the there we
go sound
we have the music playing in the
background and the music was fun found
online and mixed together and the voices
was taking from some of his videos so I
just mixed them in because it was meant
to be this fun interactive experience
almost like you were there with
seananners or you were watching some of
his videos I wanted you to wreck the
usage to recognize this as much as
possible so I really tried to get some
good quotes in there and I am and the
feeling of his videos the brightness the
fun of it and the happy face smiling of
course once you start the game notice
how the camera moves so it soon speak
out from his face and immediately you
get a auditive feedback from seniors
himself welcome you coming you to the
game so that's just some of the thoughts
that I had while creating this game and
I hope you have enjoyed this walkthrough
if you want to see more or if you think
that something there is something I
didn't cover it you can just write to me
and leave a comment something and yea
that was basically it for this video our
website is getting more and more awesome
and you can just go ahead and check it
out at Frankie's calm a wonderful
anymore so on thanks for watching and
I'll see you in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
