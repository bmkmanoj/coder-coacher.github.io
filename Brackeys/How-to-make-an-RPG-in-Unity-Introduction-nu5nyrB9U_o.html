pretty big challenge I produce often
both system and content heavy however in
this series we will try to boil it down
to a few key subjects that are central
for almost any RPG and to keep things
simple we've split the videos up into
two categories gameplay and graphics
I'll be handing the gameplay side here
we'll learn how to create stuff like
player and camera movement interactable
x' and items an inventory system
equipment character stats enemy AI and
combat but the graphics side of things
I've teamed up with Sebastian lake with
a fellow tutorial creator hello I'll be
sharing how to model break and animate a
simple character in blender complete
with a basic set of armor and a weapon
I'll also be showing how to take these
graphical elements and integrate them
with the gameplay so in these
integration episodes we'll be writing
code to trigger the correct animations
as well as to interface with Becky's
equipment system to have the equipment
graphics actually show up on the
character and animate correctly along
with them now since some of you may be
interested exclusively in the coding
side of things or others perhaps
exclusively in the graphics the series
will be split into two separate
playlists gameplay and graphics the
gameplay playlist will contain all of
Becky's coding videos as well as my
videos on integrating the graphics with
the code while the graphics playlist
will just contain my blender videos make
sure to subscribe to Sebastian's channel
so you don't miss a video in this series
the first video on gameplay will be up
on my channel this Wednesday so stay
tuned until then Sebastian has a bunch
of other games and videos you can check
out I'm super excited to get cracking on
the game if you want you can download
the environment we'll be using from dev
assets the pack will be updated as we go
also in case you get stuck we've made
the source code available on github
there will be a link for both in the
description on that thanks for watching
I will see you in the next video thanks
to all the awesome patreon supporters
who donated in June and a special thanks
to hands often yes by McKesson we'll
