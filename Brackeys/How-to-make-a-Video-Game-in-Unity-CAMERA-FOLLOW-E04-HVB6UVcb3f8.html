making our camera follow the movement of
our player not really much to say about
that let's just jump into it that's with
everything else in game development
making the camera follow the player can
be done in multiple ways the first and
most obvious one is probably just
parenting the camera to the player unity
allows us to nest game objects that
means that we can take our camera here
selected and drag it under our player we
have now parented our main camera to our
player and the main camera is now a
child of that player this means that
whenever we go and move our player the
camera is going to move with him however
the problem with this is that if we go
ahead and rotate our player the camera
also rotates with them and that's going
to look very weird when we collide with
something and the cube starts spinning
then the camera is going to spin with it
and everything's going to be confusing
so what we do instead is we take our
camera and unparent it and we make it
follow only the position of our player
using a script let's go and hit add
component we'll call it something like
follow player like C sharp and hit
create an ad let's double click it to
open it up in visual studio and let's
clean up the script a bit so let's
delete the two using tags up here let's
also delete the starred method not just
like when we wanted to move our player
where we wanted to move him a tiny bit
each frame we also want to have our
camera snap to the position of our
player each frame so we'll put our code
inside of the update method however in
order to set our cameras position to
that of the player we need a reference
to the player the easiest way to do this
is by making a variable that stores a
reference to our player so when we
create a variable we write public and so
far we've only looked at the basic data
type stuff like float integer and string
that stores numbers and text but
variables can actually also store way
more complicated stuff if we go ahead
and write transform here we can
basically get a link to our player with
information about his position rotation
and scale
remember the component responsibles with
these things are indeed called a
transform so that's what we're getting a
reference to then of course we need to
name it something but we'll just name it
player let's close up with a semicolon
and if we just try and hit save now and
head back into unity we see that an
empty slot called player now appears all
we need to do now to make this play a
variable point to our specific player is
to take the player and drag him into
that slot now every time we write player
in our code it refers to that object to
test this we can go inside of our update
and we can try displaying the position
of
a player in the console to do that
rewrite debug log to write a message to
the console inside of the parentheses we
then write player dot position and we
close it off with a semicolon now every
frame we should display a message in the
console with the position of a player
let's save that back into unity and hit
play and if we go and select our console
we can now see that position updating if
we select our player the two numbers
should correspond so we can see here
that our player is currently falling and
so his y-value is rapidly decreasing and
it does the same thing in the console we
can also see that he's moving a bit
forward on the Z again he's also moving
forward in the console so now that we
have this link between our script and
the player we can take the position of a
player and feed it to the camera let's
stop playing head back into visual
studio and instead of writing the
position of our player we'll go
transform and whenever we write this
with a non capital T it refers to the
transform of our current object that
means the object that this script is
sitting on it also sets so here the
transform attached to this game object
so by writing transform and then dot
position we're referring to the position
of our camera because our follow player
script is sitting on that object and
just like we were able to display a
position we can also set it equal to
something else so now we could move our
camera anywhere in the world but we want
to move it to a very specific place and
that's the position of a player so we'll
set it equal to player dot position and
again we'll close this off with the
semicolon so now our cameras position
this game object's position is going to
be set equal to the player's position
every frame so let's say that head back
into unity and technically our code
doesn't have any errors but there is the
main problem with this
let's try swimming out in the scene view
so we can see what's going on and
hitting play we can see that indeed our
camera is following the player but it's
following the center of our player and
that means that right when we start the
game
our main camera snaps to be inside the
player object you can see that the
effect here is that we are getting kind
of the first-person view of course this
might be something that you want for
your game but in our case I think it
would be better if we move our camera a
bit back from the player and a tiny bit
off to do that we'll create another
variable so again we'll write public and
I'm going to introduce you to a nozzle
datatype this one is called vector three
and a vector three is actually really
really simple all this does is store
three numbers a float storage
one number with decimal places a vector3
stores three floats and that makes it
really easy to use when it comes to
position of data because we have an X a
Y and a Z so if we go ahead and name
this one offset save it and go into
unity we should now be able to specify
an offset on the x y&amp;amp;z value so in our
case we wanted to remain centered on the
X so we'll leave that at zero but we do
want it to lift it a bit on the Y here
so we'll set that to something like 1
and we definitely also want to pull it
back so let's set the Z here to
something like negative 5 so now that we
have this offset on the different axis
all we need to do is add it on to a
player's position so to do that we'll go
in here and say players are position and
then plus offset and we are very used to
seeing the plus here being used between
two numbers but unless you have
experience with college-level math you
probably haven't seen it between two
vectors how do we add three numbers on
two other three numbers it's kind of
weird if you want to learn more about
what's going on here I have a video on
vectors that you should definitely check
out basically what's happening is we're
taking the x position of a player which
is currently 0 and we're adding 0 onto
that so that's the 0 then we're taking
the Y which is 1 point 1 6 in this case
and we're adding 1 on to that and then
finally on our Z this is currently 0 as
well and we're adding negative 5 on to
that so that's negative 5 on the Z and
we keep doing that as the player moves
forward so in this case our X would
still be 0 iy would be 1 point 1 6 plus
1 which is 2 point 1 6 and a 3 would be
this number minus 5 which is equal to 1
point 6 3 so make sure you save your
script and hit play and our camera
should now follow our player with the
knifes offset position and this is much
better than parenting because if we tilt
off the ground here you can see the cube
rotating but the camera staying in place
