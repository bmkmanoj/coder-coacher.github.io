dare 41 and it was a huge amount of fun
to those of you who don't know um Daria
is a massive game dev competition where
you have 48 hours to create a game from
scratch that means you do all the art
code and sound yourself for this dunam
diary we all decided to participate so
we packed up all like gear and set it up
in our friend's apartment we then went
home for a good night's sleep and when
we woke up the next day the theme had
already been announced it was to combine
two incompatible genres so naturally we
started brainstorming genres on the
whiteboard trying to figure out weird
ways to combine them I'll be completely
honest and say that I thought this was
actually a really hard challenge
finally I settled on the idea of
combining a realism based crafting game
with fantasy adventure elements the game
feels a lot like a sandbox where you
combine different real-life elements to
create materials you then combine
materials to create tools and use the
tools to gather more materials but then
out of the blue you stumble upon this
weird magical substance and suddenly the
game is all about figuring out this
magical world and I don't want to spoil
it but you do end up fighting bad guys
with this idea in mind it was time to
boot up unity I started by creating some
basic UI elements trying to figure out
how the crafting would work I decided to
go with the simplest possible solution
combine two things get a result i
implemented drag and drop to move things
around and it was already really eager
to start adding some items however I
knew that I had to first come up with a
quick way to create items and item
recipes that would make it easy to edit
them later for this I decided to use
scriptable objects which later turned
out to be a wide choice basically I
created two based scriptable objects one
for items which contained a name as well
as an icon and one for recipes which
contained information about which items
to combine in order to create a new one
using this symbol structure it was
pretty quick to get crafting working
with the UI I also had in an inventory
the keep track of all items the player
has
as the game progresses and at this point
I was ready to start adding items but I
still needed to figure out exactly what
items I wanted in my game and more
importantly which ones combined into
what to help visualize this I started
creating a graph of all the items that I
wanted in the game and I think this is
often something that is overlooked when
talking about game making planning and
visualizing tasks can be extremely
useful and I can easily say that without
this graph I would have never finished
the game in time now finally I could
start going through the list and
creating icons for each of the items
also quickly threw together some sprites
to make the UI a bit nicer and once I
was happy with it
I threw it into the editor and voila I
actually had something working I only
had around 5 items but still the idea
was there from here spend most of the
evening creating lots of different icons
for items I must say I really enjoyed
this part most of the games I make are
often really focused on gameplay and
because of that I normally use most of
my time programming but for this game
everything revolved around having enough
items to make it feel interesting and
plentiful and it was also a great excuse
to practice my pixel art skills even
though I will admit I found inspiration
in a few places
well once I had some more items in place
it was time to find a good way of
introducing magic to the player for this
I created a reward manager that would
track the amount of items the player
heads and give extra rewards such as man
tegu once the player has progressed to a
certain point and it was at this time
that I started having my friends play
test the game and man did I learn a lot
from doing so I found out that rewarding
the player with extra items worked
really well and everyone got super
excited when they found the magic goo so
I started thinking of other rewards to
give the player also learned that I
definitely needed more items in the game
and to avoid people from getting stuck I
had to create multiple ways to craft the
same items after updating the graph to
reflect these thoughts I added some UI
to highlight new items when they are
discovered I also used this as a way to
communicate story to the player and tell
a few jokes along the way which ended up
being a crucial part of the game and
that was pretty much the end of day
one next morning I felt pretty well
rested and started to slave away at all
the new items that I thought up the day
before these were really fun to do
because a lot of them were more
interesting and magical which is great
because it took pretty much the entire
day
I also added an item counter to help the
playa keep track of his progress as well
as some fancy UI animations to help tie
everything together on that I've pretty
much been the entire night doing lots
and lots of play testing I asked my
friends to play the game one by one to
find out where they were getting stuck
and between each I would go in and add
or change items to smooth out the
experience with the core game done and
only a few hours to go I still wanted to
add audio unfortunately at this time
unity decided to stop working altogether
and I had to reinstall meanwhile I had
time to record some sounds and once
unity was back up and running I quickly
added them all together and created an
icon for the game I also realized that I
needed a name for the king at this point
I felt like I was pretty much running
out of good ideas so I went with me
fairly unoriginal crafty I guess it
works just fine and that was it as
always I submitted just before the
deadline this is me at 4 a.m. time to
catch up on some lost sleep let's pretty
much it for this video if you enjoyed it
