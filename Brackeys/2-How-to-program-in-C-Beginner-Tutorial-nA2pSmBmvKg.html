welcome to the second video in how to
program in C sharp it's been such a long
time since the last one I'm at and I'm
really sorry about that but I've been
working on something really cool which
you might see from the wallpaper here
and I've also been traveling a lot but
I'm finally back home I'm ready to start
pumping out some videos so this is just
a short one but we're going to take a
look at something really important which
is input and output meaning how we read
and write from the console so that's
super cool but first before we get
started I quickly want to show you the
all new practice developer forum as you
can see we have a full on answer section
where you can ask question and and get
answers we have a discussion section
where you can share opinions about stuff
and then we have showcase and
collaboration so you can show your work
and you can collaborate with our
developers it's super awesome and here
it is this is how it looks so you can
see that we have infinite scrolling
there are a statistics there are
different categories we have some hot
topics so you can see what's trending
and some top users which you can very
much still get on top of if you are
drawing quickly so you can simply click
here to start a topic or login you can
join with both both Facebook and Twitter
or just fill out the boxes and hit join
it's very simple and very easy and I
very much hope that you will join and be
part of this quickly expanding community
because we really need to fill this up
with users also thank you to all the
beta users out there who've been testing
and reporting bugs it's really been
helpful so if you see a bug or Monda
feature please just go ahead and request
it I've made a topic for you to do so
great so that was the introduction to
today's video let's just go ahead and
delve right into it so let's open up
examine in studio and once it's opened
up here we're just going to load our
first console project solution and now
we're back to where we left off in the
last video cool
so what I really want you to understand
right now is that coding you can just
understand everything at the same time
you have to take one piece at a time and
this piece of code read here that it
automatically generates can be hard to
understand so things such as classes and
namespaces are not always easy to
comprehend so what we're going to do is
we're going to actually ignore most of
this and then we're going to focus on
writing a program that will start up and
write something and then await some user
input so for now we are going to ignore
the using system the namespace the class
and all we are going to be focusing on
this putting code inside these two curly
brackets so everything inside these two
are important for us right now
one thing I will quickly go ahead and
say is that this right here is what is
called a method it's pretty similar to
what you know as a function from Unity
script or using c-sharp in unity so and
this is a method a method and it's
called
main that's pretty much all we need to
know about the syntax here is that this
right here is the method name what this
method actually does is it is called
when the program starts that means that
everything we put inside these two curly
brackets will run as soon as we run the
program so that's going to be pretty
much our entire program inside these for
now cool so right now you can see that
we have one line here called console
that write line HelloWorld and we're
just going to go ahead and delete that
because we are going to write something
on our own so first off we're going to
go ahead and write console so now we are
writing to the console so we want to
access the console class just like we
have a class up here we are writing to
the consular class classes are going to
be more clear
what they do and when they can be used
for later then we're going to do a dot
which means that we will access all of
the stuff inside the class pretty much
like if you have a category called
link called console and then we're
accessing all the sub categories all the
function and values inside of that class
then we want to do right line
and you can see that it suggests what to
do while we write it that's super super
awesome and we can also when we have one
of the one of the objects here selected
you can see that we can view a summary
of what it does
this right here is method just like our
stat method here our main method that is
called when the program starts the
console class has a method called write
line that will write the current line
terminator to the standard output stream
that that basically means it will show a
line on the console so we're going to go
ahead and do that and then we're going
to open up two parentheses and we're
going to end with the semicolon so this
right here is how you call a function
whenever you want to call a function you
you do you find the function then you
open and close to prepare two
parentheses and you close it up with a
semicolon which is very important cool
so everything inside these two
parentheses is what we call a parameter
and a parameter is a way to pass a value
on to the function so we can simply say
hey function please do whatever it's
inside of your curly brackets and
remember to use this value along the way
and different functions have different
parameters some functions don't even
have any parameters and some functions
like this one can take multiple
different kinds of parameters and to
view
what kinds of parameters that this
function will take what we can do is we
can say console dot write line and here
above the summary which says that it
writes the line and so and so we can
also see that it says one of 19 and
that's because this function can be
called in 19 different ways meaning that
it will take 19 different parameters
that's a lot most of the functions that
we are going to be creating maybe takes
one but it's because then we both want
to be able to maybe write a number to
the console or a full-on sentence or
just one single character or maybe a
number with decimals so there are there
are many different types of values that
we want to send to this function and to
view the different values you do Shift +
on Windows with the number pad you do 4
+ 6 to go back and forth but on Mac I'm
pretty sure you can just do shift and
then the arrow keys to browse through so
do shift and then I'm on the window so
I'm going to do 6 to go to the right and
you can see that here's the first
version of this method that we can call
and this takes in an oolong and you can
see what that does in the description
but that's not what we want we don't
want a long either
this is au int this is a pool and there
is a string and basically I haven't told
you about variable types and what all
these different weird names actually
mean but just know that a string is
basically a sentence it's a series of
characters it could be one word or a
whole sentence so we're just going to
use that one so now we know that this
function can take a string value so
let's actually give it one so again we
have the console dot write line and
inside of these two parentheses we're
going to do these two quotation marks
because everything inside these to
quotation marks is a string so we can do
hello I'm a computer I'm sent from the
future and now we actually have a full
online that will write to the console so
if we go ahead and in play theoretically
this should work and it will on Mac on
Mac this will execute just fine but on
Windows it's not going to work and I'm
going to show you why so if we go ahead
and hit play up here you can see that it
very very quick nents quickly opens up
the console and then close to sit back
down and the reason why is on Mac
whenever it's done doing what it should
it will just stay open until you close
it but on Windows when a console
application is done doing what it should
it's just automatically closes so what
we want to do is we want to await for
the user to do something before the
console closest so to do this we are
going to read from the user so again
we're going to access the console you're
going to do dot then we are going to
type read and then you can see we have
different kinds of read functions we
could do read which reads the next
character we could do read key which
obtains the next character or function
key pressed by the user or we could do
realign which reads a whole line of
characters which basically is a string
but in our case we're just going to do
read key so whenever the user presses
the key on the keyboard
the application is going to quit and you
can go ahead and do this on Mac also
it's it's generally good practice to do
so go ahead and do consult re key and
this is not going to take any parameters
so just over the close the parentheses
and ended up with the semicolon now when
we go ahead and hit play you can see it
opens up for
console saying hello I'm a computer I'm
sent from the future and once we press
something it will close back down so
that's pretty much the end of this video
I'm going to do something new which is
give you a challenge to complete before
the next video where we'll show you how
it's done what I want you to do is I
want you to write out your age and your
our name and then I want you to evade
the user input so I want you to wait for
some kind of user input and then write
out a new line saying what your favorite
colors and then finally of course a
weight user input so that the council
doesn't quit immediately I'm going to
show you how this is done in the next
video also one nifty trick if you want
to do long sentences on multiple lines
instead of just making a new console dot
write line method call every time you
want to make a new line you can simply
use this character right here so you do
backslash so reverse backslash this is
and then M that will make a new line so
you don't have to put spaces around this
because then you will just have
unnecessary spaces so just input that
character which is the reverse backslash
and then an N and then we can do let's
say this is a new line so once we play
on this you can see that it makes a new
line cool so that was all I wanted to
show for this video thanks for watching
and I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
