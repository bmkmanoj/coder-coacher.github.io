tutorial in our survival game series
done by practice I am the CEO of Brack
ease and I just got back from skiing
ready to do some more tutorial stuff
today we are taking a look at how to
switch weapons in unity so we are going
to be scripting bats so as always I have
already opened up the unity and so I
have opened up unity and first of all I
just want to get rid of the ground plane
object in our scene because that we
won't need anymore now that we have such
a fine terrain alright so basically what
we're going to do and we are going to
open up the player prefab and under the
main camera will find our melee empty
game object which is start currently
starring our maze and our sort objects
so basically you want to put both
weapons in there the weapons that you're
going to be switching between and the
one that you want the character to start
out with that one you're just going to
leave enabled the other one you're just
going to disable and make sure that they
are correctly positioned and lined up
with the cameras or anything looks good
alright so I'll go ahead and disable the
sword again so I want the character to
start out out with having the mace
equipped and for now maybe we'll take a
look at how to make animations that
switch between the two
maybe not depends on how much time this
is going to take but okay let's go ahead
and create the script so you go ahead
and select the melee empty game object
you click Add component new script and
of course you're going to program this
in JavaScript and by the way a lot of
people have asked me why we are starting
out with the JavaScript well basically I
think that JavaScript is a little easier
learn in the future we might do some
c-sharp programming in general c-sharp
is a lot broader of a programming
language but for beginners JavaScript
can do exactly what you need so we'll
just call this weapon switching you know
what will D capitalize that so weapon
switching create an ad and open it up in
monodevelop perfect okay so we can go
ahead and delete the function start we
won't be needing that and let's start
out by creating some variables okay so
it has been some a little wider since we
created our last script so might be a
little rusty but as always we'll start
with the variables and we'll call the
first one bar and then weapon one so
I'll capitalize that and Sue a one a
colon and then it's going to be a type
game object next one is we are going to
do the exact same we call this just
going to call this weapon two and again
a type game object all right so this is
the variables that are going to store
our two weapons so in our function
update we want to call the weapon
switching when something happens more
specifically we want to check if we get
an input and you can make this whatever
you want I'm just going to say if input
dot get key down and then I'm going to
do a key code so key code dot capital Q
so we're going to switch weapons using
the Q key then we want something to
happen so we want to swap
our weapons and you could exclude them
but I'm just going to go ahead and make
the brackets also after all that is our
name so it should look like this and
whenever you see a piece of code just do
this so a name and then just the the the
end the ending signs it means you're
calling a function so parenthesis start
and end and then a semicolon means
function so we are going to go ahead and
have to create the function so we'll
make a new function call it swap weapons
and it's a good idea to always create
functions with capital letters all the
way through so I'm swap weapons and the
parentheses I'm going to leave them
empty and then we're going to start the
bracket and of course end it also ropes
it up Tibor there you go
and inside of here we're going to check
if the weapon 1 dot active this equal to
true and if that
do this alright so on what we have here
is we have a piece of code starring two
game objects these two weapons we have a
function update checking if the player
presses the Q key code the Q key on this
keyboard and if he does then just call
this function swap weapons once this
function will check if the weapon one is
active so the first that weapon is
currently equipped and if it is we're
going to switch to the second weapon so
the code is going to look like this
weapon 1 dot set active recursively it's
going to be false in parentheses
semi-colon and weapon 2 dot set active
recursively it's going to be true in
parenthesis so let's simply make sure
that if the weapon 1 is currently
equipped then it will equip weapon 2
instead and disable the weapon 1 now we
want to make the opposite case so we go
down until the closing bracket of the if
statement and type else so else is
called if if the if statement doesn't
meet its requirements so if the weapon
sir one isn't active then it's going to
do whatever we put inside of the else
statement so Elle's weapon 1 dot set
active recursively it's going to be true
and yes you guessed it weapon 2 that's
set active recursively is this time
going to be false
and this way we can simply switch
between our two weapons so let's go
ahead and try it out open unity back up
you can see that the two variables need
to have something stored in them so we
can drag our mace under the weapon one
another sort under the weapon - I'll go
ahead and maximize and hit play and when
I click the cue it switches to my sword
I'm going to click it again it switches
back to my mace this way this is pretty
much the simplest way to do weapon
switching I guess if I have to do the
animations also this would take too long
so I'll go ahead and cut off the video
right here but I heard I hope you learn
something from it and I'll see you in
the next video
