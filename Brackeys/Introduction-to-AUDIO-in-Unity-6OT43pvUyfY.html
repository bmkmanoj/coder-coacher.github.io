at adding audio to your game the first
part of the video will be an
introduction to audio in unity we'll be
setting up an audio listener and
adjusting some audio source components
to add sounds and then in the second
part of the video I'll show you how to
make an audio manager the audio manager
makes it really quick and easy to add
new sounds and play them through script
another link where you can download it
in the description but to those of you
who are interested in how you can
program the audio source component we'll
go through and make an audio manager
from scratch alright let's get started
so as you can see I have a project open
this is shrinking planet it's my newest
Ludum dare submission and I've gone
ahead instructed from all the audio so
when we play the game now it should be
totally silent so let's add some sounds
the first thing we need when adding
audio to our game is an audio listener
the most common place for this is the
camera if you select your main camera
you will probably see an audio listener
there already if not you can always just
go and add it by hitting add component
I'm searching for audio listener all
this component does is well listen for
sounds that also means that the game
object that you put your audio listener
on will be the place from where you hear
sounds in 3d that's why it's most
commonly put on the camera the next
thing we need is an audio source if we
go to any game object in our scene I'm
just going to select the player we can
go ahead and add a new component let's
add the audio source this component it's
responsible for playing an audio clip
that's also the first thing we have to
specify I've gone ahead and imported a
few audio clips usually supports most
file formats or design mp3 if we click
on any of them a few settings will
appear you can squeeze some performance
out of your audio by messing around with
these I'll have a link in the
description if you want to read more
about that
and if we go ahead and hit play we can
have a listen
so let's now select a player and drag in
the car sound by default our audio
source is set to play on awake so for
now hit play we should actually hear the
sound awesome we have a bunch of ways we
can configure this most important is the
volume of our sound and the spatial
blend this controls whether or not you
want your son to be played in 2d or 3d
space
if you select 2d it will always be
played with the same volume in both
speakers however if we slide it towards
3d the volume of the sound is going to
depend on how close our audio listener
is to the audio source and it's also
going to factor in stuff like the
Doppler effect where sounds moving
towards you or more high frequent and
sounds moving away you can pitch down so
let's try and set this to 3d and have a
listen I think that's a lot better for
our game finally this sound should be
looping and so I'm going to check off
the loop now in my game I have meteors
that crash down upon the planet and when
they hit the planet I want them to make
an explosion sound luckily I have it set
up in such a way that every time a
meteor hits the ground it's going to
spawn a crater object and so we can
simply go ahead and find the prefab for
this crater add an audio source and I
have a sound set up for this that the
meteor hit it sounds like this so we can
simply drag that in make sure it's set
to play on awake and you'll be using the
fact that play on awake means that the
audio will play as soon as the object
gets spawned in so if it's enabled right
when the scene starts it's going to play
right away but if it's spawned in at a
later point it's going to play at that
point and we definitely want this to be
in 3d space but we might go for
something like point 8 if we now hit
play and wait for a meteor to come
crashing we can hear the impact so you
should now be able to go through and add
audio sources to many of your game
objects I've gone ahead and added one to
the meteor as well this much like the
car is said to play on awake and is said
to loop and it's just the sound of the
media flying through air and so without
any coding we've actually added a bunch
of different sounds to our game however
some sounds aren't tied to a particular
game object and except that this could
be the click sound you hear when you
hover over a button or the game over
voice you hear when your player dies as
well as of course music there's a bunch
of different ways to go about this we
could go in and add a bunch of empty
game objects with an audio source on
each and then through script access that
component and called dot play when
necessary but I don't think that's
be clean so I've come up with a simple
audio manager that I use all the time
I'm of course going to have a link to it
in the description in case you don't
want to code it for yourself but in case
you're interested here's how it's done
so first let's go and create an empty
game object let's reset the transform
and let's call this one Audio Manager
let's drag the game object to the top so
we can always see it let's then hit add
component and we want to add a component
called Audio Manager
it's going to be of type C sharp and
let's say create an app let's double
click it to open it up in visual studio
in the top here we can now delete the
two using tags and instead write using
unity engine dot audio many of the new
audio features in unity are now wrapped
inside of this namespace so it's a good
idea to include it whenever you're
working with sound now the main idea for
this Audio Manager is to have a list of
sounds where we can easily add or remove
sounds as we go and each sound has some
different properties it has an audio
clip a volume and pitch setting the
possibility to loop and you can add
stuff like volume and pitch randomness
or spatial blend then when we start the
game we go through the list and for each
item we add an audio source with the
appropriate settings then we want to
play a sound we simply call a play
method on the audio manager where we
input the name of the sound that we want
to play and the audio manager is then
going to find the source with that name
and play the sound this makes everything
so easy to use so first we need a list
of sounds but we want to control what
data is stored in each sound and so
let's go ahead and create a custom class
called sound to do that we go inside of
unity we go to the project and hit
create c-sharp script and let's call
this one sound women double click it hit
reload all and in here we again want to
be using unity engine dot audio we also
don't want this to derive from mono
behavior and we want to delete the two
methods the first thing we want is a
reference to an audio clip so let's
write public audio clip and it's called
it clip we also want the volume let's
write public slowed volume and the pitch
public slowed pitch now we'll be adding
some more to this as we go but this is
the base of a sound class so if we save
this we can now go into the audio
manager and in here we create a public
sound array and let's call it sounds now
when we save that and go into unity and
have a look under the audio manager we
would expect
list to appear however it does not the
reason why is that whenever we create a
custom class and we want this class to
appear in the inspector we have to mark
it as serializable so right above the
class we make two square brackets and we
write system that's serializable now
when we save and head into unity we can
see that we have a list of sounds let's
add an element and the first element
here has a clip a volume and a pitch now
we can definitely make this more
interesting
first off let's go ahead and add a name
we'll make this a public string name and
we can also add sliders to our volume
and pitch to do that we use the range
attribute where we input a minimum and
maximum value we want our volume to go
between 0 and 1 and we might want our
pitch to go between 0.1 and 3 if we now
save and go into unity we can see it
looks much better let's name this first
element player death and I'm going to
drag in my player death sound now in our
audio manager whenever we start the game
we want to loop through a list and for
each sound add an audio source let's do
this inside of the awake method awake is
pretty much the same as the start method
except it's called right before so we
set up everything in our wake method so
that we can play sounds in the start to
look through our sounds we go for each
sound and we'll call the sound that
we're currently looking at s in our
sounds array we want to go ahead and add
an audio source component we can do that
on our current object or in a child
object for the sake of simplicity let's
just do it
on the current object so we'll go game
object dot add component and the
component we want to add is the audio
source and of course we want to store
this audio source in a variable so that
later when we want to play the sound we
can call the play method on the audio
source the simplest way to do this is
going to our sound class and add a
public audio source and let's call it
source of course we don't want this to
show up in the inspector because it's a
value that we publish automatically in
the awake method and so we can mic this
with an attribute called hide in
inspector so now even though the
variable is public it won't show let's
say that go into the Audio Manager and
now we can set s meaning the sound that
we're currently looking at dot source
equal to that new audio source component
and so we can set s source clip meaning
the clip of a audio source
equal to a star clip and if we want to
control our volume and pitch as well we
can set s that source dot volume equal
to s that volume and s that source dot
pitch equal to s dot pitch so if we save
this now and head into unity and hit
play we see that at the start of our
game and audio source gets added for
each sound in our sounds array and
that's the clip the volume and the pitch
all get copied over let's exit play mode
and let's add a weight to play this
sound to do that we create a new method
let's make this instead of the update
method and this one is going to be
public because we want to be able to
call this method from outside the class
let's call it play and it's going to
take in a string with the name of our
sound then all we have to do is loop
through all of our sounds and find the
sound with the appropriate name we do
that by creating another for each method
and checking the name for each element
or we could go up here and say using
system and this now allows us to find a
sound by going array dot find we want to
find the sound in the sounds array and
we want to find the sound where sound
dot name is equal to the name now this
type of syntax might be a bit new to you
but it allows us to write code hole that
faster when then store the sound that we
found in a variable called s and finally
we can go s dot source dot play of
course this is going to throw an error
if you don't find a sound with your
program name we'll have a look at that
in a second so now our audio manager
should actually work we have a way of
defining the sounds that we want we set
up audio sources for each sound when we
play the game and we have a method that
we can call whenever we want to play a
certain sound so now we can find the
place in our code where we want our
player to die let's go into player and
here I have a script called player
collision under this on collision enter
function
I check if what we hid was a meteor and
if it was we want to go ahead and in the
game and destroy the current game object
this is also why we want to play our
sound of course we need a reference to
audio manager we could create a variable
up here and reference it in the
inspector or since this is only going to
be called a few times we could use find
object of type and the type that we want
to search for is Audio Manager we then
called dot play and then the name of the
sound that we want to play in our case
that's player death so now with a single
line of code that we could put
anywhere in any of our scripts we can
play a sound of our choosing and so we
should hear that when we hit play and if
I manage to collide with something I'll
play a blow us up and we can quickly
expand on this to add some music let's
add another element to our array that's
called this one the theme and I'm going
to drag in my main theme here let's set
the volume to something a bit lower and
make sure the pitch is set to one and we
can play this from anywhere let's just
play it from within our audio manager
let's add a void start method and here
we simply call play and the sound that
we want to play is theme so now when we
hit play we can hear the music playing
of course we want our main theme to loop
to add this option we go into our sound
class and we add a public bowl called
loop then inside of our audio manager
where we set up our different sounds we
go s dot source that loop equals s that
loop and now we have an option for
looping let's go ahead and enable that
and when we now play we can see that our
main theme is set to loop let's see what
happens if we make a typo so if we
accidentally put a cue at the end of
theme this happens more often than you
think if we now hit play it's going to
try and play a sound that is in there so
we get a null reference exception to get
around this we simply check if s is
equal to null and if it is we return and
so we don't try playing a sound that is
in there now when we hit play even
though the name is still spelled wrong
nothing happens and we can even go in
here and add a tiny error message for
ourselves so I'm just throwing out a
warning saying that the sound with this
name wasn't found and now we pretty much
can't break it let's change the name
back here let's have a look at what
happens if we add this to multiple seems
easiest way to do this is make a prefab
out of the audio manager then open up
the other scene in our case theme menu
and drag the audio manager back in the
problem with this however is that if we
hit play and transition to another scene
our music gets cut off and we don't want
our music to restart every time you
change the scene we want our sound to be
unaffected to change this we make the
audio manager persist between scenes
let's go into visual studio let's go to
the top under our wake method let's add
some lines and all we need to do is call
the don't destroy onload method and as
the target we put our
on game object now this also means that
if we currently hit play and transition
to a new scene we actually have two
other managers the one from the first
thing and the one from the second now
that's of course not something we want
so to get around this we create a public
static audio manager and we'll call this
instance this is a static reference to
the current instance of our audio
manager that we have in our team and we
want to make sure that there's only one
instance so we simply go in here and
check if instance is equal to null
meaning that we don't have an audio
manager in our scene well then we set
instance equal to this object if not
meaning that we already have an instance
in our scene we want to remove this
object destroy game object and just to
make sure that no more code is called
before we destroy the object we also hit
return now depending on whether or not
you've worked with singleton patents
before that might be a bit confusing to
you but just know that now when we have
play our audio manager is set under the
don't destroy no scene with a play and
there's still only one audio manager and
you can hear that our music simply
continues that's it for audio managers
that's pretty much it for this video I
