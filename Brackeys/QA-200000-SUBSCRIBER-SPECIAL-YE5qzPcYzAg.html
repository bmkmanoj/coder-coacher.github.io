special Q&amp;amp;A video so I've reached the
200,000 subscriber mark and I'm just so
excited so I want to take this
opportunity to thank you guys so much
for supporting me and making me want to
keep making videos you guys send in a
bunch of questions let's answer them
what's the most important advice that
you want to give to younger developers
that are just starting out probably the
most important advice that I have to
give is for you to find something that
you think it's fun and then just do that
I don't think you should really find a
programming language that will lead you
to the best paying job or necessarily
try and build up skills so you can get
in on this college or whatever I think
the most important thing is work on
something that you have fun working on
and that you want to make and then just
have game development and programming be
kind of the tool that you use to create
that thing that really helps drive you
in your own development and it's
something that I found personally that
when I do that I just learn so much
quicker what car do you have I don't
have a car in fact I don't even have a
driver's license it's pretty normal to
ride a bike in Denmark how do you set
the goals for each coding session you
seem to have a structure that allows you
to do everything so smoothly Thanks
how can I do the same what tips do you
have for planning a session this one I
have something about if you need to
write a big scary module and have a hard
time kind of knowing where to start and
where to end you should really plan
ahead before you actually start coding I
suggest just sitting down with a blank
piece of paper and sketching out what
you want to end up with and kind of
breaking that down into smaller
functions really I think having a good
overview of your code is really up to
creating very small functions that only
do one thing the more you're able to
split your code into small functions the
more you're able to describe what you're
actually doing oh and it also helps that
I always practice my tutorials before
recording now that you have two hundred
thousand subscribers what will you do
with all the money you're in I think
there's a lot of confusion about how
much money youtubers actually earn I can
say for a fact I don't earn a lot of
money in fact I hardly earn enough to
make a living at least off of YouTube
ads having two hundred thousand
subscribers does not mean
a lot of views and definitely not a lot
of ad revenue it's really the best thing
you can do if you want me to keep making
videos is support me on patreon which
you can do it patreon.com slash Brady's
that was pretty smooth when we get to
play an official game made by you do you
sell any of the games you make and if
you sell games where can we buy them
from in fact I don't currently sell any
of my games online really most of what I
create these days are hobby projects or
stuff for tutorials my latest creation
is probably my Ludum dare entry and
that's just a silly thing I made in 48
hours so I wouldn't really have a place
to point you if you want to play one of
my games on Steam or anything like that
can you please make a turn-based
strategy game tutorial I would love to
do some more with strategy based games
I think the tower defence course covers
a lot of the stuff that you're going to
need when creating that kind of game but
if enough of you guys ask for it I'll
definitely see what I can do what was
the proudest moment of your life that's
definitely when I scored that lovely
lady standing behind the camera how is
it to be one of the biggest Danish
youtubers this is actually a pretty fun
question because um I am on some kind of
top list there when it comes to
subscriber count' or something like that
but I always get forgotten in Danish
media I see so many of these out top
Danish youtubers and one of the biggest
Danish youtubers and I just always get
ignored I think people are probably not
so interested in tutorial makers and
really don't see it as a youtuber thing
more as a nerdy thing that they want to
stay away from less in fact the Danish
YouTube award show that I never get
invited to I'm not salty about that at
all what's your cat's name always loved
the surprise appearances I'm glad you
guys like those they are annoying as
heck for me so this is Charley say hi
and this is Molly
she just woke up so this is a good one
how do you get game ideas I would like
to know um if you know how to get game
ideas definitely make a video about it
because I don't have a good answer
really what you should do is just sit
down try and draw something out as quick
as you possibly can just as many ideas
as possible and I think that's the best
way to kind of get your creative side
going what you can also do is think of
games you like and then ways that you
can put
been on that or recreated with your own
personal touch of course I tried to put
some kind of twist in there but it's
also a good exercise just to try and
recreate something some other better
developer did before you so I think
that's pretty much all the questions
we're going to do now I had a lot of fun
and if you want to see more of these Q&amp;amp;A
videos definitely let me know also if
you're just hungry for more questions
and answers you can always check out the
end of each monthly live stream where we
do a live Q&amp;amp;A so thanks for watching and
again thanks for 200,000 subscribers you
guys are awesome I will see you in the
next video thanks to all the awesome
patreon supporters who donated in
December and a special thanks to sultan
