video in our survival game series done
by practice I am the CEO of brackets and
today we are going to take a quick look
at creating materials and textures to
and applying them to objects and also
creating some cool lighting some some
point lights and some glowing effects
and stuff like this and so first of all
go ahead and open up unity it looks
exactly like I did before and I'm going
to go ahead and rename this terrain to
grassy terrain if we're going to have
multiple levels or it's going to persist
of different kind of terrains and first
of all something that annoy me is just
how much green on this terrain has so
let's go ahead and create a road that
leads up to our house so we can go ahead
and select the brushes and then open up
our browser and look for a texture Road
texture and I'm sure that if you search
for Road texture it could be hard to
find something we could try it out
yes that's it's going to look something
like this and we could make it out of
concrete but I want something more like
gravel gravel texture seamless um yeah I
think this actually is pretty good um
could try that out this one it's not bad
either
actually let's get this and try so on
save that and drag it into unity and
once again rename it we're going to
rename this to gravel texture zero one
and we are going to simply select our
terrain also one thing I forgot in our
project page
go down and rename the terrain that lies
here so this is basically the backup
data for the terrain that is in our
scene and let's name this exactly the
same so grassy terrain
now select our terrain in the scene go
to edit textures add texture and then
just drag in our gravel and the size is
going to be let's start out by turn 10
by 10 and add select it and we can then
go ahead and just simply paint it down
so I'll select a brush that is a little
more rough in this it's edges may be
that one and bring the brush size down
something like this and then simply
start painting so it'll just go around
like this and where it ends up with the
mountain might not look that good and
might not look that good either here but
this is basically where I want a small
city or village to be so I'll just make
something like this for now very classic
RPG type game looking something like
this let's go ahead and preview this in
game so I think that the texture is too
big
generally the the textures are too big
so um I guess we'll just leave that and
adjust those later not the best textures
that I've chosen but this just applies
some detail
it's nice alright so I can go ahead and
save this um and let's now look at
creating some textures for the walls so
let's just choose some kind of wooden
walls if we are using maces and swords
you might not have made the lows out of
bricks so let's type plank
extra seamless see if anything comes up
yes this one is not bad looks like
something that could have stood outside
we'll save this and drag it into unity
and you probably know the procedure so
far so I'm playing texture 0-1 also you
don't have to protect your on
interviewing every name it just use your
own system right so on the input
settings looks fine now let's go ahead
and create a new material so the terrain
basically doesn't need it to material it
handles all of this lighting properties
and that itself so but a object ass so
let's hit the that's right right-click
in our assets
it creates material and then call this
planks and drag in our texture the main
color still needs to be white it's going
to be a diffuse texture and then we can
just go ahead and drag it on to our
different walls and something that has
been annoying me a bit is the fact that
these are not actually on the wooden
plate so let's just go ahead and adjust
the transform to make them a little more
precise no need to be perfect again this
should be done in all the applications
I'm just showing you how to do this
especially the modeling part the
texturing can be done in unity just
using seamless but come on guys I'm sure
you can figure something out
alright so on this looks better if we go
ahead and preview it in
game I can see that we might want a tile
these one more time so this is done by
selecting the material and go on the
tiling and then hitting - - let's try
that yeah this looks better actually
maybe two or three - so tiles one extra
down the middle I think this this looks
good kind of a high-res texture so I'm
one thing I want to change now is that
this is just a diffuse shader I want to
apply some more lighting detail you know
needs for you to do this but at some
point I think we should go into normal
mapping and bump mapping and all these
different kind of kinds of techniques so
if you are way ahead you can go ahead
and download crazy bump and fit see if
you can figure it out yourself but for
now let's create a model that can act as
our lights so our lamp so let's go ahead
and go on the game object create other
and then hitting this view and serves of
zero bringing it up a bit
hitting f2 zoom in game object create
other and then cylinder scaling it down
this is a mount on the wall so this will
act as a mount and scale it down create
yet another game object this is going to
be a cube drag it down scale it down
make it longer this is actually the part
that is going to be mounted on the wall
and bigger on some axis scale it down to
look like plank
there you go this is pretty decent not
amazing but it'll do for now so this is
all lamp like we can mount on our wall
so we can go ahead and rename the sphere
to lamp and we can go ahead and make
this on mounts you know what lamp
mount drag that on the lamp and we can
select our cylinder and do lamp mount
mounts do a lamp cylinder this is fine
and just drag it on the lam box so now
we can go ahead and position it on the
wall there and I want to bring it up
might be too big and general so just
scale it down then general overall and
so that's and that is on the wall and
you can adjust all you want I'm gonna
leave it at this and so I'm going to
select different pots and give them
different kinds of materials and
textures so the light itself the bulb
itself which is pretty huge here it's
going to have a glowing material the
lamps cylinder is going to have yet
another material and the lamp mount is
going to have a third material so I
think that the lamp mild we could
probably just apply planks to that one
and it will look alright remember the
tiling is different so if I apply this
and go ahead and change the tiling it
will affect both of them so just keep
that in mind that you have to create
multiple materials if you want different
tiling properties so let's go ahead and
right click and create yet another
material and this one is going to be
called just a gray
now dark gray or gray dark if you want
to do it that way and just the main
color just drag this down to it almost
black and they go so that's it for the
amount what I'm going to scale this
mount down this cylinder there this is
picture so that looks better and now
let's go ahead and create the the
glowing so right click new material call
this glow and there are not really any
wonderful ways to make an object glow in
unity without spending some money on a
plugin so I'm just going to show you one
of the ones that I use it could be
self-illuminated or unlit whatever you
think I like the unlit transparent to
drag that on on there and you can have a
texture over it maybe the
self-illuminated diffuse you can go in
and you can you can change the color of
the light and make some illuminated and
even make the light mapper itself emits
but play around with these again that's
not really an awesome way to do it
maybe the self illuminator I'm pretty
sure that one of these actually have a
transparent mode that you could do the
reflective to make it reflect the whole
environment so so just play with it you
might find something you like at the end
you could also do stuff like under
particles you can do additive
materials this will only work though if
you also apply a texture of course it
shouldn't be this texture but something
in that order and but okay for now I'll
just go ahead and change this to
self-illuminated diffuse and make the
color a orange white ish so that looks
alright I'll go ahead and drag out these
two objects so I can scale it down a bit
it might be too huge anyway and then
just drag them back in so yeah this is
better now let's go ahead and actually
create what will emit the light so go to
game object and create other and then
choose the point light and you can see
that it already looks much better this
will just be centered in the middle of
our sphere and we can go ahead and
adjust some of the settings maybe if we
select it and the the light it's that
one and drag it under our lamp you can
call this lamp light and we can go ahead
and play around with some of the
settings so make it more orange bump up
the range to maybe 30 20 30 do 30 and
then down the intensity of the light
something you like you know what I'll
I'll keep this is 0.5 so I'm this
already looks pretty good if you want it
to look like it's glowing a little bit
more you can do something that this
called haloing so we could go ahead and
hit the component and then go to
rendering and hit the
well instead the Skyhawks flare clusion
maybe miscellaneous well I'm not sure
now also it's under effect and then
hallo and if we go ahead and adjust it
so I've put it this on the lamp itself
so if we go ahead and change the size of
it you can see what it's actually about
so it creates this very soft object
around the object itself so if you just
make this a tiny bit bakery then the
glowing fee itself so something like 0.5
and then change the color to maybe
something brighter I don't know for sure
make it more orange low then we can
actually make something that looks like
it grow a close little bit it's not
perfect but it it will do the job so
there you have it and this light is
dynamic dynamic so should you choose to
make it rigid body and fall around the
scene or animate it
everything will animate with it will not
do light mapping just yet that's how you
create some textures apply them to
objects materials and glowing effects I
hope you enjoyed this tutorial and go
ahead and visit our website you can play
some of our games and soon you can
download the scripts that I type in the
videos and some of the assets that I
create so you don't have to create
everything yourself you don't want to or
you can just generally buy me a
cup of coffee and finale models and
scripts are free you can donate if you
want to all the money goes to something
like this it goes to new sound gear more
and more plugins maybe I could do some
tutorials I mean is a Perl once I get
the money so on but you don't have to
you can just keep on watching for free I
enjoy making these and it makes me happy
if if you can learn something from it so
on thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
