with a lot of exciting news we were
really fortunate to be part of the
conference special thanks to unity for
inviting us we really had a great time
now during GDC we got to see previews of
a bunch of upcoming unity features and a
lot of them actually really surprised me
so in this video we'll have a look at
what's coming to unity in 2018 so things
kicked off with the Unity keynote after
the opening speech from John Riccitiello
it went right into machine learning here
we got to see a cool demo of how you can
use machine learning to teach the AI in
a racing game how to steer by simply
getting a human to play the game which
we can see on the left the AI will
slowly pick up on how to navigate
through the level as seen on the right
normally you would have to program all
this behavior by hand which is not only
time consuming but often leads to very
unnatural and robotic feeling AI next up
we got a quick overview of the release
scheduled for 2018 unit is planning
three major releases which you can see
here 2018 point one is mostly focused on
artists and rendering capability as
we've already seen with the announcement
of shader graph and SRP according to
unity they want to keep working on these
two themes for the remaining year in
2018 point two we can expect to see a
bunch of new features like a vector
graphics importer 2d character animation
as well as new asset bundle tools and it
was already at this point in the
presentation that I fell off my chair
never ever had I thought this would
happen it felt like my entire life had
been leading up to this moment let me
give you a hint that's right it's
finally
ready three two one
all right that's that's not it but we
have nested prefabs now so those of you
who aren't in on the joke unity has been
promising nested prefabs for a really
long time without getting into too much
detail nested prefabs really expand on
the usefulness of prefabs by allowing us
to parent prefabs to each other we'll
definitely make a video on this once we
know more from here they went on to talk
about the new rendering features most of
this had already been announced but
still they showed some really impressive
stuff from the Book of the Dead demo
using the HD render pipeline mostly what
caught my eye was support for really
high in rendering features like
subsurface scattering real time area
lights and volumetric sky occlusion and
the most insane thing was that
everything was running on a Playstation
4 Pro pretty crazy the presentation then
moved on to a tiny demo of shader graph
and find the Yoakum jammed on stage to
talk a bit about performance and the
future of programming in unity most
importantly he announced that the entity
component system is now available in
preview which is definitely exciting and
at this point I thought well that was in
the keynote got wrapped up everybody
went home but just the morning after
there was a talk on the Unity 2018
roadmap and holy wow did they announce a
lot of new features first of all Andrew
showed off some demo footage of the 2d
character animation and support for
vector graphics he also talked about
sprite shape which is a new tool for
creating spline based layouts and levels
in 2d he then went on to text mesh Crowe
which will be more tightly integrated
with the editor timeline is getting some
tools for faster editing cinema Sheen is
getting a storyboard feature to quickly
test out ideas by overlaying references
and sketches and just as I thought he
was running out of stuff prime new node
based video effects editor now we don't
know a lot about this yet but I'm just
really excited about this one
and finally the terrain system is also
getting an update again we don't know
much yet but apparently it's getting a
UI overhaul with better brush painting
as well as a performance boost something
that is definitely needed
at this point also to those of you who
don't know unity is working on a new
launcher called unity hub it's currently
available in preview and will definitely
be a nice addition especially to those
who are working with multiple versions
of unity and that's pretty much all we
had to cover for this video I would love
to hear what feature you guys the most
excited about for 2018 on that thanks
for watching and I will see you in the
next video thanks to have the awesome
patreon supporters who donated in March
and a special thanks to Patrick McKinley
