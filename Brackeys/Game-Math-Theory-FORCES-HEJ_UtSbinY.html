one and welcome to this episode of game
math theory today we'll be exploring the
branch of applied mathematics that is
referred to as dynamics which fast means
the study of forces we'll be looking at
how you can apply forces to an object in
order to make it move and we'll use
these techniques to create a simulation
of the effects of gravity in space so
what's a force forces can be described
as a push or a pull on an object let's
say we have a friend called tom tom is
standing on the railroad track and in
front of him is a cart as tom begins to
push the cart he's applying a force
which makes the car move forwards how
far the cab moves is determined by how
hard Tom pushes meaning the magnitude of
the force and at the same time by how
heavy the card is meaning the mass of
the cart but how do we describe this
mathematically well luckily we aren't
the first ones to ask that question in
fact it was already in the middle of the
1600s that a clever Englishman started
to wonder about it the name of the
curious guy was Isaac Newton and in 1686
he presented his three laws of motion
the answer lies within the second law it
states that acceleration which is a
change in velocity is produced when a
force acts on a mass the greater the
mass of the object the greater the
amount of force needed to accelerate it
I simply putted acceleration equals
force over mass so let's say that Tom
pushes the cart with a force of 400 M
the end here stands for Newton and is
the standard measurement for force let's
also imagine that the card has a mass of
50 kilos the resulting acceleration of
the cart not counting any friction from
the wheels would then be 400 n divided
by 50 kilos which after a bit of
trickery with the units gives 8 meters
per second squared it can be hard to
visualize what in effect such an
acceleration has on the cart so let's
instead figure out the speed of the cart
and how fired has moved after a certain
amount of seconds if Tom keeps pushing
the cart with the same force it will
slowly increase in speed we say that
velocity equals acceleration multiplied
with time so after pushing the cart for
one second it will move at a speed of 8
meters per second squared multiplied
with one second which is equal to 8
meters per second if we show the speed
over time on a graph we can see that it
increases linearly as Tom pushes the
cart we can also get the distance that
the cart moves we say that distance
equals how
the acceleration multiplied with x
squared so after one second
the cap will have moved 1/2 times 8
meters per second squared times 1 second
squared which is equal to 4 meters again
we can show this on a graph to see that
the cart moves further away at an
increasing rate but what happens if
multiple forces are acting on an object
in our example another friend shows up
called Duane Duane works out and is able
to push at a greater fast and Tom
because Duane pushes in the opposite
direction
he will overwhelm Tom and push the cart
back we say that the resulting force on
an object is the sum of all the acting
forces so in our case we have two acting
forces the push of Tom and Duane and the
resulting forces the push of Tom which
is 400 Newton plus the push of Duane
let's say that 600 Newton but because
Duane is pushing in the negative
direction the resulting force becomes
400 Newton minus 600 Newton which is
equal to negative 200 Newton and so the
acceleration of the cart is negative 4
meters per second squared
making the card move backwards one of
the most interesting things to study
when it comes to forces is because
unlike Duane pushing a cart gravity
cannot be seen and yet it is constantly
affecting the world around us in fact
gravity is a force that act between all
objects that means that when earth pulls
Duane down he's actually creating an
equally large pull on the earth but
because the earth has a much bigger mass
it doesn't move much again thanks to
Newton we can describe the magnitude of
the force that acts on two objects all
we need to know is the mass of the
objects that are attracting each other
and the distance between them so let's
say that two bowling balls are floating
in space it's probably the weirdest
thing I've said today I mean what are
they even doing there at the space
monkeys bowling let's say that the mass
of the first ball is 1 kilo and the mass
of the second ball is 2 kilos and that's
exactly one meter between the center of
each ball we can then calculate the
force that we should apply to each
object as the mass of the first ball
multiplied with the mass of the second
ball divided by the distance squared we
also need to multiply with the
gravitational constant which is
basically just a very small number that
helps sort out the units so if we
calculate this out we can see that our
two bowling balls will attract each
other with a force of 1.33 multiplied
with 10 to the power of negative 10
Newtons
this might seem as an extraordinarily
small
number and it definitely is but remember
that it will drastically increase as the
objects move closer to each other and
try to imagine just how large this
number gets when the object size
heaviest moons or planets so how do we
use this information to simulate the
effects of gravity acting on several
objects in space well we simply keep a
list of all the objects in the scene
then each frame we loop through the list
and for each object we will apply a
force to all other objects and calculate
the magnitude of each force using the
formula
we can then use our knowledge from
earlier to move each object according to
the forces acting on it and the result
should look something like this if you
want to play around with it yourself
there will be a link to the source code
in the description that's pretty much
all I have to show for this video if
you're interested in learning more about
dynamics there's a link for that in the
description as well I hope you enjoyed
