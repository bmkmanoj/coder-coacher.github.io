welcome to the third video covering the
all new unity GUI system introduced with
unity 4.6 so unity 4.6 is still in a
public beta so to download it please
just head over to unity 3d 3d comm and
you can download it there also if you
have any questions throughout this video
please just visit from brackish comm and
ask a question here I among many other
developers are just waiting to to answer
your questions
cool so the topic of today's video is
just going to expand a bit on what we
did last so last video was pretty short
and hopefully this one is going to be
too we took a look at making our buttons
actually do something whenever we press
them and today we're simply going to do
the same but with sliders so how we can
set up sliders to interact with our
gameplay elements so as always I've
opened up unity and I've created a very
basic scene here we simply have a main
camera with the background then we have
a a cube just a simple standard unity
cube and then we have a button which we
set up in the last video and now I've
also created a slider and I've basically
just led this slider B as is I've just
scaled it a bit and change the color of
some of the elements just to make it fit
but other than that it's completely from
fresh I mean nothing has changed here so
what we're going to do is on my cube
I've created a script called rotate cube
and it has a public variable called
speed which is currently set to 30 so
when we press play right now
you can see that this cube rotates
around the y-axis
and if we go ahead and and double click
on the rotate cube script here to
inspect it I can show you just how
simple this functionality actually is so
I've created a public float called speed
and I've just defaulted it to ten I've
set it to 30 in the inspector then
inside of the update function I simply
used to transform that rotate to rotate
it around its local y-axis dependent on
the speed and then I multiplied with
time that Delta time so that it's not
going to be framerate dependent but what
we are going to do is we're going to
make our slider control the speed that
it and that it rotates with so in order
to do this we're going to make a public
void so a public function that doesn't
return anything and let's call this
adjust speed and this is going to take a
sum just a single argument and we're
just going to call this let's see this
is already speed so let's just call this
new speed and make sure to set this as a
type of float so we're going to make a
float called new speed and then we're
simply going to open up the function
here and inside of this we're simply
going to set our speed variable to be
equal to new speed and that's all we
have to do inside of our script so
simply save this now we can head into
the canvas we can select our slider we
can go down here to the on value changed
single you can see that the list is
currently empty so let's hit the plus
sign let's select the object so I'm just
going to find the cube there it is so
once we've selected our cube we can go
ahead and select a function on that cube
and you will notice that it has both a
game object category the transform
component has a bunch of things so
that's the mesophyll do the box Collider
and the mesh renderer but it also has
our newly created script code rotate
cube and once we dig on
this you can see that it has some
different static parameters that we can
change but it also has a dynamic float
called adjust speed so once we select
this it's actually going to work just
like that now it's going to input the
value of the slider into this new speed
variable and then it's going to set the
speed to that new float so if we would
play right now you will see that this is
working
but it's rotating extremely slowly it's
simply going between 0 and 1 and that's
not really something we want so in order
to change this let's set the max value
to maybe 200 just for fun and the
minimum value we're just going to keep
that as at 0 but right now our default
value is set to 1 so in order to change
this we're just going to use the slider
to change our default value and I'm just
going to default this to 30 as I did
before so now when we hit play you can
see that it rotates as before but we can
now control the speed that it rotates
with using this slider and that's super
fun so you could of course also go
negative 200 here if you wanted it to
rotate in the opposite direction you can
see that our slider changes accordingly
and now we can rotate in both directions
so that's the basics of editing scripts
or editing values based on a normal UI
slider it's simply that easy and in here
we can of course do all kinds of
different stuff we can change the color
of objects we can change the loudness of
music whatever you want to do simply
using this basic formula with a public
function a name your input a float take
a float as an argument and then you do
something based on that float so that
was basically it for this video I
actually managed to keep it have pretty
short so let's say a record almost so
thanks for watching today's video and
I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
