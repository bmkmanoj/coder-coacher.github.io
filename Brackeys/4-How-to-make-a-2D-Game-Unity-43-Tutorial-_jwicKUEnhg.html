welcome to the fourth episode in going
to d today we will be taking a look at
making our ball and make a jump around
the screen so but before we go ahead and
get started I just want to quickly plug
a couple of wallpapers I made you can
see the first one on my desktop here and
then also just a brackets logo wallpaper
a lot of people requested me to make
some some wallpapers so I thought I
would go ahead and do it so you can get
them at brackish comm slash wallpapers
that's a secret URL so just type it
directly in there and you can download
the zip file in HD cold so let's always
as always open up a unity and what we're
going to go ahead and do first is we're
going to import the sprite that will be
our ball so if I just quickly minimize
this go into the 2d assets pack again
available at break is calm and under the
pong game under individual sprites we
have the ball so let's just drag that on
to unity and release it in the project
pane and now when we select it here we
can see that all of the settings are
already set up like we want them to so
now we can just go ahead and drag our
ball into the scene view I'm just going
to drag it pretty much in the center
here and what we can do is we can first
off add some components so the first
thing we want to add is the physics 2d
circle Collider and so we will just
scale it down by adjusting the radius to
something like 0.23 that looks pretty
good and when we play the game now the
ball is just static we wanted to
actually act in physics space so let's
hit add component physics 2d and add a
rigidbody 2d which will allow us to make
it actually jump around so now when we
hit play we can see that it falls and it
just sits there so basically what we
want to do is first off we want to
to be set to fixed angle we are going to
kill the angular drag set that to zero
the gravity we are going to kill that in
a sec also but first off let's set the
mass to zero point one just because we
don't really want the mass to have an
effect on anything then what we're going
to do is we're going to go down here in
the project pane and we're going to
create a physics 2d material and we are
going to call this a ball bounce and
what this will do is it will allow us to
adjust some properties for how this ball
will act in physics space so basically
we can kill off its friction so that it
won't be affected by basically it won't
slow down is what it's going to altom
utley mean and then we're going to set
the bounciness to one so that it will
bounce off everything it hits and now
when we hit play we should oh yeah we
need to apply it first so select the
ball drag on the ball bounce under the
material under the circle Collider and
now hit play and we can see the ball
bouncing just beautifully if you want to
know more about collision and rigid
bodies and physics materials you can go
ahead and watch the mastering collision
tutorial I made a while ago cool so what
we can do now is we can just turn off
the gravity scale so set that to zero
and I think we are ready to create our
ball script so let's just go ahead and
rename ah no actually let's just make
the script sit on the bowl and then we
can handle spawning it through the GM
object and yeah so let's just start out
by making a ball script so let's select
the ball hit new script and call this
ball control and create an ad let's
double click it to open it up in
monodevelop
here it is and let me zoom in so you can
see this better
so we can no actually let's keep the
function update because we're just going
to rename it so in the function stat we
first off want to start the ball we
wanted to start traveling in a random
direction so if you have played
old-school pong you will notice that
once the game starts it shoots out to a
random side so what we can do now is we
can use a random number to affect which
side it goes goes to so we can use for
example random dot range there are a lot
of random things we can call in here so
we can use random range and this will
make a float object or a float value
between the minimum and maximum values
you you put in so if we do like zero and
just suit let's just two zero zero and
one we can say that if actually let's
make this into a variable sorry I'm
going so variable and then random number
equals random range zero to one and then
we can go in here in an if statement and
say if random number is a less than or
equal to 0.5 then we wanted to shoot out
in one direction so debug that lock
shoot right and if it's not so else oops
debug Tadlock shoot left so now when we
play this we should see that it randomly
chooses a number or a direction to shoot
so right now we've only gotten shoot
right but in a sec if we keep on playing
this we should get shoot left to appear
also let's see if we can get you left to
appear some reason this is not working
so if it's less than or equal to 0.5 do
we need this to be 2 that would be weird
there was left and right and left and
left well it looks like we need this to
be too yeah that's something about that
actually random deranged can confuse you
sometimes but ok it works now so let's
just go with this it's really not that
important it's just so it doesn't suit
out to the same exact side every time so
in here we're just going to put
rigidbody 2d dot add force and then this
needs a vector two so a vector 2 is just
a variable storing two coordinates the X
and the y so we're going to do new
vector2 and inside of this we are just
going to do something like maybe 80 and
10 this is just an estimate you could
make variables for these so you can
adjust them inside of unity but I think
this is going to be just fine and let's
just duplicate the same line down here
and then make the 82 into a minus 80 and
the 10 into 8 minus 10 and of course you
could make even more if statements you
can make a switch so that there are more
outcomes or you could just use the
random that range directly to access the
force but again it just gets to come
we just want this working right so let's
save this and hit play and we can see
that our ball shoots out so it's acting
just how we want it to and yeah things
are looking great but we have a problem
and that is that the ball is currently
very very predictable because in some
pong variations if I if you move upwards
while colliding with the ball you will
change the the direction of the ball
just a bit but right now it doesn't
matter which way we are moving the ball
will jump the same no matter what and so
these patterns that are very easy to
predict will start appearing so I think
we should go ahead and change that and
it's it's pretty much a decision whether
or not you want to do it but I think it
makes it a little more fun so let's go
ahead and do function on coalition enter
to D and this will get cold whenever we
collide with something it will that is
2-dimensional it will get cold one time
and what we want to do is in here we
want to pass some variables so we want
to basically store some information
about the coalition and we could call
this the cold the cold info let's
actually call it call info for Collider
information and it's going to be a type
collision 2d remember to the put a 2d
there or you will get an error cool so
what we can do now is we can first off
check that we have hit the player so
let's do if call info dot collider the
one we collide with the tag is equal to
player
then we want something to happen so
let's just do a debug that lock it's
working and then exit out of this and we
will go into unity and we will remember
this time to select both our players or
you can select the prefab in the project
pane so this is actually pretty handy
because if we were to select let's see
our player - and then change its its tag
and hit apply we would also apply the
move up and down keys and that's not
something we want so instead we can go
into the prefab in the project pane and
change the values here and they will
both automatically update so for the tag
will select the prefab go to tag select
player it will automatically be there if
not you can go ahead and hit add tag and
you can just type it in there and then
afterwards selected great so let's hit
play now and once it hits our player we
get to see it's working in the console
so that's just perfect but you might
notice that once our ball hits our
players they get pushed so to change
this we can go ahead and select again
our player prefab and we can just bump
up the mass quite a bit and this is an
easy solution but one thing we would
want to do also is go under the player
controls and we are going to lock in our
precision we can also go under the
normal E and when when it comes to rigid
bodies you have some constraints as to
where you want them to move but it's not
in the 2d rigid bodies yet so instead we
are going to open up the player control
script here and then in the function
update we simply want to set the the X
velocity to zero so we just do rigidbody
2d
that velocity dot x equals zero and this
will mean that our okay so this will
mean that our players will stay in place
so now when the ball hits they do
nothing they move a tiny tiny tiny bit
but then they the next frame that will
just snap into place again so it really
doesn't matter cool so we're worried
that's our ball is moving and it's
colliding and everything is great okay
so we wanted to be affected by velocity
so instead of the it's working statement
let's go ahead and type var velocity y
are just well I because this is the name
of the variable and this is going to be
equal to rigidbody2d dot velocity dot y
so I just want to store it as a variable
so you can easily access it then we're
going to do well I so the Y velocity of
the rigid body of our ball is going to
be equal to and here we could just set
it directly to the velocity of the
player but I didn't really I don't
really think that was that great so
instead I did this to make a mix out of
the two so I mix in the velocity of the
ball and mix in the velocity of the
player and I think this is working
pretty great so what I did was I took
half the velocity of the Y and plus the
Collider dot Collider or not to collide
I mean Collider info dot Collider done
rigidbody2d dot velocity Todd why okay
and divide that by three so half the
velocity y plus the third of the
velocity of the player I found that to
be a pretty great match and now if we
hit save and go back into unity
you will notice that we can affect the
velocity of the ball by moving up and
down so if I can just get to wake so if
I stay still and don't really move the
ball should slowly cancel out its
velocity so if we can get this to slowly
just it's just working actually I don't
think this is working okay so I'll just
go ahead and quickly turn off the
recording and I'll see you in a second
okay so I'm back I'm sorry for the
smaller confusion there and of course as
always when you look through code you
suddenly just find something that is
insanely stupid and I did something
insanely stupid so basically what I did
was I made a new variable which had just
declared as a float value and then I
just changed that and the rigidbody 2d
that velocity didn't really update so we
basically just changed this value and
not the value we actually wanted to
change there are a couple of ways to
solve this the easiest of which is just
to forget this variable declaration copy
the rigidbody 2d de velocidad y in place
of the velocity the Y here and then just
delete this and now everything should be
working and we can also Tilly tower
debug that large statement so now when
we go ahead and hit play we should see
that if we don't move at all yet the the
y movement of the boyle Kansas's cancels
out but if we then give it some momentum
you can see that we can affect the
traveling direction so this is great
because it it's small like the modified
version of pong which I really like and
it makes the game a lot more exciting
because you can actually try to score
score goals cool so right now you will
notice that when we hit the left and
right walls nothing happens so I guess
that's going to be the objective for
next time so
we're going to handle scoring yay so
thanks for watching and I'll see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
