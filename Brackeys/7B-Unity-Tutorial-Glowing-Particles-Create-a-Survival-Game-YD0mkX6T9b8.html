seventh episode in our survival game
series Dunbar brackets I am the CEO of
practice and now we are going to take a
look at creating the particles all right
so if you open up unity I have already
done this and this is the same session
and you double-click on the import
folder or no I'm sorry
back to assets under the prefabs what
we're going to going to be creating is a
magical sword so I start with some kind
of buff on it some kind of spell on it
you could do this with fire you could do
this with ice buffs you can do it with
mystical powers different stuff swirl
swirling around you can do a lot of
stuff but start by dragging in dragging
it into the scene so here it is and I've
set it up correctly and I just need to
add some kind of extra graphical element
because I think that this by itself is
pretty boring so if you want the game to
be completely realistic you don't need
to do this you could make something like
a torch with file on it you could make a
flamethrower you can make everything you
want and if you don't know how to code
something you can just write to me at
YouTube Facebook or Twitter and I'll be
answering questions and maybe even cover
it in a video ok so now that we have
this sword let's just position it where
it needs to be within the player main
camera melee just to be able to see it
and view it in the game view also so we
can just drag this under our mace or the
weapon that you have currently put it
put selected
and then just throw out the transform
just to get it there and then drag it
out under the melee and just click this
little button which will disable the
maze and now you can just go ahead and
drag it down and rotate it accordingly
this just needs to be like 90 and so now
you have a sort that looks alright in
the game view and we could go ahead and
do some stuff with it so simply go to
game object in the top create other and
then hit the particle system now you're
going to go ahead and drag this on this
sword and if we make the game view a
little bit smaller just so we can still
view the sword you can see all kinds of
particles racing to the top rising and
this does not look like anything we want
but alright so we need to start tweaking
some settings so if we start by renaming
this - we could do sort particles or if
you have an idea of what kind of
particles you could type sword fire or
particles fire whatever you want I'll
just - sword particles and on the right
hand side you can now see all the
different variables that we're going to
tweak oh my god that's a lot
I recommend that you play around with
this yourself to get the desired effect
though we are going to take a look at
quite a few things ok so first of all we
want the duration to be yes we could do
about five this doesn't really match you
because because it's looping if you want
something only to happen in like like
instantly or in two seconds one second
you can just check uncheck just looping
and it will be just like an explosion so
I can show you if I uncheck this and
stop and then hit simulate it
it simply creates particles for one
second and then continue on okay
so I'll change this back to five hit the
looping and now I'll go down to the
shape and I simply want this to only
emit from the blade of the sword and now
it's emitting on a in a cone so this is
not what I want I want to change this to
box and sorry change this to a box and
this box is way too huge so I want to
just trick these variables down
something a little better watch out by
hitting with hit hitting F though as I
just said because they will zoom out so
you can see every particle so you might
just while you're editing editing this
hit the stop simulating button um this
could be easier for you right so the
width looks alright I might change it
down even more to point zero zero two
two zero no point zero to a one
let's go with two it's good to make it a
little wider the why okay so the axis
might get screwed off because this is a
little cool and if you can also just go
ahead and drag on the particle system
itself
if you think that typing in the
variables is confusing so if this helps
you out you can just go ahead and do
that and of course position it in the
scene itself to get it right so this
looks pretty promising and about that
white again a little wider than you
actually then than what the sword is and
then drag it down and one thing that you
should notice now okay let's just make
it a little
do before you go preaching on like that
this actually fit pretty perfect on to
the plate
one thing though this is fine that if
you want the particles to be like
stationary so let me show you what I
mean by this
so if I go ahead and just change the
size of the particles to 0.1 and this is
an old right size and then I go ahead
and change the speed to something really
small like 0.01 you can see that now the
particles are almost stationary I don't
think that this is pretty boring but so
I want to make them go up just like fire
though when I change the speed to let's
say 0.2 this looks pretty natural
maybe 0.1 then the particles start
simply collecting here so there are a
lot of particles clouding together here
and down here we are missing quite a few
so what I would simply do even though
this seems a little illogical I would
drag this down to make it really small
and then just simply drag the whole
system down to just the root off the
weapon and now we can increase the speed
on the lifetime as we want it so I would
increase this to about there and now we
have a much cooler looking effect so now
that now that we have done this I would
go ahead and maybe tweak some emission
you could go ahead and make it emit more
particles or fewer
but I think that Tenace may be alright
you can also apply gravity so you can
make them go up and then down
so you could say that they need to
simply go up at first and then fall down
like a waterfall you can do a lot of
different stuff it's really really a
cool tool to tweak stuff out with it
just take what did I screw up here so
the size the speed needs to be about two
point five three four let's just make
five all right so right now that you've
probably noticed that when they spawn
down here they don't fade in they just
spawn and also they just disappear up
here and I think that this effect is
pretty ugly so let's change this and we
do that by checking down here the color
by speed so enable this and then you can
just uncollapse it and then you can hit
the color function here and now you get
what is called the gradient editor and
this is basic if you're never seen a
gradient editor before this is the
beginning of the particles lifetime and
this is the end so it's basically just
like a time line just with color and
opacity so how much what kind of color
is it and how well can you see through
it so um let's start out by making it
all kinds of red and then going to the
end and making it more like a orange
type feel and it's an orange something
like this and it's not changing too much
no so I might go ahead and make this a
little less red though it's it's
changing everything
this is pretty weird actually
this should oh this is PI speed so
uncheck the color by speed and then
check the color over lifetime now we get
the right gradient so start by making it
look red and then changing it to orange
something like this this is much better
and maybe a little wider you can little
more right this looks alright I guess
and now you could go ahead and click on
the little keyframes above and this is
the Alpha this is the opacity this is
how well you can see through so if we
just drag this all the way down it will
be simply fading out and I guess we want
that and if we go ahead and drag the
alpha over here so we can determine when
it will start to fade out we could say
about already here because then we can
make a new one and make it fade in also
so drag that alpha all the way down so
now it fades and fades we could also
make one more here that is not at all
transparent so we have this curve and
then we can suddenly start to see how
massive the color is and then it fades
away but play around with this together
look looking like you want it to I think
this is pretty cool maybe the red is a
little bit too much so we can start
changing that just makes meet a few
keyframes too much something like well I
guess we'll just leave it at this for
now okay so um one thing though right
now the particles don't look that shiny
and I don't really like the effect of
them so what we're going to do is we're
going to make a new material and a
material is basically
it's it's what stores a texture and a
shader so this might not make that much
sense but if I go into paint an object
has several things that makes it that
makes it able to be rendered in a scene
so if we have assembly a sphere or a box
that we want to have rendered in the
scene this is our sphere that we want to
be rendered in order for this to be
rendered it needs quite a few things
first of all it needs to have what it
has here this is simply just an outline
this is the mesh this is the model so we
need to need to have a few lines that
simply determine where the computer
should draw surfaces so it needs this
outline this wireframe and in a box it
would look something like this if you
have ever seen a 3d cube before so
something like this so this is just what
determines where it needs to draw face
as well that's Pat and like this with
all the extra lines so and once you have
that once you have shaped that or have
done a complete program to shape that
for you you need what is called a
material and the materials store
different things so by default a
material it's just a color it could be
black it could be gray it could be wide
it could be red so if we have the color
red this is the color red in our
material it also needs to store other
stuff it starts stock
stuff like a texture and a shader and a
texture is not just a coloring this if
this is if you want more than just one
color on a an object this is the detail
this could be an image so basically if
we want it to make a wooden plank first
of all we would have the lines that make
out the plank
like this this could create a fence so
if you had several of these this could
create a fence but first of all you
would model it out like this then the
computer would start drawing the
surfaces using this material so this
would make it red if we didn't want it
to be completely red though we could
apply a texture which is a image an
image so this could be a bunch of detail
this could be um so you have all these
lines on it and you have holes in it
what looks like holes and different
colors and this enables it to be a whole
lot more advanced and once you have
applied the texture it also needs a
shader and the shader sounds more
complex than it really is the definition
of a shader is how an object interacts
with light and its environment this is
simply how the object reflects and
handles lighting so simply to put it
symbol this could determine whether or
not the object is transparent
transparent so this of course wouldn't
be but a window would have a transparent
shader and some shaders can emit light
so if you have a light bulb you want a
light emitting shader some things is are
reflective what's called a Blin is a
reflective shader or you can have
specular
on the the objects this is a specular
shader and you can have what's called a
Lambert or in unity I forget what it's
called I think yes it diffuse material a
diffuse shader so this won't create any
specular and this is typically what you
would use with stuff like planks so
that's basically what a material is so
this might sound complicating a
complicated but it's really not so if we
hit down save then then right-click and
hit create and then open up and then
material and we could go ahead and just
to simplify this we could call this
maybe wall texture and we could over
here we'd choose the shader so if this
needs to be the wall shader it should
probably be diffuse because we nearly
want it to be transparent emitting light
or noise having specular so we could
choose a color and maybe we should
choose a brownish color and then we
could just drag this onto the wall and
maybe even select the wall and you can
now see that this is the material that
it's using but right now this doesn't
look at that awesome so we could go on
to the Internet and then just search for
wall texture seamless and this just
means that we can um that just a moment
I'll just check that we can tile the
texture inside of unity but you could go
ahead and save this and and this is just
demonstrative purposes you can go ahead
and save this and drag it into unity as
an image file and then just drag it on
here as a texture you can see that now
it has texture data applied to it and we
can now make the color white to make the
texture look nice and we can then
determine a
chairman how the texture will tile
inside of unity but this is how you do
this this is how you handle stuff like
this so we would want it to probably
look something like this
so it's child and three times on this
axis and only one time on the other we
could also do like six here and two here
to make it look even better and this is
how you apply detail but we'll be going
over this later so for now I'll just go
ahead and sorry my phone is ringing and
just go for now we'll just go ahead and
make this and just delete the the
material and the texture here and you
can see that it turns purple and it just
does this when it doesn't have a
material applied to it so that we can
easily see that it has hasn't got one so
for now we'll we can just use a default
shader or material so act come on to the
mesh renderer materials you can click
this to add someone and we can just use
the default diffuse all right
so that's that was a quick walkthrough
of what a material is right now we need
something that looks glowing so right
click create and then material and then
you can call this for additive or
glowing and we can go ahead and change
the shader type through a particle and
then additive soft and this will just
make it look like it's shining a little
bit more and you can play around with
this if it's isn't working for you and
then choose the default particles
texture you can see now that it has this
very kind of look and we can now go back
into the sort particles and then down at
the button right sets renderer we can
select the material the new material
that we've made the additive one you can
see that the the particles
smaller you know but they look better I
think at least so we can go ahead and
once again increase the size of the
particles I'll increase this to 0.2 and
actually for now I'm pretty satisfied
with how this sword is looking so we
could go ahead and hit play maybe even
maximize it and OH
as you can see just when we play it and
you can see the particles slowly start
emitting if you just want it to be
glowing and when you start the game you
can go to the sword particles and then
hit the pre-warm so now when you start
the game it'll start out with the with
particles all the way to the top but I
think that this is looking pretty cool
actually
one thing though if you're creating
something like a flamethrower and you
would go ahead and check off the the
simulation spaces you would check this
to weld
instead of local and this means that if
you lick in the scene view when ever
remove the particles doesn't move with
us and this looks silly with stuff like
a glowing soy kill though so I change
this back to local so this is basically
it for the particles go ahead and hit
start and if we select this sort of
whatever game object it is this on and
hit the apply the sword preset prefab
now has this kind of particle system
applied to it so for drag in a new one
you can see that they are both glowing
alright so later on maybe we'll script
some kind of buff so it applies more
damage or something whenever this is
this is on but this was set for now with
the particles and I'll see you in the
next tutorial thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
