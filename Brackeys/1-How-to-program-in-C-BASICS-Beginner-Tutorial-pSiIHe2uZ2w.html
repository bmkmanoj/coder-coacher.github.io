everyone and welcome to the first video
in how to program in C sharp this course
is going to be quite different from what
I normally do which is game development
tutorials but I've been getting a lot of
requests on making a course that really
focuses on the c-sharp language and this
is super awesome because it will allow
us to really give an introduction to
what programming means and reading and
writing an understanding code whilst
learning a language that can pretty much
be used for any kind of software
development whether you want to do web
development whether you want to develop
for PC or Mac or game development or a
mobile app development c-sharp pretty
much does it all by now
so c-sharp is super cool and we can
really focus on the language and
understanding it so what we are going to
be doing today as first off what can see
shop do we just went through that then
we're going to be talking about console
applications what is an IDE we're going
to install the software we're going to
be using throughout the course and we're
going to create our first project if all
of this seems very easy and fundamental
to you please just go ahead and skip
onto the next video where we will delve
into the programming side so first off
let me explain what kind of software we
are going to be writing in this course
so we're going to be making what is
called console applications and if you
don't know what this is there's an image
on the screen right now I agree with you
that it does not look very appealing but
it's great for really focusing on the
general language because it's not so
specific on game development tools or
mobile app tools or anything it's it's a
lot of language but not much API so the
API stands for application programming
interface and it's basically a series of
commands that you can use so game
development uses some one kind of API
and other software development uses
other kinds of API s so that's a really
simplified very
way of looking at it by light I think it
will work for now so an IDE also sounds
really frightening it is really not it
stands for integrated development
environment and it's basically just a
software that you use to programming so
if if you're in a video editor you might
use Premiere Pro or Sony Vegas and if
you're a programmer you might might use
Visual Studio Xcode or what we are going
to be using which is monodevelop
and it's even an extended version of
monodevelop called xamarin studio so
when you learn this you can also do app
development right after so we're going
to be using mono develop and in an
extended version called xamarin studio
just so you know they are basically the
same thing just don't get them confused
you just need to know that they might
use different naming sometimes so let's
dive right into it and install our first
IDE so let's head over to our browser
and let's open up monodevelop com let's
hit download now to download the file
but first we have to say select an
operating system so if you're on Mac
click that and make sure you first
install this package down here which
will download the mono framework plus
gtk what these does is not important for
now but you need them so download them
and install them and then right after
you can download and install monodevelop
itself but we own windows so we're going
to select that and here you will need to
first install gtk for.net and then the
dotnet framework so download both of
them and install them and then right
after we can download the Installer
itself so I'm going to hit download and
it will start downloading and you can
see now it's not cold mono develop
anymore now it's called summer in studio
so that's why I wanted to clear that up
so when it's downloaded simply open it
and we will run Installer here I'm just
going to change
my directory because I have a secondary
hard disk and Sh I would rather you have
it sit on so exam or in studio let's say
it okay next and it's going to install
the reason why we hit yes here the
reason why we're using summer in studio
is because it's cross platform which is
really awesome Visual Studio is only
four four windows it's made by Microsoft
and Xcode is only for Mac and it's made
by Apple and they're both good takes but
I mean for what we're going to be doing
here which is console applications
samer in studio is going to be more than
enough so hit launch summer in studio
and hit finish and it might go ahead and
prompt you here to update it often just
pops up and say hey there's some updates
do you want to install and simply just
hit install and restyle I think it's
called and and you will be good to go
it's always great to keep your software
updated so we're going to go ahead and
click new solution and solutions are
basically like projects if you think of
them in that respect
so let's hit new solution and we are
going to be making a console project in
the c-sharp language so let's hit a hit
undo c-sharp click on the c-sharp
category we can also do F sharp or VB
net or I'll do stuff and then hit
console project and when you have the
selected we are going to do a name so
let's call this first console project
and we're just going to keep the
solution name the same as the name and
I'm just going to change the location to
be on the desktop and let's hit create
directory for solution and let's hit OK
let's actually do solution name first
console project solution just so we keep
them separate because you can have
several projects under one solution
there it's not really important for this
tutorial but let's just name it
correctly from the beginning it's not
good to teach bad habits so let's hit OK
and it will start creating our project
and now this right here is our first
c-sharp program so this here is c-sharp
it might look very frightening and
difficult to understand at this very
moment but in the next video we are
going to go through everything explain
it we're going to write some code
ourself and we're going to launch our
first console program so that's going to
be really awesome I hope you're looking
forward to it as much as I am it's
always fun to play around with these
console apps and yeah thanks for
watching and I'll see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
