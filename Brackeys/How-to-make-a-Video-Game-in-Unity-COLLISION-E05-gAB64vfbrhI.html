at creating obstacles and how to make
things happen when two objects collide
also Before we jump into the tutorial I
have a quick update for you guys
I'm really glad the feedback on this
series has been so positive so far I'm
having a blast making it if you don't
follow me on social media when you're
watching this video I'm actually on my
first vacation for a very very long time
because of that the recent videos and
the next ones are all scheduled I really
tried to fit in all of the blanks while
I was gone but unfortunately I had to
skip a video that means that this
witness stayed there will be no new
video however that will of course be
another how to make a video game this
Sunday alright enough rambling let's get
started so if we select our player we
can see that we currently have a player
movement script and we could definitely
go ahead and add our collision code to
this script as well but to make things
easier to understand let's go ahead and
create a separate script let's add a
component and let's call it something
like player collision hip new script
like C sharp and hit create and add
let's double click the script to open it
up in Visual Studio let's delete the two
using tags appear and both the start and
the update method so adding code to
colliding objects in unity is actually
really easy to do just like start an
update unity has created a function with
a specific name that is called whenever
two objects collide let's write void
just as we would do with start an update
and then write on collision enter make
sure to use capital letters the same way
that I do and that you spell this in the
right way if you do this wrong unity is
not going to throw an error it's not
going to complain in any way but it's
just not going to be working we even
open and close some parentheses and some
curly brackets this now means that
whatever code we place within these two
curly brackets will be called whenever
this object collides with something so
if we save this and go back into unity
we can add our player collation script
to whatever object we want as long as
the object has a rigidbody and a
Collider we can be sure that this code
will be called so to test this let's
just go ahead and throw a debug door
lock statement that says we hit
something
let's save this go into unity and hit
play and you can see now that right off
the gate a message displays in our
console saying that we hit something and
you might think that's a bit weird
because we don't currently have any
obstacles in our scene but you need to
text collision between all objects so
what we actually hit here is the ground
so when we hit play and our player falls
down this message
displayed let's try and add an obstacle
to our scene we can go over here in the
hierarchy right click go 3d object and
then cube we can then reset the
transform off this object let's move it
forward a bit let's put it add one on
the y-axis hit F to focus on it and we
can see that it's standing on our ground
it's currently totally white so let's go
into our project panel right click go
create material and this one is going to
be our obstacle Max we can make this a
bit darker and we can drag it on to our
obstacle we can also consider turning
down the smoothness you will notice the
preview down here changing the higher
the smoothness the more light will
bounce off the surface let's just leave
that at zero we can now take this cube
move it forward a bit more and give it a
scale on the x-axis of about two we can
rename it to something like obstacles
and you will notice this right away has
a box Collider so all we need to do is
add a rigidbody as well we can go ahead
and increase the mass a tiny bit this is
a bit bigger than the cube so that set
it to something like 2 and that should
be all the settings we need to configure
now if we go to our console clear all
the stuff we have in it and hit play we
should see that we both collide with the
ground and the obstacle object however
we need a way of keeping track of what
we head because we don't want this to
trigger whenever we hit the ground to do
that we go into our script and we tell
unity we want some information about
what object we hit we can do that by
inserting a bit of code within these two
parentheses let's write collision this
lets unity know that we want to gather
some information about the collision and
then we need to give that information a
name again we can choose any name we
want here I'm just going to type
collision info then down here instead of
simply writing we hit something let's
display what we hit to do that we can
replace our text with collision info we
then use these dot to access different
parts of this information you can see
that we can get information about the
contact points between the colliders
stuff like the impact force sum and
other handy parameters the most
important one for us is that we can get
info about the collider we hit so let's
write dot Collider and again we can type
god and we'll get all the information
about that Collider here we can access
the rigidbody if our Collider the
material of our Collider or just display
its name so by accessing the collider
within collision info and the name
within the collider we should now
display the name of whatever we here
let's see if this works in unity let's
hit play and we should see that it first
shows ground and then obstacle this
makes it really easy for us to have
different stuff happen depending on what
we hit we could write if collision info
dark Collider name is equal to obstacle
and remember to put this within
quotation marks let's then open and
close the curly brackets and now
everything we write within these two
curly brackets will only happen if the
name of the collider that we hit is
obstacle let's see if that works let's
write a debug deadlock statement here
saying we hit an obstacle again let's
save this head back into unity and hit
play and you can see nothing happens
when we hit the ground but as soon as we
collide with the obstacle it displays a
message in our case it actually
displayed - that's because we had two
quick collisions with the obstacle it
was hard to see with the naked eye but
unity actually detected it however most
of the times you will only see one one
thing that we should correct about this
piece of code is that checking for an
obstacles name is not the best way to go
about things if you create a larger game
you can quickly have hundreds if not
thousands of objects in your scene and
searching through all of them can be
really taxing on the computer it also
means that if we were to go ahead and
rename the object our code would no
longer work a much better way to go
about things is using tags tags can be
used to group objects together so in our
case we could mark all of our different
obstacles with an obstacle tag to do
that we go up here website tag we click
on tag and you can see the different
tags created by unity automatically we
need to go ahead and add a new one hit
the plus sign to create a new entry and
it's called this one obstacle we can
then select our obstacle object and
change the tag to obstacle then in our
code instead of checking for the name
we'll check for tag this is much better
because it allows us to create a bunch
of different objects and as long as they
share the same tag we can configure them
in any way we want let's just make sure
that this is working by hitting play and
indeed it is of course displaying a
message in the console isn't very
exciting what you should probably do is
add some kind of end screen or maybe
just restart the level those are great
things to add but it's enough for a
separate video instead let's make sure
to disable our players movement because
right now when we hit the object we
actually just keep flying instead we can
simply go in through
and turn off our player movement script
to do that we need to have a reference
to a player movement script let's go
into Visual Studio and before a function
let's add a variable let's type public
then the name of our script which is
player movement and then we need to give
the variable a name in our case let's
call it just movement when we now save
this and go into unity we can see that
there's now an empty slot here so by
simply dragging all player movement
script into that slot we've now created
a reference from the player collision
script choose the player movement script
and we've called this movement now in
our code we can replace our debug log
statement with movement dot enabled and
we can set this to false again let's say
hit play and hit an obstacle we can now
see that our player movement script
turns off so that was pretty much it for
