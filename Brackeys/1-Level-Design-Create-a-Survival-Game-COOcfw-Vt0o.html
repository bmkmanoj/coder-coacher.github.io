level design video in our survival game
series this one is going to be much more
art based than usual but I'll still give
away some cool tips tricks and
techniques along the way the first thing
I do is take a look at the reference
photo and maximize it on my secondary
screen so I can always have a look at it
I then start sculpting away on a new
terrain I start out using a large and
smooth brush this way I can shape the
overall feel of the mountains I then go
in with a more detailed one to give it
the rough and edgy look this way it will
actually look like stone
I then add a simple grass texture it's
always good to see how your terrain
looks with texture supplied even though
it's just assemble one like this one I
then add the outer boundaries and some
more detail this is a good time to make
the terrain look less flat so I start
sculpting away on that I then rename it
and add the default border import
package order basic I then drag it into
my scene set the position variables to
zero and make sure it covers the whole
terrain now I can just use the height
brush to sculpt down on the terrain and
the water will start appearing I then
bring up the border a little bit and
cover some of the mistakes where it goes
through the ground now I add a path this
is done by using the height too I then
select all of the different props and
move them upwards here you see me
creating the dirt path texture I made
this using a photorealistic image taking
with a real camera I then apply some
filters to make it look more smooth and
a bit cartoony this just adds a nice
mood to the game I then painted onto the
terrain
I then load in a nice stone texture and
applied to the mountains it's a good
idea to have the same texture applied
with this different opacity settings
this way you can have variety and nice
blending here you just see me making the
path a bit darker to make the path blend
better between grass and dirt I apply
another texture I do the same to the
water I now use a large brush with
plenty of detail to make the grass look
less clean now it's time to position the
objects around the scene and make sure
to select the fence and drag it down to
the project pane to make a prefab out of
it I then make some empty game objects
and drag for fences into one of them
this way I can have packs of fences so I
don't have to duplicate one and then
move and so on make sure to rename them
properly so you can quickly find them in
your scene the same technique is used
for applying the lamps and now I want to
apply fire to the fireplace so I import
the default particle particles I drag in
the flames position them and play around
with the light I would like it to be
bigger and softer so I add an extra
light that can take care of that I then
drag it onto the campfire prefab and
drag it on into the project pane now I
clean up the hierarchy by deleting old
objects
and then import a doc to sit by the
water I create a custom Collider by
making a series of empty game objects
with colliders attached
finally I position it make it a prefab
and make the last changes to the
textures here's the final result let me
know if you like this type of video in
the comments since I think it's a nice
addition to the ordinary scripting ones
thank you for watching and I'll see you
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
