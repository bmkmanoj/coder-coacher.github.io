asked me how you can create some kind of
score for the game that's what we're
going to be making today it also gives
us the chance to play around with some
unity UI exciting stuff let's get
started let's begin by getting a bit
more organized first up let's create a
folder for all of our scripts let's name
it scripts we'll place our follow player
play collision and play movement in
there let's also make one for our
materials again we'll call this one
materials and drag our obstacle mat and
play a mat in there I think we can just
leave the rest here let's then correct
something that's been knowing me since
the last video and that is the collision
detection sometimes it happens that our
player actually passes through one of
the obstacles it's something that you
guys have also noticed in the comments
to get more accurate physics detection
we can select our obstacles and choose
continuous under collision detection
we'll do the same thing to our player
we'll also go under edit project
settings time and decrease our fixed
time step I'll just set it to 0.01 this
means that uni will more frequently
update our physics and therefore the
chance of missing a collision is reduced
this also means that we'll probably have
to select our player and increase the
forward force a little bit I'll just set
it to something like 8000 and I played
around with it and found that a sideways
force of about 120 felt pretty good now
when we hit play everything should look
and feel pretty much the same way but it
just feels a lot nicer and the
collisions are going to be much better
I'm also just going to fix my OCD by
setting our play to a Y position of
exactly once all right so let's get
started with our UI P creating UI
ingenuity is pretty much the same thing
as creating anything else we go to the
hierarchy we right-click we go under UI
now and we can select text
this creates a canvas a canvas is a
place to display all of our different UI
elements and a text object which of
course allows us to configure our text
well we can't currently see it anywhere
so have a good look at it let's switch
to 2d mode let's select our text and hit
F let's also zoom out a bit so we can
see our entire canvas
notice that the canvas will resize to
fit the size of our game view this is
basically the screen that we can paint
stuff on what text object here I'm just
going to move it up and put it kind of
in the upper center I'm also going to
change our text alignment to Center on
both the horizontal and the vertical
you can also see that we can slice about
text and if we hold down alt we will
size from this Center however it doesn't
actually change the font size it just
changes the boundaries of our text so in
order to actually scale up our text
we'll have to increase the font size
over here just make sure you make plenty
of room for the text so that if your
player reaches a really high score it's
not going to clip we can also set the
horizontal overflow down here to
overflow which means that if it should
reach one of the boundaries it's just
going to keep going something like this
then let's change the text to something
like two hundred and fifty just to give
ourselves an idea of what's going on and
I'm going to definitely also bump up the
font size some more currently when we
resize our window say if we maximize it
our text is kind of current into the
centered so text will always be a fixed
distance from the center this also means
that it doesn't resize and I kind of
wanted to do that so let's select our
canvas and it's changed the UI scale
mode from constant pixel size meaning
that everything doesn't resize to scale
with screen size and I wanted to kind of
try and match the height you can see now
that if we maximize our game view the
font gets bigger as well and I really
like that I'm also going to take the
color of our text and make it completely
white I think that gives a pretty cool
faded look finally for the look of our
text I really really hate Arial it's
kind of a passion I mean there's a lot
of bad fans out there but please
anything but area so I'm just going to
go ahead and download another one there
are a lot of great fun our cows out
there they're fond google font and so on
I'm just going to go and open my browser
I'm going to search for Roboto this is a
fun made by Google and it's really nice
modern and simple I'm just going to
select this font click down here and we
can now download it as a zip file so I'm
just going to unzip that file by hitting
extract all and extract and now you can
just select all of the different font
versions and drag them directly into
unity well up we'll also go ahead and
create a separate folder for this called
fonts and shift select all of them and
drag them in there and it's that easy
now we can go on to our text and change
the font to whatever version of Roboto
that we like I'm just going to go with
something like rogue bottle then
actually we might want to make the text
black here just to make it more visible
now it kind of completes the look of our
text but it's still not updating I mean
if we hit play it's just going to be
stuck at 203
and I want this to count out by the
meter you could also count up the scored
by the time but I think since this is
about reaching as far as possible it's
pretty fun to measure distance to do
that we go ahead and create a new script
on a text object I'm going to call it
score and they create an app let's
double click it and as always we're just
going to be removing the two using tags
up there and the start method so in
order to keep track of how far we reach
entry level we need a reference to our
player because our player has a position
and we can use that to make sure his
distance traveled it's the same as any
other variable we start with public then
the type here we could either write game
object and this gives us a lot of
information about our player but we only
want the position and therefore we're
going to type transform in step because
remember the transform component is
responsible for position rotation and
scale we're going to go ahead and write
player as the name and now in our update
loop we should be able to access player
dot position Z and this is how many
units we've moved on the z axis of
course we have to make sure that our
player starts at the Z of 0 but indeed
he does so if we just want to display
the position of our player here we can
say debug the lock and then insert
player dot position three into the
parentheses let's save this go into
unity select our text object and drag in
our player if we then switch to the
console and hit play we should get a
bunch of debug deadlock messages
constantly saying the updated position
of our player on the z axis now all we
need to do is transfer this value onto
the UI element and that's really easy to
do as well just like we needed a
reference from a scorer to the player we
also need a reference from our score to
the text so again we'll go into unity
and whenever we're dealing with UI
elements we actually need to include
some more functions so we'll go up here
and say that we're going to be using
unity engine
UI and this now allows us to write code
for the user interface we can then
create another variable this is also
going to be public and it's going to be
of type text and this is of course
because the name of the component that
is responsible for text is text and so
we make it of type text and we can give
this some fancy name I'm just going to
go with score text and close it with a
semicolon then down here instead of
debug logging opposition will say scored
and now we can access all the different
parts of our text we can change the font
size we can change the color and we can
change the text itself so score text
text allows us to change the text
content we can then set that equal to
player style position dot Z however if
we try and run this it is going to throw
an error and we can actually already see
it if we hover over this red part it
says cannot implicitly convert type
float to string so what's happening well
our position on the z axis is a float
number remember if load is one of the
basic data types and whenever we want to
set our text equal to something it
requires a string a string is also one
of the fundamental data types and it's
what we use to store text so we need to
convert this number into text to do that
we simply write dot at the end here and
then to string and we need to follow
that with two parentheses it's a bit
weird that we have to do this I mean
it's still going to be a number but now
it's going to be a number inside of a
string and that's the difference there
for now just right after me so if we
save this head back into unity we need
to of course reference our score text so
we'll drag in our text component and hit
plain and we can now see the UI updating
however it's doing so with a very high
precision and I think there's no reason
for us to have decimal places in here
only whole numbers to do that we simply
need to format our text and the to
string method actually allows us to do
that really easily all we need to do is
go in here and in quotation marks write
a zero if we save that now going to
unity and hit play we should see that it
displays our distance in meters but only
in whole numbers much much better and we
can see how cool that looks in full
screen if you think something about your
text doesn't look super crisp you can
select the canvas and choose pixel
perfect this sometimes can make the UI
render a lot sharper that's pretty much
it for this video if you liked it make
sure to subscribe so you don't miss a
future episode also because of my
traveling I had to delay the monthly
live stream a bit but I will be
live-streaming very soon make sure to
follow me at Facebook facebook.com slash
brekkie
over twitter at bracket suite to get
notified when that will happen you don't
want to miss it it's always a lot of fun
unadjusted a video on creating
destructible objects that i think would
fit really nicely into this one if you
want to have to play all the obstacles
when they collide so check that out here
on that thanks for watching I will see
you in the next video thanks of the
awesome people who donated in February
and a special thanks to Derek huge jerk
face filmography James Callaghan and
Jason Latino if you want to become a
picture in yourself you can do so at
pitching becomes less Preki thanks a lot
