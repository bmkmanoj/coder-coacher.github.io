video to let you know that I will be
live streaming on Twitch in just a
second I might already have gone live by
the time this video airs and basically
that's because we just reached level two
on patron that is the four hundred
dollars a month mark and that's amazing
thank you so much to all of the people
who is donated and this live stream will
be the first of hopefully many and I've
promised to livestream at least once a
month so we'll begin the with this one
and we'll see how it goes and I just
wanted to show you that on the game that
we are going to be making in this stream
it looks like this and it's kind of a
dutch d falling our blocks kind of gave
a game so we have the player controller
here and we have the blocks that
randomly spawn and they will increase in
their falling speed and once you get hit
you can see okay that was not the best
display but we have this cool
slow-motion effect that I really like so
that is what we are going to be
recreating in this stream and I was of
course also be answering some questions
so head over there if you should miss it
for some reason I will try my best to
upload this to youtube somehow but I'm
still figuring out some of the tech
stuff so I'll see you there and by</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
