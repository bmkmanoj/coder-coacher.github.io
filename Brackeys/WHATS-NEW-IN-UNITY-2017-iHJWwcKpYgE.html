one you can download it already using
the link in the description this marks
the first version in the 2017 cycle
let's see what it has to offer
first up timeline is now part of the
editor in case you don't know timeline
is a cinematic sequence at all it's
great for creating cutscenes
and other cinematic elements without the
use of code in fact it was used to make
the atom demo film you can definitely
expect a tutorial on timeline at some
point in the future so stay tuned for
that 2017 point one is also really
embracing cinema scene City machine is a
procedural camera system that enables
you to compose shots once again without
the use of code soon the machine also
allows you to create dolly tracks and
have the camera automatically prioritize
between multiple targets the
post-processing stack has also been
improved the changes include a component
called the post process volume which
allows you to easily blend between
effects and different parts of your
scene this one still in beta but it's
expected to be out pretty soon your
indie collaborate is out of beta though
and becomes part of unity teams along
with cloud build unity teams is going to
cost nine dollars a month for the first
three team members if you don't have a
Unity subscription however you can try
it for free until October we also seeing
some new additions to analytics the
coolest one is probably remote settings
which allows you to change values in
your game from the analytics dashboard
this means you can adjust stuff like
difficulty settings without having to
redeploy when it comes to 2d the main
changes are in new 2d sprite adlets
workflow and the sprite mass component
which can be used to hide or reveal
parts of a sprite the animation window
has also received a number of
improvements to speed up the process of
key framing and to make the workflow
feel more intuitive additionally unity
is introducing a new experiments of
feature the game object recorder it
allows you to record the transform of a
game object over time and stored in an
animation clip this is really great for
baking physics into animation for better
performance and to the audio enthusiasts
you can now play Amba sonic audio clips
which means that players will now
experience full sphere surround sound in
unity games other than that the editor
gets a new arc handle class to
interactively edit arcs in the scene
view the UI system now has its own
dedicated profiler panels to help you
debug your UI and to the visual studio
lovers unity will now give you the
option to install vias community 2017 on
Windows with a faster and lighter
installation process and more
importantly Mac users rejoice Microsoft
just released Visual Studio for Mac
along with unity integration finally we
also seeing a scripting runtime upgrade
which features dotnet 4.6 and support
for c-sharp 6 at this point it's only an
experimental feature though the particle
system has seen some nice improvements
this one a new doughnut emission shape
has been added the noise module now
allows you to apply noise to rotation
size and even your custom shaders using
particles in 2d has become easier as
well thanks to new controls and
constraints such as the ability to align
particles to their velocity Direction
also you can now use sprites in the
particle system and with the new update
particles can apply forces to the
colliders plate head so that's pretty
nice but that's really way too many
changes to cover in this video here's a
list of some of the larger ones finally
2017 point one of course comes with a
number of smaller changes and bug fixes
we download it today and if you want to
get your hands on some of the pro
features such as customizable splash
screens and of course the dark editor
skin there will be a link for that in
the description and if you haven't had
your fill with all the new stuff I will
have a link to where you can read more
as well on that thanks for watching and
I will see you in the next video thanks
