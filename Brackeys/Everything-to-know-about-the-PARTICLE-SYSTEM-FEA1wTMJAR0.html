is playing around with particles for
some reason I just keep having fun with
it
so in this mega video we'll go over the
entire particle system from beginning to
end
here are some time stamps if there's any
particular feature you want to hear
about this video is sponsored by udemy
udemy is a great site for learning new
skills and they have a lot of cool
courses on making games today I want to
mention this awesome course on building
android games and apps using unity
throughout the course you will learn how
to build a Legend of Zelda game from
scratch make 3d models using blender and
how to tailor everything to the Android
platform so if this course sounds
interesting to you
or if you're just looking for an awesome
place to discover new knowledge on game
development definitely check out udemy

the particle system consists of a bunch
of different modules that each control
different aspects of the system you have
to enable a module in order to access
its settings the first three modules and
the very last module are almost always
used these are the particle system the
mission the shape and the renderer
module which all enabled by default the
rest of the modules contain more
specific settings for different use
cases so let's take it from the top the
particle system module is by fine the
module with the most important settings
this module contains global properties
that affect the entire system here you
can control whether or not the system
should loop the duration of the system
and if you want to have it play
automatically some of the properties in
the particle system module applied to
the particles themselves as they are
emitted in other words these are the
start settings for your particles this
includes lifetime which is how long a
particle will last speed size rotation
and color now all values that you adjust
in the particle system can use something
we call modifiers this make it possible
to randomize properties or control them
over the duration of the system the
modifiers are going to be different for
each property but one that's really good
to know is random between two constants
as the name suggests this allows you to
have unity randomize between two vibes
another one is curves which gives you
full control of a property over
now this module is also where you can
add gravity to your particles also
before moving on make sure to choose a
stimulation space here we decide if we
want the particles to follow around the
object or move independently the
emission module handles the creation of
particles here we have three different
types of emission to choose from rate
overtime Radio distance and curst s--
the first one rate over time simply
affects how much time passes between
each particle emission this is probably
one of the most used properties of the
entire particle system the second one
can be used to define how far the object
needs to move before another particle is
emitted especially useful for moving
vehicles emitting smoke finally you can
set up bursts where you fire off a bunch
of particles at once I use this all the
time for explosion like effects in the
shape module we choose the shape of the
emitter there is a rarity of shapes you
can choose from such as sphere
hemisphere cone and donut or you can of
course choose your own mesh this can
allow for some pretty interesting
results the rest of the properties for
this module control how the particles
are emitted from the shape do they only
emit from the surface or from the for
volume what direction should they shoot
out and so on the renderer module is
extremely important this is where you
define the look of your particles using
the render mode we can choose if we want
to show the particles on a 2d surface
which we call a billboard or if you want
to render them as a 3d mesh after
choosing a render mode we have to assign
a material if you're creating 2d
particles they're a bunch of shaders to
choose from under the particles shader
category many of these use custom
blending modes to give the particles a
certain look
the main wants to know are additive
which make the particles seem very
bright Pilon including the right paths
of the texture and multiply which does
the opposite if you're making 3d
particles you can simply use the
standard shader also if you want the
particles to cast or receive shadows
make sure to enable it here next we have
what I like to call the over lifetime
module
as the name implies we use these to
change properties on the particles over
time after they get emitted here we have
some self-explanatory ones like size and
color as you can see the color module
gives us a gradient that we can use to
smooth the transition from one color to
another the bottom part of the gradient
defines color and the top defines alpha
values so you can easily use this to
fade in and out particles we also have a
module called velocity over lifetime
that allows you to control the speed of
the particles over time here you can
control the amount of force to apply in
each axis and the speed modifier is a
multiplier that affects the speed in all
directions limit velocity over lifetime
is also interesting in that it does the
exact opposite here we can limit the
speed of the particles by adding drag I
often use this for explosion like
effects where the particles should
gradually slow down and just like the
over lifetime modules we have lit by
speed modules these make changes to the
particles based on their current speed
for example in color by speed we create
a color gradient and rather than have a
change over time we match it to a
certain speed range rotation and size by
speed work in much the same way the
noise module is a new addition to the
unity particle system and it's
absolutely amazing it basically allows
you to add turbulence to your particles
fully understanding the different noise
properties can get rather math heavy but
in general we can say that strength is
how much you want the noise to influence
the particles frequency is how smooth
you want the turbulence to be the higher
the value the faster and more often the
particles will change direction scroll
speed allows you to change the noise
that applies to the particles over time
which can make everything feel much more
dynamic and finally the octaves define
how many layers of noise we stack on top
of each other by adding multiple noise
layers we can create more interesting
movement at the bottom of the module we
choose what we want the noise to affect
position rotation and size the collision
module enables your particles to collide
with all the game objects in your scene
you do this by setting the type to world
however this can be pretty taxing on the
computer since that you can use the
default
option claims here you define custom
planes that only the particles will
collide with in most cases you probably
also want to reduce the bounce factor to
not make them jump around as well as
increased dampen to make them slow down
on impact
I also recommend playing around with the
collision quality to make everything as
performant as possible the sub emitters
module is where things begin to get more
complicated
imagine inception but for particles here
you can set up submitters meaning you
can spawn new particle emitters from
other particles the new emitter can then
be controlled as a separate particle
system an example of when this is useful
is when creating impact effects or
fireworks if you want your particles to
animate you can use the texture sheet
animation module here you can specify
either a texture sheet where each image
in your animation is laid out on a grid
or a number of sprites I use this all
the time when creating 2d games and
especially for crafting more detailed
special effects the lights module is a
fast way to make the particles cast
light onto their surroundings this is
great for effects like fire or lightning
here you can simply create a light and
drag it into the light slot you can then
control how big a portion of the
particles should emit lights using the
ratio the other settings like use
particle color and size effects range or
determine whether or not you want the
resulting light to be affected by the
particle it's sitting on if you check
out them the look of the light will be a
combination of the particle and the
light and if you don't check any of them
the light will just keep its values
now the trails module can create a trail
either from or between particles the
most important thing to remember here is
that you need to create a trail material
in order for it to render properly the
trail material is assigned in the
renderer module after this you can
adjust width and color and even have a
change over the length of the trail with
the triggers module particles can
actually trigger game logic when
colliding with objects the callback can
happen when the particle enters
exits is inside or is outside of the
collider by default you have the option
to kill particles when triggering but
you can also create your own custom
script for more advanced behaviors if
this is something you're interested in I
reckon
checking out the example in the
documentation with the inherent velocity
module the emitter can transfer its
current velocity to the particles it
emits this is useful if your particle
system is moving around the scene and
you want the particles to follow it to
some extent you can use the multiplier
to choose the portion of the emitter
speed that gets transferred to the
particles if you have a wind sown in
your terrain enable the external forces
module to make it influence your
particles and finally we have the custom
data module which is pretty much
reserved for advanced users in short
this allows you to define custom data to
be attached to your particles you can
then later use this data in a custom
shader so that is pretty much all the
features I wanted to cover in this video
from here on it's up to you to have fun
and experiment and if you still have
questions I suggest you have a look at
the documentation it holds all the
answers also don't forget to check out
