AI for enemy let's get into it so let's
begin by creating an object for our
enemy let's right-click in the hierarchy
go 3d object and then select capsule
let's go to the scene you that's right
click on the transform and hit reset
let's move this over to near the end of
the bridge now I don't want the graphics
to sit on this object so let's just
remove the mesh renderer and the mesh
filter and it's instead right click go
3d object and then cube and this will be
our temporary graphics so we can remove
the collider on this one we can bump up
the y scale to 2 and down the scale on
the x and z to something like point 6 so
now it has somewhat the dimensions of a
character let's rename this object to
graphics I rename the parent object to
enemy we'll also open up the capsule
Collider here let's change the radius to
something like point three and we'll
leave the height add two let's also
select our graphics object and move it
up by say one on the Y just to make sure
that the pivot of our parent object will
be at the bottom and let's now also
offset our capsule Collider the same way
cool we then want to go ahead and add
our nav mesh agent let's just move this
to the top here let's collapse the
capsule Collider and open up the nav
mesh agent and you can see now the
collisions cylinder that it creates here
we want to set the speed to something
like 2 the acceleration bump that up to
something around 20 let's set the
stopping distance to 2 as well and we
can set the radius for obstacle
avoidance to around save 0.2 if you're
confused about what a lot of this stuff
does I recommend watching the first
video in this series
let's now collapse this as well and
let's finally add a rigidbody on top
here we just want to make sure to check
is kinematic and our enemy has all of
the necessary components in order for us
to apply movement on top so let's just
drag him down to stand somewhat on the
ground let's then go under our scripts
let's create a new folder here let's
call this controllers and yet we can put
all of our controller scripts so let's
take our camera controller I'll play
your controller and let's also take our
player motor since these are connected
let's drag them onto the folder let's
right click hit create
C sharp script and now we can add an
enemy controller and swap let's make
sure to drag this onto our enemy object
and let's open it up in visual studio
now the first thing that we want to do
here is to define a look
radius because we only want enemies to
chase and attack us if we're within a
certain range let's create a public
float and let's call it look radius I'm
going just to fold this to ten let's
also make sure to display this in the
editor by going void on draw gizmos
selected and yet we'll set the color of
the gifts mode to colored red and we
then go gizmos dot draw wire sphere in
order to draw a sphere around our
current position with the radius of look
radius so if we save this we should now
be able to visually see the look radius
of our enemy in the editor so in this
case if we were to move on to the bridge
we'd be detected by the enemy of course
in order for our enemy to check whether
or not we're within range we need a
reference from our enemy to our player
to do that let's go in here and create a
transform target and we'll also need a
reference to a nav mesh agent in order
to move our enemy remember whenever
we're using AI inside of unity we have
to include the unity engine
AI namespace and now we can create a
reference to our nav mesh agent let's
just call it agent we can set these
references in the start method we inside
agent equal to get component of type nav
mesh agent to find the component on our
game object but how do we find our
player well of course we could use game
object at find object with tag but then
we'd have to search through all the
objects in our scene and we don't want
to go through and manually reference our
player for every enemy instead let's set
up a script that will always keep track
of a player to do that let's right click
under scripts go create c-sharp script
and we'll call this the player manager
and we can just have this sit under our
game manager let's open up the script
and the first thing we want to do is
create a simple singleton pattern we'll
do this in the exact same way that we've
done it before and as always if you want
to learn more about Singleton's there's
a link in the description so I'm just
gonna wrap this in a region called
singleton I'm gonna create a public
static player manager called instance
and then inside of the awake method I'm
gonna set instance equal to this now we
can collapse this and we can create here
a public game object which will
reference our
higher so if we save this we can just go
into unity and drag our player object
into this slot we're doing it this way
because we are not currently
instantiating the player at runtime
however many games spawn in the player
while running if that's the case just
make sure to update this variable to
point to the player you spawn now we can
really easily go into our enemy
controller and set target equal to our
player manager dot instance dot player
and of course this is of type game
objects that we have to convert it to a
transform then the update method we can
get the distance from our enemy to a
player can create a float called
distance and set it equal to vector 3
the distance between our targets
position and our precision we then check
if distance is less than or equal to our
look radius well then we want to start
chasing the player so we can use agent
dot set destination and feed it our
targets of position if we now save this
and go into unity let's take our
interactable on the bridge here and
disable it let's make sure we can see
both the game and the scene view let's
select our enemy and hit play and you
can see now that if we get closer to our
enemy it starts to chase us awesome one
thing that you'll also notice is that if
it gets close enough in order to stop
and we then run around it it's not gonna
update its rotation so it won't be
pointing towards us unless we move away
now this might be fine as long as we are
using a white cube but when we start
using an actual skeleton that is going
to try and attack us we don't want it to
attack out in thin air to change this we
use the same method we did for a player
when pointing towards interactable
that is first off checking if the
distance is less than or equal to the
stopping distance of our agent if it is
well then we actually want to go ahead
and attack the target and we also want
to make sure to face the target will be
handling attacking in the next video but
we can at least make sure to face the
target to do that we'll create a method
called face target and we did this exact
same thing in video number two on
interaction so I'm just gonna quickly do
it again here first we get a direction
to the target
we then get a rotation where we point to
that target and we then update our own
rotation to point in this direction but
it's probably a good idea to apply a bit
of smoothing here so we'll be using
quaternion slope in order to spherically
interpolate between our current
rotations or transform rotation and our
target rotation which is look rotation
and we'll do this over time dot delta
time multiplied with say five if we then
make sure to call the method up here so
face target save it and hit play we
should see that no matter how we move
our enemy will always point towards us
but we also want to be able to interact
with our enemy to do that let's go to
scripts and go create C shop script
enemy and we'll of course drag this onto
the enemy let's open it up we'll make
sure to derive enemy from interactable
and we'll then go in and override our
interact method so whenever we interact
with our enemy we want to attack it but
that's again for the next video you can
see now that we have our interaction
radius let's just set that to four we
can also add some stats to our enemy to
do that let's right-click on a stats
folder co-create c-sharp script let's
call this the enemies stats again of
course we'll add this to our enemy
object let's again delete our two
methods and this time we want to derive
from our character stats now the only
thing that we want to change here is how
we died so let's create a public
override void for the diameter and here
we probably want to display some kind of
cold death animation or turn into a
rectal so a drag tall effect slash death
animation and then we want to destroy
the game object so we'll call destroy
game object this would also be a good
place to add loot let's save this go
into unity and we now set a max health
of say 40 a base value for the damage of
say five let's also give it three armor
that's pretty much all of the systems
that we need for enemy AI you can see
that it will follow us around and if we
right-click it we are going to interact
with it really nice job making it this
far into this series pretty much the
only thing left gameplay-wise is combat
I can't wait let's pretty much it for
this video if you enjoy
make sure to subscribe so dome it's a
future one also some of you were a bit
confused in the description of the last
video I understand why we are juggling
videos between two different channels so
I've gone ahead and compiled a playlist
it has all the videos on my channel and
all of the graphics integration on
Sebastian's channel I'll have a link for
that in the description on that thanks
for watching and I will see you in the
next video thanks to all the awesome
patreon supporters who donated in August
and a special thanks to hats off - yes
pamekasan Thomas Wally stone gamer
Sybok Nami Jason a Tito Derrick heaps
Kirk face tamara phi with some casa
