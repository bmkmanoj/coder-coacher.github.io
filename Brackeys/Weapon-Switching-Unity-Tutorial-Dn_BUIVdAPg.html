you can create weapon switching in unity
this system will allow you to switch
between any number of weapons that you
want using both the scroll wheel and the
number keys and it can easily be
combined with the weapon script that we
created in my previous video in order to
make a really nice weapon system so
check that out if you haven't already
alright so let's jump into it by the way
the weapons I'm using here are from this
sci-fi weapons pack if you want to get
it for yourself you can go to dev assets
comm click on the sci-fi weapons as with
everything else on the side its pay what
you want this bag actually features a
total of 32 different weapons
so you'll enjoy them and if you're
making a more realistic shooter we
actually also have the modern weapons
pack which features some pretty popular
realistic weapons so as you can see I
have this example team set up under the
player we have the main camera and under
the main camera we have our three
different weapons you can see in the
scene view here that I'm just using the
standard rigidbody first-person
controller you can always get this by
right-clicking going import package then
choosing characters then going under
standard assets characters first person
character and choosing the rigidbody FPS
controller prefab now under our main
camera we currently have the heavy
weapon active but as you can see we also
have a rifle and a pistol each one of
these guns have a gun script on them
which is responsible for shooting this
is the one that we created in the
previous video note how the different
weapons have different gun settings now
in order to switch between these when
in-game we need a script and we could
just go ahead and put this on our main
camera itself however I think it makes
sense to have an object dedicated for
this purpose let's go ahead and right
click on the main camera hit create MT
let's rename this one to weapon holder
and I'll just have it sit in the center
of our camera then let's take our three
weapons and drag them under the weapon
holder we and then select the weapon
holder hit add component and we want to
create a new script called something
like weapon switching it's a new script
like c-sharp and creating that let's
double click it to open it up in visual
studio now of course there's a bunch of
way you can go about creating weapon
switching you could create an array of
all your weapons and then spawn them in
and out as you need them or you can even
create some kind of scriptable object
that is going to store all the
information about your weapons but I
think a much easier and still very
customizable way is by simply enabling
and disabling all the child objects of
our weapon holder this way we don't have
to update any kind of list we don't have
to go and create custom data objects and
figure all that stuff out and we can
still swap weapons in and out as we want
so let's begin by delete the two using
tags up here and we'll actually keep
both these start and
they'd method for the script we only
need one variable and let's go ahead and
create that now this variable is going
to determine what weapon we currently
have selected you could use the name of
the weapon but I think a lot easier is
using some kind of index so we'll create
a public integer and we'll call it
something like selected weapon and we
can just default this to zero now in
unity whenever we talk about indexes of
child objects we start from the top so a
rifle here would have an index of zero
and so this will be selected by default
the heavy weapon will have one and the
pistol left - luckily we can very easily
rearrange all the objects here so if we
want our pistol to be selected first we
simply drag that to the top but I'm just
going to keep the rifle there so right
when we start the game we want our rifle
to be selected let's go ahead and call
some kind of method that will do this
force let's call it select weapon so now
we're calling the method we also need to
create it let's do that right underneath
our update method let's write void
select weapon and basically what we want
to do here is loop through all of the
weapons if the weapons index does not
match the selected weapon we want to
disable it and if it does match we want
to enable it so in order to loop through
our weapons we use it for each statement
and we say that for each transform and
we'll go ahead and call this transform
the weapon under transform this
basically means that we will take all
the transforms that are childs to our
current transform which is the weapon
holder and we'll do through each one
referring to the current one we're
inspecting as weapon let's open and
close some curly brackets and of course
now we need to reference by index and a
for each statement doesn't have one
let's just go ahead and create one
ourselves up here we'll write int I
equals 0 then each time we go through a
weapon we write I plus plus so the first
time we live through is going to be 0 we
then add 1 on to it the second time it's
going to be equal to 1 and then add 1 on
to it and so 2 3 4 and you get the point
what this allows us to do is now go in
here and check if I it's equal to the
selected weapon well then we want to
enable the weapon and so we go weapon
dot game object subset active we want to
set it to true if not meaning that the
index is do not match we say weapon that
game object subset active false so what
we're doing here is that the start of
the game we want to select the currently
selected weapon which defaults to 0 so
that's the first one and we do this by
first creating a variable called iron
setting in equal to
zero will then loop over all of the
weapons and in the beginning here is
going to be zero so if our selected
weapon is zero and it is we're going to
go ahead and make that active and we're
then going to increase I and then for a
second weapon we're going to check if
one is equal to zero which it is not and
so we'll go ahead and disable that
weapon and then we add one again and
this time I is going to be equal to two
and selected weapon is still going to be
zero so it's again false and that is two
going to be disabled this way only one
of our weapons will be enabled at a time
so if we save this we should actually
already see that when we run the game
it's going to select our rifle call but
we still can't switch weapons during the
game to do that we need to get some
input from our player and we do that in
the update method we can both change
weapons to using the scroll wheel or the
number keys let's begin with the scroll
wheel so let's check if our player
Scrolls up to do that we right if input
get access and the access that we want
to check for here is the one called
Mouse scroll wheel and you need to write
this the exact same way that I did
capital m capital S and capital W if not
it's not going to avoid this here is a
float that represents the current
movement of the scroll wheel if it's
greater than zero we've scrolled up and
if it's less than zero we've scrolled
down so here we can check if this value
is greater than zero and if it is we can
go ahead and select the next weapon in
the chain so we want to increase the
directed weapon by one to do that we go
SAS plus however right now we can do
this infinitely and since we only have
three weapons we are quickly going to
get to a point where we simply disable
all the weapons so instead let's have
this number wrap around so that when we
get to index two meaning that we've
selected our third weapon and then
scroll up it's going to go back to the
first weapon meaning index zero to do
that we want to check if selected weapon
is greater than or equal to the current
amount of weapons we have which we get
by using transform the child count minus
one so if we have three children we're
going to check if selected weapon is
greater than or equal to two and if it
is we don't want to increase our
selected weapon instead we want to set
our selected weapon equal to zero and if
not well then we can go ahead and
increment it every one this to happen in
the opposite direction as well so we'll
say here that if it is less than zero we
want to see if selected weapon is
less than or equal to zero and if it is
we want to set selected weapon equal to
transform child count minus one and if
it is not we want to go ahead and
subtract from it this way we can go in
both directions this can be a bit
confusing to wrap your head around but
try and go through it line by line to
understand it and don't worry these
things become much easier to understand
over time so now if we save this and go
into unity a weapons won't change but we
should be able to see our selected
weapon variable change it's a play and
now when I scroll up you can see the
selected weapon increase until it gets
to two in which case it's going to go
back to zero the same way if I scroll
down you can see the decreasing and when
I get to zero it's going to jump back to
two awesome now all we need to do is
also call us select weapon function but
we only want to do this if we've
actually selected a new weapon we could
go in here and call select weapon here
and here but since we're going to be
lots of different stuff that requires us
to select a new weapon let's not do that
instead let's go up here and create a
temporary variable it's going to be of
type int and it's going to be called
previous selected weapon and it set it
equal to our selected weapon then at the
very bottom after we've done all of our
calculations we can check if the
previous selected weapon is not equal to
the selected weapon in which case we
want to go ahead and call our Select
weapon method so that we will enable and
disable the corresponding objects this
way when we hit play and again scroll
using our mouse wheel we can see that we
can now switch between the weapons in
both directions so now we actually
already have a nice weapon switching
script oven running and you can easily
add on to this by creating weapon
switching animation and maybe some UI to
display what weapon we are currently on
and which one is next in the chain I
think most importantly we can go ahead
and map the different weapons onto the
number keys to do that we just use a
bunch of if statements we're going to
hear me right if input get key down and
the key that we want to check for is key
code alpha one meaning that we've
pressed the one key on the keyboard and
if we have we can go ahead and set
selected weapon equal to zero let's go
ahead and copy this if statement and
we'll just go ahead and change the 1 to
a 2 and the 0 to a 1 however we of
course also need to check if we have two
weapons if not we don't want to set
selected weapon to one so in here we
need to add another requirement and
we use the double and signs here and
what we want to ensure is that transform
Dutch child count is greater than or
equal to two and now we can copy this
entire if statement once more and let's
just do once more this way we can use
the first four numbers will change this
one to a three this one to a three and
this one to this one two or four this
one to a four and this one to a three if
we now save this and hit enter unity and
I begin by pressing two you can see it
switches to the second weapon three to
the third one to the rifle and four
nothing happens so now we can use a
combination of the scroll wheel and the
number keys in order to change weapons
you can very easily go ahead and add new
weapons to the hierarchy here and
everything should automatically update
you can also go ahead and reorganize
elements on the fly and our script
should just update to take care of it
