everyone and welcome to this unity 5
primer this video is not going to be
part of any particular series but
instead aims to give you insight into
the new features introduced with unity 5
and how to use them so I've tried to
pick out some of the most important and
the largest changes and you should see
them on screen now this video is
probably going to be pretty long and you
might know some of it already so just
click on the subjects that you want to
learn more about if you want to skip
ahead or you can of course just watch
the video with the whole way through so
click on something now and we're gonna
continue cool so the first thing we are
going to be taking a look at today is
the rendering pipeline quite a few
things has changed in rendering most
importantly the lighting so if we open
up a unity double-click on unity 5 once
you've downloaded it you can see that we
have this new open dialog where we have
access to tutorials documentation and
the projects that we are working on
let's just hit new project under this
and let's call this unity 5 primer and
we're gonna put it on the desktop I am
at least we're gonna set the defaults up
for 3d you can of course do 2d but most
of the changes to the rendering pipeline
is under 3d if you want to know more
about the 2d things that has changed
please go ahead and see the newest
addition to the 2d platformer course
because there I talked about how to
update to unity 5 and kind of what that
means for a project you can also import
some asset packages here I'm not going
to do that code let's say create project
and it's gonna very quickly open up this
project notice just how fast that is now
I've been using the asset store so let's
just browse away from that and
everything pretty much looks the way it
used to when it comes to the layout but
you will notice that inside of the scene
view we now have a new thief
old skybox which looks very awesome if
you ask me at least so the first thing
we are going to be looking at here is
just setting up a basic scene where we
can play around with some of the new
rendering features so let's hit
right-click that's going to 3d object
and create a cube which we are just
going to reset and make 20 by 1 by 20 to
kind of get us a ground here and we're
gonna just rename this ground then we
can make another object right-click 3d
object sphere let's again reset this
move it up just a bit let's call this
ball and yeah I think it looks pretty
good like this you will notice that
right now that everything is very blown
out because these two are completely
white so let's just go in and make these
some materials where we can then change
the color so let's go to project
right-click go under material and let's
make a ground material and also
right-click material and make a ball
material and I'm just gonna change the
albedo on the pole here to be a bit
darker and then drag that onto the ball
and then the ground we can maybe make
that a color so let's just make it a bit
red here cool so now that we have this
set up you some things could become very
apparent first of all we have this
nice-looking shader on the ball with
some nice glossiness and this metallic
feel and you can also see that we have
some reflection from the spy the skybox
on to our ground so what is going on
here
well with unity 5 a lot of stuff has
changed about the way that we render
images so first off we there has been
introduced a whole new lighting system
it's called enlighten and basically it
allows for things like global
illumination which means that we can
have lighting bounds around the scene so
that lighting isn't just direct but we
also get this indirect lighting that
happens when light bounces off objects
and that can be colored depending on the
properties of the objects so that makes
everything look much more much more
interesting we also have a bunch of new
stuff - the shaders here I'm going to
talk about that in a second and then we
also have the ability to get lining from
our sky park systems and stuff like that
so I'm gonna get into everything but
first thing that I want you to notice is
that we have a soft shadow here and this
is different because also make sure that
you are in you have select the lighting
up here just to make sure that that's
okay but that's different from the
normal unity free version because soft
shadows used to be a pro feature what
has happened with a unity 5 is basically
all the stuff that used to be pro and
the stuff that used to be free and now
all free that means that what was before
unity Pro is now called unity personal
Edition and then we have some extra
stuff that now costs so everything that
concerns the engine such as soft shadows
or whatever or image effects and all
that it's available to us as long as we
don't make a huge amount of money each
year and everything except the dark
theme so if you're very very fond of the
dark theme you'll still have to purchase
that but stuff like cloud building the
team license and these extra features
and still also building to certain
platforms does still cost money and this
is a really great way to do it because
it allows us to create very very
powerful full software using this a free
editor cool so that means that free soft
shadows are free you can see that they
are also selected by default and what we
can also do is we can go ahead and
right-click go under light point light
and you will notice here if I just drag
this up and go to the shadows and select
soft shadows that soft shadows will
indeed
also work with point lights so that's
super super cool cool so let's just
delete that light there actually let's
have it there I changed my mind so
that's going to be the object no light
I'm just gonna control the scene this
that's easier cool just so we have some
more data more three-dimensional
lighting so it doesn't come from just
one place that looks pretty cool and
what I want to dig into now please
select this as static and also the
directional light as static that will
allow us to do some more effects so what
I want to do now now I've talked about
shadows is talked a bit about the new
shaders so unities shader system has
been pretty much redone from scratch
it's introduced a whole new kind of
shader called a physically based shader
or
PBR for physically based rendering and
what a PBS I physically based shader
does is that it describes the property
of our object that describes it using
terms that we use in real life such as
how metallic something is or how shiny
or whatever and then it emulates that
inside of our scene and what this allows
us to do is first off it's very easy to
create and describe the way that you
want your object to look but also you
don't have to kind of fake the look of
every object because what we did before
was we wrote a bunch of custom shaders
or at least if you were able to or found
some on the internet and you customized
then uncheck them and they look really
good in the scene but as soon as you put
them into another lighting condition
everything started looking bad again the
cool thing about physically based
rendering is that we describe the
properties of the object and so no
matter where we place it it's going to
look absolutely beautiful so that's the
really cool thing and to show you this I
want to quickly download some textures
so let's head into the unity asset store
I'm just going to lock in here
so I'm just gonna pause the recording
for a second and I'll be right back I'm
back now and I've locked in and what I
want to do is just find some textures
and materials so we're gonna go under
the textures and materials tab there and
I found some pretty cool and looking
ones if we go ahead and sort by price we
only want the free ones I'm just gonna
see if I can find them here I did find
some some nice ones we might need to go
into my browsing history so let's do
that
let's go in here and that's search for
ground we have the ground textures pack
so you can just search for that hit
download on that and the out or the
outdoor ground textures you can also
download that I'm just gonna go with the
outdoor ground textures I think if we go
in here we can see that they are with
normal specular and height maps for
general use and that's going to be
really cool we want something other than
just the diffuse map so let's import
those and I also found another package
as soon as it's done importing here that
you might want to check out and that was
oh let's see if I can I can remember
this one second I'll just check what it
was okay so I'm back and I've found it
it was the tileable cobblestone texture
so let's just import that one also so
now that we have these imported you can
of course import whatever you want to
I'm just gonna use these for
demonstrational purposes so and now that
we have these imported let's start out
by making ourselves a ground so let's
change this back to white excuse me
let's go under the ATT textures go on
the ground William one and under the
ground one we're gonna find a diffuse
map which we can drag into the little
square here this albedo here is what we
called the diffuse and we are gonna
change from the shader up here from
standard to standard specular because we
have a specular map and the standard
shader here I haven't explained this is
basically where we do
99% of our material work this is gonna
do so much for us as you can see this
room for specular Maps normal Maps
height Maps emission and detail maps and
secondary maps and all that it has so
much
very nice functionality and the great
thing about it is that if you don't use
some of these parameters it's not gonna
actually compile the code so it's not
going to be any slower if that if you
use this and don't use all of the
properties then if you were using a
highly optimized or shaded that didn't
do as much this is very very optimized
and it works really great
so the albedo is what we usually call
the diffuse and then the specular we're
gonna drag in our specular map and as
you can see what this does it it
basically prevents the whole surface
from being this reflective specular
thing and only makes the important parts
which are basically the rocks here
actually have some specular value and
I've we select the ground again here we
can then drag in the normal map this is
a non-standard normal map and you can
see just how huge in effect this can
have I'm just gonna maybe bump this down
a bit so something like zero point maybe
zero point four it's gonna be plenty I
think I don't want to overdo it with the
normal map this is already quite a lot
and then we have a height map and it's
not too apparent on this one so I'm not
going to talk about it yet but I will
talk about it when we do the ball it's
it's very much clearer there so that is
just a quick overview on how to set up a
basic material in using the new of
physically-based
a shader a standard shader and then
let's set up the ball here let's again
change the albedo to white let's go into
cobblestone and we can drag in the
cobblestone a specular oops under the
map there and let's change the timing of
this to may be three by three oops
down there three by three something like
that that looks pretty good
and we can kind of change this from
actually let's remain at standard here
then we're gonna drag in the normal map
and we're gonna drag in our displacement
map under your height map and you can
see that it already sets up a very
nice-looking material what we can do is
we can change just how metallic we want
this object to be so if you want this to
be completely metal you can see what
this actually does now it looks like a
metallic surface but this rock here is
very not very much not metallic and so
we want this to be pretty low in fact I
want it to be zero and the smoothness
here is kind of the smoothness of the
specular and and kind of the reflection
on from the outside and I want this to
be fairly smooth but I still want to see
some detail so maybe 0.4 are pretty
close to the default it's going to be
pretty good for this texture you can
maybe make it even more faded but I
still want to have some some nice
details and wrinkles there I think that
looks pretty nice cool now it almost
looks wet we might want to make it a bit
more smooth or a set the smoothness a
bit lower I should say cool and here
let's try and adjust the height medicine
map slider to see what this does so we
can bump it up and you can see that it
extrudes certain parts of the image and
we can bump it down and you can see that
it goes back to flat so that's basically
what the height map does and the
displacement map here is not not genius
I think it could be a whole lot better
but you get an understanding of what it
actually does oops that was for the
ground I'm gonna go back to the ball
here and just give it a bit of height
maybe 0.3 it's gonna be fine so you can
see these displacements up here which is
really makes the material look more
realistic when you view it from
side cool so that was an overview of the
physically based rendering shader this
figures could be so long and I've
already talked a bit about global
illumination I'm just gonna show you
what this does under the light settings
and we're gonna look at a mission also
so if I go in here and create some new
objects first off I want to mark the
ball and ground here as static and you
can see down here that it starts doing
some rendering and that's because on
static objects it's going to calculate
some some nicer looking lighting so
everything that is gonna be static
please mark it as static so now go into
3d object and let's make a cube here
let's drag the sky up here and I'm just
going to duplicate them and move them
over and find the left one of these I
want to make a new material let's make a
new material oops right-click create
material let's call this red drag it
onto the left guy let's change this
color to red now go on select both cubes
and mark them as static and you will see
something magical happen as soon as it's
baked here you can see that we have
spill light so we have light that
bounces from our two light sources onto
the red surface and then the bounce
light that returns from the red surface
is now colored both from the the source
of the light and depending on the
properties of the material here which is
of course very red and it's gonna spill
onto the object over here so that's
really cool that's called bounce light
or spill light so now that we have that
set up I'm just gonna show you how you
can adjust some lighting settings under
the lighting panel
so I have mine over here you can find it
under window lighting cool
I'd like to dark it by the inspector
panel what we can do here is we can
first off adjust our skybox
this one up here we can then say what
are we want our ambient lighting source
to be before I am being
it was pretty much pretty much could
pretty much only be a one single color a
one single color here and it really
didn't look too good now the light will
depend on from will the color of the
line and the intensity of the light will
be colored depending on the skybox so
the direction of the light will actually
matter and you can see what the scene
would look like if we complete the turn
off the ambient light so let's drag down
the ambient intensity here and you can
see that now we have no ambient light
and if we disabled our point and
directional light in here and it bakes
you can see that we almost can't see
anything we still can't see a little bit
and the reason why is under lighting we
also have reflection intensity so if we
pump that down everything gets black but
differ flection intensity here is really
really cool it allows us to adjust on a
global level
how much reflection we should see from
the Sky box and then also from
reflection probes which I'm not going to
go into but that allows you to create
reflection depending on not only the Sky
box but the actual objects in scene so
that's super cool and you can of course
adjust the bounces and and play around
with all that so I'm just gonna bump up
the ambient and insensitive to and turn
back on the lights so we have this cool
looking scene again and you can see here
but the reflection intensity does to a
scene here I actually think it's a bit
too high by default at least for our
scene here we can go into our each
object here and manipulate it but I
think we should just do it on a global
level so I'm just gonna bump down the
reflects and intensity a bit there this
looks a bit better cool
you also have a bunch of other settings
I'm not gonna go too much into them but
we can boost the indirect lighting
that's going to happen and you can see
what that does that's a cool slider to
have we also have the bounce boost the
bounce lighting I was taught
about when something hits and then
bounces off and I could go on forever
just wanted to show you kind of that
that does then we're gonna look at
emission so if we take and duplicate
this object one more time and notice
that it's marked as static and we can
just scale this up a bit maybe and then
scale it down is cable scale it up on
this axis so we have this nice flat
surface that we can maybe turn over a
bit this process is going to be very
known to you if you ever used blender
blender sliding system called cycles and
this allows us to create light emitting
from a surface so let's make a new
material for this create material and
let's call this emission let's drag it
on the plane and let's just let leave
the albedo and the metallic Ness and all
that we're gonna go under emission and
set this to one notice you can both get
this from a texture or from just a
single color actually let's set this to
five to make it more apparent and we can
maybe change the light here to a
greenish color or red or whatever you
want to do so let's do a a a brachial
here without it being too girly and
let's just bump this down again so maybe
something like three so you can see what
that does and that's actually a really
really cool feature awesome so now that
we have that in place I just quickly
want to show you also that if we take
our ball here move it over create a new
material for this called reflection and
drag it onto the ball what we can do is
we can bump up the metallic Ness and you
can see just how reflective these
materials can be and if we even tidy up
the smoothness here it you can get these
really cool-looking glossy surfaces
which will of course also be affected by
a height map or a normal map so you can
get these really cool-looking wrinkled
metallic surfaces just a cool tip for
you
awesome so that pretty much concludes
the whole lighting part of our rendering
essential so to say and the last part is
just that we now have image effects
available this was before a pro feature
so if we maybe go into our game view
here and adjust it so it looks a bit
better so let's find our camera let's
whoops for some reason my unity froze
there for a sec okay it's back so if we
move up this camera actually I think
that's a feature called center camera on
view move to view here come troll all
shift and then align with view control
shift F there we go so now our camera
will be aligned and if we bring up our
game view some we reason that closed
there we go
you can see that our camera sees what we
see then we can go under edit project
settings quality and make sure this is
set to fantastic indeed it is and then
at last we can import a package called
effects image effects are also under
effects there are a bunch of things
under effects and it's just gonna
process these so just wait for that I
think it's actually pretty annoying that
it isn't just called image effects I
don't think the new names are that
descriptive of the content for example
if you just look over it it's hard to
say where you would find for example
some sky boxes it's not under
environment for example so but it's just
gonna import these and hopefully we can
get done with this so we can move on to
the next segment concede it makes an
editor folder and some standard assets
under effects here so that's really cool
and what we can do is we can select our
main camera hit add component and we now
have image effects and we can maybe go
under bloom and go select the bloom here
so you can see we now have that effect
available that's really a favorite then
we can maybe select some camera
depth-of-field maybe so we can get that
going to you and this is going to look
really weird and you have all of these
available we could also go into color
adjustments may be making a color
correction or whatever we can do a
vignette also which is probably under
your camera here so we can pump that up
we have all these cool things to play
around with so this looks pretty
artistic so that's actually kind of fun
and you get the idea
awesome so that concludes the first
segment and let's go ahead and jump on
to the next one which is going to be the
audio mixer
okay so welcome to the audio segment
this is where we dig right into the
audio mixer that is now introduced with
unity five and actually probably the
largest workflow change that we see with
this new update is how we go about doing
audio in our game so that's really
really awesome and I have so much to
show you so let's just get right into it
now you can see I've set up this test
scene just using the same techniques
that I showed you in the rendering part
and it has this ball which I've called
the speaker this represents an audio
source that is in our scene of some
sorts and then we have a ground and what
I want to do if you haven't done this
already is right click down here go
under import package and import all of
the characters I've just done that
already so you don't have to wait and
this way we can drag in and a
first-person controller which you see
here under first person character under
character's first person character
prefabs and then FPS controller and
that's just dragging that in there and
the cool thing about this guy if we just
reset the transform and dragging up a
bit here to make him stand on our
surface maybe pull him back a bit too is
that he will have some if some audio on
him already with footsteps and jumping
and landing footsteps and jumping and
landing and we'll also be able to move
around so we can see how that effects
and the sound so if we play now as you
can hear we now have footsteps and I
will be able to hear this when we jump
inland so that's really cool and I've
also gone ahead and imported two free
packages from the unity asset store and
they're both under audio the one is free
game music and the other one is the
ambient sample pack so we're just going
to be using some sample audio both of
them are free and you can of course use
any audio you would like so what we are
going to do is first off we're going to
right click up here we're going to go
under audio and select all
your source we already had have an audio
listener which is the other part of any
kind of audio setup on the FPS
controller we should have an audio
listener it should be here somewhere
maybe under the first person character
that we have it on with the camera we
have an audio listener just make sure
you have one and only one of those and
now we also have an audio source and in
the source we're going to drag in some
ambient sound and this is a rain loop on
29 seconds we're gonna drag that into
the audio clip this looks pretty
familiar except we have a bunch of new
settings down here and then we're gonna
make sure it plays on awake and that it
will loop the priority you can just
leave us be and the volume we're gonna
adjust another way just make sure that
the spatial blend and yes you can now
splenda tween 2d and 3d simulation so
that's really awesome it's pushed all
the way over to 2d excuse me
cool so what will happen now if we just
rename this to ambient sound and and we
hit play we can hear some rain so that's
really cool and this will stay with us
no matter where we walk so our direction
and our placement in 3d want effect this
at all what I also want to do is I want
to on the speaker here place and a audio
source component so simply type in
source and hit enter you can see that it
places a source right here and what I
want to do here is I want to drag in
some music to this so this with love
from vertex to do for that's what I'm
gonna drag under here make sure place on
awake make sure it loops and now drag
the spacial blend all the way to the
right so now when we hit play we can
hear footsteps we can can hear rain and
when we get closer to this we should
also be able to hear some music so that
will depend on where we face
so you should be able to hear this go
from one monitor to the other if you
don't then that's fine then the stereo
audio hasn't covered gone over to
wherever or whatever device you're
watching on but the main thing is that
it is indeed a stereo sound here and it
emulates 3d space but that is not really
new the new pod comes now with the audio
mixer tada this is a really really
awesome feature it's something that I've
been missing in unity for so long and
I've tried a bunch of different plugins
and all that to make it make it it work
but nothing has been quite satisfied
satisfactory as to the level that this a
new mixer is so if you can the window
you can select audio mixer it's also
under control aid and we're simply going
to go ahead and hit the plus sign here
to create a new mixer and we're just
gonna call this one main mixer excuse me
there and you can see that we have a
bunch of settings up here first off most
importantly we have the groups and
basically the groups allows us to split
a bunch of different style sounds into
some different groups here or buses
maybe and what we can do with those is
we can control they are we can we can
control the volume we can control
whether their solo muted and we can give
them a bunch of effects so to
demonstrate list let's make three new
groups first off we're going to make and
one for music we are also going to make
one for groups you don't want that to be
inside of music we want it to be inside
the master you can nest these groups
which is really cool then we want one
for let's do player with footsteps and
all that and we also want one called
ambience so you can see we now have
three sliders and the master slider each
representing volume and if we just go
ahead
play right now who noticed that the
audio plays just like before but we
don't get any response in here and the
reason why is we need to assign the
different audio sources to these groups
so if we go into let's say first of
speaker find the audio source you can
see it has an output and we need to hear
a give it a mixer group that it should
output to so this idea of routing
different sources to different channels
it's really really important so you can
either go in here and select something
or you can drag from the project down
here you can say the cool make sure
setup we have here or you can even drag
it from the mixer that's up to you I'm
just going to drag them the mixer here
so drag the music into there oh my god
keeps going I'm sorry cool so now that
we have the mixer or the music main
mixer group selected there let's also
select our FPS controller find our audio
source and it's everything is under in
one audio source E and we're simply
going to drag in the player that and
then find our ambient sound and dragon
ambience there so you can of course have
multiple audio sources assigned to each
group that's kind of the point
but this is just a demonstration so I
don't want to go into that so what we
can do now is we can hit play and we
will see the different mixers actually
showing the current volume in decibels
that is going through the mixer channel
and this is super awesome and if we dock
it down here by the console move this up
going to game view you can see that the
player will also react when we do some
footsteps and the cool thing about this
is that we can while we are playing edit
these settings so to show you this I'll
simply click Edit in play mode and this
will allow you to edit you have to click
this or you cannot
actually change anything and the reason
why this button is here is because
changes to the audio mixer will carry
over from planar but normally when you
make a change it just disappears as soon
as you stop playing this is really great
for testing but it's annoying if you
want to tweak things while the game is
running which is very important for
audio that's why we have this button so
simply click Edit in play mode and now
we can for example adjust the volume so
we can maybe make the ambience a bit
louder drag down some of the player
footsteps I think they are just a bit
too much and we'll just leave the music
be I think so this way we can really
adjust our mix and I mean we can go all
kinds of crazy here you don't have to be
as limited as I am here in my in my
options so we can just maybe drag down
the music
a tiny bit there cool so other than
adjusting music we also have the ability
to add effects and this is where it gets
really cool so a good example of this is
actually with this music you I have this
red ball set up to be a speaker but
sound coming from a speaker isn't just
natural clear sound often if it's a a
mid to low end speaker that will be some
distortion it will maybe change the the
sound spectrum the frequencies a bit
maybe to make them sound better if it's
a bad speaker will make them sound worse
and so we can go in and add some effects
to this to make it sound like there's a
speaker in-game so let's move a bit
closer to the ball here so we can really
hear the music and I just quickly want
to add some effects to this so I'm gonna
drag back the audio mix up here so we
can go away from from game
and into the audio mix instead dragged
down the console here and let's add some
effects so let's select the music let's
go and it was right here called wet says
add effect or you can click add here the
effects will appear down here just like
any DAW digital audio workstation that
you might have used in the past if if
any if you have them all this will be
very familiar you have the mute button
which of course mutes the solo body
which solos the track and then you have
this B this is for bypass and that
basically turns off all the effects on
on your channel which basically allows
you to click the listen with and without
effects and compare so if we click add
effect here now we can go under and we
can add some different effects first off
I want to do a program EQ this allows us
to change the frequencies the frequency
spectrum you can hear that I can turn
off all of the high frequencies so it
gets really die or we can turn off the
low frequencies or we can boost a
certain part of the spectrum for example
if we just wait for the music to come
back here we can boost them de lives
boost the highs
boost the myths so you can really hear
what that does
so from in my case here I want to kind
of maybe boost the middle channel and
then we can add another effect and for
this I want to do a low pass so we cut
off some of the high range here I want
some resonance so this will really
distort the the music and you can play
around with the cutoff frequency that
sounds pretty good I think
that will turn off all of the clarity in
the sound and then maybe a bit of
distortion please note that distortion
will make your music quiet a lot louder
so you want to bump down the volume and
then bump up this Distortion something
like this actually sounds pretty good
and you can listen with and without
defects so you can hear it's much louder
but it's also distorted I'm interesting
about that I'm down with it actually
when we had this close close we wanted
to really fill out the space
yeah I think that actually sounds really
really nice and why don't we go ahead
and just have a listen from the
beginning here so if we go into game out
I'm gonna stop talking and just play
around this
cool so now that actually sounds like a
speaker in our game one quick thing I
want to mention about the audio mixer
now that we've been over sources groups
and effects snapshots we're not going to
go into views snapshots are basically
presets of settings so if you've made a
configuration like I have here it's a
good idea to store it in a snapshot and
then you can quickly shift between
different configurations for example if
we hit play here I'm going to the audio
mixer oops we go into the audio mixer
hit edit in play mode create a snapshot
call this maybe no music then we can
turn off the music here and maybe bump
up the ambience instead and the player
sound and now you can hear that when I
switch between these they will animate
so that's a very quick and easy way to
animate a bunch of parameters very
easily so you don't have to go in
through code and just change all of them
at the same time awesome and you can of
course add one of them as default by
writing in and heading said as start
snapshot so that will do awesome so that
was basically the audio walkthrough now
we're going to continue on to the next
segment
so now we're gonna have a look at
scripting what has been changed in terms
of programming in unity so first of all
I quickly want to open up unity here of
course and show you a scene I've set up
so this is very basic it's just using on
the technique showed under the render
segment where I have this ground I have
light I have a ball with a bread
material on it and I've added a rigid
body which is currently using gravity to
that make sure it's not marked at sass
static because this is going to be
moving and I also have an FPS controller
standing on the ground this is from the
standard asset so if you right click on
import package characters then it will
be under the character's first person
character and then prefabs there is the
FPS controller just to get your card up
so now when we hit play you'll notice
that we have a ball here that we can
push around we can also jump and look
around ourselves cool so what we want to
do now is have a quick look at what has
changed in terms of scripting and really
there are so so many changes to the
Unity API and there's there are so many
additions that a bunch of cleanups a lot
of code is going to run much more
efficiently now and really one thing
that has been improved quite a lot is
how quickly we can instantiate objects
and that's very awesome so I'm gonna
show you a case where we are gonna
instantiate a bunch of objects and and
just show you how fast that is now I'm
also gonna show you the new physics
system how easy it handles a bunch of
objects at the same time it's now been
upgraded to physics 3.0 I believe and it
it's definitely got a gotten a huge
update which makes it much easier to
have this huge amount of objects or
rigid bodies in a scene so we are going
to combine those two instances and then
I'm also going to show you the changes
with these easy component
scissors so to do this I'm going to
create a script and right now that is
going to spawn a bunch of balls and on a
line that are then going to fall so in
order to do this I've made the spawn in
to a prefab by dragging it to the
project panel and now I want to make a
an empty game object so control-shift-n
or command shift then if you're on a Mac
and I'm just gonna call this underscore
spawner it really doesn't matter what
it's called and I'm going to reset the
transform and then move it up to where
and we want the balls to start spawning
on outputs and then go on to add
component new script and we're gonna
call this one spawner then let's double
click it to open it up in monodevelop
and it's just gonna take a moment cool
I'm just gonna assume a bit in on the
code here and everything looks pretty
much like it used to
I'm gonna delete the start method and
instead make two variables the first one
is going to be a reference to our bolt
so that's gonna be if off type that's
actually gonna be a public so we can do
public transform and then we're gonna
call it ball then we're also gonna have
a private and this is just gonna be a
boolean called do once that we'll make
sure that we only spawn all of these
balls once and not each frame we're
simply gonna use the update function
method to check whether or not we are
going to spawn so in here we're gonna
say if time that time which is no amount
of seconds that has elapsed since we
started playing if that is bigger than 3
so if 3 seconds has gone by I want the
balls to start spawning and in order to
spawn a huge amount of objects we're
going to be using a for statement so for
int I equals 0 when I is less than and
then maybe 100 we can maybe make this
into a int variable here up here so we
might say ammount spawn amount so if I
is less than amount then we're going to
default this to 100
then we want to increment I ribs and
then inside of this for statement we
want to instantiate and what we want to
instantiate is the pole and the position
is going to be point out transform that
position and simply using quaternion
that identity so it doesn't have any
rotation whatsoever and then down here
we want to set dowon's equal to false
because we are going to be d folding
this to true and then here we want to
check if it's true so if time is greater
than 3 and dowon's it's true so that's
the setup that will make sure that when
the 3 second mark has passed its gonna
spawn 100 balls and then it's gonna make
sure that it doesn't do it next frame
also but currently they all spawn in the
same position I want them to do this
kind of just this huge row of objects so
we're gonna create a way for us to
change the position depending on the
increment so in order to do this let's
create a temporary variable this is
gonna be of type vector 3 this is going
to be called past four position and
we're gonna make this equal to a new
vector3 vector 3 being a variable that
stores three numbers in here we're gonna
type transform got position X I simply
wanted to have the x position of a
spawner then it's going to be
transformed that position dot Y and then
plus I so as I gets bigger as we spawn
more balls it's gonna set the position
higher so it's gonna start from the
button and then just spawn upwards you
can of course do I times 2 if you want a
bigger space between them I'm pretty
sure that my ball here has a 1 1 1 scale
so this is just gonna put them as close
as they can be and then transform dot
position dot Z
because we want to emulate that or
duplicate that from the spawner itself
so now we can hit save we can head back
into unity see that no areas are here
but it's gonna note tell us that past is
not used which is very important because
we have to put pass in there great so
now we should see it working and we can
click on a spawner and we can drag in
the ball and set the amount just leave
that 200 for now now when we hit play we
should see that we spawn into the scene
and right about now it spawns a huge
amount of balls and then they're just
gonna stand there jump if I walk into
these they're gonna start falling at a
pretty rapid rate so we have this huge
amount of balls falling down and the
recording might not show this but
actually we have a pretty good frame
rate throughout this demonstration I'm
just going to put on the stats here so
you can see our frame rate now we spawn
not a single frame drop here and now
with all of the rigidbody start moving
and the FPS is completely steady so
that's really amazing both on behalf of
the physic system but also when it comes
to this spawning operator I will however
show you that it does do some
calculation because this way this case
where I adhere is an excellent example
of how we can use the profiler because
if we can't see a visual change on the
FPS or if we can but we don't know
what's causing it we can use the Unity
profiler to tell us what is currently
taking up a lot of performance use both
on the CPU the GPU memory wise on the
physics system everything is there and
it's really amazing and it's now
available because all of the pro
features are now free so if we go under
window and select the profiler or
control 7 and some
the target here actually I'm gonna dock
it down here by the console and then
just drag it up so we can see both the
game view and the profiler at the same
time you can see we have a bunch of
different things here and right now it's
excluding the GPU but we can just
include that if you want to so it's
right here but I'm simply not gonna
include it because it's not really that
important for the test we're doing here
and I'm gonna check on everything
physics vsync TIR there's every
parameter that is I want to see it here
and make sure it's set to record now we
can hit play and we can see in real time
what is happening and as soon as they
spawn we should see a spike cool
so the first spike we see is right here
but you can see there are multiple
spikes in here and some of them are
caused by rendering some of them are
crossbow physics and it also has this
very annoying vsync which doesn't really
tell us a whole lot it spends quite a
lot of time on it but vertical synching
is something that you can choose to have
a nut to have not really something that
is easy to optimize so we can disable
that this makes everything quite a bit
easier if we are not focusing on the
rendering which we are not right now we
can disable that too and also stuff like
the garbage collector global
illumination and others it's not
important to us right now it's really
only the physics system and script and
the physics systems you can see down
here so we're gonna disable the physics
system on the CPU also but just notice
before we do how small of a change there
is from this point where it's only our
character controller - over here where
we have actually a hundred rigid bodies
acting at the same time it's really
amazing
so now let's disable that and we can see
now only the scripts how much they take
up and you might be wondering well why
are there even any why is that even even
happening anything up until this point I
mean we are not running in the scripts
but yeah
scripts are of course included with the
first-person controllers and that's what
you're seeing but if we go over here to
the first spike right about there we can
see this that wait for target FPS takes
us
61% please just ignore that but if we
select our behavior update this is where
we see all the farm on our behaviors
obtaining so if we go under this we can
see spawner at update that's our
spawners update function and inside of
this we should see an instantiate call
and we can see that it has a hundred
calls how much time it takes it takes
six milliseconds which is amazing
considering how many respawning and the
percentage of time it's taking up on the
CPU that frame so that's really amazing
and we can even go further in and see
what the instantiate function is
actually doing so this profile is is
completely amazing on isolating issues
finding out what is taking time really
comparing like on an actual use case on
an actual use level what method is best
for doing what and and all that because
you can theorize about performance all
you want and this actually shows you a
graph so that's really really awesome
and you can hook it up to an external
build and do all kinds of stuff
with that that's a feature that is very
handy to have in unity free now so I'm
gonna clear that out and that will
pretty much conclude the no no no no
that will conclude the profiler part but
I still have to have to talk about the
most important API change to scripting
which is removing component property
getters haha so what does that mean that
basically means that you are going to
see quite a bit of kit component when
scripting so let's try out a use case
here so let's say then we want our balls
to spawn but we also want to tell the
balls that they shouldn't that the
rigidbody should disable gravity we want
some no gravity
boss that's sounding wrong but what we
are gonna do here is we are going to go
into a scene we're gonna drag down a
spawner here so we have we are able to
interact with these so-called low
gravity balls here so then we're gonna
have head back into unity and what we
can do is of course we can collect the
rigidbody and then access one of its
properties called gravity and set that
to false so in order to do this first
off we want to collect our instantiated
prefab and we do this by making a
temporary variable so that's for example
say game object and then we're gonna
call this just go game object equals
instantiate and we are gonna have to
tell you that it should instantiate as a
game object so you make sure to cast it
and then here we can say that go dot
rich a body and know why is this not
working I mean if we say go dot
transform it's here if we say co-taught
game object it's here but if we say code
that rigidbody it's not and it's not
with collider either or audio why is
this well that's because unity has made
a choice to go in and remove some of the
easy accessors that they've made they
have made these quick component getters
so we don't have to do get component
each time but they found out that this
actually confuses more than it gives and
it also doesn't very very clearly show
how much performance
it actually takes up it looks like we
are not doing a gate component cold but
really we are so that functionality has
now been removed to make everything more
explicit in our code I really like the
decision some newer members often don't
because they now have to write more code
but really it helps you look at or
understand what the code is doing
so we have to do go that getcomponent
then find the rigidbody component Oh
kick component to be rigid body like
this and then we can do that gravity
use gravity equals false this is now the
new way to access in the rigid body and
it's the same with the audio it's the
same with Collider it's the same with
all kinds of components so that's very
important that you understand that now
so let's save that and let's head back
into unity and let's hit play here and
we should say that a bunch of balls born
oops
apparently we're getting a null
reference exception and this is growing
all kinds of crazy it's not set to an
instance of an object I'm sure we're
spawning but for some reason and might
not be finding the rigid body on the
component but it should be I'm just
gonna quickly look into this and find
out what I'm doing wrong okay so I've
found the solution and simply go ahead
and replace game object with transform
both here and here and will work so now
you see when we hit play wait a second
here for it to spawn there we go there
they are and they're now without gravity
as you can see they are floating off
into space so that's basically it for
this scripting part of this tutorial
hello everyone welcome to the last
section of this unity 5 primer in this
part we are going to have a look at the
new ability to export to WebGL what this
does is allows us to have it to use
unity or run unity games in the browser
without downloading and plucking so it's
much more smooth in the way in the sense
that your users don't have to install
some kind of ugly plug-in and then might
miss out on your game so if we just open
up unity here and this is going to be a
quick and walkthrough we can go to a
file build settings or press ctrl shift
B to open up the build settings and I
just have a small game here which I'm
actually just gonna show you here we
made that right before in the scripting
section and you can see just spawned
some balls and then you can go into them
and there are a hundred physics objects
acting together here I'm just gonna show
you how quick that runs in the browser I
am also just gonna bump up the
sensitivity of the FPS controller
because for some reason reason that goes
down when you are exporting to WebGL so
I'm just gonna find the first person
control here going to Mouse look and
change the X&amp;amp;Y sensitivity to something
like 6 instead just try this out in game
that's much much nicer cool so what we
can go in and do now oops just stop
playing there is go to the build
settings so ctrl shift V we can add the
current scene make sure that you have a
scene added there make sure that you go
down and select WebGL and it's currently
only in a preview version it won't it
will have quite a few bucks so be aware
of that and actually the first time I
tried to build I ran into one currently
I with this configuration and the scene
it won't build for me if I select slow
which means that it will build fast so
instead as the optimization level I have
to select fast you can play around with
Matt and really it takes some time to
export as is you can also check
you want a development build I'm also
going to leave that off because I had
some trouble with that too but again
this is a preview so once you're happy
with that and have went into your player
settings and maybe typed in their
company name and the product name which
is going to be awesome
physics red balls all over of destiny of
course and put in an icon and all that
then we are ready to hit built and to do
that you can maybe make a builds folder
which I've already done and I've already
built it because it takes again quite
some time so once you've done that you
can head into the folder going to unity
5 primer builds and you can see that
there are a bunch of folders here we
have the compressed data we have the
release also some data files and then
the template data and the template here
is really just the style of the webpage
if we open this up with notepad plus
plus here just gonna remove the other
things I've been doing here you can see
that you can adjust the CSS file here
this is simple pretty standard CSS also
you can adjust how you want your a page
to look and you also have some different
images and then we of course have the
index page itself which is you can of
course also edit this is just normal
HTML with some JavaScript in in it and
yeah so that what you that's what you
have the ability to kind of add it if we
right click on this you're gonna have to
select open with Firefox and the reason
why is Firefox is actually the only
browser currently that is supported if
you want to run this in Chrome which I
assume or at least hope that most of you
want then you're gonna have to download
Chrome 35 which is currently in beta and
the reason why it doesn't work with 34
is because it it sometimes freezes
because that's an issue with that
so if if that's a problem if you don't
want to get the beta just download
Firefox it's a very quick install I've
done that so that works quite I'm fine
so as you can see just opens up we have
this cool interface here you can play
around in your scene here you can see
the balls jumping up and down and you
can maybe even make this full screen you
can see just how how slowly it is to
move the camera here so again you want
my drone to rebuild that and then we can
just walk into these and you can see all
of the objects falling down and actually
a very nice frame rate so that's it's
having no trouble handling over or just
about a hundred physical objects so
that's a a really great performance so I
just wanted to quickly show you how that
actually works and that it actually does
from wake somewhat at least so yeah that
was just the WebGL part of this video
and that pretty much concludes the whole
unity 5 primer video I hope you really
enjoyed it that it lifts up to
expectations I've spent quite a lot of
time it's it's really a long one so if
you've made it all the way through
congratulations you are a champ really
really well done and it would of course
mean a lot if you can share this video
to other unity users that you might know
so they can also get a hang of unity 5
I've really put some work into this
video so I hope you enjoyed it and I'll
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
