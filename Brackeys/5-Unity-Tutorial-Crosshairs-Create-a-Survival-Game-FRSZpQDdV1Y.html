of our survival games series done by
practice I am the CEO of Black Keys and
today is going to be a hopefully pretty
quick tutorial because I'm in a hurry as
always and it's going to be about how to
implement crosshairs so that the player
knows exactly where the center of the
screen is so let's go ahead and get
started maybe even some materials and
colors I know let's see how much time we
have
okay so I've opened up unity again again
and then yes so from our community and
we can just go ahead and drag the
animation clips that we created in the
last tutorial under our animations and
so save this and we can go ahead and
create the cursor crosser so what we
need to do is we need to open up some
kind of photo editing program some kind
of graphics program this could be GIMP
that's a pretty cool free alternative to
photoshop that which I will be using so
open something like that up and if you
don't know how to do this this will be
pretty simple but then you can just find
something online under what's called I
think it's pixel art or something like
that which you'll need some kind of
image that does not have a white
background else it will look real
so um okay so create a new new document
and we can just call it this cursor and
it's going to be about 16 by 16 pixels
but you can scale it down and it's just
a really small square and I'm going to
double click on the background and call
this BG and then just turn this layer
off
and then I'm going to create a simple
round shape it's nothing fancy and I'm
not going to teach you anything in
Photoshop it's just really basic so and
this this is going to be white you can
make it whatever you want and I'm going
to click and drag in the century holding
down alt and shift and yes that looks
about right and we can go ahead and take
the opacity down to about 70 and then we
can go ahead and save else and then
navigate to your unity project so - undo
my drop box under the D Drive onto the
draft box brackets no weight survival I
think it's called lettuce and then
assets and then here you can just save
as a Photoshop file because unity
recognizes this else you can go ahead
and save it as a PNG or jpg everything
will work also I think they use TIFF but
I'm not entirely sure gif is probably
not allowed but you can try that okay so
um it's safe and alright and then we can
go back to unity and that's the photo
editing part of this tutorial now we can
go ahead and create a new kind of game
object so go to game object create I'll
do and then hit the gooey texture pom
pom pom and one very important part of
the gooey texture is that it always
needs to you know need to know where it
is at so by default it's at the 0.5 0.5
and zero and the set won't change
everything anything sorry and the Z
won't change anything at all because
this is all relative to your camera so
if I go ahead and hit play this is
always stuck on your camera this is the
2d element and
won't change you can it's not acting in
the 3d space so you can just go ahead
and leave that at zero and if you want
this type of graphic to be anchored in
the corner then you can go ahead and
type 0 0 and in whoop and it will be
anchored in the left corner but this we
want to be anchored in the century so
and what do you use to adjust it you use
what is called pixel inset because there
are many forms of GUI GUI means
graphical user interface and there are
many ways to do it but basically pixel
inset is how far away this is from the
century but it could be from the center
it could be from the left side right
side it could be from the corners in
pixels the element should be so how far
away from some point the the GUI should
be in pixels and this way it will always
be the exact same distance from
someplace no matter your screen
resolution so this is what you'll need
to appear to adjusting it else it will
change when you maximize and minimize so
um but for now we are going to change
the texture first of all so you can go
ahead and drag the cursor element in
here and I don't know why I have named
this cursor this should be cross hair
I'm a little out of my mind today and
then you can change the texture to GUI
down here in the import settings and
this is really important because GUI is
much higher image quality than texture
this is important remember this UI is so
much better quality and can be it can it
don't need to be perfectly square
textures can only be a thousand 25 512
64 32 16 by 16 all this kind of stuff
GUI elements can be anything you want so
the bad size will just change this to 32
not that it will match and then hit
apply and then go into the unity
watermark small which is what our grill
element is needs and then you can change
the width to 16 and the height to 16 and
we can go ahead and zero out the pixels
inside now this won't make it perfectly
centered
this will make it centered from the
corner of the GUI element so we should
go ahead and say about eight and I think
it's eight may it might be minus eight I
think this should be the century but you
can do some testing on this later for
now we can just leave it at serious you
know it won't matter that much so now we
have this element in the center of a
screen and we can make this smaller we
can make it Baker just adjusting the
width and height or going into Photoshop
and doing it so let's rename this to
cross hair and yeah that'll be it
so that's it for this tutorial
um I'm sorry that it's so quick but I
haven't got time for any more and I'll
see you next time thanks for watching
you
