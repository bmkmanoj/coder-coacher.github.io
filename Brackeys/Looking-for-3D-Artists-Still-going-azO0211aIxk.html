everyone
since this is not a normal video I've
uploaded it as an extra on top of the
regular schedule if you follow me on
Facebook or Twitter you might know that
I recently made a post talking for 3d
artists to help me with a new project of
mine the project has now come a lot
further and I'm ready to include more
artists which is why I'm making this
video you should contact me if you're up
for a challenge and interested in
working together I'm looking for people
who are experienced in 3d modelling
sculpting and texturing it's definitely
a big plus if you have experience
creating character rakes and animations
and especially if you have made models
for the unity asset store or a similar
site so if you think that sounds like
you don't hesitate to throw me an email
at apply at brackish comm make sure to
include a link to your portfolio or
other previous works I'm excited to
bring more people on board the project
and I can't wait to hear from you guys
that's pretty much it for this video and
I will see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
