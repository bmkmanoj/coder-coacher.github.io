inventory system basics video in this
one we are going to be taking a look at
how to set up an inventory system and
customize it for your game using our
free to use inventory system and editor
extension available on the unity asset
story so if you don't have this editor
extension go ahead and download it or
you can go to our website and read about
it break east comm slash inventory along
with watching the demo and all that's
that cool stuff and I'm sure this system
will fit your game perfectly it's fully
customizable but anyway let's get on
with the video this is a tutorial so
first things first let's open up unity
and I assume you already have the pack
installed on the under the inventory
folder here so once you simply install
the pack from the asset store you get
one folder folder called inventory and
that's it so if we double click on that
you can see all the different stuff we
have in here and so in this one I'm
going to be showing you how to set up
the inventory system and just the basic
folder structure where you can find
things cool so let's move on
so the different folders first off let's
take the gizmos folder and just drag it
under the assets this will just allow us
to quickly find items and inventory
systems in our scenes now we have a
bunch of different folders most of them
are pretty self-explanatory along with a
written guide to on how to use this if
I'm moving too quickly or or you just
prefer reading about it we have a demo
folder where you can see an example of
how it's the some weapon items are set
up using the system we have the editor
which just has the editor script
extension
we have the tea UI where we have the
different GUI elements then we have the
guide the resources folder in here we
have the different skins and some sounds
and then at last we have the scripts and
the weapons weapon models and textures
which you can feel free to use cool so
let's move on the first thing we do is
to open up our window called inventory
you can also press control I and then we
can go under inventory here and now you
see a bunch of settings if you don't see
this you need to select the players so
we select the player and you can see the
tells us this section set up the
inventory system automatically and as
recommended just make sure to select the
player fill in the fields and hit the
set it up button so that's what we are
going to do first up we are going to
choose whether we want to include the
character sheet this is highly
recommended for especially for beginners
or intermediate users only advanced and
very experienced users should not
include this and the character sheet
scan this is if you have made a custom
skin we're just going to change that
later if you have it have made one so
we'll just leave that and now we have
the weapon holder and the weapon holder
is where the weapons are going to be
equipped to so basically if you have
arms like we have here we want it to be
inside of our armature right inside of
the hands so if we go down under our
main camera where we have our arms we
can browse through the different bones
down to the hand right the whole ride
and then we have the melee object which
is where we want weapons to be so we're
just going to drag the melee on there
and now we have the postgame ignore the
inventory screen that's the same as the
character sheet skin then we have an
option to do stuff like pausing the game
disabling the mouse movement or just
keep playing this
is a first-person game so I want to do
both so we both want to pause the game
and disable the mouse and then we want
to drag in on main camera there so cool
and this is just helping with finding
the mouse look component which is going
to be disabled now we can go ahead and
set it up so let's just hit the set it
up button and in the console view it
will tell us whether or not this was
successful in Acharya has been removed
from player II this is always done
before the inventory gets setup and the
inventory and character sheet has been
set up on player on a new object called
inventory and that's perfect for us so
now we can see under our play we have a
object called inventory and it has all
the different scripts and variables and
everything we need so now when we go
ahead and hit play it should work though
for our series we have a weapon
switching script which is not really
updated for this system a updated
version ism is included in the pack so
we're just going to remove that and then
we're going to remove the different
weapons which are on here so remove
those actually we're going to keep the
fists on for now but keep them disabled
so remove the iron mace and the knife
and that's just with your falling
following on with the survival game
series which you can of course also find
on our channel cool so now if we go
under game and hit the play button we
should be able to hit AI and this brings
up our inventory and character sheet
window and that's it for setting of the
inventory it's that easy now it's time
to get started creating some items but
we're going to show that in a different
video since we have many different kinds
of items you can set up I'm just going
to give you a quick tour of where you
can tweak settings though it's
recommended you set up items first
because it can be hard to judge whether
or not you should choose one option of
the other if you don't have something to
try it on so cool under the inventory
script this is where everything gets
stored so we can see the contents when
you pick up something it will go to this
array and we can define how many objects
can be in the inventory and across all
scripts which allow it we have a debug
mode which you can check so debug logs
will be casted down in the console which
is great if you are if you're building
on to the scripts as so so you can find
out where you have made mistakes under
the inventory display this should be
obvious enough this displays the content
of the inventory script so they are
dependent dependent on each other and we
have variables to treat the window in
different ways tweak the icon sizes and
the update list delay is something you
really want to stay away from in most
cases and the offset can the window be
dragged and the on/off button which you
can choose between any anyone you want
and if you're unsure on what a variable
does all you have to do is double-click
the script and it will open up in
monodevelop
so we're just waiting for it to open up
so rais'd great with awkward pauses in
then in a tutorial but we'll go with it
great so we open up the inventory
display here and you can see that every
single part of this script is fully
documented and it's like that with all
of the scripts and every single variable
is documented so we have the we simply
find in the name of the variable we
don't know what is doing let's say the
update list delay and then you can read
the comment this is a great explanation
of what the variable does if you're in
doubt
anyway let's move on quickly the
character sheet that's where we can
equip things - that's where we can equip
weapons and all that stuff then we have
a lot of tweaking for the GUI there and
the buttons can it be dragged the skins
and the weapon slot if you didn't get
the right the first time the inventory
post game scripts you have some
customization abilities here the audio
source here you can tweak the audio of
the inventory system which you won't be
able to hear in this video unfortunately
but it's great and you can tweak some
settings if you want to pitch things up
and down or change the volume and we
also have an automatic pitch + + -
feature which will make a deep it's just
a bit so the sounds doesn't sound too
repeated and it gets annoying at the end
and that we have the inventory audio
script with all of the different audio
clips which will load up if you don't
add custom ones okay great so that was
pretty much it for the inventory system
part of this tutorial just a quick note
to those of you who are following the
series unity 4.2 is out and so if you
download that update to the newest
version of unity you should be able to
get free directional shadows with the
free version of unity that's really
really awesome so I'm just going to turn
that on under our time of day script
here under the Sun I'm just going to
check shadows hard shadows it's
unfortunately only hard shadows but it
looks much better than without so now we
have shadows in game and that's just
really cool awesome so that was pretty
much it for this video guys I hope you
enjoyed it and I'll see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
