shooting tutorial done by Brad keys I am
the CEO of Brad keys and in this video
we are going to take a look at two
different methods for creating our
shooting mechanics they are the most
used and we won't go into all of the
detail with recoil and muscle flashes
and stuff like that but I will show you
how to script shooting and how to
implement it into a game also you can
choose on your own which of the methods
you want to use it really depends on the
style of your game we are going to be
implementing this raycast shooting
mechanic into our survival game which we
have a tutorial series on also on our
youtube channel so you can go ahead and
check those out if you want to but first
of all I have set up a scene here inside
of unity to demonstrate the differences
between the two kinds of shooting the
first one we are going to be taking a
look at is what's called prefab shooting
or at least I called it that and this
kind of shooting effect is pretty much
achieved by instantiating a bullet which
you have then attached a script to and a
rigidbody so you can make it shoot out
so you apply some force and then unit
sees collision system will do the rest
and once it hits something it will check
if the it will then send a message to
whatever game object it hit that the
game object here should apply have
applied damage to it and you can change
the damage on the bullet itself using
this variable but let's just first of
all before we get into the scripting let
me show you how this actually behaves in
game so let's hit play
and you can see that I've made this
little red bullet and once it hits the
enemy on the enemy dice and this is
because I've set the enemy to have 100
HP health points and I've set the damage
also to be 100 so if I go back into a
unity into the project pane and select
the bullet prefab that I've made we can
go under the damage variable and simply
change this to something less let's say
50 and therefore when I play the game I
need to hit the enemies 2 times before
they disappear but as you can see there
can be some errors with this that can be
glitches especially if I change this
back to 100 especially if we make it so
that the bullet goes even faster because
realistically a bullet travels so
incredibly fast especially with modern
weapons of course that you will have to
turn this up so you wouldn't even be
able to see the bullet so if I open up
the prefab shooting script this is how
it looks it simply has a variable called
the bullet and this is declared as a
type rigidbody because we want to later
influence the force and the positioning
of the rigidbody we simply wanted to
shoot out and it also has a speed
variable which can then be changed
inside of unity it then checks if the
player hits the mouse button and if he
does we want to instantiate the bullet
so instantiate the bullet and the
instantiated version of the bullet
should be called clone we then want to
apply a velocity to the clones or clone
dot velocity in the direction forward by
the speed amount the speed variable and
then I've just added that the clone game
object should
be destroyed after three seconds so that
our hierarchy won't be filled up
completely so when I play the game and
make some bullets you can see them start
to disappear after three seconds right
so that's the prefab shooting let me
just show you how this can be used wrong
so I have bye for now
and check this to our main camera the
prefab shooting script and if I change
up the speed to let's say 200 with which
would probably be more realistic first
of all the bullet goes really fast in
get it can go through walls also because
simply it's too fast for the unity
coalition system to handle and well I
have to shoot the enemies a whole lot of
times before they die
even though they should die on just one
shot so it can be really effective for
creating slower bullets or if you want
to be able to throw hand grenades but in
general if you want to be precise with
your shooting prefab shooting is just
not the way so let's go ahead and
disable this and select our play into
that and enable the raycast shooting
which I've of course attached to the
player and let's just see how this works
so I hit play and so we can see that I
have made a little particle that appears
wherever we hit something and of course
I am missing the crosshairs that would
be in the center of us scene in this
preview scene but so it can be a little
difficult to aim but once you get that
in place this should work just fine so I
can aim at the enemy and they will die
and I can pretty much guarantee that
this will happen every time one thing
though of course the enemies does have
to have otaku lighters attached to them
but that's also the case
with the prefab shooting let's take a
look at how reg has shooting actually
works so here we have quite a few things
going on and most of these are actually
because I wanted to show you what the
computer does behind the behind the game
so this is what the computer does so if
I just quickly hit play while I am in
this scene view also so I hit play here
there you go you can see that the
computer draws a red line between the
player of the camera what he is pointing
at and the enemy or whatever he's
shooting at and so the computer is able
to more realistically calculate how the
bullet would fly you then have to
implement stuff like gravity and other
forces that could manipulate the
trajectory of the bullet but this is a
much much better way to do it so that's
pretty much ray cast shooting so if I
just quickly open up paint we have in
the first example in the prefab shooting
example this is the prefab shooting we
simply take a point and this can be
whatever this would normally be an empty
game object this box is an empty game
object and we say that from here we want
to create a bullet prefab so we
instantiate a bullet around that and
then later we tell it that we want to
fly in a certain direction and this
would normally just be forward and this
can be done using a speed variable which
you can then change inside of unity so
that's it for the pre
fab shooting and because this bullet
this bullet prefab has a rigidbody
attached to it it will by default
collide with things in the same ray cast
shooting works somewhat similar but a
little different so this is the raycast
shooting and what we're doing here is we
have our player and whenever he presses
the button we tell the computer to draw
an invisible line let's make this screen
from the camera the way he looking he's
looking until it hits something whenever
it hits something we want to instantiate
some particles wherever it hits so here
we can instantiate some sparks some
blood then we simply say that we want to
send a message to whatever it hits and
this means that we can call a function
on the game from this script that is
attached to the game object that we had
so if this was our enemy this is our
enemy would then be red we can call a
function on the enemy script saying that
it needs to lose health so on that's
basically it for understanding the
different methods the one that we are
going to be using in a survival game is
the raycast shooting so let me just go
ahead and open up the actual is the
actual scene from our survival game and
this is how the game looks so far we
have an enemy down here and let me see
if I can find him there yes
that's our enemy and because we are just
testing some stuff out I want to bring
him over to our play so a little village
so if I go ahead and hit play
we can see him and he he actually also
chases us and for now we can only hit
him but we want to also create a
shooting mechanic so I haven't actually
modelled out a gun but this is not
important for this tutorial this the gun
would simply be graphics for now we just
want to create the script that handles
the shooting and so if we go under the
player the main camera we can see that I
have made an empty game object called
melee and under this melee I have a maze
and a sword and so I can parent all of
the different weapons that I want to
exist in my scene to this melee object
so if I go ahead and disable the mace I
want to create a new object called gun
and for now this is just going to be in
empty got a game object this is where
you would bring in your model the gun
and I'm just going to call this cut drag
it under the melee game object and let's
Center off the position and there we go
it's pretty much in this century of our
camera trajectory and a little out from
our player that looks good not that it
really matters as long as you don't have
a model
so let's actually add a script now so
hit the add component button new script
and call this let's call this ray cast
shooting ray cast shooting and I'll just
quickly capitalize the are actually
let's not do that because unity wouldn't
like us to so let's open up the script
in monodevelop and here we go this is
how it looks so let's start writing some
shooting functionality
we can go ahead and delete the function
start because we won't be using that and
let's make some variables the first
variable you're going to make is called
var and then we are going to write you
can write whatever you want but this is
basically just going to store the
particles that are going to emit
whenever our so called bullet hits
something so this could be sparks this
could be blood and you could also have
different particles emit depending on
what you what you actually had so I'm
just going to write our particles
actually I'm going to write effect and
then it's going to be a type transform
the next one is going to be a bar and
this is going to be the damage variable
so let's write the damage and by default
let's set this to 100 let's go into our
function update now and write some more
code so here we're going to type bar hit
and it's going to be a type raycast see
if I can spell this right raycast
hit yes and then a VAR ray of type ray
and it's going to be a ray and it's
going to be equal to camera don't main
dot screen point to Ray a vector
parenthesis vector three parenthesis
screen dot with x zero point 5 comma
screen dot height small letters screen
dot height type x some 0.5 and then
comma zero and our parentheses and uh
parentheses and then a semicolon now
what we're doing here is we are creating
two variables inside our function update
so these are constantly going to be
changed the first one is kind of is
called hit and it's going to basically
store all of the information of the game
object that we are going to be hitting
so our hit function or hit variable I'm
sorry it's going to store information
about our enemy so whenever we send out
the line and it hits the enemy it's
going to store information about what we
hit and where we hit it so that's its
that is something we are going to
reference later to found find our stuff
and to send a message to the game object
that it should lose damage so this is
our hit variable now let's go back and
see what our ray variable does array is
our actual ray cast so this is our line
and here you simply say that the century
of the screen should be sending out the
line straight forward so ray equals
camera dot main screen point array and
the screen point array function will
simply take it whatever position on the
screen mean that means a to D chord in
that and send out a lane line straight
forward from that
and here we declare
whatever exactly that's going to be and
it's going to be half down our screen so
we take the width and it's going to be
the width times 0.5 so that means about
here and it's going to be the height
times 0.5 so that means half of the
height width which gives us the center
of the screen and on the Z we just
wanted to start directly from the camera
and so that this is how we actually cast
out one of these lines all right so now
we want to check if the player actually
presses the input mouse button so
actually presses the fire button so if
input that get mouse button down you can
use anything here but I'm going to use
the mouse button down zero which means
the left mouse button then we want some
things to happen so let's open up some
parentheses so we can make some logic
with this if statement and inside of
here we want yet another if statement we
want if physics dot raycast so if the
raycast actually hits something ray hit
100 and separate them with commas and
make sure you close up the parentheses
so this will check this will make sure
that it casts out this ray that it
stores the information in the hit
variable and that it only does this if
it's inside a range of 100 so that you
won't be shooting stuff all the way
across the scene but feel free to play
around with this variable it really
depends on what you want to achieve so
let's open up some more brackets
so we can have some logic inside of this
new if statement and here we're going to
do quite a few things let's start out by
just actually writing the dyeing of our
enemy so we are going to write hit dart
transform that sent message and open
parenthesis and call this apply damage
comma the damage comment
send message options dot don't require
receiver close up the parentheses and
end with a semicolon now I know that
this code can be a lot and it is quite
confusing but let me just go what we
have going on so far we have the damage
variable which is going to simply tell
the computer how much we want to damage
the auto an opponent we have some
variables helping us in sending out the
array and looking at what it hits and we
have some if statements making sure that
this only happens when it actually hits
something and when the player presses
the fire button and if all of these
requirements are met then we want to
send a message to whatever we hit that
it should apply damage I can see that I
have misspelled this to Apple damage so
apply damage it's very important that
this name here is the same as the name
of the function that should apply the
damage so what's going on here is we say
it sold the hit that transformed that
send message that we want it to call a
function called apply damage and it it
has a requirement and that is that it
will use the damage variable so we call
the apply damage function
and send the damage variable with it and
if the D if whatever we hit doesn't have
this damage function then we just won't
care so it doesn't have to have a a
receiver then then nothing will happen
simply so I'm let's open up the script
that will actually be applied damage to
so go back into unity let's just quickly
see if we have any errors I can see that
we have two if physics that drink Astra
function update let me see I can't seem
to find any errors oh yeah I've missed a
parenthesis in the F statement so
quickly close that up see if we still
have any errors now via error free what
I love the thing now we can go and check
out our enemy script that's our enemy
and this was written in the survival
game series tutorial tutorial series and
you can just go ahead and check it out
but it's a very simple script called
enemy health and inside of here you can
see that we have a function called apply
damage which requires the damage
variable and it's simply going to say
that health will be less the amount of
damage so health minus equals the damage
so we will subtract the damage variable
that we are going to be sending from the
health all right so I'll just quickly
close on some of these scripts so these
are the two most important scripts and
let's go ahead and test out if this
actually works so open up the game hit
play and indeed when I click the button
and point on the enemy it does disappear
from our scene so that's it for the most
basic part of raycast shooting if you
also want to apply some particles we can
do
that so let's go back into the raycast
shooting script this can be really
helpful in showing the player where he
hits when he when he misses and so on
and so forth
so let's write VAR particle clone equals
instantiate and the instantiate function
is what you use whenever you want to
spawn an object so make an object up
here all of this Sutton so open up a
parenthesis and type effect the variable
effect we declared earlier comma hit dot
point comma quaternion dot look rotation
open up parentheses hit dot normal close
parentheses close parentheses and a
semicolon now this line makes a new
variable called particle clone and this
allows us to later delete this when it's
done playing but the important part is
not this the important part is the
instantiate effect at the hit point with
the rotation of catonian luke rotation
hit but normal now if you're not too
heavy on math basically what the normal
is so I'm going to open up a new paint
document basically what the normal is at
least in this case is if we have a
circle the normal would be this line so
what we're doing is we want if we hit
the if we hit the circle from a certain
angle let's say we hit it from here we
want to make sure that the particles are
facing this
way out and not emitting inside of the
the the circle of the enemy so we wanted
to mid emit outwards and this is better
done by simply taking the normal of that
point and so we can make sure that the
particles will emit the correct way and
so if we go back into the script editor
we simply instantiate the particles at
the position where we hit with this
normal rotation but you'd really I can
understand if it's it's difficult
wrapping your head around but for now
you can just go ahead and write it in it
should work in all cases and then type
off that destroy particle clone and dot
game object game object come after two
or three seconds you can choose I'm just
going to write two so this will just
make that make sure that we don't have a
lot of particles in our scene they will
be destroyed after two seconds and let's
quickly make a particle for us to
instantiate I've done this before hand
so I'm just going to use the one I used
inside of the example scene so I have it
under the shooting tutorial and then
pull it hit so I'm going to drag that
out into my assets folder so that is
select the gun and drag in the ability
to hit but you can always do this by
making a game objects create other
particle system to going around with it
until you are satisfied and then just
dragging it into the project to make a
prefab out of this so now that we have
added this effect let's hit play and
indeed when I hit the wall you can see
the different particle start emitting
and when I hit the enemy he dies and the
party
also mid so on that's it for shooting I
know this was quite a long video but it
is a difficult subject especially when
you want to add different forces
particle effects and so on and so forth
I hope you enjoyed the video and I'll
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
