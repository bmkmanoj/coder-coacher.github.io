everyone and welcome to this video in
creating a tower defense game in unity
today we're going to be creating a pass
menu for our game not really much to say
about that so let's just jump right into
it so as you can see I'm here in unity
and what I want to begin with is kind of
sketching out the UI so let's find our
overlay canvas and have a look at what
we have in here we currently have our
shop which sits at the bottom of the
screen and the game over menu that we
switch on and off as the game continues
and I thought we should go ahead and
create our paths menu in kind of the
same style as the game over menu uses so
what you could do is just duplicate the
game over menu and modify to suit our
needs or we could quickly recreate it
let's do that because not everyone has
watched the game over tutorial so let's
just go right click UI and create a new
panel and we basically just want to
choose none for this source image so we
can get rid of those roundings in the
edges and this allows us to simply
choose a color and we can go ahead and
choose the same color as the background
image for our game over menu
so let's actually just copy this entire
image component and paste it over here
cool then what we want is our some
buttons and we of course have some
buttons inside of our game over menu and
I'm actually just going to take one of
these buttons copy it over here and just
copy the main the menu button and just
have a look at some of the settings so
the image here we have again no source
image the color is completely white
everything else is pretty much default
values and we don't want this on click
event and we can delete the canvas group
so this is pretty much just a standard
button and then if we look at the text
you can see that we've put in menu here
we have Roboto medium as the font the
font size is at 40 and the color is kind
of the same color as our background
elements so you can just copy the hex
here if you want to and all of the other
settings so now I've showed you those we
can kind of continue here so let's move
this to the center of our screen maybe a
bit down and let's kind of widen it to
fill up a bit more something like that
looks pretty nice and let's go and write
continue here instead so if we press
this button of
is the pause menu is going to disappear
and we can continue with our game
let's also rename the game object itself
to continue and everything else seems
fine for now
so let's now drag this to be a child of
the panel that we created and let's
rename our panel to pause menu then we
can duplicate our continue button and
what I basically want to do is create
two buttons that are side by side here
one for restarting and one for quitting
and you could just do that like I did
here by moving and positioning them
individually but what I would rather do
is are whoops I went back a step too far
there is create an empty object and we
can kind of scale this to the size of
our continue button and then move it
down and this is going to just be a
simple horizontal layout group so now we
can take a few buttons say our first
continue button here and the second one
and you can see it scales it automatic
for us however we need a bit of spacing
so that's just bump our spacing up to
say 8 pixels and I think that looks
pretty great so we can call this one our
two buttons and then we can call the
first button retry and the second button
will call this one menu and of course we
need to need to change the text elements
as well so this one's going to say retry
not betray and this one is going to say
menu cool yeah so pretty simple UI but
it does the job and so what we can do
further here is maybe just add a bit of
context context text up here which is
probably just going to say past so let's
just create one big text element and
again we can just copy our game over
text from the game over menu here and
let's have a look at some of the
settings we have a font size of 85
defined itself is Roboto medium I think
we could easily change this to Roboto
bold and everything else is like this we
have a bit of shadowing we can delete
the canvas group and yeah that's it and
then we can change the text here to past
cool
and what I want to do is kind of scale
this in to be the same width of our
buttons move it down until it kind of
sits on top of them and that's maybe
instead of having a fixed font size
let's make this a best-fit and that
means that it will scale between these
two sizes to fit on this size as best as
it possibly can and we can maybe widen
this a tiny bit and you can see that it
actually goes above 100 here so let's
whine this to 130 and now we can take
this a bit back there we go just to kind
of make it the same width as our buttons
you could put a fixed font size in there
or you could have it scale automatically
let's also rename this object to past
text and now I think if we just move
this elements up a bit we're pretty much
ready to make this an interactive menu
so the first thing that we want to do is
of course disable the menu itself this
way we can enable it when we want to
inside the game then we want to create a
script and let's make this a script that
sits on the game master because a game
master is responsible for changing
States in the game it's responsible for
keeping track of important things as
what way we are on and what we should
build so let's also have this pause our
game and basically we're just going to
create a script here Cole called possum
in here let's do that so he create an
ADD there and let's double click that to
open it up in visual studio and that's
just going to take a second to load here
and it's going to pop up on my secondary
monitor but I can quickly drag it over
there we go
so what I want in here is basically a
way for us to register if the users
press the Escape key
I think the Escape key is going to be
the only button that is going to tackle
actually we could add the P in there as
well that's a very public key for
passing the game so let's create a
update method and this can be used for
checking for input so let's go if input
dot get key down and then we want to
check for the key code Escape key or
we'd use the two vertical bars here or
in case we get the key down keycode dot
and then we use P for pause awesome and
in case this happens what we want to do
is we want to call some kind of method
called toggle where we will toggle the
pause menu either on or off depending on
what it's already set to so we will just
invert its current state and we can
delete the system that collections up
here and we can go ahead and create this
toggle method so at the moment we
actually already have a bit of
functionality for kind of stopping our
mouse movement if you will remember when
we implemented our camera controller
here we made it so that if we press the
escape we could disable that so right
now I'm trying to move but it won't and
then I hit escape again and we can move
around once more so in order to kind of
get rid of this code on we got to go
into the main camera under the camera
controller and delete the variable
called do movement and we also need to
delete these two lines or these four
lines and that takes care of actually
implementing that into the update loop
so now we can have this stuff only um
kind of act inside of our parts menu and
not have two different things happen
when you press escape in different
places so basically what we want to do
inside of the toggle here is we want to
enable some kind of UI or disable it so
we need a reference to that UI and in
order to do that we'll just create a
public game object up here called the UI
and then down here we'll simply do UI
dot set active and we could either put
true here if you want to enable it or
false if you want to disable it and we
just want to do the opposite so we want
to flip it so we can get the current
state of the UI by saying you i dot
active self and this is going to be true
if the game object is enabled and not
true if it's disabled so we can just do
the inverse of this by putting an
exclamation mark here so
case it's enabled it's going to flip
this to say false and then we're going
to set it active false which means we're
going to disable it so that's a pretty
clever little piece of code but it's
very efficient and totally easy to use I
mean you save a lot of space by doing it
this way instead of going if already
enabled to do this if not do that that I
mean it's essentially accomplishes the
same thing and I don't think there's
much difference performance wise but
this is just a lot cleaner so that we
can go and say um and now we actually
want to have an if statement in here so
we can go if you I dot active self
now that we've flipped it so in case we
just enabled our past menu what we want
to do is go I and freeze time so we of
course don't want our game running while
the pause menu is enabled and therefore
we can simply go time dot timescale and
set that equal to zero and what you
might have heard is that when you ever
whenever you change the time scale
meaning the speed at which the game is
running and one is normal time zero is
still not running at all and two is
double time
you might have heard that you should
change time fixed at a time as well so
time dot fixed
Delta time here you can see that's both
a get and a set variable and you
definitely should in case you're
creating some a slow-motion movement or
speeding up the game but when just
setting time that time scale to zero
it's essentially freezing the fixed
delta time behind the scene so it's
actually not running the loop at all and
therefore you don't need to change fixed
it at a time so just in case some of you
were wondering don't you have to do that
you actually do not and in case we
haven't just enabled our pause menu in
case we actually just disabled it we
want to return to our normal time scale
which is one so we want to just have the
game back up and running as it would
normally so we should actually already
see this happening and if we go into our
UI scene here or a unity scene here and
find out game master we can now
reference the UI element
which is going to be a past menu that we
just created and let's hit play and
let's try and free sink time and you can
see the timer stops there is no enemy or
appearing everything else looks fine and
we can hit escape again and the game
continues and one nice thing is that you
can see our hover animations are
actually still working these are not
affected by the freeze time and and this
is because this is just a simple
recoloring and the way unity does it is
independent of the current time scale if
you're using some more sophisticated
animations using an animator that will
be affected unless you change a
parameter on that animator and I'm going
to show you how to do that in just a
moment so basically what we need to do
now is kind of hook these buttons up to
our past menu in order to actually make
them do something and that's super easy
all we do let's go into a pause menu and
create some public functions one for
each button so we'll create a public
void here called continue maybe or we
could actually just have it called the
toggle function that we already have
made public so we'll do that and then we
only need one for the menu and one for
the retry so let's create a public void
retry and in here we want to reload the
current scene and so we need to go up
here and get Unity engine dot scene
management and remember this is how this
is something that we need to access
whenever we need to load a new scene or
reload an already existing scene and
then we go down here and go scene
manager dot get at or dead load scene
and the scene that we want to load is
the currently active scene so we just
want to reload whatever we are already
on and we do that by going scene manager
get active scene and we can't actually
just pass in the scene that this returns
we need to go dot and then build index
close so that is the build index of the
scene we're currently at which we are
passing into the load scene and it's
just going to restart one thing that we
also need to make sure is that we
unfreeze time because when reloading a
scene unity doesn't actually change time
dot time
scale back to whatever it was in the
beginning so we actually need to
manually go in here and say time that
time scale equals 1 or we could just hit
toggle which we I think we're going to
do and then we just need another a third
method here for on the menu and we
haven't implemented any kind of menu yet
so for now we'll just throw a debug the
lock statement saying something like go
to menu much in the same way that we did
on with our game over screen cool
so that's pretty much all of the
programming that we needed to do in this
lesson so we can just close down visual
studio and we can find our our pause
menu object over here we can find our
continue button and we can add an on
click event so let's just hit the plus
sign there drag in our game master where
our script is sitting find our script
and find the correct method which is our
target then we need to go into our two
buttons first off the retry add an on
click event
drag in the game master find the script
and let's select retry and the same
thing for a menu add on click event
dragon scoop all right object find
script and let's select new menu
function so now they are hooked up and
we'll call those methods and now when we
hit play hit escape continue oops
it goes back as it should call retry
it's going to restart the level as you
can see did that so if I can not let
this go up a bit and go over here and
hit retry you can see it totally reach
restarts the level and the menu it
should say go to menu so that's perfect
so now we have a fully working pause
menu and all I really want to do for the
rest of the tutorial since we have a bit
of time left it's just adds a bit more
sophisticated animation so basically
what I want to add is just whenever the
pause menu is opened I want it to kind
of fade in I think it's nice that it
just disappears as soon as you wanted to
but when it comes to animating UI
elements onto the screen I like to have
a tiny bit of animation there and I'm
just going to go with a standard fade
but you can do some fancy UI things and
also whenever we hover over the buttons
I think this is a
really really boring animation so
instead let's create something where our
arm where buttons actually pop out a
little bit so in order to do this all we
really need to do is find our path menu
and we need to add an AH some animation
to this and we do that by going to our
animation tab or window and hitting
create this is going to create an
animator and animator and an animation
so the name of our animation here is
going to be just pause menu because we
only have one animation so you can see
it's created an animator called pause
menu and an animation and really what we
want to do is just kind of go forward a
little bit of time and then we want to
animate the opacity of our entire path
menu so let's just disable the animation
window let's enable this so we can see
what we're doing
let's hit add component and add a canvas
renderer I'm sorry a canvas group and
this allows us of course to animate the
Alpha Channel of this entire object so
now we can go hit record again and we
can go forward a few frames and change
the Alpha to zero and now of course it
an amazed from totally visible to
invisible so we just need to flip the
order of these keyframes so let's just
go like this and you can see now that we
have a nice fading in animation actually
I kind of messed that up
so in the beginning here it should be
zero and then it should be one there we
go so let's see yeah much better and of
course this is currently looping so
let's just find our paths menu animation
not the controller and disable loop time
so now it won't loop and by default
these kind of animators are set to play
the animation right off the bat so as
soon as the game object is enabled this
pause menu animation is going to play so
we really don't need to add any more
code whatsoever it's just going to play
as soon as we open it up so let's try
that up and okay so something weird is
happening here and what is that well you
can actually see that if we hit escape
here you can see that things are
changing and the animator is actually
updated it says clear
count one here and if we have a look at
the animator and here you can see that
it is animating it's just stuck at the
very beginning and that's because we
froze time remember time is frozen and
so this clip here stops at the very
beginning and when we disable it of
course it's not going to be playing
anymore because the object is gone so
what we need to do is make this
animation independent of our current
time dot timescale and we do that by
going into the past menu under the
animator and changing the update mode
mode it's currently set to normal which
most of these animators should be but we
want to change it in our case to
unscaled time so when we change the time
scale this is going to just ignore that
so when we now hit play and hit escape
you can see that our past menu animates
on with just a quick fading which helps
make things look things look a lot nicer
and finally to our buttons all we really
need to do here is maybe just ah enable
our paths menu just so we can see what
we're working with finding our say
continue button and you just need to
choose one of them to start with and
we'll apply the change to all of the
others in a very easy way we need to
change the transition here to animation
and hit Auto generate animation and this
is just going to well first create a
animation controller and let's just call
this one button really really general
maybe we should call it something no
that's fine
pause menu button let's do that no yeah
let's just do button actually and let's
hit save so what we can do here is now
we have an animator automatically set up
with the button controller and if we
look down in our animation window we
have four different animations the
normal highlighted the pressed and the
disabled and we're not really disabling
our buttons in any way so we can just
focus on the first three when it's
normal we want the scale up here to be 1
1 1 and so if we just quickly modify
something here it inserts a keyframe
automatically and we can just set that
back so now we have a keyframe here
where this scale is 1 1 1 then we can go
to our highlighted mode and we
maybe bump this up to 1.05 on the X and
on the Y so you can see that just makes
the button a tiny bit bigger bit bigger
and let's go under pressed and do the
same as with our normal mode so let's
just quickly edit that and have it be at
1 1 1 we don't need to do any actual on
our keyframing
inside of the hour button States
themselves because unity is actually
going to blend between these animation
States for us and so it should already
be working one thing that we could do is
maybe when hovering some of these
buttons we could create a tiny bit of
movement on that could be pretty cool so
inside of our highlighted here we could
actually go a bit forward in time and
animate it so we could have it maybe go
down to point 0 to here and then back up
and then right-click and select flat so
it's that it's kind of pulsating you
could totally have that so let's now
disable the recording here and this
should actually already be on working
except again this animators update mode
needs to be changed to on scale time
oilseed will not work and then if we
disabled our past menu and hit play we
should actually see now that unity does
this nice blending and you can see we
have our animation in there as well I
actually kind of like that animation I
think it's pretty funky so let's just
keep it in here so the next thing that
we want to do is just apply this to our
other buttons as well and that's super
easy all we need to do is copy the
animator copy that component find our
retry button change the transition shot
type to animation and let's now paste
the component as new down here and we do
the same thing with our menu again
change the animation right click paste
component as new so now when we hit play
and this is probably our final
playthrough so let's just maximize the
game here so we can get a good view hit
escape you can see that we have a nice
harbour animation for all of our buttons
and it seems super smooth and we can of
course continue the game we can retry
or we can go to the menu or at least we
will implement that very soon
so that was pretty much all I wanted to
show you for this video I hope you
enjoyed it I have actually covered a lot
of the stuff that I wanted to cover for
this course so if you have any
suggestions I'm very open to hear them
so without further ado I will see in the
next video and thanks for watching this
