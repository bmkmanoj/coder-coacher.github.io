game into an actual game by making a way
to lose that's right we'll create a game
or we stay pretty central to any game
this one included let's dive right into
it let's begin by dragging our score
script under the scripts folder just to
clean up from the last video and
currently the way we keep track of
whether or not we've collided with
something if using a script that sits on
the player called player collision and
well it makes sense to detect player
collision on the play object itself the
play object is not a good place to end
our game that should be done using some
kind of game manager let's go ahead and
create one let's right-click in the
hierarchy to create an empty object
let's reset the transform and let's name
it game manager let's also drag it to
the top just to make it clear to see
let's then add a new component and it's
called that game manager as well let's
say create an ad and this component will
be responsible for changing States in
our game we can do stuff like start and
stop a game restart a game and display
UI on the screen if you want to score
calendar a game over screen or
transition to other menu it's like a
main menu our level selector in our case
we're going to make some code that will
restart our game when we hit something
or when we fall off the edge let's
double click the game manager the first
thing we need to do is delete our two
standard functions let's also delete the
two using tags up here let's then write
a new custom function loyd and let's
call it something like end game or game
over I'm just going to write end game
here two parentheses and then the curly
brackets and in here we'll do some
different stuff but for now let's just
display a message to the console to let
us know whether or not we're calling the
function at the right time let's write
debug that lock and then insert
something like game over we can then
save this and hit back into unity so now
our game manager has a function called
end game that will display a message in
the console but we need a way to access
our game manager and call this function
to do that we go to our player find our
player collation script and double click
on it normally when we need to access
something within another script we use a
reference you can see up here we're
using a public player movement called
movement in order to be able to disable
and play a movement when we collide with
something and we could go ahead and do
the same thing with our game manager
here we could write public game manager
and then call it something like game
manager then save that an indie
inspector now drag
game-manager and this will work fine in
our instance but if you wanted a player
to die at some point meaning that we
would have to remove them from the scene
and then maybe spawn and back in because
the game manager doesn't sit on the same
object we would lose this reference it's
actually really easy to show you this
let's go and do acid and let's drag our
player in here to create a prefab out
let's then delete the player from our
scene and drag him back in you can see
that under game manager it now says none
because the prefab itself is not linked
to the game manager and that's not
really a good way around it
so instead we don't use a variable let's
delete this here what we do is we
actually search for the game manager
when we want it and unity has a nice way
of searching for scripts to do that
let's go to the place in our code where
we want to end the game which is right
around here and let's write find object
of type and the type that we want to
find is the game manager we also need to
put a open and close parenthesis the
syntax is actually very similar to get
component which allows us to find a
component on the object here we also use
the smaller than and greater than sign
and inside we write the component that
we want up here for example we could
actually replace movement the reference
to a player movement script with get
component and then make sure to write
player movement like this an opening and
closing parenthesis this is actually
going to do the exact same thing and
it's the same thing with our find object
of type we can actually now just use dot
and access all of the stuff under our
game manager we can then write end game
and you will notice that it doesn't show
up the reason for this is not that we
don't have a valid reference to the game
manager but that our game manager
actually hides this function that's
because it's currently marked as private
we need to instead go in here and write
public void save that and we should now
be able to access it in here so let's
write dot and gain and you can see that
it now shows up of course whenever you
use fine object of type you need to make
sure that you do at least have one
object of the type you're searching for
or this is going to return an error so
just make sure you have game manager in
your scene so let's say this head into
unity and we should see the variable
disappear but that's alright because
we're searching for it without a
variable if you try and play the game
now we're actually going to get some
errors you can see here that it says
unassigned referenced exception the
variable play of score has not been
assigned and the variable of follow
player has not been assigned that's
because both on our main
camera we reference the player and we
need to drag him in there and under our
text object that displays our score we
also have a reference to the player so
we need to drag him in there as well
that's two other places where we could
use find object of type if we wanted to
have the ability to swap our player in
and out of the scene I just wanted to
show you how it's done
do you note that it is of course not as
performant as creating a direct
reference as we do with the variable
let's clear those errors and when we now
hit play we should see that when we
collide with something
it says game over in the console but we
don't only want to display this message
when we collide with something we also
want to display it when you fall off the
edge in order to do that let's go into
our player again and now let's open the
player movement script in here we keep
track of the player's position and the
forces that we want to add to him in
order to make a move inside of our fixed
update we can go ahead and add another
line and what I want to do is I want to
check if our position on the y-axis gets
below a certain number that means that
if our player falls down and we just say
negative one he has fallen off the edge
and we want to restart the game so to do
that through code we write if then we
use our beat up position and we access
the y-value we then check if that is
less than and I'm just going to hard
code in a small negative number I'm
going to put negative one let's again
open or close some curly brackets and if
we reach this position we can do the
same thing as we did in our player
collision we can say find object of type
the type we're looking for is the game
manager and we can then write dot and
King so once you get easy to the syntax
it's actually really easy to do and then
save the script head back into unity and
we should now see that when we fall off
the edge here we see a bunch of game
over statements in the console the
reason why is that we are checking for
this y value each fixed update call that
gets done a lot of times a second but we
actually only want to do this one we
don't want the game to end multiple
times so what we do is go inside of the
game manager and that's a little nifty
trick we can use here all we want to do
is create a boolean up here remember
boolean are used to store a value that
can either be true or false I'm gonna
call this one game has ended will
defaulted to false then in our end game
method will said game has ended to true
and now we can make an if statement that
checks when another game has already
ended
so we'll say if game has ended its equal
to false was then we want
to do these things that we want to
actually end the game so the first time
our in-game method is called game
ascended is going to be false and so
this is going to be true that we are
going to set game has ended equal to
true we're going to show game over in
the console that we could do other stuff
like restarting the game and then the
next time it's called game ascended is
now going to be true and so the if
statement here is going to return false
and this is not going to be cold so our
game will only end once if we save this
now we should feed in unity as well we'd
play and jump off the edge here we can
see that only one message is displayed
in the console and it doesn't matter
whether or not we are colliding with
something or falling off the edge it
will always only display one so the
final thing we need to do is actually
restart the game and we do that again
inside of our game manager first off I
want to create a separate function for
this let's call this one void restart we
then need to make sure to call this
method we do that by writing restart up
here so now when our game ends and after
we show a message in the console we're
going to call the restart method which
means that in our code will jump from
here to down here and everything inside
these two curly brackets will be
executed and restarting a scene in unity
is actually fairly simple first off we
need to go up here and include unity
engine dot scene management we need to
use this whenever we need to change to a
different scene or reload the scene that
we are already on we then go into our
restart method and rewrite scene manager
then press dot and you can see all of
the stuff that are seeing manager can do
we can merge scenes load scenes get
information about active scenes and some
other more advanced functions we want to
load a scene and the scene that we want
to load is currently called level one
you can see in unity that that's the
name of our scene but if you have
multiple levels in our game it's not
always going to be level one the thing
that we want to load is the seam that is
currently active so we can actually get
the active scene by going scene manager
get active scene again open or close the
parentheses make sure you have all of
the parentheses in here or we then use
dot name so this piece of code returns
the name of our current scene and this
piece of code loads the scene with a
given name everything is done using the
scene
manager so we now close this with the
semicolon and when we save this and head
into unity we should actually see it
working however there are going to be a
slight problem with this let's hit play
we can see that when we collide with the
block it instantly restarts but it looks
a little weird and also it restarts very
very quickly we want a slight delay so
we can actually see the collision the
first problem is with the lighting and
it's something that unity has been doing
recently which is a little bit weird if
we go to window then lighting it will
open the lighting panel in here we can
see that this small check box down here
is set to auto this means that unity
will automatically detect changes in
lighting and do the necessary processing
to show an accurate lighting
representation however when reloading
scenes in the unity editor unity doesn't
have time to do these calculations and
so we get a scene with very very bland
lighting all we need to do is disable
auto and it's designing in your scene
now looks weird
simply hit build and unity is going to
calculate the lining of course this
means that every time we change
something it's probably a good idea to
go back and hit build and I normally
leave auto on when testing but if it's
annoying you a lot you can disable it
and you can now see that when we hit
play and the level restarts
our lighting looks perfect however we
still need to code in a slight delay to
do that we go back into our script and
instead of directly calling the function
we use something called invoke let's
write invoke and invoke takes two
parameters the first one in quotation
marks is the name of a function which is
restart the second one is the delay the
amount of time before calling the
function and we could definitely just
hard code this in we could write to here
and it would wait two seconds but I
think it's better to go up here and make
it into a variable this way we can
easily tweak it in the inspector the
variable is going to be a public float
that means that we're storing some kind
of decimal place number we'll call it
restart delay and set it equal to one by
default we can then take a restart delay
and put it in place of the number two
here so now whatever our restart delay
is equal to is the amount of time that
we will wait before invoke is going to
call the restart method and our skiing
is going to load let's save this head
back into unity and hopefully everything
is going to be working now we just need
to add play and when we collide with
something you can see that we get a
second to see the collision which looks
a bit nicer and it's the same thing when
we fall off the edge the final thing
that you might need to do if you need
a little bit when reloading the scene is
added to the build settings to do that
you go to file build settings and in
here we have a list of all of the scenes
that we want to include when we export
our game currently there's nothing in
here and that's not a problem because we
only have a single scene and gonna be
smart enough to know that that's the
theme we want to use but if you have
multiple scenes it's very very important
that you add all them in here we can
just click Add open scene or you can
always just drag them from the project
panel you can see that our scene has a
name the checkbox to say whether or not
it's included and a build index if you
have multiple levels you normally
download them by name
but by blood index so that unity will
transition to the next scene in the
queue it's pretty cool we can just close
that now let's also take our game
manager and drag it under the scripts
folder and that should be it nothing
should change in our case but it should
hopefully fix some errors if you have
any that was so much it for this video I
