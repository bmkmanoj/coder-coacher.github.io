I will be live streaming in just a
moment so if you want to see that head
on over to twitch.tv / Brakiss and yeah
i will be live in just a moment and what
we will be making today is a replica of
the very popular game called curve fever
which is basically like a modern snake
game so I'm just going to head on over
into unity here and show you kind of
what it is that we will be making and
this is a two player game and you can
see it's really just about avoiding of
course hitting the tail of the other
player or hitting the edge of the map or
of course hitting your own tail and on
the tail rendering part here is done
using the unity line renderer which has
seen some major improvements in unity
5.5 and that is currently out in beta so
we'll be playing a bit around with the
beta here and just checking some stuff
out so I hope that you will join us
there and without further ado I will see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
