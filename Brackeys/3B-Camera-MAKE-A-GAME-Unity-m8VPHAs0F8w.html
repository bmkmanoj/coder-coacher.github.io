three part B and make a game a cool
series on making a video game in unity
so this is again Part B of part three
and go ahead and click in the
description if you haven't watched part
a in this one we are going to be
scripting the camera and that's going to
be a lot of fun so basically what we're
going to be doing is we're going to have
our camera move with our ball but there
are some things that we should take into
consideration because if we make it so
that our camera is directly out from the
ball pointing in everything will appear
to look 2 dimensional this is because we
look at the box and the bowl from a
direct angle and we will only see
objects which are way down here a way up
here as being three-dimensional and
that's really not an effect we're going
for so if we look at it from the direct
side view here things will appear
two-dimensional if we though go ahead
and point our camera from a little bit
of an angle so we have our distance out
from the ball this is still the same but
then we add a little bit in the y-axis
here so whoops let's annex on the y-axis
to make our camera point the wide way
down on the ball then everything will
appear to be three-dimensional which is
the effect we're going for and to do
this we want the x axis which means that
when the ball goes from side to side we
want that to just be equal to the balls
x axis so we want that to follow the
ball completely the set axis which means
our distance from the ball this is the
one here
side point of view so the one going out
towards the camera here we want that to
be minus 10 so that we will be 10 units
from the bowl and the y-axis which means
the up and down we want that to be equal
to the bowls so it will follow but a
little bit higher so we'll just plus
that value with something like 1 or 1.5
to give it the three-dimensional look so
that is the axis we want and if you
don't understand this yet hopefully you
will in a second I've already opened up
your unity here so we can take a look at
what I mean
inside of the scene view and then in
just a sec start scripting and if we
have a look in the camera preview here I
will also actually let me just show you
this in the game view you can see that
this almost appears to be
two-dimensional if we take the Y here
and make it 0 we can see that it it
looks completely two-dimensional if it
wasn't for the lighting what we want to
do is make our camera rotate just a bit
we want to bring it up a tad there and
then we want to rotate it down towards
our bowl to point directly at it and now
we have added a lot of perspective and
once we play the game everything will
look much better so now let's have a
look at achieving this in scripting so
let's make a new script first select our
main camera oops I'll just go ahead and
delete that never mind that select the
main camera hit the add component button
new script and let's call this our
camera control
it's going to be of type JavaScript and
hit create an ad now we can double click
this to open it up in monodevelop
and there it is this was the ball
control script and now we can see the
completely fresh camera control script
okay so what we want this to do is first
of all we want to apply some variables
the first one and whenever you're making
variables you should really think about
what you want the script to do and then
what does the script need up what input
does it need in order to do those things
and it's something that's hard to figure
out if you haven't have no experience in
scripting so for now you can just type
after me but but that's really the
thought process so what does the camera
need well it needs to know what to
follow so it needs to know a target so
the first variable is called target and
it's going to be of type transform the
transform is what we use for many things
it's what we use for getting a position
a rotation and all that kind of stuff
but it's also what we use whenever we
want to spawn an object or instantiate
something we'll get into that for now
just right transform it needs one more
thing actually it needs two things it
needs a distance from the ball out to
the camera on the set axis this one so
we'll call that vert and then distance
off type actually I think I'll make
these too small but that's completely up
to you I just like them D capitalized it
changes as long as you stick to one
thing which I can't do
so the variable distance should be equal
to and for now let's write minus 10 I
think that's a pretty good distance you
can go ahead and change it inside of
unity so so don't worry about that the
reason why it's minus is because if we
look at it from a top perspective here
we want you can see that this is
pointing forward so if we made this 10
it would just go past the ball we want
to back it up
minus 10 units that's why it's minus 10
and open up the function update here and
inside of this we want to type some
logic in a sec but first we want to add
yet another variable and this one is
going to be called let's call it lift
and that's going to be how much we will
lift the camera up on the y-axis to give
it that tilting effect and let's just
type have eat let's just make this equal
to 1.5 for now and close that up with a
semicolon now it's time to go into the
function update let's type transform
that position soutien equals so the
transform whenever we just type this
without anything in front we mean the
transform of this object so basically
what we're accessing here is the
position of the object descriptor
sitting on in this case that's our
camera so we're just telling that the
position of our camera should be
something and what it should be is the
target that position so we wanted to be
equal to the target position that was
with a small T there and if we just
close it now and hit play you will see
that the game is not exactly working
whenever we replay the game our
we have to assign the target variable of
course so select the main camera and
because we've made this cool variable
thing where we want the target we can
see appearing inside of the inspector
and what we can simply do is we can take
the bowl and we can drag it onto the
target there and that's all you have to
do now unity will use that ball as a
target it's really cool so now we can
hit play and we can see it not working
because the main camera just immediately
jumps to the balls position and if we
roll the ball you can see the camera
following it so that's not what we want
so let's just clear those areas up in
the console because we have that fixed
now and let's go inside the script and
let's correct this so we want to change
the position a bit this target dot
position will be our starting point but
we want to add some things on to that so
let's hit plus and then we want to plus
it with a vector3 that just means that
we want to change it on three axes so we
want to add on three axes to that and
the first one which is the X it goes X Y
Z and if we go back and look here we can
see that our X should just be equal to
the balls X so we won't change that at
all that should just be zero but the
next value is the Y X Y and the y we
want it to be equal to Y but plus 1.5 so
we have the Y and then we want to plus
it by 1.5 so we'll make one point five
there but again instead of writing this
number out we can just type our variable
we made up here called lift so lift
comma and then the Z actually send Z we
want it to be equal to minus 10 so we'll
just type minus 10 but again instead of
typing this out we'll just do
distance close that up with the
parenthesis and a semicolon so now we
are saying that our cameras position
should be equal to our targets position
but change it with the lift and pull it
back with the distance now when we hit
save to that head back into unity and
hit play you can see that our camera
moves up just a bit and it will follow
around the position of our ball which
makes our game much more interesting
already one thing is wrong though and
that is whenever the camera goes up we
want it to be pointing down at the ball
we want it to always stay focused on the
ball so to make this will in the
function update write something as
simple as transform that look at and
that's something again something unity
built for us to make it really something
to make it object look at something else
so we will just use transform that look
at and then in parenthesis we type what
it should look at and that should of
course be the target close that up and
now we have made a script let's just
remove the space there now we've made a
script that will figure out the position
of the ball applied to the camera
plus it's with some values and then
rotate the camera to look at the ball so
we have an awesome movement script which
will make everything look much better I
know this was a lot to take in
well done so far it's going great I know
you don't I don't expect you to
understand all of this it is very much
information to take in in a short amount
of time but it definitely helps to just
get started with decoding early and then
we'll slowly expand onto it and i i've
met many people who struggled with
coding but all of them have been able to
learn it at some point and it's actually
a lot of fun once you get the hang of it
so in the next one we're going to be
doing some level design and finally
making the game look a little more
interesting thanks for watching and I'll
see you next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
