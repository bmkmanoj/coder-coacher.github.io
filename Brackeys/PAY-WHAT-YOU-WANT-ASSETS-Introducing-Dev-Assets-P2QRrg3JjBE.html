months I've been working on something
that I've been dying to show you and
it's finally ready drumroll please
introducing dev acids develops is a
website where you can download high
quality acid packs such as this and this
we already have a lot of stuff on the
site but we'll add loads more as we go
the best part is that it's paid what you
want so you can choose the price that
you can afford you can even grab it for
free all I need to do to get started is
go to dev assess calm choose the pack
you like select the price and hit
download while you're there you should
subscribe to the newsletter s1 this way
will notify you whenever a new pack hits
the site and don't worry we want spam
everything on the side is hand-picked
and polished to give the best experience
using it that means that not only do we
organize everything to make it really
easy to use we also provide a unity
package with an example scene to quickly
get everything working inside of unity
when did I mention that you can use the
assets for commercial use as well check
out the usage guidelines for more
information remember that deviseth is
powered by only your support and when
you pay for a pack that money goes
directly to site development and most
importantly to the talented artists who
decided to share their work if you think
dev assets is as awesome as we do make
sure to tell your friends and share it
on Facebook and Twitter I think that
together we can make this site into a
flourishing place for both developers
and artists and talking about artists we
are always talking to bring more people
on board so if you want to become part
of the project feel free to throw us an
email with the link to your portfolio at
apply at brackish calm that's pretty
much it for now I hope you will enjoy
the site it sure has cost me a lot of
sleepless nights thanks for watching and
I will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
