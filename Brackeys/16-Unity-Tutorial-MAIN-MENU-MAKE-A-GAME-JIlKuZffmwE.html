will come to video number 16 and make a
game a cool series on making a video
game in unity so today we're going to be
taking a look and are making our menu
actually do something so we're going to
be expanding on the subject of last
week's video and this process is
actually both very easy and also very
fun so you will notice that I am on a
Mac today and that's because I'm
currently traveling so I hope the
quality and audio quality is just as
fine as it normally is let's just get
started as you can see I've already
opened up a unity and I'm just going to
quickly go ahead and drag the music
object up here because I like it at the
top what we're going to go ahead and do
is maybe move these buttons here just a
tiny bit closer together I think they're
just it's had too far apart so I'm just
going to set this to 135 and the same
with the other one 135 there that looks
at a bit better and what we can also do
is we can rename this from audio to
music because I think that we are only
going to be changing the music volume
today I would like this slider to do
that awesome so now we can actually go
ahead and select the canvas here and
today we can make this pixel perfect so
if you click this you will notice that
everything looks much better and much
sharper than it did before
the reason why I couldn't do that in the
last video was because unity 4.6 beta
was having some problems with my windows
configuration but on this computer it
works just fine so try it out awesome
so select the main camera and we are
going to add a new script so hit add
component new script and this is of
course going to be of type JavaScript
and let's just call this main menu
this script let's open it up in
monodevelop is simply going to be a
bunch of functions that we can call
whenever we press our buttons and change
something with our slider that does some
simple things let's just delete the two
default functions and let's create a new
one let's call this quit game because
that's the easiest one to do and let's
just open up some brackets and inside of
this we're simply going to say
application dad quit and we're done that
was basically it
this application that quit function will
not actually do anything at all inside
of the unity editor but once you build
it to let's say a Windows Mac or Linux
standalone this will actually close down
Nick at the application so now let's
save this head into unity and hit play
and I'm just going to turn down the
volume here but you can see that when I
press the button nothing happens
but that's not because application I
quit doesn't work inside the editor
that's because we have to assign it to
this button so let's just make a debug
log statement in here so we can test
whether or not something is actually
happening let's just say game is exiting
just like this to let us know that the
button has been pressed now let's save
this hit play and this should still not
be working
indeed it it's not what we're going to
do is we're going to go into our scene
view you're going to select the quit
game button then we can scroll down and
you can see that there's a list here
called on click excuse me so what we can
deal with this on click list is we can
add items or functions that we want to
be called whenever we press the button
so simply hit the plus sign
we are then going to select the object
that the function is on so that's the
main camera then we are going to go
ahead and and find our script which is
main menu and now you can see that there
is a quit game function down here so now
this should indeed be called let's go
into the console so we can see what is
going on let's hit play
and now when we press the quit game
button it will say game is exiting so
now we know it's working
awesome now let's go ahead and make
another function and this is going to be
for our start game and inside of this
we're going to say application dot load
level whoops not loaded level but load
level and in here we're going to pass it
a name and we're just going to do level
one now save head back into unity and
remember whenever we do we load a level
in unity we have to also add it to the
build settings let's go under file build
settings and you can see that our level
one is indeed added to the build I'm
also going to add the main menu and drag
it up so it's right above cool now we
can go ahead and and find our play game
button so simply select it and we can go
ahead and add is a item an item to the
list let's again select the main camera
now we are going to go on the main menu
and you should see a start game function
indeed we have one right here now when
we hit play and then hit play game the
game will change see what we are also
going to do with this is we are going to
go in here and instead of just hard
coding in the name of the level that we
want to load we can use what is called
an argument because wouldn't it be cool
if we could
load or start the game with different
levels with different buttons all using
the same function that's actually
relatively easy to do all we have to do
is create a an argument or a parameter
and we do this inside of these two
parentheses in here we are first going
to type what we will refer to the level
name as so we'll just refer to it as
level it's basically the name of the
variable that we're making then we are
going to make a type and this is going
to be of type string because a name is
usually usually of tribe string so now
instead of hard-coding level one in here
we'll simply type in level because
that's what we've called our variable
what this says is that whenever we call
the function start game and wanted just
to do things in here we'll make a will
require that we send over a name with it
that we will call level and that we can
then pass in here so now what this
actually means in practice it's okay if
you don't quite understand it yet but
it's you will see the effect of it is
that we can select our play game button
we can scroll down again select the
function the start game and you can see
that it takes in a string now and this
allows us in in this box right here to
simply type in the name of the level
that we want to load so for different
buttons we can type in different levels
here and it's also just much easier to
change because we don't have to find it
in code you can just do it inside of the
editor so now when we hit play it's
again going to work just fine but but
it's now a lot more flexible and we
don't have to add a function for every
single level that we want to load we
could also go ahead and change the name
of this to load level because we add
then we can use it for
much more but since this is under the
main menu script I'm just going to call
it start game the last function that
we're going to be making is also
slightly different but still I just bear
with me here and you will get it in a
sec so we're going to make a function
when we're going to call this set game
volume of course you can call it
whatever you want then inside of the
parentheses you're going to type vol
that's what we're going to call our
volume of type float and then we're
going to open it up here so again we are
taking in a parameter we are calling it
vol and it's going to store the volume
as a number so that's all we're doing
we're just saying that when we are
called we're going to call this from the
slider the slider value is going to be
passed in here and we'll just call it
vol for volume now we can go ahead and
use this vol to set the volume of our
music so let's first create a reference
to our music so up here do a VAR and
let's call this music of type audio
source and we can just put that in in
the inspector now inside of the set game
volume function all we need to do is do
music dot volume equals ball because
remember the vol here is the value of
our slider so that's all we need to do
in code we've now finished our script
let's head back into unity first off
select the main camera and drag in the
music object into our music audio source
that's very important or you're going to
get a null reference exception if you
get one
just remember to drag it in there now we
can select our slider scroll down and
you can see that we have again on value
change this will be called every time
the value changes we're going to hit
play or plus find our main camera object
find
function on the main menu and you can
see that it's up here under dynamic
flowed which means that we will put in
whatever value of the slider as an
argument which is just what we want so
we're going to hit set game volume and
that's all we need to do I'm also just
going to default this to 0.45 maybe I
think that's a pretty good starting
point for the volume and now I'm just
going to bump up the volume on my
computer so you can hear how this
affects the music let me play here and
I'll just try it out you can see here
the music playing and now I can adjust
it using the slider
so that was basically all for today's
video I hope you enjoyed it and I'll see
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
