everyone and welcome to video number
four on making a multiplayer FPS in
unity in this video our primary focus is
going to be syncing our movement and
rotation over the network so things will
start to look like an actual multi
player fps also we're going to update
the looks of our scene a bit and just
clean up the project so let's get
started but before we do I quickly want
to mention that if you have any
questions you can go to farm practice
comm if your code isn't working you can
download it off github links in the
description and if you want to support
my videos you can go to break is calm
slash donate so now that that's out of
the way
enjoy so let's start by adding a bit
more contrast to our scene so if we go
into a scene view here and select the
ground plane I think we should add a new
material to this so let's right-click go
create material and let's call this
ground then we can drag it onto our
ground plane we can go under the albedo
slot and change the texture here and you
can see that there are a bunch of
textures imported with this standard
assets pack one of those is the swatch
orange and I'm just going to be using
that and also we might might want to
bump down the smoothness a bit actually
I'm going to change this from standard
to standard specular set up and then
bump that down to 0.3 and maybe I want
this to be a bit less orange so in order
to do that we can simply find a color
pretty much opposite of orangey s or
light blue and tint it a bit in that
direction just so it won't be too much
and then finally I want to add the same
grid that we see on the cubes here so if
you select those those are also from the
standard asset so you have this an AV
grid texture and then they use an
emission map that has this grid look so
we can do the same so if we simply
select our ground plane go underground
and then we can find our emission slot
and find the grid emission
texture again under prototyping and the
textures and then we can maybe bump this
up to two to make it a bit more clear to
see at least from a distance also when
we had the grid on the ground plane here
I want to go on the gizmos and make sure
to disable sure grid you can see I've
done that already I think that looks the
best awesome so I think that really
added some a nice feel to our scene and
I think you will find it - the pretty
cool with the skybox also so now that we
have that in place we can maybe just
quickly create a couple of folders here
so let's create one for scripts where we
can place our controller on motor and
I'll play your setup and one for
materials where we can place our ground
and our gun cool so let's hit save on
that and now we are ready to do a
movement synchronization over the
network for our player objects so if we
select the player here unity has
provided us with an awesome component
called the network transform component
and this takes care of pretty much all
pretty much everything for us so singing
position and rotation over the network
isn't necessarily a very difficult task
on top of the HL api and we could
definitely go ahead and create a script
that would work just fine right now
but the default unity component has some
nice features that I think will you will
like so let's let me just talk a bit
about how this singing actually work
well you can see the first slider we
have here is the network send rate and
this is the amount of times and second
that we will send a package containing
information about our position around
and rotation to other clients so this is
kind of the update rate and well in an
ideal world this would be 60 at least so
every time our computer rent
the frame we would also send the
information and then it would be ready
next time the other clients would want
to render frame so this way we would get
very accurate movement and we would get
a very smooth movement also but in
reality that's not really possible
because if we were to bump the send rate
up to a very farm a bit behind what this
allows us to but then we would very
quickly clutter up the network and that
would maybe cause it to completely stop
or to a black candy connection or
whatever so that would give us a lot of
issues instead what we do is we send out
a limited rate you can see the default
here is 9 and we're just going to leave
it at 9 and then what we do is we take
this very jerky motion where the player
just drum jumps from one position to the
next and then we smooth it out by
looping between the positions or doing
what is called movement interpolation
and this is super awesome because we get
suddenly a very smooth movement it's not
going to be as accurate but we can get
close so that's kind of what we do and
the extra awesome part of the network
transform component here is that it can
utilize that we are using a rigidbody 3d
and this means that it will take into
account of velocity and movement
direction and all that to predict where
we are going to be in a second and
therefore can make more precise
interpolation for our movement so that's
super awesome so if you have you if
you're using a rigidbody like I am here
definitely use it here under the
transform sync mode if you're not there
well then you can just sync the
transform and that's going to be fine
but this is definitely very cool and
then we have the movement threshold here
and that is the amount of units or
that's the how much we can move in units
before we send updates out that we have
moved so this is how much this is
basically the threshold for registering
that we have moved on the network and
that's going to
fine here and then we have the snap
threshold and this is basically how many
units we need to move before we don't do
any interpolation and just snap to that
point so let's say our we had we would
have 8l appoint teleport the point over
here and the end of the portal would be
over here well then we would want to be
able to go through that and then jump
over there with any without any
interpolation along the way well that is
what the snap threshold can be used for
and also if we should experience a huge
lag spike and a loss of connection for a
time well then if we move all the way
over here we will wanted to simply jump
once we get the connection again and not
suddenly just fly through the map that
would look super weird so that's kind of
what that variable is for and you can
just leave it at five then we have the
interpolate movement factor and the
smaller you make this well then the more
we are going to interpolate the slower
we are going to or the more smooth I
should say the movement is going to be
and a pretty good value for this is
actually one that's a good default value
and we're going to leave it at that but
I do want to show you what it looks like
if we disable interpolation and you can
do that by setting this to zero and
let's also just disable rotation here
set that to none and we can look at that
in a second so if we were to now save
this and then go on to edit project
settings player and then we can just
disable this annoying resolution dialog
each time that we make a build we can
also disable the oil set the default not
to be full screen and then maybe input
800 by 600 years so we're just going to
get a small VIN window that starts
automatically
so now let's press control B a command
BR if you're on the Mac here and it's
going to build a player for us and you
can see that it starts up there and
inside of unity I'm simply going to drag
my scene over here split it down the
middle so that we have our player here
and the scene here and we can view both
the build and the scene over here
so now let's hit play and go to host and
yep and then we can navigate over to our
build here and select client and if we
turn around here then looking over here
we can start moving around and you can
see that it is indeed updating but it's
very jerky so we have this motion
jumping which we definitely do not want
but the cool thing is that we can go in
and adjust this interpolation factor
while the game is running so this might
not work it has worked for me I don't
know if the component is built to do
this so not all of the settings might
not work in real time but I know at
least if we find our player here on the
player that we built so that would be
this one not the one connected to the
editor so that one here associated with
the build and then bump the interpolate
factor up to one and then look at them
here and go over here you can see just
how smooth that motion now is so that is
actually a pretty good amount you can
see that it takes him a little while to
slow down when we stop while over here
it's instant but that's kind of the
price that you have to pay so I'm
actually very satisfied with that
movement just for fun let me show you
what this would look like if we changed
it to 0.1 that means that the until it
interpolation would be very slow and you
can see indeed it is and if we were to
bump this up to something like 3 well
then you can see we start introducing
some of the jerkiness back into the
motion so I think a value of 1 is great
there and we can go in here and save
that to 1 then the rotation here we can
select what axis we want to sync over
the network and in our case we only want
to sync the y-axis because we are going
to do the sinking of rotation on the
camera as a separate component so we'll
just select Y there and the interpolate
fashion factor we're going to have to
bump that up to ten actually I found
when using one it was way too slow I
mean way too slow so I found that 10 is
a good value and why these two differ so
much is not something that I can answer
your on I'm sorry
I simply don't know but I do know that
10 is a pretty good value to set for
this you can of course again build the
players and play around with this so
we're just going to assume that this is
working and then add the rotation
syncing for the camera also so you might
be thinking well let's go ahead and find
the camera here and let's add a
component and add the network transform
where you can see now it introduces a
network identity and another network
transform and that's not something that
we want to have instead what we want is
we want the player to have this central
network identity component and have
everything be controlled from the road
object so in there for unity has made
this network transform child component
that we attached to the route the player
object and then we drag in the camera
and it will control this so if we select
Network transform child here you can see
that we have this target variable and in
here we can drag the camera and we have
a bunch of settings for this too and
this behaves a little weird because when
I use the movement threshold well I said
okay so I don't want to sync any
movement I just want to sync
rotation on the x-axis so I went in and
said set the movement threshold really
high so that it would never send out any
movement that didn't work hard because
movement threshold I think it's a bug
also has an effect on rotation it worked
on some of the clients but on the host
system and the the rotation suddenly
didn't update so if you want to be sure
that this is working simply leave the
movement threshold as is
then we have the interpolate movement
factory this we can go ahead and set to
zero that's that's fine because we don't
want to spend any processing power on
the templating movement on something
that doesn't move then we have the
interpolate rotation factor and this
somehow behaves differently than the
rotation factory up here and it might be
because this swings using a transform
and not a rigid body which is also
something we want because our camera
doesn't have a rigid body attached so
that might be why but for now let's just
leave that this at 0.5 and see what
happens and then we can change it at run
time the rotation axis we of course want
to set to X only and we don't need to
compress the rotation here so let's save
this and let's build this and see if it
works
so there we have the build we hit plate
select host there select client here
and you can see now that our rotation
looks just fine however if we kind of
get closer here you can see that the
up-and-down rotation is a bit jerk and
jerky still it's kind of clunky so in
order to change the smoothness on this
we can of course find the object as
always not that one this one and we can
try and make this smaller so let's set
it to 0.2 and just focus on him there
and you can see now the rotation is much
smoother I think however now it's a bit
it takes a bit long for it to slow down
so I think we'll find an intermediate
value at something like 0.3 and you can
see there what it looks like and now we
can move around and look around and it
will update on the client which also
hosts the server and on the remote
client here so that's basically all for
syncing movement over in the net
so that's it stop on that let's stop
playing there let's go into the player
and change this to point 3 and we can
collapse that and collapse that and we
are basically done so that was basically
it for performing movement
synchronization over the network for our
player I hope you enjoyed this video and
the next one I think that we're going to
look into expanding on our character
controls so maybe adding some flying
mechanics the spring physics that I
teased you in the first video and also
have setting a lock on how much we can
rotate our camera so that we don't
suddenly view everything upside down so
that was basically it for this video I
hope you enjoyed it and I'll see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
