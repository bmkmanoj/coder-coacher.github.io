intricate down to under 30 minutes
so um hello welcome to the first
tutorial done by brac ease I am the CEO
of practice and today I'm going to show
you how to create a survival game this
is probably going to be a whole series
because this can't be done in just one
single tutorial and yes let's see where
this brings us so I have opened up a new
unity project it's completely empty and
you can just do this by going to file a
new project and I did not import any
assets so this tutorial is for the
beginner to the intermediate mostly for
beginners and then we'll move on to the
other parts later so okay let's start
out by creating a ground plane for our
character to move on this is going to be
a first person game so go to game object
create other and then cube and let's
make sure that this is in the center of
the scene by going to a transform on the
right hand side and searing out the X Y
and C transform so by simply
highlighting the cube in the hierarchy
and then taking my miles to the
perspective view and pressing F it will
zoom in on the highlighted objects all
right now let's scale this on the X to
about 50 on the Y you can just leave
that at 1 and the sea-air to again 15 so
now we have quite a huge ground plane
for a character to stand on let's go
through a hierarchy on the left hand
side rename this to and ground
plain make sure that you notice that
unity is cap sensitive so I type
everything in one word with every word
starting with a capital letter but just
make sure that you'll find your own
system and stick to it alright so now
let's import a character a unity has a
database with default characters that
you can import and also different kinds
of packages so go right click on the
assets window go to import package and
then character controller this is the
scripts and graphic go click import this
is the scripts and graphics that will
make sure that we can walk around and
inject act fit with physics and I've
seen now you should get a folder called
standard assets double click on this
double click on the folder chord and
character controllers and then just take
the first person controller and drag it
onto the plane every anywhere you want
now if we hit F again you can see that
the character is indeed there in form of
the cylinder and let's just drag it up a
little bit so it won't fall through the
ground when we start playing the game
okay right now our scene isn't very
exciting it is not going to be very
exciting in this tutorial but we can at
least make some light so go to create a
game object create audio and then point
lights and so this is as the name
describes it light emitting from one
single point in a radius so let's just
drag this up so we can see the light
emitting now drank this up quite a bit
and then increase the range on the right
hand side to about that same 30 40
maybe 50 maybe yeah 50 looks fine so now
we can navigate Nicene by pleasant and
pressing the play button or ctrl P or
command P if you're on a Mac so now here
in the game view um you can walk around
and jump and look anywhere you want and
if you walk by the company you'll be
falling so we already have the most
basic game mechanics in place okay so
now let's go ahead and create a skybox
to make the heaven look a little less
blue and after that we'll be creating a
house and then in the next tutorial
we'll look at the simple coding and some
game mechanics including shooting so now
let's just first of all delete the
object called main camera we won't be
needing this because the first-person
controller comes with a camera so if you
go to the first-person controller in the
hierarchy and expand this with the
little arrow you can see the main camp
there so and over here on the right hand
side you can now see all the components
that this main camera has on it has
attached to it and we can go ahead and
add one by clicking add component then
going to rendering and then skybox this
want something inserted to it so let's
import some default sky boxes by going
to our assets folder then hitting import
no right-clicking import package and
then sky boxes so you will see this
importing and this will give us about
five maybe six
skyboxes that we can use so double-click
on the standard assets when it's done
then skyboxes and you can see all the
different skybox now again first on the
main camera and then we can simply try
to click and drag into the empty slots
on the right hand side and you can see
it appearing in the game view so let's
try the dawn dusk this was the one that
we used for the game called kill pill
and you can find that on our Facebook
page the first one we use this and oh by
the way to maximize any window I just
hold hover my mouse over it and then
press the space button this will
maximize and minimize that's a pretty
cool feature okay so let's just go with
something a little more happy with a
sunny yes this one I like this one yes
that's very nice okay so now that we
have our skybox in the scene um we can
go ahead and create a house so go to
game object create other and then cube
and keep in mind throughout this
tutorial that unity is a game and it is
not meant to be modeling or texturing or
anything like that it just handles the
scripting and the piecing everything
together it's it's not meant to do this
I'll just create a simple structure just
to so you can get familiar with the
environment but please do this in other
applications if you want something
looking good okay so I have C rolled out
the transform now we can just drag it up
a little bit to see it and hit F to
maximize it and let's make this into a
wall so we'll make it longer and by
holding down control I can snap it but
that's
just type in a value let's type in maybe
five this to small ten and on the Y we
want it to be like yes five drag it on
top of the planes it's just resting
dryer we could type in a preset number
this won't be necessary this is fine now
we can go ahead and name this house wall
one zero one and then ctrl D it's
duplicated and rename this to pass wall
so to so now if we drag out you can see
that our two walls and we can position
them anywhere we want and click on one
hold down shift click on the other just
like select them both and then just drag
them let's duplicate them both call them
small three and house wall four and then
we can rotate them so go through the
rotation Y and type in ninety degrees so
we rotate them a calling and so now we
can just drag this down to the side do
the same thing with number three so just
rotate 90 degrees and then just drag and
drag and so make sure that they are even
and pretty even and this is what's
really bad okay so now we can just drag
out the walls to make it like cubic and
there you go we have a sealed room you
can delete all of the walls if you want
and just play around this to make a
smaller structure something that our
player when we play the game can hide in
shelter in interact with so that is
pretty much the basics of eternity
d next time we'll be stepping it up
we'll be creating some shooting
mechanics and after that we'll be
creating some enemies and will spawn and
interact just like zombies so yes thank
you for watching now as mentioned
earlier I am the CEO of friend cold
brackets we are working on our first iOS
title to be released on both both the
iPad and the iPhone and it's called your
game I think it's really exciting I will
be making updates and everything you can
get on facebook.com slash Frankie's and
soon to come our website and brackish
comm click the links and support it it
means a lot with just regular people
trying to get outside on the web with
something we made and then if you want a
little heads-up on what we are creating
something in that style you can go to
the congregate website there are the
second version of the game I talked
about earlier called kill / and you can
just search for kill pill traffic
islands you can also find this on our
website it's very fun it's very easy and
thank you for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
