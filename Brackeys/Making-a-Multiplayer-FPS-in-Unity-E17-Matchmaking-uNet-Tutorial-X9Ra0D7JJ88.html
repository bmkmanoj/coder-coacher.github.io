welcome to video number 17 on making a
multi-player fierce in unity this video
is going to be very short but very very
important we are going to be talking
about matchmaking and how you can
connect players over the Internet
instead of just running multiple clients
on one computer as we've done so far
so finally you will be able to send the
game to your friends and play with them
wherever they are also on the local
network of course so it's it's very easy
to set this up there for this short
video but I will be explaining a bit
about how it works and some of the
pricing stuff so yeah without further
ado let's jump right into today's video
so you can see that I'm here in unity
and the window that we want to find is
on the window and then services and I
like to dug it over here by the
inspector panel and the first thing that
we want to do here is select an
organization if you haven't created one
of those you can go ahead and do it I
believe it will prompt you to do that
and I'm just going to select brackets
here and then I'm going to select create
in order to create the unity project ID
and that's because any services that
includes the multiplayer I API it
includes stuff like analytics cloud
builds adds all of that on that unity
provides needs to be linked with your
project and it does that through a unity
project ID and that's what we're going
to be creating here or if you already
have one set up you can click that
button there and type it in so I'm going
to hit create here and now it's
basically done exactly that you can see
I've access to ads analytics cloud build
all of that stuff and then the
multiplayer tab down here and that's why
we're going to go down and click that
and you can say see that it loads just
for a moment here and then you can see
your configuration overview and
currently it says that there's no
configuration presence and what we can
do to change this assembly hit go to
dashboard we also have some other things
we can do in here such as go to the
Settings tab if you want to rename your
magic name change the organization or
unlined unlink the project from the
unity project so that's that's all
settings that you have access to you
cannot delete your unity project ID in
here but you can do that through the
dashboard up here so let's go onto
multiplayer and hit go to dashboard and
it's going to open this up enjoy on
default web browser in my case that's
Google Chrome so here we have it and
it's going to ask you to set this up and
we do this by first specifying the
maximum amount of players that we are
set a room for per room so in a lobby I
want to have maybe a maximum of 16
players so I'm going to type in 16 here
and hit save and we can basically change
this at any point so it's not really
important just choose a number that's
big enough for you and you can see you
can change it very quickly right here
then we have this statistic called the
CCU usage CCU means concurrent users and
it's something that we often talk about
when talking about network games and it
basically means the total amount of
users that are on your game at any given
time and of course this is going to vary
depending on the day and the time of day
and over the life cycle of your or the
lifetime of your game but when I'm
billing or when calculating how much
you're going to pay on any kind of
server for any kind of service you like
to kind of predict how many concurrent
users you're going to need or how much
room you're going to need for X amount
of concurrent users and this here should
show you with maybe a bit of error how
many users are currently on the game and
of course we haven't loaded up this game
anywhere so there's currently no
concurrent users on there you can also
see that my global CCU limit meaning the
at all or the maximum amount of people
that can be on the game at any time is
200 that's because I have unity Pro if
you have the default a unity version
you're going to have
a number of 20 here and this is only for
when developing your game it to amount
of 20 people is going to be fine this is
only for testing on a few computers so
you're not going to need any more than
that but when you act actually publish
the game then you want to go in here
under activate live mode live mode you
can see here is for multiplayer projects
that are about to be publicly released
to end-users so that means that when you
want to actually share this with the
world and it's no longer in the arm in
the development phase but maybe in the
testing phase such as where the access
and beta or just release then you're
going to go in here and activate it and
from there on out you're going to be
paying for how much traffic you use and
the reason for this is because unit
servers are expensive and unity have set
up some servers and that does
matchmaking that means they connect user
setup rooms and all of that stuff and
also relay servers that make sure that
they connect that when a client connects
it connects to unity servers first and
then they go from Unity servers to what
every other client that you want to
communicate with and it does this to
avoid problems with firewall and net
configuration and that kind of stuff so
that it just works all of this stuff can
be done manually you can do this on your
own
however it's actually kind of difficult
and if you have never played around with
service before and you find the stuff
that I show you in this video to be on
may be kind of difficult
I wouldn't recommend our beginning with
that yet I mean this kind of stuff can
be fairly advanced it can definitely be
done of course it can be taught if you
if you really want to get into it do
that but it's not something that you
just do overnight so and that's why
unity provides this and I definitely
recommend that you are use it so let's
look a bit on pricing shall we so here
you have the unity services page and you
can see that it says here that it's
backed by you
with unity matchmaker servers and the
unity relay servers so that was what I
was talking about you can see that the
personal Edition includes 20 CCU for
multiplayer development and again this
is only on the development and includes
200 for the professional Edition so
unity charges 0.49 on dollars per
gigabyte are used by the Unity
matchmaker and relay servers and only
those all of the other traffic doesn't
matter and you can see here that they
have made a tool to estimate the monthly
bill that you're going to have and this
is very much an estimate things can vary
it's very hard to predict how many
concurrent users you are going to have
how many messages they will send how
much how large these are messages are
and all that stuff but it's here so if
you have an idea of what this is going
to be you can check it out for now I
would just worry about building the game
and seeing if you can you can actually
turn it into something that's worth
publishing and if you do then it's maybe
time to look into this kind of stuff so
but it's definitely here and you should
definitely read up on different
alternatives to publishing your game
online it's it's it's a whole world out
there good so that's how unity is
multiplayer system works and how they're
matchmaking works and if we go back into
unity now we can refresh our
configuration and it's going to list
here the same information that we had on
in the chrome tab here so I have a pro
subscription plan with 200cc you limit
and we're currently using serial and
what we basically able to do now is if
you go into our network manager we don't
need to change a single thing here
instead we can simply go ahead and hit
play and then instead of using LAN host
online client we go and enable the
matchmaker there and unity now can
create an internet match meaning a room
for people to join and then it can of
course find an internet match and it's
really that easy to you so you type in a
real name you
create then you find and it will connect
you to one of them and you can just um
you can just choose to connect to the
correct room and everything works of
course this our UI is very temporary and
I definitely want to change this in an
upcoming video so that was all we needed
to do what I'm going to do now is simply
build this for the Mac that I have
standing nearby and I'm going to build
it for the Windows client here as well
and then I'm just going to record that
the two are connecting to each other and
I'm going to make sure to put my Mac on
a separate network so that you can see
that it doesn't only work on land so
let's do that now and of course when I'm
building here just going to build
settings and then I'm switching between
Windows and Mac and then I'm just
hitting build and choosing a place for
that to happen so that's all I'm doing
if you don't have the Mac OS X here
you're going to need to re R run the
Installer and choose it as a installable
component so you have the ability to
choose whether or not you want to be
able to export to Mac and so if you
haven't chosen that you should go ahead
and rerun the installer so I'll see you
in a little bit
so as you can see I've set up my Mac
alongside my Windows computer and I'm
just now creating a test Lobby on the
Mac then I'm switching to the window
hitting fine internet match and then I'm
choosing the lobby that we just created
and that should bring the two players
inside of the same room and you can see
that all of our network code is working
so that was pretty much it for this
video I hope you enjoyed it and I'll see
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
