everyone and welcome to the second video
in the going to DS short series today we
are going to be taking a look at making
player control so that's going to be
really awesome and you might notice that
in the 2d assets pack available on
brackish comm we have a 2d character
controller now which is great for 2d
platformer games and this was originally
made by Mike dis arrow so thanks to him
now let's get started with today's video
so as always I have opened double unity
and if we first off go ahead and focus
on the player so what we're going to do
is we're going to add a box Collider so
go to add component and you can see
that's a new tab called physics 2d let's
select this and hit the box Collider now
we can go ahead and adjust the size it
didn't do this automatically because
I've added this shadowing effect so
things that the image starts out here so
we're just going to shrink this down a
bit first off the size on the x-axis is
going to be zero point 2 4 and the size
on the y-axis is going to be 2 points I
believe it's 6 8 nope 8 6 there we have
it and that looks really precise and you
can of course zoom in and edit it
further now now we can just go ahead and
add the script so let's hit add
component new script and let's call this
player controls and we're going to make
it a type JavaScript throughout this
short series we're going to be using
JavaScript because I find it easiest for
complete beginners to learn and this is
mostly for beginners to intermediate
users but you can of course go ahead and
convert it to c-sharp and it will work
just fine
let's hit create an ad and double-click
it to open it up in monodevelop for the
new monodevelop looks way cleaner
and has the mod yeah a much more clean
interface let's first off delete the
function start because we're not going
to need it now we can go ahead and
declare some variables so let's type var
move up what we're going to do is we're
going to store what keys we want to
press in order for our players to move
up and down as variables a lot of people
don't know that you can do this but it's
really handy because we need two players
each with their set of controls and we
don't want to manage inputs controls or
create several script for that instead
we can just store it as a variable so
we're going to do type key code and then
make another variable called move down
which is also going to be of type key
code at last we are going to create a
third variable called speed and let's do
a type float and we're just going to set
that equal to ten by default now in the
function update let's create the if
statements that are going to check for
input so if input dot get key and then
we're going to open up a parenthesis and
type move up so if we press the move up
key something's going to happen then
let's do else if input dot get key and
this time we are going to type move down
so if we press the down key something
something else is going to happen and at
last we want in an else statement and
the reason for this is that we are not
going to be adding force to our player
instead we are going to access the
velocity directly this will allow us to
get the really tight and snappy controls
which is which are usually in old-school
arcade games and not those floaty
annoying kinds of controls but it also
means that once we have set the velocity
it will stay the same because it's not
affected by gravity or any other force
so basically once we press a key the
player will just keep on moving and we
want them to stop whenever we don't
press anything so we are going to do
else and in here we can set the velocity
to be zero but before we can change the
velocity at all we need to add a
rigidbody so let's head back into unity
and see that the variables now appear
let's select the move up and change it
to W because this is the player on the
left and I want that to be W there and
they move down to s the speed we're just
going to leave that at 10 now we can go
ahead and hit add component physics to D
and then rigidbody 2d you can see that a
lot of these settings are just like the
old rigidbody component we're going to
start off by changing the gravity scale
to zero because we don't want the player
to fall to the ground also we're going
to check fixed angle which is a really
new awesome feature making our object
stationary on the rotation meaning that
it won't just rotate when we play the
game now we can go ahead and open up the
script again and unity has made the
naming of their new functions really
easy to remember basically once you want
to do something to the specific like
exes sing a 2d rigidbody all we have to
do is type what we used to type and then
put 2d after so if we want to access the
rigidbody we are just going to do rigid
body and then put 2d after then we are
going to do dot velocity and then we're
going to do the y axis because that's
the up and down and we're going to set
that speed you're going to do the same
in the next one
rigidbody 2d velocity dot y equal speed
but we want to reverse the direction we
want this to go downwards so what
we can do is we can say speed times
minus one so by multiplying with minus
one we reverse the variable speed thus
our object will move downwards in the
else statement here we're going to type
rigidbody2d
dot velocity dot y and then just equal
it to zero this way our object one move
now we can go in and play with our
controls sorry it play and now we can
move up and down so this is working just
how we want it you can easily duplicate
the cade the player and change the move
up and down and now we have two players
you will also notice that we can move
off-screen this is something we are
going to change in an upcoming video
where I'm going to show you a cool
script I made where it will
automatically adjust colliders or
boundary boxes that they're also known
to fit the screen size so that's going
to be really awesome thank you for
watching this video and I'll see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
