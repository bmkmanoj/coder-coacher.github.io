asset pack available at dev assets calm
the western props back by dark Ellen
that's with everything else on the site
it's pay what you want we've been
working super hard to get everything
just right so that you guys will choose
to support the project after all we are
counting solely on your support
so you can of course just go grab the
pack from the link in the description
and set it up yourselves but he isn't
sure to turn how to get everything
working in unity in case you're in doubt
so so download the assets just go to dev
assets comm and you can see it's pretty
much here on the front page so let's
just go ahead and click on that image
you can check out some of the
screenshots here and when you're ready
to download simply select the price that
you can afford and go ahead and hit the
blue button it's going to download at
the zip file that we can just double
click it's going to open up and we can
see this weapon props pack folder we can
just drag that to any location on the
computer and it's going to unzip it then
we can open up the western props pack
folder inside is a readme a models
folder and a western props unity package
if you're not using unity you can go
ahead and grab all the models and
textures inside of the models folder
everything is neatly organized if you
are using unity however I really
recommend just double clicking on the
western props unity package as you can
see I have an empty unity project
already open
so when we double-click it it's just
going to start importing so click import
wait for unity to load everything in and
a Western props pack should now appear
in your project panel so let's expand
that and double click on the example
scene and we can see just how easy it
was to get all these awesome looking
models working inside of unity this is
rendered without any effects on the
camera just plain models so if we now
want to bring one of these props into
our game we can simply go to the prefabs
folder select the one we'd like I'm just
going to go ahead and take the wooden
barrel here and rub it into your scene
notice how every single model uses the
standard shader and has both an ax B Doe
a metallic a normal map and an occlusion
map it's pretty much tailored to work
with unity right at the gate and pretty
much any other PBR workflow the amazing
part about this is that we can easily
change the mood of our scene and still
have the models look awesome let's for
example just take our directional light
and disable it and all of a sudden we
have a nice-looking nighttime scene and
all of the models are rendering
appropriately let's pretty much it for
this video I will of course have a
regular tutorial out on Sunday and until
then I hope you will just enjoy going
nuts with this pack so yeah thanks for
watching and I will see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
