Metta thank you so much for donating if

thanks for tuning in at brac ease hello
I want to welcome to this video in
creating a tower defense game in unity
today we'll be adding a laser beam er to
our game so it's always a lot of fun to
play around lasers and today we'll just
be importing the our model for the chart
will also be setting on the line
renderer that will give that laser we
feel whenever we shoot stuff and then in
an upcoming video because it was a bit
too much to squeeze into just one video
will also be slowing down enemies
whenever they're hit so that will allow
for more interesting gameplay mechanics
and give the user more abilities to
create interesting are kind of defensive
setups so that is what we're going to be
doing today and without further ado
let's just jump right into it so as you
can see I'm pure in unity and I really
want to begin with just importing the
models so let's minimize unity here and
head on over and open the tower defense
assets pack and you can of course
download this for free and that's the
link for that in the description so
let's just let's jump right into our
models folder under our laser Beamer and
you can see that's both a blend file
here in case you have blender installed
and if you do not we'll just use the FBX
as we have done the other time so let's
just use that one and drag it into unity
but before we do that let's create a
folder here on our imports and let's
call that laser beam erm just to stay
nicely organized we can drag the FBX in
there instead and you will of course see
that it creates a laser beam object
which we will put a scale factor of 0.5
on and hit apply and then we have a
materials folder with all the different
materials that will just be modifying a
tiny bit here in a second so now let's
take our laser beam er and drag it into
the scene and let's reset the transform
if it isn't already and hit F to focus
in on that just shift it back to
perspective view there let's have a look
in the scene view here how it looks in
game and I think it looks just fine
however there are some things here that
we need to tweak so the first thing is
that we want this to be in one word ah
that's just
preference of mine whenever dealing with
stuff inside of unity and then I want to
rename these things here so this one
here is the base that is what we call
the other ones and this is going to be
the head awesome then we can change the
materials for to make this look a bit
better so let's find our bolts here I
actually want them to be black you can
of course choose whatever you want here
and I'm going to bump up the metallic
Ness on those and bump down the
smoothness a bit on there we go actually
make them a bit darker a bit more
metallic I guess that will actually
Dargan them and then we can take the
base here because I think and that is
the stand here let's rename that to base
as well so we don't get confused and I
think this is a bit too blue so let's
actually make it more over in the gray
area here a bit more metallic take down
the smoothness just a tad and maybe even
lighten it up a bit here so something
like that is a lot better because I
wanted to kind of get in a be in line
with the other arm
turret stance so that's fine I do want
it to be a tiny bit more blue then we
can take our main turret which is this
part up here and actually really like
this the feel of this I just want it to
be more metallic which means that it
will be darkened then therefore we have
to brighten it up in our colour and then
I think we can maybe take our smoothness
and just doubt that down just a tad and
I really like the feel of this and then
we can find our third accent here which
is this a yellow colour and we can
definitely go with the yellow but I
think we just need to dial it down
just a tiny bit um for this to look a
bit better something like that and it's
just small tweaks here and there finally
we have the pipe I think we can make
that pop even more so let's just give
that even more of a purple colour a tiny
bit of metallic Ness and then definitely
bump down the smoothness here and I
think that looks pretty cool definitely
looks laser II maybe even toxic so
that's fine and on what we can do now is
just I actually apply our turret script
so let's apply our turret here and we'll
give this
a range of say 20 and we won't mess with
the fire rate that's not going to matter
because we're going to be creating our
own little system for dealing with armed
lasers because they are kind of an
ongoing thing and we have the enemy
attack we'll just leave that and then we
need to add a pot to rotate so let's
just right-click create a new empty
object and reset that and call this one
our part to rotate and let's drag this
under our head and then reset the
transform to that drag it out again and
that will just Center it kind of where
it needs to be which is here and now of
course we need to have our blue z arrow
point in the direction of our head so
we've done this multiple times and we're
just making sure that when we rotate
this it will actually align with the z
axis being forward so that we don't have
to do any messing around with any
rotation since I have the script we just
do that in here which is much more
visual so make sure it says pivot pivot
and local up here and then we can maybe
zero DX on the X and um zero the
coordinate on the X and then us put a 90
that will have to be a negative 90 on
the Y and let's also put a 1 1 1 scale I
think that's going to be better and then
we can take our head here and drag that
under the pot to rate rotate and we can
just say continue here and now we should
be see that our pot to rotate points in
the correct direction and we can just
easily move this part around awesome so
now we can reference that in here as
well so let's drag our pot to rotate
into the pot to rotate field and finally
we need a bullet prefab except we're not
going to be using bullets so we'll
ignore that as well however we do want a
fire point um so we'll have some place
where our laser will origin so and we
are just going to create that as we've
always done on the d-pad to rotate
rotate so let's create an empty there
again reset it and we'll name this our
fire point and we will make sure again
to position this correctly so let's view
it from this side
I'd switch to isometric view and we can
just drag that up there and I want it to
be pretty close now because we're not
actually instantiating anything here
we're just kind of putting a point for
the line renderer so we can get really
close and um it's actually centered from
the front here I believe already that's
awesome yeah great cool so now we can
drag this in select the line
the laser beam er and drag the fire
point on to the correct slot and there
we go so I believe that was all we
needed to set up on on this object so
far so let's actually go out and turn
this into prefab now so let's go into
prefabs and drag that in there the
entire laser Beamer and we'll just have
it sit here for a moment so that we can
easily change things if we want to so
the next thing is kind of adding this to
our build menu so that we can actually
put it in the game as the game is
running so and to do this again we find
our overlay canvas under sharp and then
we see that we have a standard chart and
a missile launcher item and I will
really wants me to spend money these
days so I'll just dismiss that the only
thing that's running out is my patience
the hell from there we go
so I'll duplicate our missile launcher
item here and I will call this one armed
laser Beamer and we'll actually do laser
beam a item and we need to change the
icon and we'll do that in just a second
but let's also change the cost text down
here and I'll change that to say 350
dollars to make it very expensive which
means we'll have to make it powerful as
well and we need to go into the shop and
change this function here and I believe
we can just go ahead and do that right
now so let's double click on the shop to
be taking over here and let's double
click that to open it up in Visual
Studio and all we need to do here is
first add a new turret blueprint so
we'll go public chart blueprint and this
is going to be our laser beam err and
we'll add a new function for this as
well
so we'll call this one deselect lace
Bheema and it's going to say laser beam
are selected there we go and we are
going to select the turret to build and
we're going to pass in our laser beam
are of course awesome and one thing that
I actually noticed is that under our
build manager if we go to a game master
and find a build manager here you can
see that we still have a standard turret
and a missile launcher prefab referenced
but we're not using those in any way so
let's just double click on that and go
in here and remove those two fields
there's really no reason for those to
sit there because we are passing them
along on inside of the turret blueprint
so we can just remove those and you can
see that we should still be error free
down here awesome so now that we've
added those we can find our shop and we
can find our laser beam err and we can
set this up so let's set the cost to 350
and let's also find our prefab and drag
that in there cool so I believe that was
kind of all we needed to setup in terms
of the shop here except of course we
need to add an icon so let's have a look
at importing on one of those then again
I inside of the arm inside of the tower
defense assets pack I have a sprites
folder and I've included a laser beam
err icon dot P&amp;amp;G that's also a Photoshop
file if you use Photoshop again I'm just
going to import the PNG here and let's
find our um icons folder and let's drag
that right in there I believe the other
ones we imported were PNG as well let me
just check for that because I like to
use the same actually the first one was
a Photoshop we'll just do a PNG here it
really doesn't matter on my system so
you can see here that the texture type
is going to set to texture we need to
change that to 2d and UI and the sorting
here or the Alpha Channel should be
sorted out and I believe that's all we
need to change except we can maybe on
change this to 512 if we have our CD and
then we can make this to color um there
we go just to make it display really
beaut
and then we can change that inside of
the our missile launcher icon here
change that to the laser beam err so you
can see that setup inside of your unity
scene and I actually think that looks
fairly decent good okay things are
moving along I actually wanna maybe make
it a tiny bit Baker
um actually want to make it maybe 120
down here I think that's better and that
looks really really cool so now we
should be able to just hit play and
select the laser beam err and it should
say boobs
that's something here we haven't
assigned oh that's on a laser beam maybe
we haven't assigned a bullet prefab for
now just what testing will go in here
and just assign a normal bullet one
we'll just do a bullet there we go
just that we won't get any errors so we
can select here our missile or it says
missile launcher selected that's because
we have to find our laser beam err item
now we go into the shop and we have to
change the on click event so we've
actually added the function but we
haven't changed this event so it still
points to the Select missile launcher
function so we just need to go under
shop and change that to select laser
Beamer and we should be all right so
let's try and hit play now clicking
there laser beam are selected and
clicking somewhere in the scene and you
can see it appears and we can only
purchase one because we actually don't
have that much money when starting up
cool so now I think it's time to add in
a line renderer to do some actually
lasering laser ring laser thing so let's
do that so let's create a we could
either actually put it just in here or
we could put it as a separate object I
think we're just going to put it on the
road but you can do anything you want so
let's just put it here and um we're not
going to be casting shadows we're not
going to be receiving shadows motion
vectors will just leave on will have one
material which will specify in a moment
let's just set up some temporary
positions here that will allow us to
view what this looks like so let's put a
y-value of three and a
why're your three down here and then as
the value of maybe five just so we can
see kind of what is going on actually we
could put it out here but I think this
is going to be fine good so this is what
our line currently looks like not too
awesome so let's go to um excuse me I
think I'll have to take a sip of water
here that's better
all right so let's go into our
parameters and let's uh put our start
with two point three and our end with
two point three as well cool that is
definitely better and then we can go
inside of our know our positions are
fine we can go and find an actual
material so let's create a new one
inside the materials folder let's create
a new material and let's call this one
laser let's then go back to a laser beam
er and drag the laser in there and we
can go down here change the shader to
something like unlit color maybe or you
could go particles are alpha blended
actually I think I'm going to go alpha
blended and um you can see that we can
mess around with the color in here so
that's what we're going to be doing so
let's take our start color here and
change that to some kind of orangey
thing let's take our end color actually
I want to switch that around um this one
needs to be a bit actually let's do the
first one red and the other one yeah
let's do that so this one will be kind
of bright almost yellow and this one is
going to be kind of red to give that
cool-looking effect there and we can
maybe make the first one here a bit
transparent as well and this is where I
want to go in to our material and bump
this up a bit and also bump this up a
bit
something like that looks a bit better
and there we go
I actually think that looks kind of nice
I'm looking inside of the game we view
here just to get an idea of how that
looks and you can definitely go ahead
and add more effects around this one
thing that I do recommend is that you
add the tip of the delay to add some
kind of party
system that you toggle on and off in
order to give a cool impression that the
lace is actually hitting the object and
there's sparks bouncing off and stuff
like that
it's that if that's something you really
want to see me do leave that in the
comment and I'll include it in the next
video for slowing down the enemies and
stuff like that then we'll just go
particle crazy which you know I love
it's not really not that I don't want to
do it so please leave a comment
okay so we'll continue the video here so
we've set up these parameters and are we
actually ready to go ahead and make this
interactive through the script so let's
apply this and it don't worry about this
being looking weird like this we can
just delete our laser beam err should be
totally fine and then we can um find the
scripts called chart there we go so
let's double-click our third script and
we'll move things around a bit here and
to organize them for what we want to do
so currently we have these apps your
boots I want to call this general and I
pretty much only want our range to being
here because the next thing that I want
to do is have one cold on use bullets
and this is going to be the default and
in here we have stuff for bullets we
have the fire rate the fire countdown we
also have the bullet prefab awesome so
we'll just put all of those in there and
then we'll create a new header down here
which is going to be armed use of course
laser and we'll remove the default there
and to include the laser what we'll do
is we'll have a boolean that on the arm
that we can check inside of the editor
if we want the chart to use a laser
instead so we'll just do a public poll
used later and we'll set that equal to
false by default awesome and then in
here we can also have other stuff like a
reference to a line render so let's do a
public line renderer and we'll just do
line renderer by the way in case you
missed on the recent brackets live
stream it's
on the YouTube channel as a reupload so
you can check that out we created on the
curve fever the snake-like game and in
there we do a lot of stuff with the line
renderer and we do that in unity 5.5
which is currently in public beta but
will probably soon be released for real
um and there's so much new stuff done to
the line renderer it looks so much
better so if you think this is looking
kind of not that great I'll go check
that out and play around with the
features there there's so much stuff to
make it look a lot better and especially
with particles as well so that's a lot
of fun and you can check that out just
wanted to mention that so we have the
public line renderer here and let's
actually put this to use and just to
give you an idea of what we just did let
me just find our prefabs and then find
our laser beam in here and you can see
that this is now much more nicely
grouped and we'll just for the laser
beam err here we'll have to check the
you use laser and we'll drag a line
renderer right in there so if it's
sitting on another object you can just
drag in that object and it will select
the line renderer for you so that should
take care of all of that and we can just
remove the bullet prefab here not that
it matters I it's just not the one that
we're using cool by the way I'll just
throw in one more point before
continuing if you want to set this up
even more nicely so that you have a
variable called used bullets or maybe
even an enumerator to select either
bullets or laser and then it will show
fields depending on what you've selected
then i really suggest creating an editor
script and unity is so easily extendable
with those it's just too much for this
video that simply switches between
displaying those that's super easy to do
and you can just look up unity custom
editor good so that was all so now we
can continue so let's find the place
here where we update stuff so in here we
check if our target is equal to null and
if it isn't meaning that we have a
target we lock on to it and then we
handle some shooting so let's take all
of this logon code and move into
separate function we should have done
this a long time ago so let's call this
one lock on target and we'll move that
down here so board lock on target and
we'll just paste in that entire code
blog in there and um then we can put an
if statement here saying if used laser
then we want to laser stuff whoops not
used laser we want to create a new
function called lace that's really
annoying let's just create the function
here instead of getting around visual
studios autocomplete so we'll have a
void laser down here and now we should
be able to title type it up here so
laser and um if not so if we're using
bullets we can go ahead and do all this
fire countdown shooting stuff awesome
and you can of course put that into a
separate function as well but since we
already have a shoot function I don't
really think that's necessary
um cool so um and I can see that I've
pressed insert there just needed to get
rid of that so inside of our laser what
we can now do is say line renderer dot
and then we can set the positions of the
different points that we want our line
renderer to go through so again if you
haven't seen the livestream and I cover
this in there there's the positions
array here meaning on each of these
elements here in the array is a point
that our line renderer will go through
so we can actually create more if you
want kind of a bending laser if you want
one that sticks ax or whatever you can
definitely do that but for now we'll
just create a symbol line and we'll do
that by simply setting the first element
and the second element in the array so
we'll just do line renderer that's set
position and we do that using an index
so in our case the first element is
index that's zero and giving it a
position and that's going to be our own
position but we want not to use that we
want to use our fire point fire point up
transform dot actually it's it's a
transform so we can just do fire point
up position and we want to set the
second
one so line renderer dot set position
one to our targets position so target
dot position there we go so that
actually does it for us and we should
see this working already so if we go in
here if we hit play and place down our
turret we can see that that works
however you will want to also notice
that when our enemy here gets out of
range the line renderer does not
disappear so what we have to do in order
to get that working is just using the
fact that up here we're checking whether
or not we have a target so let's just
make this a bit bigger here so let's say
if target is equal to null we definitely
want to return but we want to do some
stuff before that and that is just
checking if line renderer actually let's
first check if our used laser is true so
you only want to do this kind of stuff
if we're actually using a laser and in
that case we can say if line renderer
actually we don't even need to do that
if statement we could do that if
statement ah we'll do it if line
renderer dud arm enabled then we want to
disable it so we can just do line
renderer dot enabled equals false there
we go and if you can of course put that
inside the audio statement that's what
oh but I think this is easier to read
and then on down here we can simply say
that if line renderer dot enabled and
then put an exclamation mark so if it's
not enabled we'll do line renderer dot
enabled equals true there we go so this
way we easily switch it on and off and
we only do it once even though we are
doing all of this stuff inside the
update loop so if we now hit play we
should see that when we spawn this in we
no longer have a line up here and that
on there's no line until we actually get
a target and as soon as he's out of
range our line renderer just again
disappear
so that is working just the way we
wanted to and um yeah again for the next
video we'll be slowing down the
opponents if you want me to add some
damage or with time let me know if you
want me to add more particles or more
effects let me know I would love to do
that and yeah so that's pretty much all
I wanted to show for this video I hope
you enjoyed it and I will see you in the
next one thank you so much to all of the
