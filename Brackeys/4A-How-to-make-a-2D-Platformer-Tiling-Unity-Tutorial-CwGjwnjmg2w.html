welcome to the fourth video in the how
to make a 2d platformer course today we
are going to be taking a look at making
our background and foreground elements
style as the player progresses it will
allow us to create very small levels but
still the player will be able to
infinitely explore them so that's going
to be really awesome we're going to talk
about a lot of cool calculations with
the camera to world position we are
going to do some performance
optimization it's going to be really
awesome so yeah let's get started and of
course if you don't want to do all of
the scripting which is understandable
though I think it's wise if you do
please go to Brad keys comm where you
can go to the 2d platformer page and
download the all the scripts and assets
and everything else right here for free
so if you have errors that's a good
place to go awesome so let's open up a
unity and it's just as we left it the
last time one thing I do want to go
ahead and tweak though is that I want to
get a little bit more parallaxing on the
foreground right now the effect is a bit
too subtle so what I realized is because
we have an auto graphic camera we can
simply just move it forward so let's
just drag out the blue background so we
won't affected and let's just move the
better main camera backward is what I
meant to say so let's just move it a bit
back here you can move it as far as you
want as long as it's inside of this
rectangle but let's just move it like
there and then let's drag the blue
background back on the main camera then
we can simply take our foreground and we
can just move it over so right about
here I think is going to be good yeah
that's just
now the parallaxing is more apparent and
it looks like the ground is closer to
the camera which is nice cold so let's
let's go ahead and actually create the
script
but before we started writing it let me
just explain what it's going to do so
I've made this drawing this explanation
drawing here and I of course excuse my
drawing skills I am not so practiced in
the odd of drawing with the computer
mouse
but what I've drawn here is the player
in the center which can he can move to
the left and the right up and down won't
matter for this tutorial we are going to
focus on the x-axis and this rectangle
here represents what the camera sees
this red line down here is the
foreground element which is going to
work just like the background and what
we are going to do is we are going to
take point a here which is the x
position of the of the extent of the
foreground here so we're going to take
the edge here and we're going to take
the x position of that and then we are
going to take the B point here which is
going to be the extent of the camera so
in Weld points what is the camera see
and then we're going to ask ourselves is
a bigger than B so is this ground
further out than B if it's not then we
are going to go ahead and instantiate a
new one and we can do the same over here
so is see that smaller than D and if not
then we want to go ahead and spawn
something and the the things we're going
to spawn are just the same element which
we are going to repeat and the
foreground I've made repeatable but the
background I have not so we're going to
do a cool trick with that where we
revert its size so that we won't get
weird clipping issues so we're going to
look into that but basically we are
going to instantiate what we're going to
refer to as a buddy which is basically
just a clone of the element and then
we're going to position it so it just
aligns with the element itself and to
take care of performance we can
have some variables saying that do we
have a left body until we have a right
body and if we have both we are not
going to do these calculations at all so
that's the basics of what we are going
to be doing today so let's dive right
into it so I'll keep that open in case
we need it and let's go ahead and select
our foreground dirt here and let's
create a new script actually before that
let's disable parallaxing in our DM
object because that will interfere with
the with the instantiation of new
grounds I have a trick for that and
we're going to fix it
soon but when we're debugging we're just
going to disable that cool so let's
select the foreground dirt
let's hit add component new script and
let's call this mmm tiling let's keep it
simple let's double click this to open
it up in monodevelop awesome
so this script is going to be pretty
long but it's not too complicated it
just has many parts first thing we're
going to do is we're going to require a
component and this is a really awesome
feature oops let me zoom in here so you
can see what's going on oh man it's good
that I didn't forget that we're going to
require a component meaning that once we
attach this script a unit is
automatically going to check if a
component is attached to the game object
and if not it's going to create one so
that's really awesome because we're
going to only use the script with sprite
renderer so we're going to require a
sprite renderer to do this type to
square brackets and inside of those type
require component then open up some
parentheses where we're going to type
type off and then open up another set of
parentheses where we're going to do
sprite renderer this is a good way to
make sure that we always have a sprite
renderer attached so we won't get errors
in our code possum
Wow I said that like five times thirty
but it's awesome we're going to declare
some variables the first one is going to
be a public int and this is going to
store our offset we want to offset this
just a tiny bit because if we check the
cameras position versus the grounds edge
here if you check a and B on this exact
point it is pretty prone to error so we
are just going to make sure that B is
like maybe two units to the left so that
we will or to the right so that we will
always make sure be sure that a buddy is
instantiated before we get there
so we're just going to offset the
calculations a tiny bed so we're going
to do offset x equals let's just do two
it's not that important just a tiny bit
then we're going to do public pool and
the boolean is the true or false value
and we're going to see a name this has a
ride buddy and we are going to default
this to false then we're going to create
another one which is also going to be a
public pool has a left buddy and we're
going to also going to default this to
false so these two are what we're going
to check whenever we instantiating does
it already have a buddy do we even need
to do the calculations and such then
we're going to do public full reverse
scale and this is also going to be equal
to false by default this is what we're
going to use for the background elements
that I've not made tile able then we're
going to do private float and in here
we're going to store the width of a
sprite so that we know how how long the
element is so we can
should we check these positions so we're
going to do sprite with equals zero F
actually let me comment out some of
these so this is going to be the the
offset so that we don't get any weird
errors these are used for checking if we
need to instantiate stuff then we have
the reverse scale used if on the object
it's not tie label and then we have the
sprite width which is the width of our
texture of our element let's call it
that our other mint awesome and then
right below this we're going to do
private camera so we're just going to
store a short reference to our camera
just as we did in the last tutorial for
performance reasons and because it's
awesome and then private transform my
transform and this is for a performance
reason that we are storing the objects
transform in a variable it's just faster
and generally good practice cool let's
now create a new function so let's do
bard awake and again awake is where you
want to do all of the referencing sing
between scripts so we're going to do cam
equals camera mate and we are going to
do my transform equals transform yep and
the void start in here we're going to
assign the sprite renderer and we are
going to check the width so we're going
to do sprite renderer and let's just
call this s renderer it's not something
that we're going to use frequently
equals get compile
and then this is the syntax and then
inside of these two signs we're going to
write sprite renderer so that's the type
of component that we want to get and I
don't remember I'm pretty sure that you
can only have one sprite renderer that
would make sense so but this is just
going to grab the first component of the
type you insert so if there's multiple
it's just going to going to return the
first one and then we're going to do
sprite with equals s renderer so our
sprite renderer that sprite dot bounds
dot size dot X ok so that will give us
the width of our element no matter how
we size it so that's that's a really
great feature cool then in the update
function and this is where it gets kind
of exciting what we're going to do here
is first we are going to make an if
statement and inside of this we are
going to do has a right yeah let's do
left first has the left body is equal to
false or has Andi these two signs are
used for or and the reason why I copy
pasted them is because my keyboard is
being annoying right now with certain
symbols just have to configure that
these are called vertical bars if you
cannot figure out how to make them on
your keyboard just write how to make
vertical bar on Google and you'll figure
it out many people have asked me this so
I just thought I wanted to say but these
basically means or so whenever you're
checking for something you can check
does it have a left body or does it have
a right buddy
cool so then we're going to check has a
right body and this is going is equal to
false and then close it off and let's do
the parenthesis so
we're going to close these yeah so here
we're just checking
does it still need buddies if not -
nothing cool so now we're going to
calculate the cameras extent meaning
half the width of what the camera can
see in world coordinates so if we look
at our drawing here we're going to
calculate the the position B over here
so we're going to calculate the length
from the center of the camera to the
point B so we do this by doing float cam
horizontal extent so what we're going to
call it and it's going to be equal to
cam dot autographic size times screen
dot width divided by screen dot height
so this will return this will equal to
the the length from the center of the
camera to its right bar and let's just
comment this out also so we're going to
do calculate the cameras extent meaning
half their width of what the camera can
see and it's going to be in world
coordinates versus pixels coordinates
great so now right below this we are
going to calculate the exposition where
the camera can see the edge of the
sprite so we can take this into
consideration we're going to use the
sprite width and the current position of
our object and we're going to calculate
at what position the camera
and see the edge of the ground so we're
going to do calculate the exposition
where the camera can see the edge of the
sprite which is the element and we are
going to write float edge visible
position right so we're going to split
it up into the right position and the
left position and this one is going to
be equal to my transform that position
dot X so our current x position plus
sprite with divided by two because we we
want to only get half of it because it's
this distance here and then we're going
to do close off the parentheses and then
we're going to do - cam horizontal
extent so we are factoring in our own
position then we are adding on half the
spread width which is basically the
sprite extent and then we are
subtracting the cam horizontal extent to
figure out the position where we would
intersect then we're going to do this
same calculation for the left position
so we're going to do edge visible
position left equals my transform dot
position X and then this time we're
going to do - sprite width divided by 2
plus cam horizontal extent so we are
just inverting the calculations
basically
