to another robotics with the Raspberry
Pi tutorial video we're going to build
off the last video and this time we're
going to take away all user control and
let the car control itself we still only
have one sensor in the front I might do
another video later with the center in
the rear as well so two sensors I bought
a bunch of these distant sensors so
maybe we'll do that after that we would
be out of GPIO pins so we'll see I also
picked up a camera so probably have a
video where we add a camera to that and
for this video will take away user
control but we'll end up adding user
control back once we have the camera
just to play around with the camera and
kind of remote controlling by a camera
so that'll be kind of fun also have some
parts already and then other parts are
on their way for a quadcopter and
that'll probably be my main focus in the
next month or so so stay tuned for that
too and start collecting some quadcopter
parts if you're interested so with that
let's go ahead and get started there's a
few minor housekeeping things we need to
do but for the most part changing to
autonomy is relatively simplistic so
let's go ahead and get started the first
thing we want to do is change directory
in robotics and in there we have sensor
up I I've already changed my sensor dot
pi but I'll at least explain what the
change was it was pretty simple small
change so go sudo nano sensor Chi and
once you're in there you're going to
want to come to the bottom this part you
want to comment out print distance cm we
don't want to print that every time we
import because if you import this it's
going to do that the other thing we
already had to try and accept here but
we were passing on the exception now say
distance equals 100 and then run GPIO
cleanup course and return distance
because that's going to become a problem
later on when we start checking for
distance very frequently and if it's
less than something we want to do
something so before it was returning
none and none is less than 20 so it
becomes an issue so anyways once that's
done escape out of there make sure you
save it and now we're going to do is go
sudo nano robot
was a robot v dot pi and now we're going
to make some small changes here the only
thing we want to import is going to be
important random we're gonna use that
just so it's it does some random stuff
for us the next thing we want to do is
we want to go ahead and comment out all
this key input stuff we'll come back to
it later but for now add three three
quotes but above that and then after
this add another three coke quotes
doesn't make it clear that that's
commented out but it is so just know
that that's the case now what we want to
do is let's go ahead and just make a
simple define Auto actually it's cost
autonomy Tong me auto probably would
conflict with some other name that
exists
so anyways define autonomy one two three
four time frame is going to equal 30
milliseconds zero point zero three zero
and then for X is getting equal random
dot R and range zero to four basically
what this is going to do is it's going
to give us a number of zero one two or
three not four and we're going to use
this to just do random things okay now
before I forget let's go ahead and save
this an overwrite our not overwrite
rather we're going to save it but we're
actually to call a robot six dot by now
that we've made some changes so make
sure you do that yes that's fine and now
sudo nano robot six step I come back
down to the bottom and basically what
we're going to do now is x equals random
ranch right so now we're just going to
have what do we do if it's zero what do
we do if it's one whatever you do is two
three what we're going to do is haven't
do a movement so let's say it's a zero
we're gonna have it move forward now you
want it to move forward for more than
like 0.3 seconds right 30 milliseconds
let's say we want it to move forward for
longer than that but what if we move
forward for one whole second well if we
move forward for one whole second a lot
can change as far as like how far away
something is in one second so really
while we're doing that move that whole
second we really want to be checking
distance constantly so what I'm going to
do is just make a quick
or loop and have it run through this
four loop and then kind of do it for
about a second but we want to have it
checking distance pretty much constantly
to watch out for any objects either that
maybe we're always there but we got
closer to them or some maybe something
comes into the way like an animal or
something else so for that reason let's
go ahead and come over and now what we
want to go ahead and do is we're going
to start our if statement so first we're
going to say if x equals zero what do we
want to do one two three four one two
three four well for y in range thirty
what this is going to do is just go one
two through yeah one two three four five
six seven eight nine all the way already
basically it's gonna run it 30 times so
for Y and range 30 what do we want to do
well what we need it to do first of all
we want it to let's say we want to move
forward so we're gonna say it needs to
do initiate and then it needs to go
ahead and go forward for time frame but
we also need to check the front so how
are we going to do that well we probably
should just write a function that's
going to check the front so let's come
up a little bit make some space here and
now we're going to define a function
called check underscore front empty
parameters and all this function is
going to do is run the distance command
and see how close everything is and if
it is too close do something so come
down check front starts with initiate
and then we're going to say this equals
distance because we import a distance
right now what do we want to do well if
this let's say for now is less than 15
what do we want to do well if it's less
than 15 let's go ahead and just have it
print out too close and we'll have it
print the distance too close and then
we'll just do this to close dist good
enough so if it's the case it's going to
print out to console what the problem is
it's going to initiate and then it's
going to run a reverse to now of course
if we ever add a sensor to the back
when we reverse for two whole seconds
we'd also want to do a check rear all
right because this is probably going to
reverse into stuff but for now this is
the best we've got so we'll do that and
then and then we need to do the same
thing again because let's say it gets
stuck like let's say it's stuck between
two things in Reverse for two seconds
but it might not be ready to go forward
yet so now we want to check it again so
we're gonna say this equals distance and
then again if this is less than 15 well
something went wrong right so then what
are we gonna do well let's go ahead and
print again to close and dist and then
what we want to do is we'll go ahead and
run another initiation and then we'll go
ahead and reverse for two seconds and
actually you know what what we should do
is not reverse if if we're not gaining
any more distance away from what we need
to gain so in two seconds we should be
less than or greater than 15 but if
we're not maybe something's going wrong
so maybe we should pivot left for three
seconds so we can maybe change our
direct trajectory so to speak so we'll
pivot left for three and then after we
pivot left for three we still need to
make some distance hopefully so let's
initiate again and then we run reverse
too after typing all these initiations I
kind of want to add it back to the
function so maybe we will anyway so
reverse for two seconds and then we need
to let's check distance one last time
dist equals distance and then after this
one
if this is less than 15 we could have
more and more loops like this but for
now if it's still the case we're just
going to print too close giving up and
then we'll just have it spit out the
distance and then here we're going to do
a sistex 't I believe we did import
system let's go up to the top make sure
though I think we used it for the
yeah so we do have sis so that's okay um
so that's it for check front I'm gonna
go ahead and run a quick save here um
yes because sometimes it disconnects so
I'm connected wirelessly sometimes a
signal drops it's really annoying so
anyway I just saved it entered back into
it coming back down now so now we've got
this whole check front function so now
what we're going to go ahead and do is
for Y in range 30 what we better do
instead is let's go ahead and let's make
another row here and we're going to run
check on our score run and just check
the front and so you can see so every 30
milliseconds is going to check the
distance and cover it so every 30
milliseconds is pretty darn good
so that'll do well enough for now now
that's it for that one so now we're
going to have to cover the rest of the
wave statements so L if x equals 1 what
do we want to do well we're going to say
for y in range 30 again and we're going
to do check front again and then we're
going to run initiate and then we'll run
a pivot underscore left for time frame
and that's it there or do another LF x
equals 2 for y in range 30 what do we
want to do now well first of all we need
to check underscore front then we want
to go ahead run initiate and then after
that let's do turn underscore right or
the time frame and then let's do an turn
left for this one x equals 3
for wine range 30 check front initiate
and then turn left for timeframe okay so
that should be it um scroll okay so
we're all set there in that function now
what we want to do is we only have this
function we're going to have to call it
into existence so let's go ahead and
what we would do is like let's say for Z
let's say in range we'll push it to the
limit we'll let it go 30 times what do
we actually you know it for now we're
just going to do some simple development
before we actually use it on the ground
so we'll say for Z and range 10 what do
we want to do we want to run autonomy
right cool okay so let's go ahead and
say that yes make sure it's right in a
robot 6 hit enter and now we're ready to
go so right now it shouldn't hit
anything you can see that my distance
sensor is kind of pointed down a little
bit let me see if I can fix that
that's a little better anyways kind of
loose so now we're ready to run it let's
go ahead and do sudo python robot six
dot pi now what it should do is do a
bunch of forward mamie maneuvers um turn
all that kind of stuff and then I have a
trusty little box here and when I put
that trusty box in front of it it should
reverse and if I hold it there it should
reverse then pivot then reverse so we'll
see about that and in fact maybe I'll
lift up my camera a little bit so you
can see better if it's pivoting that'll
do for now you can at least sort of see
both wheels hopefully that's good enough
for you guys so let's go ahead and just
hit enter and see if it does some things
autonomously
let's going forward hit turning turning
forward some pivot there turning good
okay cool so now let's go ahead and run
it again and we'll stick this box in
front of it and as you can see
immediately when we stick that box in
front of it it turns and it tells us
it's too close and whatnot now let's see
if it ok it's reversing pivoting
reversing and that was successful so now
it's moving again I'm imagine we're
going to hit ten soon yeah but then of
course if we do this panic pivot still
in trouble and too close giving up shut
down okay so so our body is doing
everything as we expected so that's good
now the real test is to go ahead and put
it on the ground and see what happens so
that's what we're going to be doing next
so let's go ahead and do that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
