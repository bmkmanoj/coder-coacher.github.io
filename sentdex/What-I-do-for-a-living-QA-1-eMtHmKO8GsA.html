very first QA or questioning answers
video I get a lot of the exact same
questions over and over and over so I
thought I could make these QA videos to
kind of answer them all at once for
people also so I can point people to
them so the first question that I'm
going to answer here and then also as I
answer these questions the first ones
are just ones that I've personally found
but as we go on if you want you can ask
questions in the comments and the next
time I make one of these videos I'll try
to answer at least mostly those
questions the questions that are asked
in the comments so the first question I
usually get is how did you learn Python
and not only how did you learn but how
do you learn Python nowadays like
because I get a lot of requests for like
book recommendations and stuff like this
so first of all a little bit about me I
have been self-employed since I was 12
years old I have had part-time jobs
along the way my last job was as a
waiter and that place ended up going out
of business at the time I was working
like two days a week or something just
for some side cash by that point I
already had my own businesses and I was
making almost enough money to survive I
just didn't want to quit my job but
eventually that place actually went out
of business
and then from that point on I just
worked for myself so so I'd always been
self-employed but I paid a programmer to
make websites for me and do the things
that I need I want it done but
eventually I came up with the idea for
what is now sent Dexcom which is
sentiment analysis for stocks and other
things and the web developer I had at
the time was not going to be doing
natural language processing they had no
interest in it they couldn't do it so I
decided I'll do it myself and so I found
that Python had the module or library
called NLT Kay which the natural
language toolkit and ltk dot org slash
book is a great book for learning how to
use NLT Kay and it has kind of an
introduction that is an introduction to
Python even so that actually served as
my intro to Python was that NLT Kay book
basically so a perfect introduction for
me probably horrible introduction for
most people but that's why I usually
tell people like you want to get off the
basics as soon as possible and actually
start working on something that
interests you because
the basics are boring the basics aren't
applicable really directly immediately
to anything that you might be interested
in so in most cases you can you can
usually just like learn the true basics
like if statements and variables and
functions and that kind of stuff once
you learn that stuff like get out and
like do something because that's how
you're actually going to learn anyway
that's how I learn Python nowadays I
really just kind of google everything so
I don't actually I don't have any formal
computer science or mathematics or
anything background but I just use
Google I just look it up and Google has
information on anything you could
possibly want but especially programming
the programmer community is incredibly
willing to share things so that brings
us to the second question maybe even
this one's the more common question I
get and that is what do you do for a
living so what I do for a living is I
run I've always just run online
businesses that's just kind of always
been my forte lately it's been most of
my like base income comes from Python
program at net in the YouTube channel
just from like add revenue
I can relatively comfortably estimate
how much money I'm going to make on the
YouTube channel in Python programming
net net so I make money from advertising
and then on Python program at net from
the subscribers with plus equals one so
I make a okay base salary at least
enough to like pay the bills right and
then beyond that I get contracting and
consulting jobs so if someone comes at
comes to me it has something that sounds
interesting or something I'll take those
on but for the most part I really enjoy
working on Python programming net and a
lot of people ask me like why do you do
that why don't you just like once you go
start a business as if like going first
of all as if Python print net isn't a
business but also as if it's like really
simple to just go and start start a
business and be a billionaire or
something it's really not that easy and
also as someone who likes spent much of
my life starting businesses and running
online businesses it's actually really
difficult to find something that you
you're good at you actually enjoy doing
and you get some sort of like reward
from
that isn't monetary as well so with the
YouTube channel
I get like pretty much everything plus
more so like with the YouTube channel
first of all I get to learn new things
constantly if I wasn't doing the YouTube
channel in Python programming net I
would not be anywhere near the
programmer than I am today so if I
wasn't doing that I wouldn't have
learned all these things myself and
because one of the best ways to really
like learn something is to teach it and
if you try to teach something that you
don't really know it quickly like first
of all it solidifies what you do know
and it shines a light on what you don't
know and if you're oblivious to
something that you didn't know
eventually someone's going to watch that
video and comment and tell you that
you're stupid right and so that happens
and thanks to some of those sometimes
jerk viewers but sometimes like they're
just they're good people they give you
information you actually learn just from
the fact that you shared and that's why
I like peer review is often thought of
as like a really a good thing to do it
can be painful because sometimes people
are really mean but at the same time if
you do peer review of code and stuff
like that it will make you a better
programmer over time so for me I just I
get to learn new things I get to like
focus on whatever I want to focus on I
get to learn new things over time
I get to help people and for the most
part like 99.9% of the people I interact
with in regards to Python programming
net are like super positive and and like
pleasant people to be around as opposed
to other businesses that I've run so for
example with sent XCOM it's a cool
business I really like the data analysis
aspect to it it's a lot of fun to like
dive into that that kind of big data but
at the same time at the end of the day
to make money what I have to do is sell
that data to either institutions or
individuals themselves and that can be
kind of a challenge so with institutions
you're usually dealing with like finance
firm types of people and I don't mean to
like offend anybody really but the
people in the world of finance like too
many of those people are betas who
either think they're alphas or think
that they need to act like al
was to fit in because that's what you're
supposed to do because I've seen like
movies or something like that so those
people are just not fun to deal with and
then also there was a lot of people that
as they're like interested in buying the
data I just know when speaking to them
that they're not going to get anything
from the data like they're not going
they don't know how to properly make use
of the data and I'm not here to teach
you how to use the data I'm just here to
sell you the data that you want access
to so I don't know it just was not it
wasn't fulfilling to me like I made
money doing it but it just wasn't
fulfilling and I actually still have
like I have sources that still take the
data like if you're on quanto peon for
example you can get the date you can get
access to the data for like twenty
dollars a month or something so it's at
least super cheap and it's easy to play
around and there's like a free stream of
it too so you can figure out if it's
actually going to be worth it to you so
that's just kind of like worked out but
to get back to the point of like
business like running a business is
first of all most businesses will just
fail but if you can find a business that
you like you really enjoy doing and you
have a passion for it and you make money
at it and you're good at it and you're
helping people at the same time it just
seems like well let's hold on to that in
the meantime you know we can look for
other things but I just I get so much
value back from Python programming at
net that that's why I do it I just
really really like doing it and also in
terms of recommendations that I have for
people a lot of people ask me like when
they're asking on the topic of how do
you learn Python and stuff don't forget
that one of the ways that I'm learning
Python and improving myself is by
teaching Python so I usually suggest to
people that you should do the same you
should have like a blog or maybe even a
YouTube channel like try to do that
because that will also get you exposure
so the other thing not only do I get
contracting and consulting offers I get
job offers like every week I get
multiple job offers and usually they're
like two smaller companies and stuff but
in the last couple months I've had an
offer from Apple and Facebook and
probably those are the two like biggest
companies that you would even know about
but many other companies beyond that and
I'm not reaching out to these companies
like I'm
even applying they're coming to me and
they're finding me and so you can pretty
much do the same or you can reach out if
you have something to show them that
like I hey this is what I've been doing
that's what they want to see and if you
look at like what Google applications
want or Facebook or whatever they want a
portfolio like that's what they actually
want to see nine times out of ten they
care about like your the other stuff on
your resume but for the most part they
want to see what what you do and what
you actually know anyway that will wrap
up with the first QA hopefully that was
slightly enlightening to some of you as
I said before if you have questions that
you want me to answer just comment below
and I'll answer them I still have quite
a few other questions that I get like
all the time that I'm going to answer
but these first two or at least the
second one took me a long time to get
through so I'm going to cut it off here
anyway questions below and otherwise I
will see you in the next tutorial or
question and answer video who knows</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
