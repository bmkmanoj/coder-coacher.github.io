13th financial charting tutorial where
we left off we're making a pretty nice
looking candlestick chart this was it
we've got the open well we've got the
open and closed on our candlestick and
we've got volume data here so if you
guys are familiar with Cowell stick
charting you'll notice probably
immediately that we didn't unless you
were just like too enamored with my
colors you'll notice that we're missing
something right we've got this line here
right that's going through we're missing
the shadow of the open high low close
basically so we're missing the high and
the low on this so really this
candlestick charts only showing that
half the data right we're only showing
two out of the four data sets so we
definitely need to fix that and there's
a couple of different things that we can
do one we could we can specify the color
here but natively built into finance py
I looked at their file it's literally
hard-coded that this line is black so so
we have a couple of different options
for us one is we could just change the
background color of like this chart here
to white so the black would show up but
that's pretty lame because we'd have to
move off the dark toute chart and as we
all know the dark dot charts really
essential to making money and showing
everyone that were a badass for the
reason that the dark dad charts are for
badasses is because to noobs simply
can't do it because the chart won't work
but luckily for you guys I'm gonna be
here to teach you the way of the badass
just kidding but not really anyway what
we're gonna have to do to do this is
we're going to edit the core finance
type py file and then within that the
the candlestick function now if you
don't know what any of that means that's
okay I'm gonna hold your hand through
the entire process if you don't know
what the heck you're doing just take it
slow and copy everything that I do but
really this kind of method will help you
in the future as well like if there is a
function that either
one you don't understand how it works or
two you just like it's not doing what
you want to do like what I did with when
I first saw this was like oh I wonder if
there's like a parameter for us to fill
in for a shadow so I looked at the
function and know like it's literally
hard coded as a K which denotes black
and so then I was like well okay well
we'll just edit it in so that's what we
did and that's what I'm going to show
you guys how to do so to do that we're
gonna close out of here and what you
want to do is go to my computer right
you know so you got or not mine here but
you know your computer so you
where are your disks are and whatever
python is installed for you in my case
it's in C my ears might be in another
Drive like I've got a bunch of other
drives here with operating systems and
stuff so anyway mine it's Steve for
primacy you guys it's in C so it's
popping to C then you're gonna pop over
to Python 27 then you should have a
capital L IB I don't know how many I've
probably gone into this file like
hundreds and hundreds of times
I still get these two mixed up I'm like
whom which one do i click but it's
always the one that's proper right so
anyway capital L I beep and then down
here let's see we've met plot live am I
just blind or what oh no way no we go to
site packages and then matplotlib and
then now you're in my plot lip so now we
want to do is scroll down till we get to
finance here it is now you'll notice
that there's a white one and then
there's these two black ones now the
white one is the raw file that's what we
want to do now the black one is a
compiled Python file so when we edit
this it will go to the compiled finance
so you only need to edit the one white
one so hit edit so now we reading the
finance that py file awesome so this
basically is all of the finance that py
stuff and as you'll see actually very
interestingly
find out people I does have a fetch
historical Yahoo data it's also guy it's
there's like some files in here too and
sometimes of interesting stuff if you're
interested in financial plotting it'll
behoove you did
just kind of scroll through this and see
what they are doing it's also got the
second version of candlestick which I
don't use I'm not sure what the point of
it is but yeah there's a whole bunch of
stuff and they even have like volume
overlay that's pretty interesting I mean
we might end up using volume overlay
actually it's kind of a waste so you
don't have to have volume on a separate
chart right like we've got volume on a
second subplot what you can do is
overlay the volume on top of your
current chart but part of the problem
with that is sometimes it literally will
lay over your financial data which I
don't really like but there's probably a
min and Max setting that we can all
figure out and we can just like include
that in the tutorial that's like a real
basic function so when I use is pretty
intense so maybe I could learn something
from their function anyway what we're
looking for is Candlestick so I just do
like a ctrl F right and you'll get this
little search thing and just type in
candlestick make sure it takes you to
the regular candlestick not candlestick
too so in immediately when I look at
this I see okay we've got these
parameters that will either be defined
or are defined right like these are
definable and these are the default
parameters right so so we're not going
to touch this yet but if you scroll down
here what we're looking for is if you
had no idea right what we're looking for
shadow like that's the first thing I
look for with shadow that's not here but
the only thing that is here that sorry
I've seen lines and we're appending some
sort of V line which I can only assume
means vertical line so that lead should
lead you here and then you should see
that color is K which is black for for
anybody that doesn't know what K is and
something you know you should be like oh
well that's our problem so what if we
just did white W for white and we just
kind of move this over and where is my
other one let's yeah this is it yeah so
now that we've changed that let's run
this and see if we got white sure enough
you should probably see it immediately
that it's white and if we zoom in oh
yeah yeah it's definitely white so now
we have our data back but I'm not quite
happy yet because one we just hard-coded
it just like they did I'm actually
surprised
they didn't give up for amateur for it
or two I'm show you guys but that's just
the way it is but this isn't very good
for a couple of reasons one is it just
looks ugly - it looks ugly and three if
you zoom out it kind of like the store
it said a little bit like lightens
everything up so and it looks ugly so
that's not good so what we want to do is
we're done with this edit our finance
file a little bit more and for that I'm
gonna continue on in the next video as
always thanks for watching thank you for
your support or subscriptions and until
next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
