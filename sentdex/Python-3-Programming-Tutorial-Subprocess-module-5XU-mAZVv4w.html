Python 3 tutorial video in this video
we're going to talk about is sub process
and the idea of so process is it's in a
way does replace other modules and
another way it's it's own thing entirely
but it replaces things like um like OS
dot system OS piping all that kind of
stuff as well as like some commands
basically what sub process is going to
let you do is communicate so so a system
as you saw we could we could send and do
some communication from the shell to
your command prompt bash from shell to a
script and get the output from the
script right in this way we can actually
do the reverse so we can communicate
from the script to the shell and get the
output from the shell so the best thing
to do from this point is to just kind of
go over it now up here I have a
Raspberry Pi that I'm using and then
also I have just my regular this is my
Windows 7 so depending on you know what
operating system you're using the
commands that you run are going to be
slightly different I'm going to go ahead
and CCD desktop here and then I'm gonna
CD into it and then here we're just
staying at home ok so so the first thing
you want to do now I just kind of
recommend that you run this in a shell
somewhere so you can actually see the
output because if a little bit through
the tutorial will actually capture the
output by our script in Python but to
start you don't necessarily you're not
going to always capture the output so if
you're following along and like an IDE
at first you're not going to see the
results so anyway so it just makes sense
to me either command dot exe or like
some sort of shell ssh whatever so
anyway with that let's go ahead and get
started so I'll start showing in Windows
and then I'll show it in Linux so if
you're on Windows to start a Python
interpreter you just type in Python and
then if you're in Linux you'll type
either Python
which would give you probably yeah to
seven for me so I've got both to seven
and three installed on this machine so
you hit control D and Python three
should yeah should give you Python three
interpreter make some space there come
over here okay so on Windows let's say
you wanted to run a command so a simple
command I think on both you know Linux
LS and then on Windows der is just going
to list what's in that directory so
let's cover that first so let's say if
your windows is a subprocess call and
we're going to call Durer and then we're
going to say show equals true now what
this is doing is basically sub-process
and then dot call it's like calling this
command Durer is the command it's
calling and then shell leak was true
means we want to do it within the shell
you could call it you could call it in
something else if you want it that's for
maybe a way later tutorial for now
always have shell equals true because
that's where you want to execute so
we'll call der shell equals true we hit
enter oops sub pro over silly me have to
import sub process group ok sub process
imported up arrow up arrow there now we
called der and as you can see we get
this little output here if you're in an
IDE let's say that's pure Python you
even though you did this call you
wouldn't have actually seen this data
right here so same thing on Linux I
thought if I did these like enters I
would make space but we're not making
space let me do this then okay so import
a sub process again and now um our Linux
will be LS so sub process call and we
want to call this time LS and shell
equals true so same thing as before and
this time it lists out all the things
that are basically my home directory
right so and again though if you were in
a just an IDE and you ran this on Linux
you wouldn't have any output it wouldn't
say anything so now how do we actually
acquire output
we'll go back to Windows I guess since
we're doing window
first and so to do that you would do
something like this so you could say
output equals sub process dot check
underscore output and then you do
basically the same thing we did before
so we'll say Durer and then again shell
equals true run that and now you don't
get anything but we can print a output
and now you get your output now of
course we have like this return and
newline that's coming up excuse the
language but so this one's actually
really messy but we can we can still
parse by that you know so you can really
you can use replaces and really at the
end of the day you would be parsing by
that or splitting by that really anyway
so just because it looks like that it
looks kind of ugly to our eyeballs but
for whatever reason that you were
wanting to do this in a script it's not
that not that hard now I come back over
here to Linux we can do the same thing
sub process dot chips actually we want
to define this as output equals sub
process check underscore output and
again a same output or not Durer
LS and then show equals true and then we
can print the output and there you go
you get the things that are here now
again this one's kind of ugly again but
as you can see that desktop new line
ends Moe new line ocr'd up hi PNG new
line python games all the long so those
are just a couple of quick things now I
realize that all we did was show a run a
command and how to get output from that
command but hopefully after that you can
sort of understand how powerful those
just those two things are because now
you can run any commands so for example
um let me show you let's open up a
Python 3 here so let me bring over this
okay so this is the list of all of our
Python tutorials and here we have our
system tutorial so if you remember we
did system and all that so I can hold
shift
computer open command window here and if
you recall I think it was sis dot PI
which is a really horrible name to name
that file in fact let's change that till
a cyst or something and never got in
trouble before but if you ever like
learning a tutorial RL learning it
tutorial learning a module it's really
easy to name the file something like for
example when I was practicing like SMTP
live I named it I think email or
something got Pyke's I wanted to send an
email with it and that conflicts write a
naming something sis top I conflicts
with sis so anyway that's always a
stupid idea anyway so it's just taught
now and if you remember if we ran Python
and we did insists tut dot pi and then
we said um example what's his top I did
for us was it uses sis dark V and it
would take any arguments that we passed
through via the shell so again we're
communicating from the shell to our
Python script and in that Python script
were able to grab what the shell said
now what we're showing is basically that
we communicate from the script to the
shell and grab what the shell said but
we can tie those two things together so
instead what we could do is we could go
Python so we open up Python and now
we're in this directory right so we're
actually in the sister actory running a
Python shell right now and so what we
can do now is say something like this so
import sub process and then we could say
output actually let's just run the
command so we could go sub process call
and then we can call Python um what
would we call it sis yeah it's just
tucked up high and then check this out
and then we run this and show it's true
again
Oh oops uh so anyway check this out
shouldn't have those little spaces there
but that's okay what we can do instead
oh this will gate this would be
interesting let's see if I can get away
with this so if you remember we had to
encase all that in the quotes let's see
if we can do this check this out
oh good oh man now I'm angry so it's
it's acting like these are all their own
you know every space is the every space
is a different argument
normally trying to figure out how to do
that I mean you could do like an under
under case or underlined you know or
whatever underscore that's the word man
call Python I'm not really sure how to
tie this together someone who does how
to tie those together so I can like a
tight string together does that worked
before I believe to use I can't remember
I think it was double quotes before
though so we didn't Kate let's try
encase this in single quotes I'm gonna
use double quotes here if that doesn't
work
sorry for wasting your time Python
yeah success doesn't feel good anyway so
so here we can see that we're actually
in a Python script communicating to the
shell running something from the shell
passing an argument through this shell
back to a script so we're communicating
from script to script basically doing
this now there's a lot of other ways
that we can do this so I looked by a
naval base and sometimes they fly
fighter jets over not sure if y'all
could hear that probably not but I can
hear that they make my dog really mad
anyway so here's an example of us
passing Python sistah and then obviously
we could do a subprocess
dot check underscore output and then we
could do the same thing again so pythons
just up I whoa picture neo when you say
that and then show equals true taro and
things aren't colored for you there we
go
okay so we've checked the output so we
could store this right to output
obviously we're starting with you know
thusly byte code stuff and the aren't
and I think the artist for return and
then obviously newline anyway um so
that's how we could store the values
back so we can communicate by between
scripts now obviously we can just import
scripts this way but here's a way where
we can actually communicate to them from
again two different programming
languages very simply just by passing
arguments in and out of your command
prompt so anyway enough on that just
showing you guys I mean there's just
really endless things it's kind of like
when I show you the URL Lib tutorial
it's pretty basic stuff but when you
combine all the things that you can do
with the internet it suddenly becomes
amazing
same thing here if if you're able to
access the shell you can run any shell
command I mean you could run anything so
here we could go like this we could say
sub process call and then we can
actually call
see sudo apt-get install Python Tweety
okay so we've actually install modules
even this way oops sudo apt-get install
positive no such policy oh ok so what we
do she'll eat it's true ok so here from
a Python script we're you know
installing packages all of this we were
able to get away with running sudo and
all fats so anyway I think we'll cut it
off here but just showing you guys I
mean this is there's so many things that
you can do with this ability to
communicate back and forth so anyway
I'll leave that all those possibilities
up to you if you guys have any questions
or comments on this video feel free to
share them below I know some people are
going to ask about pipes I'm going to
cover pipes in her own tutorial video
entirely so eventually we'll get to that
not really sure what I'm going to cover
that but anyway if you have any question
comments on this video please feel free
to leave them below as always thanks for
watching thanks for all the support and
subscriptions and it's the next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
