final part of our directional movement
system tutorial video in this video we
are going to you know get our true
answer to whether or not we did this
right ruminant truth coming right up so
I'm going as so most of you guys did
indeed follow up from the last video I
don't know how you'd be doing any of
this if you hadn't but just in case I
guess you could just get the script here
starting point out PI it's the empty
code paste that into here and between
these lines is where we add all of our
new code so now we come to what we have
just built up which is here and let me
see here so let me fit this one to
screen where I just paste it all this
stuff in and this is the code that we
just built so in theory all we really
need to do is we already have
exponential moving average defined so
I'm just going to delete that from here
you might want to keep it on hand if you
want to save each individual script is
what you can't eventually start to do is
when I'm done with all of this I'll
probably add them onto my charting
application and allow users to choose
like the indicators that they want so
eventually I mean you want to have all
this stuff on hand you could leave it in
this file and then you could just import
every single file and do that but again
you would already have exponential
moving average to find so there wouldn't
really be a need for this or for that
rather but anyways us we want everything
here we already get the stock data so we
don't need to copy and paste that but we
do need TR literally all the way down to
where we print out a DX and we actually
even have to call a DX but we'll get
there so copy all that and we'll have to
align it keep that in mind paste it all
and we can see it really it looks like
we need to at least get a couple tabs
over let's see how how we keep scrolling
here we go okay so really we have to do
one two tabs to be all set looks like so
how a DX don't forget we have
to actually call ADX and you'll have to
call it in the same alignment as like
right here right so come down
delete call a DX to make sure it runs
now we actually want to go ahead and
plot this stuff up a good thing to do
that I thought about I should have done
in the last few videos is at least for
me whenever I chart stuff in Python if I
start charting and then hit an error my
computer gets very angry with me and
throws nasty little errors so instead
I'll just in case everything and a try
and accept loop that way if we do have
an exception it'll still chart it in
Python in my computer won't get angry at
me so I'm just gonna do this but within
this try all we really need to do at
least at this time we have to we're
plotting three different lines right so
we knew a suit plot and then what do we
want to plot well let's actually let's
see hold on let me think for a second so
with in action what we can do is let's
take this and put this with in the there
so this is within the ADX function so we
try we hit 80 x here okay we printed out
80 x and now let's go ahead and we're
gonna say the plot date equals date 1 :
and then I think we're ready at this
point so now plot and we're going to
plot date and again so all of the data
lines up we'll do minus SP : then we
also want to plot ATX minus SP : finally
we're going to plot that line a lot of
times you'll see it black if the
background of the chart is white in our
case the background of our chart is it's
not black I don't think it's a very dark
color though it's a dark blue I want to
say so we'll apply it the ADX line is a
w-4 white then a X 2 dot poll I and
again we want to do
this plot date and again we want to do -
SP : but this line is going to be the
positive di line but again this is going
to be - SP : and since it's the positive
di line we're gonna make this line G for
green finally exude up a lot you want to
do plot they - SP : negative to the I -
SP :
finally this one is going to be red
that'll be pretty true on every chart
for the most part most people plot that
this line is green this line is red now
let's just add the label plot y label 80
X 14 color equals W so again like later
on you could have this all and its own
little function or its own little script
import that script and then you could
really just have these things as either
top indicators or bottom indicators or
like on chart indicators right so some
of the things like Bollinger Bands or
whatever you have those like on the
chart and then so like this would be a
bottom indicator for example a zero
which was where RSI is will be top
indicator and so on but anyway more on
that later I'll probably cover the
tutorial of doing all that when we're
all done here and have like just this
massive amount of indicators that we can
choose from save it
let's go ahead and run it see if we got
any errors will do do ebay again that
was a decent one I think looks good to
me we did print out everything a little
silence those pronounced but the chart
itself looks good let's fit it to screen
here so anyway yeah looks good I think
eBay is one of the ones I didn't show
you guys so so everything looks good
actually we've been getting pretty lucky
with very few typos and bugs and not and
my scripts so we're definitely due for
some massive
anyway so that concludes this video with
ad directional movement system if
everything covered so far I kind of like
this one the best
not sure I'd actually trade on it or
anything but as far as you know all of
these indication indicators go this
one's probably the closest to being a
legitimate usable indicator in my
opinion anyway so that's going to
include this ATX tutorial miniseries and
I suppose within the math and indicators
large series hope you guys enjoyed as
always thanks for watching thanks for
the support of the subscriptions and
until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
