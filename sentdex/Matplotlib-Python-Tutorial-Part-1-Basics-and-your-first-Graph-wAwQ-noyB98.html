first tutorial in the Matt plop Lib
tutorial series
today I'm going to show you guys just
the most basic of just getting some
plots and graphing it if you were like
me originally all I wanted to do and it
was just I have some some stuff I just
want to plot it on my computer I I
didn't really care about anything too
fancy I just wanted to plot some plots
and if you're like me you're going to do
that and then later on you're going to
long to make stuff colorful and have
some dynamic stuff to it maybe even get
live updates you know so the graph
itself refreshes automatically you don't
have to close and reopen and reload so
anyway what I'm going to do is just
start from the very very basics and move
along right away what you're going to
want to do is you'll have to import the
matplotlib right now all we're doing is
using a PI plot and we want to import
that as PLT you don't have to do this
you can import it as whatever you want
it X X Y if you wanted but generally if
you look anywhere for documents or
examples this is how people are going to
denote matplotlib and the other thing I
suggest you get I'm not going to show
you guys at the moment but numpy you
also import numpy as in key however
again we're not really going to be using
that in this tutorial so i'm going to
comment it out so and how do you get
Matt plot live if you don't have it well
this was probably one of the easiest
imports to get you just go to matplotlib
Bourg let me get back to the home for
you and then you click on downloads and
then you come down here to whatever
version you have if you listen to me and
one of my others or listen to just about
anybody else you probably have Python
2.7 and I personally have 132 you might
have AMD 64 you'll have to figure that
out on your own or you could even have
one of these you could also download the
tarball
but if you easiest thing is just to use
the exe it works well although I will
admit I just mentioned that if you do
have the problem like if it says you
don't have Python installed the way
around that again used to go into system
control panel you want to edit your
environmental variables so you go to
control panel sorry system advanced
settings or something like that
environment variables and then you need
to add the Python directory to your path
just how I think it's a semicolon then
in that directory
so anyways back to this so we've
imported matplotlib pipe pipe lot as PLT
so all you have to do it's very very
simple all you have to do is you want to
call the matplotlib pipeline with this
then you want to tell it we want to plot
and so we're going to plot our x will be
1 2 3 &amp;amp; 4 and then we'll plot wise the
corresponding y 479 and you always
always always have to have an equal
number of variables on either side I
mean it sounds a common sense but later
on it can be kind of hard like if you're
matching up to X's and because like
later on usually what ends up happening
is you have some sort of process that
identifies X so later on you'd have a
variable just called X and you'll have X
here and you'll have Y here and that and
though these will correspond to maybe a
huge list or a huge array and sometimes
the arrays don't match up in length and
so that'll be a problem later on they
will certainly run into it at least once
and that would be a problem and then so
once you've told it to plug that hole
the other thing in this block show and
then you run this and you'll get this
pop up here and here we go we've got all
four plots here this is the first second
third and fourth now you can do all
kinds of fun fancy stuff with matplotlib
once you have more and more data you you
can use some of this stuff but this is
the zoom function you just click on it
you'll see this little arrow and then
you can
zoom into plots now we don't like a
seven-run I have too many but you still
can
if you accidentally like you got here
where you want to be in the nearly up
shoot I just miss clicked or whatever
you can use the back function if you
miss click to the back function like
shoot you could go back forward again
it's kind of like a browser and then if
you just happen to get so lost near so
gosh now I got to reload it no you don't
you can just hit home and it takes you
back to the original image then you can
also use this and it's kind of like a
click and drag you know you can move
this around up and down all that but
again and again you know if you do that
you're like ah shoot I want that you can
do that
and finally this little button here
motion to finally we still have to save
but the save is pretty pretty simple you
just save the picture you can save it as
anything you want you just type in it's
called a tag image file format but you
can also just take a screenshot using
the print screen I've never really used
this but I think you can save like
dynamics of the picture or of the graph
if you wanted to oh this okay this is
the only useful part of this to me it
brings up this window he oh shoot I'm
back okay I hate windows shake uh I
don't know anybody else who has Windows
7 but uh this'll like shake option like
I'll show you shake a window and
everything goes away when I first got
this I didn't know that you could
reshape it again everything would come
back and I'd have like maybe like 30
windows up and I'm like oh my gosh like
go open them and stuff and then one of
my buddies that actually has a Mac told
me to just shake it again and I was just
thoroughly embarrassed anyway um okay so
what this does is you can kind of
reshape this stuff so this is the left
and it is usually corresponding to these
the actual chart itself soon as you can
see there's the chart then you've got
like this like background space and then
you've actually got the frame or the
window right around here and so you can
say like okay left here I want this to
be like that and then from the bottom
you can do this kind of stuff and
yeah I mean the point
not sure what w-space is I can't
remember what this is I think it has
something to do with if there's multiple
like if there's another chart here I
want to say it's the space between two
charts because sometimes like if you
have too many charts the numbers can
overlap each other and you still will
override it by squishing it like this
but if you have a lot of different
charts that's what that each space and W
space is and actually I can probably
bring up one of my charts and show you
an example one moment okay now bear in
mind these charts are well first of all
you'll notice are color coded and stuff
and these are also live updating charts
I believe it's on like a 15 or 30 second
timer so don't pay any attention to that
if they start changing color on us but I
just want to show you the head space and
I like whit space room I'm not quite
positive with the stand for but I like
to think of them as head space and I
don't know wide space so as you can see
since like this chart is actually made
for like a full screen monitor so
normally not overlapping but now they
are and so what you can do is change
this like well of course not I'm not
being able to edit this stuff why won't
you let me edit you
okay here we go so you can say okay I
don't want any and so now they're
allowed to just overlap each other you
can do the same thing with this and now
they're allowed to just overlap each
other so if you're running out of space
or whatnot but generally you want to be
able to read your charts so you want to
make it maybe bigger so we can really
space them out anyway so really the
purpose for headspace and white space
with space or whatever if you know what
this fit what the letters actually stand
for I just think if this is up and down
side to side but this will be used for
for later is you can actually cut hard
code this stuff right in so like on that
chart I have there it's actually hard
coded in but again no matter how hard
you code it if you squish the window up
enough it'll still disobey but what you
can do is just code it in so what you
can do is use this window and kind of
mess with these parameters to you see
something you kind of like and take
these numbers and you import that into
your script so those are the basics to
putting up a chart now the next thing um
that you absolutely must have on every
chart if you've been grade school or
anything and you should know and taking
a math class that every graph has to
have what a title
no matter what otherwise the teacher you
took off a bunch of points from you and
so we'll just say I'm at five and then
what else did you have to do you had to
label your x and y axes pretty simple X
label and we'll call this plot X now you
have to do your Y level
that fly why now save it and run it and
as you can see we have Matt plot example
title why label X label later on you do
all kinds of stuff with this you can
affect the size the way angles
um you can affect the way the numbers
angle like if you have dates down here a
lot of times the dates will run over
each other so you can get them to be
kind of crooked in sideways ish and so
they fit we can change the color of
lawns you do all kinds of stuff so I'm
going to show you guys a few other
things on some later tutorials although
coloring is definitely not gonna be the
next one I don't think the next most
useful thing is not hard-coding your
your dataxe right now we're doing this
and so most people are going to either
have a notepad file or a next self file
which really they're interchangeable you
could call an excel a notepad or save a
notepad as an excel as long as it's
comma separated it doesn't really matter
so I'll show you guys how to load that
stuff in and continue plotting in the
next tutorial
