Python 3 tutorial in the last tutorial
we're talking about strings in the print
function and in this tutorial we're
going to be talking about is just basic
mathematics within Python so with that
I'll just show you guys you've got
obviously your typical operators you've
got the plus sign minus sign you got
multiplication and you have division so
with that I'm just going to comment this
out for now I guess I never really
mentioned commenting out either so now
would be a good time to just mention if
you use the pound sign that results in a
single line comment and so basically all
the comments is is just something that
doesn't it's not really
when python goes over it it recognize it
as a comment and it doesn't do anything
with it so you can say print hi right
and if we run this it prints hi it
doesn't do anything here and so by that
same token if you did like print hi you
would think it you know maybe to print
twice but no it just prints that single
hi so that's a single line comment
there's also multiple line comments so
the way to do that is with three single
quotes here you can also do with double
quotes and then you can put whatever you
want within here and that's a multiple
line comments so if you just you're
long-winded and all your discussions
like me then you use a lot of these
anyway so that's just comments since I
used it here so anyways now back to
mathematics so the operations that you
can do obviously the first one we see is
addition so we could do 1 plus 3 you
don't actually have to print anything so
when you actually call 1 plus 3 or at
least in the old one used it would
return it but let's do it here I guess
let's see if it'll good so it's
returning it here but for whatever
reason it won't return it huh that's
interesting I guess we'll print it out
then no I'm not quite sure why I won't I
guess we could do it in here anyways so
we'll just do it live in here normally
you know you want it just randomly put a
1 plus 3 like that's not doing anything
anyways you would assign it to a
variable or whatever
but anyways you can do mathematics here
so one plus three for you can also do a
3-1 you can do multiplication so 4 times
4 you can also do division and division
is something special within Python 3.3
or actually 3 anything 3 and above
because into 7 if you did 5 divided by 2
or I guess if you defined about the two
you'd probably get one and if you did 5
divided by like four you get zero I
think because I wanted to work in whole
numbers only but with a 3 and above
I knew it works the way you would expect
it to work and it you do indeed get to
52.5 and if you do well if I that works
too I suppose
and you can get like a float out of it
and all that so that's that obviously in
Python 2 you would have to either call
one of these a float to get that or you
could you know from future import
division which future is Python 3 but
anyways so that's that you've got
division a couple other things that you
can do really only really one more thing
I'd like to show you is 4 x 4 now what
that's going to multiply multiplied with
that's going to do is actually do 4 to
the school to the I can't think right
now it's getting it it's the act they
like makes it an exponent right so
you've got 4 to the power of that's what
I was looking for 4 to the power of 4
and then when you do that you get 256 so
that's that um there are a couple other
things that you can do that I'll show
you guys later on like a like we did um
or we will do is like a counter so you
could do like 4 plus equals 1 that's
actually not even let us do it here so
anyway I guess you'll see that later so
now uh that's pretty much all I want to
cover with the math wonder 4 plus equals
1 works into 7 didn't notice that this
is kind of it acts differently because
it does act differently because there
are actually different types of data as
you type it in here and maybe that's why
it's doing this but
anyway I thought I would be able to get
away with that but no so anyways uh
that's going to include just the basic
mathematics within Python tutorial we
never actually ended up using this
that's okay
so if you guys have any questions feel
free to post them below otherwise stay
