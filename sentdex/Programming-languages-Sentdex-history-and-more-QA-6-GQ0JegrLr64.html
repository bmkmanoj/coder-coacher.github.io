another Q&amp;amp;A and this Q day I'm going to
be answering some quick questions and
then getting into a couple more
questions on roaring languages
specifically so first of all how old am
i people have been asking this lot I'm
26 soon to be 27 but currently 26 tabs
or spaces definitely tabs which equal
four spaces I'll accept an editor that
just converts tabs of spaces but I just
want to hit one button two spaces is
unacceptable and obviously like six or
eight spaces per tab is also
unacceptable work-life balance with my
wife my wife is in medical school so
that should answer your question we both
pretty much work a time we have usually
dinner together every night on the
weekends usually we spend like Saturday
or eight or Sunday together otherwise
like during the week we're pretty much
both working all day should grown-ups
play video games I don't really see why
not
I don't consider myself a grown-up and I
play video games so I guess that's why I
do think that you know that you can play
it too much snow different than really
watching television or doing anything
else if you're spending like more than
like three or four hours a day on
average playing video games you probably
are playing too much but whatever do you
attend PyCon I'll be attending PyCon in
2017 will be my first PyCon I've wanted
to attend in the past just couldn't
afford the plane ticket hotel and ticket
cost food all that kind of stuff but I
will be there in 2017 I'll be there from
the 18th to the 22nd so if you're going
to be there for those days let me know
especially as we get closer to the event
maybe we can meet up
what does semtex mean syntax is the
meshing of sentiment and index so syntax
as for the channel name and kind of
getting into the next question maybe but
as for the channel name basically the
channel the purpose of this channel was
actually really to market said Dexcom
not really so much to do Python
tutorials so then we get to the next
question where did the inspiration for
Centex come from so I'm assuming that's
$0.04 XCOM like the website but it might
even be the channel but for the website
really just being bored in college so
being bored in college I try to figure
out something to do
my time I found out that you could trade
stocks like on your phone which was a
relatively new thing at the time that
was pretty novel so I would really like
sitting class and just kind of like big
news for stocks and stuff like that and
every now and then change the position
or buy some stock sell some stock
whatever and I started to think like
well what if you just like automated
this because basically what I was doing
was I was reading news and kind of
evaluating the news in terms of
basically what was the overall opinion
the sentiment the feeling for this
company and kind of adding that up and
accruing that over time what was the
change there and making moves based on
that so then I thought well we could
probably automate such a thing and
that's where Centex was born and why I
learned a program Python if you meant
syntax the channel as I just said a
minute ago really syntax the channel I
didn't really mean to make this a Python
programming channel it was really just
like I did like a few kind of tutorial
and informational kind of videos on what
sentiment analysis was and people
clearly really liked the tutorials and
so I just kind of kept doing tutorials
because people liked him I didn't think
they were that great but and they
weren't but even if you do you put out
like kind of horribly produced videos
some people still benefit from that and
it was actually a lot of people at least
to me at the time and so I thought that
was kind of cool so I just kind of kept
doing that there was never really a time
I sat down and was like man I really
want to make a Python programming
YouTube channel like that never happened
really the channel kind of came to me if
I was going to put it some way now let's
talk about I got this question which
kind of asks and kind of brings us to a
lot of questions butts from curious guy
why would you like to learn C++
why not Java as you know Java is the
most used language oh so C++ really I
like the idea of C++ so I can more
easily
I just want to learn C++ I think C++ is
like if you know Python already and you
want to eke out like the last little bit
of performance maybe from Python C++
would be the next step so
so that's really all there is to it with
C++ also for some reason I just don't
like Java I don't know I just had a
really bad I guess first experience with
Java I'm sure if I went back now that I
know like programming paradigms
maybe Java wouldn't be so like
gross-looking to me but I just the
whenever I was trying to figure out
which programming language to start with
I tried Java and I was like this is
disgusting so no offense to anybody
programs Java there's plenty of people
out there that can certainly out program
me in Java it's just I did not like Java
anyway yeah so C++ just seems like a
really a good next step after Python it
just it just seems to make sense to me
also I mean there's also kind of like a
another like layer in this question that
is like basically why would you why not
Java because Java is the most most used
language right um I don't personally
base my my any really choice on what the
most used thing is I always want to go
out and try it for myself and go with
whatever I personally like best now
maybe it's the case with Java that most
people actually really like Java best
and I'm just not one of those people but
I wouldn't go for Java just because
that's what everyone else is doing
doesn't really make any sense also in
terms of like um I see a lot of like
Java might be the most used language but
I also see this phrase in terms like
Java is the language that has the most
programming jobs so the argument being
like you should learn Java because it
has the most jobs but that's not first
of all that that's ignoring supply and
demand it's just basically demand or I
guess you could say supply of jobs but
really when people say like it's the
most jobs
that's like saying like there's the most
demand for Java but if there's a huge
supply also of Java programmers that
doesn't mean you're going to get a job
but also you're really more likely to
get a job if you're a good programmer in
whatever language it is that you choose
to learn I mean I'm sure there's some
languages where that's not necessarily
the case like if you're I don't know a
Pascal programmer you probably need to
learn something else but if you're
Python C++ even I guess Ruby in the one
instance that you can use Ruby that kind
of stuff here like a current used
programming language your
going to be fine that also brings me to
another question that someone asked I
wasn't even going to include it but it
just made me think about it was someone
asked about Julia in being like the new
and better Python the thing with
programming languages really and in my
time sound like I'm about to contradict
myself but the thing with programming
languages that makes them good or bad is
like the community behind the
programming language but by community i
don't mean the size of the community
necessarily i mean size can help but I
don't mean the size right it's how you
use it so so like the Python like a
great example is comparing Python
to Ruby both of them are high level
object-oriented languages simple syntax
really easy languages to get used to and
used and fun to develop in but with Ruby
you make websites that's it now people
could come and make libraries for Ruby
to do a bunch of other things it's just
they don't because they already exist in
Python you would use Python for those
things right and so python is great
because python has a great community so
the question like with julia is whether
or not julia is going to have such a
great community that's like the Python
community is that's what makes Python
great right Python there's a lot of
things we could improve about Python but
it's the community behind Python that
stops just some other random language
like Julia let's say from easily being
able to come in and just take over
another great examples like javascript
javascript is really not the best
language for the task but it's the
community that powers JavaScript and
JavaScript especially even lately is
only on the rise it's only getting
bigger more powerful more awesome and
that has everything to do with the
community and really very little to do
with the language so yeah you can keep
copying kind of this high level fun
syntax language stuff and try to become
the next big thing but that's really not
what it takes it you need the the
awesome communities that really truly
power these programming languages so
that's going to bring me to the end of
this QA if you have questions comments
which I rub you the wrong way with
something I said feel free to leave it
below if you've got future questions
that you want me to answer feel free to
leave those below as well otherwise I
will see you in another tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
