another Python 3 basics tutorial video
in this video we're going to talking
about a multi-line print so multi-line
print is kind of like a multi-line
comment only you're going to actually
print it out to console in multiple
lines so whenever I started programming
there really it took me a long time to
figure this one out I had no idea that
you could do a multi-line print and so
sometimes you want to make you know kind
of cute gooeys and just cute text-based
ASCII gooeys and I would literally code
those gooeys by lines so I would do
print and then the most single line and
print the next line print the next line
and then I found out you don't have to
do that no one ever told me this I was
actually looking at someone's code and I
noticed that they were doing it and I
was like oh my gosh you can had no idea
you could do this so anyway I'm just
going to show you guys real quick
multi-line print so to do a multi-line
print you just do print and then one two
three just like a multi-line comment you
can see it even kind of wants to comment
it out one two three and as long as it's
within a print statement it's going to
print it and so kind of an easy way to
work around this is to do something like
this and then put your print in between
the this area here that way because
usually if you're doing a multi-line
print because you've made some sort of
design or something so to do it nicely
all we do it this way
so make your space here and we'll just
say like you know so this is a simple
multi-line print
pretty cool huh
or a
if it honey I crack myself up I know you
guys are just loving it anyway so this
is a simple multi-line print obviously
since we had these extra spaces here
that's why it did that we could take
them away like that and get less of that
now um so the next thing I want to show
you guys is like you can do you know
stuff like this um
we'll make a box that copy this paste it
and oops this box needs to be a little
taller guys do you like this oh my
goodness I think I'm broken today
everybody haven't had much sleep oh my
gosh okay
hey making a box this is a lot of effort
for making a simple box okay and then
we'll just say a box alright it's not
centered oh my goodness alright
that's not centered either anyway run it
and then we printed out our box you guys
get the point so again sometimes you
want to do like kind of like gooeys like
this you want to make some boxes and
organize some data yourself that's how
you can do it with multi line print so
anyways if you guys have any questions
or comments pretty simple things so I'm
not sure anybody's gonna have a question
about this but if you do leave them in
the section below as always thanks for
watching thanks for all the support
