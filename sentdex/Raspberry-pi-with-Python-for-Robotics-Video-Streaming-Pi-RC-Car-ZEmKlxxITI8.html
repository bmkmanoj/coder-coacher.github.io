to another Python Raspberry Pi robotics
tutorial video in this video I'm just
going to show you guys where I am with
my RC car now as you can see we've got
what looks to be a video feed and it
sure is a video feed I added the
Raspberry Pi camera module to my car and
I have that streaming the data to my PC
now the only problem is buffering there
is a bit of a lag to get back to the PC
anything between like one in three
seconds about and this is just due to
probably a lot of things the most
important thing is just the fact that
we're working with a Raspberry Pi we're
also working with that little cheap
edimax Wi-Fi so we're probably paying a
little bit of a tax just sending the
data back even though we are in network
and the other thing is well the main I
think the main reason though is just the
fact that it's a Raspberry Pi okay so
but the Raspberry Pi we've got the
camera module in there we've also got a
distant sensor in there and we've got
all the GPIO pins that are doing things
as well so there's a lot of things that
are going on that is plugged in at the
moment and so I think that just gives us
a bit of a lag the other thing that I've
noticed is once we start adding like
right now the video feeds okay we're not
noticing anything too major yet but when
we start adding and working with this
script I'll run our autonomous script
here I think you'll notice that the
camera might even go out we might
actually draw power so anyway let's go
ahead and see because our power supply
is actually a thousand milliamps so I
mean there's no problem with the power
supply as far as like rating is
concerned but anyways let's go ahead and
change the rectory into robotics and the
file that we want to run is robot
six-step ah just to see so we'll do sudo
python robot 6 dot pi and we'll let this
run I believe it starts immediately so
you can even see that it has quite a
delay I think it's actually running too
even too fast for this script actually I
just put new batteries in and it appears
that it goes a lot faster than it did
before with batteries I hear banging
around in the kitchen we were definitely
hitting things
I'll show you guys where I put the
camera it's actually in a pretty safe
spot but the distance sensor is not and
I wonder if it's hitting this in sensor
but I think the first thing that we'd
want to do is oh oh it's gonna make a
run for apparently I don't know man
these new batteries are powerful I've
never seen this thing be so uh so strong
normally doesn't run very well and she's
a stop right hip Stasi I forgot long we
made the script but very maybe it's done
I don't know there it finally ended oh
man
so anyway yeah there's a little bit of a
delay there now oh one thing we probably
ought to do sudo Nana um robot sixth up
high because that was getting way too
close and I think like I said just put
brand new batteries in so I have never
even seen pivot that well normally when
we run the pivot commands it very slowly
pivots because it's underpowered
that was some serious pivoting I am
interested to see it in person actually
so here we go it looks like we might
actually drop our camera pretty pretty
soon once it starts doing that like gray
screen anyway I want to get to our
distance here I forget where where we
give ya if current distance is less than
20 then we want to run Reverse but I
thought we have a longer that's all
commented out so I think what we're
running is actually autonomy and then we
run the check front command so the check
front functions let me find check front
and I think this is check front right
okay so instead of 15 we really need to
make a single variable so we're not
hard-coding all this if this is greater
than we're gonna do I guess we'll do 25
just so it actually does something
twenty-five twenty-five five all right
hopefully we won't hear so many crashes
I heard it quite a few bumps in the
kitchen there and actually I probably
should check the distance sensor make
sure that it's pointing so this is the
sensor sits above so if it hits
something the distance sensor would
point up so let me go make sure that's
okay oh okay so it was actually aiming
down a little bit but probably not
enough to influence anything major but
definitely something that happened so
now it's definitely hitting on the back
end it looks like possibly hit on the
front end there but we're definitely
hitting on the back it reverses to the
back really quickly might make a run for
them from the kitchen here in a minute
it's fighting the oven at the moment
okay so anyway as this is running she
want to explain some of the things that
I did with the kit that I got from st.
smart the camera module actually fits
inside the front like there's that front
piece and it's got a circle I'm not
really sure what the whole cutout circle
was originally intended for but it
actually fits the Raspberry Pi camera
module perfectly and so you can fit that
the camera module in there and then the
lens just barely pokes through now
there's no good way to mount the camera
module there so I just use electrical
tape and just literally taped it there
but as far as the lens hole is concerned
that was perfect so again I'm not really
sure what it was intended for but it
worked out really well so I'll show you
guys at the end of that after this is
done with its run hearing a lot less
crashes we do definitely want to put a
rear distance sensor in this but
otherwise this is doing pretty good I
hear it hitting on the back but it
doesn't appear to be hitting on the
front you can even see the camera cuts
out a second whenever it hits in the
back but anyway not too bad so let me go
grab it and I will show you guys what
we've
going on at the moment okay so this is
what we have now so this is our power
supply this is the distance sensor so
obviously this is a little a weak point
for this car also we have all these
cables out here nice this stuff
everything pretty much in there but
maybe we'll get to that eventually
but then the camera module I'm not sure
how well you can see but it's actually
this poking through right there so the
lens is able to stick there and you can
see the LED part of the camera on anyway
so it's actually doing pretty well in
there I think it would be pretty hard to
get it especially because the wheels act
like a bumper but I'm thinking of adding
like two little rubber pieces on the
front there just to make sure that it
doesn't get absolutely destroyed at some
point by hitting like a corner or
something like that I could foresee it
getting hit pretty good so anyway that's
what um we have at the moment for a car
I'm not really sure what else to do with
it besides put on a distance sensor for
the rear and so maybe I'll do that and
then show you guys the results of that
but that's about it so anyways if you
guys have any questions or comments feel
free to leave those below as always
