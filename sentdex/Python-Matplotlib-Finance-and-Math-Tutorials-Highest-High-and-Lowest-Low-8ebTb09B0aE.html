their Python Finance and mathematics
video in this video we're gonna be
talking about both highest high and
lowest low so some people like to apply
either just the highest higher just the
lowest low and or you might see some
people that apply them together so what
we're gonna do in this video is cover
highest high lowest low we are gonna
plot them together but of course you can
use your own discretion and choose not
to plot them together so what I've done
now hopefully it's gonna help us out is
we can go to that the page the link is
in the description and now I've got the
starting code for the calculation videos
if you click on that that'll take you to
this page and it has that starting code
now so you don't feel like keep retyping
that over and over unless i'm sure some
of you guys saved it but this will help
some of you guys are just joining us out
so now the next thing that we want to do
is define oh and also make sure you have
sample data dot txt I suppose I left
that out that's also in that link in the
description here just click on sample
data it takes you here and then save
that at least here we're asking you to
save it as single day to dot txt so
let's get to the actual function itself
so we're gonna do define H H low low for
highest high and lowest low to do this
we need the date the closing price and
the time frame we want to consider now
let me just do this some people like to
do with the high prices so and then the
low like the highest high of the high
prices and then the lowest low of the
low prices but most of the time you're
actually going to consider just the
closing price of that ball each bar of
data so not always is you know like at
least throughout this series we've done
open high low close and it's been for
like a day right a whole day and but
generally if you've got like one minute
tick data let's say our tick data one
minute you know open high low close data
you've got still the open high low close
there so it just doesn't really matter
like it's just mostly depending on that
bar and we just so happen to be using
one day long bars anyway so this
function is going to return an HH for
highest high and LL for a lowest low
now X is going to equal time France
that's where we're going to start while
X is less than the length of whatever DB
what are we gonna do we're gonna say the
consideration High's is equal to see X
minus TF : X and then Collin slow equals
C X minus TF come on X to the X next
we're gonna say high is high equals the
max of consider eyes a lowest low equals
the men of Consular next we're gonna say
HH dot append highest high then ll dot
and the low is low more space here pause
or meet my speakers now X plus equals 1
and then finally we're gonna have this
return d4 date h/h for the high high and
ll for Lois low finally it's gonna do
HH ll date close P and we use a 5 time
frame now the next thing we want to do
is actually chart this so if you notice
I skipped usually we do like an
introductory video or explain the thing
then we do it I think highest high and
lowest low is fairly self-explanatory
and simple enough to where I'm actually
going to content it all under the same
same tutorial video as long as I can
think of what I want to say and actually
we didn't have to really do this but we
can't run it and we can just you know
kind of print out so we could just say X
Y Z equals that and then we can print Y
print Z and that'll be like our actual
output here we do ok we type out a pen
there try it one more time ok so now we
got it printing out stuff that's what we
want right we want 57 ish because we're
talking about Starbucks here so now that
we've done that now that
thing we want to do is actually chart
this up so let me go back over to where
we were and here's this page with sample
code with the empty slot if you don't
already have it click on that and then
copy and paste that sample code into an
empty Python scripts let me do that let
move this thing out of the way bring
this over paste that code in here and if
you scroll up just a little bit there's
the spot for indicator so what I'm going
to go ahead and do is copy and paste
basically everything up to the
definition of that function and then
come over here oops that's the wrong
thing come over here and paste into
there and then we'll do two tabs over
and now I'm actually gonna rename this
stuff but first let me fit this to my
screen and now we're gonna rename these
I'm gonna leave that variable well we
better not I'm gonna say h h l LX HH y
ll y equals that then we're just gonna
plot these up and we're just a 2 dot fly
HH l HH l LX HH y and we're gonna make
this line green since it's the highs x 2
dot fly HH l LX h h or no ll y plot it
as a red line next we're going to do the
minus SP : if you want to know why we're
doing that
check out the charting stocks in python
tutorial series i'm gonna copy this now
paste paste paste and now we're gonna
add our white labels so peel T dot y
label and this will be h HL l5 and we
need to make it white so color equals
white and that should be it so let's go
ahead and save that and on that
hopefully no means your errors asking us
what stock to plot let's split up
Starbucks and okay cool so here's
Starbucks and we can see down here is
our high high low low and let me talk
about a little bit about the high oil
why people actually seem to like that
one actually you know it would be a good
idea we can plot the highest high and
lowest low right on the prices because I
was gonna say generally it smooths out
the line without very much lag but also
it just happens to look like it's
smoother because this is a different
chart right whenever you make a chart
squished like this it just makes it look
less volatile so it's kind of cheating
us a little bit there so what we could
do is well I'll talk about that in a
second anyway so people will use this
one to smooth out a little bit but also
you can kind of gauge it's like a
different way to look at the prices I
suppose so like whenever there's like a
priced movement generally you're gonna
see either the lowest low coming up
right and it's gonna push your highest
high up or if it's falling the highest
high is gonna be falling and the lowest
low will also obviously be pushed down
because of it and so it's just kind of
like a way to smooth the lines without
being like really lagging because it's
actually looking at previous data so a
lot of times it's not gonna lag like a
simple moving average so at well we're
talking about it let's go ahead and I
think I could just change this to one
and that won't be an issue for us let's
go ahead and play it up on eBay again
nope that was Wow it got really angry at
me for why it got so mad for access
because access one is the one
mom maybe it's the while a little bit I
don't know hmm I think I would have
gotten this angry at me oh it's trying
to do something about maybe the date I
can't even like see what line it's even
referencing and this gobbly mess Wow
anyway let's go ahead and just I'm just
gonna copy this function here we'll
replace this as two and two hopefully I
can do this will come up up here the
definition since I'm doing this let me
make my font smaller so I can see what
I'm doing better
slicker here make some space
not sure SP is defined at this point
though so this needs to be DTF let's
make this DTF : so the data matches I
think time frame isn't defined until
later on in the script
well actually you know what I think it's
yeah it's defined already okay let's try
it again hopefully it doesn't just go
crazy on us otherwise ought to figure
out what's going on okay that worked
okay so anyway you drag this over I
guess cuz probably what had happened is
it plotted it and then it formatted the
dates on this axis here and then it and
then when I went to reap lot on there it
was very angry at me because I just like
trying to reformat again so that was the
issue
but anyway it's actually kind of hard to
see this so let me zoom in let's zoom
into it like a volatile spot first so
it's kind it's you know kind of a way to
add bands around your stuff and as you
can see it's somewhat lagging in you
know like the intensity so to speak but
not anywhere near as much as the lagging
of like the simple moving average like a
10 simple moving average because I think
we were using a 5 for this so we could
change this to like a 5 and we could see
what the difference is but anyway so
those are your high high highest high
and lowest low lines pretty basic
indicator I don't really see a huge
value in having these lines maybe I just
don't understand them which is totally
possible but they are somewhat popular
for people to use especially as a form
of band and then they put like a simple
moving average on there and whenever it
kind of acts as a signal line basically
when this simple moving average or
either crosses over or the simple moving
average goes outside of it that's kind
of like an indication of something but
anyway wanted to cover them they're
basic enough to cover and I was able to
jam them all into one video so there you
have it so hopefully you guys enjoyed
hopefully you maybe learn something new
not sure what new thing
you would have learned besides the
indicator but anyway hopefully it was
enjoyable for you guys as always thanks
for watching thanks for all the support
the subscriptions until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
