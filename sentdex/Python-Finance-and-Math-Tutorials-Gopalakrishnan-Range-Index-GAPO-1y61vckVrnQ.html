Python mathematics and Finance
indicators video this video we're gonna
be talking about the Gopalakrishnan
range index otherwise known as gap oh
and that's what I'm gonna call it for
the rest of this video the gap o is
intended to measure the volatility in a
stock and it doesn't incorporate volume
so you can think what you want about
that the only reason I throw that in
there is that sometimes either your
volume information isn't included or you
might not want to use volume or you
might want to maybe add volume to the
equation to make it that much better
but it's kind of neat when you can have
an indicator that mimics volume yet does
not use volume the calculation for the
gap o indicators is basically going to
be the logarithm of the highest high for
whatever time frame you're considering -
the lowest low for whatever time frame
you're considering then you're going to
do that divided by the logarithm of that
time frame so with that let's go ahead
and look at an example of this gap Oh
indicator before we get into actually
programming it so here's our charting
application if you want more about it
check out our Python charting
application tutorial video series so
we're looking at eBay and so here we
have eBay and down here we've got the
gap o 14 for eBay
actually I nevermind thought I'd change
it but no this is indeed the gap o 14 so
here's an example of the gap o here and
as you can see so as you know the
volatility here in theory is going up
you can not only see this in the chart
price but you can see in the volume or
volume a really spikes up there and
price falls
sure enough the gap o is pretty high
again here as it's very volatile falling
it goes up and then as it's rising you
can see the gap o goes up and then where
you've got more of like it controlled
like here's a spike rise and here's a
spike rise both times you see the gap o
spike up then you've got more of a
controlled steady rise without too much
change and it's not so crazy and then
here you you could say that price is
going up down up down up down up down
but for the most part it's
relatively stable and it's a little
up/down a little process and as you can
see here the gap Oh kind of like levels
out so with that let's look at another
gap Oh indicator let's look at something
like Tesla would be a good one where it
like kind of flatlined and then it went
way up and then it's been going way down
yeah it's a pretty good one so here's
Tesla and as you can see I mean it's
relatively stable here and then the
price starts really rising and so the
gap Oh indicator goes way up right and
then it starts really falling and sure
enough the gap so it stays upright
because the idea of the gap oh isn't
really for trend at all it's volatility
and here's a great example of it
matching volume pretty well where you
know trade bond is pretty low it's
stable it's low and stable here and then
it spikes up here with trade volume and
price as a you know gains popularity or
whatever and really the gap Oh indicator
is like pretty much right on par with
the volume here and then as you know the
actual stock starts trending down the
RSI starts trending down but the gap oh
is still there because it's it's
volatility only so it's pretty
interesting indicator actually it's just
another one of those I actually quite
like the indicators that measure
volatility without using volume I think
it's pretty cool obviously it's it's
fairly simple I mean the stock price
itself measures volatility usually
without volume but still I like the
indicators that do it's just kind of
like a neat out of the like out of the
box method for doing it so anyways
that's the gap Oh indicator in the next
video what we're gonna be doing is
actually programming the gap Oh
indicator in Python and then the video
after that we'll plot it up just like
this and this charting application so if
that sounds interesting to you guys stay
tuned the next video as always thanks
