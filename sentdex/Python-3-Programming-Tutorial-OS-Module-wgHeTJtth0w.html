another Python 3 tutorial video in this
video what we're talking about is the
Python standard library so the last
video we're talking about built-in
functions now we're going to be talking
about these modules that come with your
installation of Python first one we're
going to cover is OS and purpose for OS
at least from my uses has always been
just any sort of directory operations so
changing your path as far as you know
where things are at the moment making
directories or folders deleting them
moving them around and so on so let's go
ahead get started with some examples of
our OS function so first we're going to
import OS and then what we can do is we
can figure out first of all where are we
so they say curd er equals OS get CWD
empty parameters and what CWD stands for
is current working directory and we can
go ahead and print cur dur like so save
and run that and we get where we are at
the moment so for me that's see users H
desktop desktop some text lessons Python
3 say Harrison why do you have two
desktops that's funky well I like a nice
clean desktop so I actually on my
desktop I have a folder called
desktop and I just move all my desktop
icons into that yes I know you can hide
icons on your desktop there's a reason
why I don't do that but that's not what
this video is about so anyway moving on
so closing I that so that's our current
current directory now one of the other
things we can do is we can create
directories so we can do OS dot M cater
for make and dirt and we're going to
call this directory neuter neuter and
that's going to go basically right up
here as we make it so let's go ahead and
save and run that real quick hopefully
pop over here fast enough there is our
new directory is it just popped up now
what we can do is you can close out of
this and then come back down here and in
fact let's delete this one so it doesn't
get in our way as we run through this
now we can do is we could let's make
some time operations because otherwise
this whole thing might happen faster
than we see it with our eyeballs so
we're going to import time we're gonna
say time asleep uh two seconds and we're
gonna say Oh s dot rename and here we
can rename the directory and we're gonna
rename new Dirar
and we're gonna call it new dirt too now
oh let's go ahead and run this come over
here there's new dirt and then wait for
it there's new dear - okay so we can
close out of this awesome it's delete
neuter - lets do another time dot sleep
two seconds and this time let's make
some space here this time let us go
ahead and remove the door so OS dot r m4
remove dirt and now we specify the name
that we want to delete neuter - so it's
gone so kiss
save and run it again yep and so there's
new dirt we were named it to neuter -
and then a couple seconds we delete it
gone
okay so that's how we could do some of
the file operations you can also move
directories all kinds of fun stuff one
of the things that we could do is check
this out actually hold on let me do
let's just run this one more time
current working directory Mesa directory
deletes that directory should have OS
actually already imported
help Oh s whoa crazy so if you want to
learn one of the things about OS we can
use what we just learned in the previous
video as you can see there is a lot of
information here um yeah just gobs of
information that you can do and use with
OS so yeah anyway gonna close out so
that's gonna conclude my tutorial on OS
again there's a huge amount of things
that you can do with it West but for the
most part people are using OS just to
make directories remove directories move
directories or delete directories I
guess
was removed directories rename
directories that's the other thing I was
looking for so anyway a quick tutorial
on OS the next tutorial we're going to
cover is for system and system actually
is quite fun you can do some really neat
kind of hacky things with cysts so
that's the next thing we'll be showing
so stay tuned for that if you have any
questions or comments on this video feel
free to leave them below if you have any
requests also feel free to make requests
I'm making the series right now as we as
you listen so if you have a specific
request make it and it will probably
find its way into this series anyway
that's it with this stay tuned to the
next video as always thanks for watching
thanks for all the support subscriptions
and it's a nice time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
