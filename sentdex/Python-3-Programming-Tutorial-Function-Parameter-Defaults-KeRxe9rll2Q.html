another Python 3 basics video in this
video we're going to be covering default
function parameters I'm just going to go
ahead and clear this out so normally we
write a function like so simple and 1
num2 and that's it and then we have the
function to do something for now just
right pass that just gives it something
to do if I don't write anything here and
I define another function it will be mad
it will throw an error it expects an
indent so anyway write something there
but what we can do is something like
this so define simple num 1 and then we
can do what's called a default parameter
num2 and by default we just say dumb 2
equals 5 so what this is going to do
when you do this is it's going to just
by default give them to the very the
value of 5 so if we print number 1 and 2
and then we call simple you actually
don't have to put anything in there we
could say 5 right even though we've got
two parameters here when you have a
default it's automatically filled so you
don't have to specify it so in fact let
me change this since we used five for
number two and we'll run it and sure
enough we get to 5 so that was fine we
didn't throw an error even though we
only had one and that's because this has
some default a default value to it now
why would anybody use a default value so
an example of a time when you might use
default a good thing to think about is
say you you're going to go buy a car and
maybe you care a lot about like what
kind of stereo the car has or whatnot
but you don't really care about the
types of tires that it has you're not
too worried about the suspension and all
that but then some people are worried
about the suspension and don't give
anything about the radio they just want
the stock radio in there and so on so
different people like to do different
forms of customization so an example of
this in programming would be maybe a
program that allows you to create
Windows so basic window and every window
needs a width and a height
but then you have other things that you
might need in your window so what are
some things that you might need in a
window um well you might need font so
you might any font type and we'll do TN
r for Times New Roman as a quick aside
I'm going to have I'm gonna hit enter so
you can what you can do in your
specifying things within parentheses is
the following comma enter and you can
continue specifying things here and this
can just kind of help keep things a
little bit more organized so you don't
run out of space or you don't have like
one really long line okay so some other
properties that we might want with this
window background color by default let's
say that's white scrollbar equals true
and that'll do for now so let's just say
we have three parameters here that can
be added now in this basic window let's
just say we print wit high font BGC and
um we won't print scrollbar anyway and
that's it so if we call a basic window
the only thing that we really have to
specify here that doesn't have a value
of already is width and height so let's
say we want it to be 500 pixels wide 350
top okay so when we go to run this we
get 500 350 TNR w so we print it out
right all of the specifications here so
even though we didn't specify font BGC
scrollbar we were able to modify those
so then what happens if you do want to
modify well generally what you're going
to see is people type out the name but
you could in theory do something like
this and we'll just say a for Arial and
we run it and sure enough that worked
but the reason why people are going to
type it out is because of the following
what if you don't care to change font
but you want to change background color
well if you don't
want to type it out you're going to have
to type in a and then W is obviously
throw in a double at you in here it's
going to say the font type is W and you
don't want W because W is like webdings
and you don't want webdings so obviously
that would cause trouble so what you're
going to see when people have default
parameters is BGC equals and then
whatever they want it to equal
oops we lost our equal save run and now
you'll see that t NR went unaffected but
W is there vgcw let's change it to be
for black run it and you can see it we
changed it so obviously when we have
this view of variables it like it's not
that big of a deal if you had to type
them all out but just imagine with some
things people like to make their modules
really highly customizable so like with
matplotlib you've got all kinds of
things you've got line thickness line
color plot markers you've got now I'm
blanking there's a whole bunch of stuff
though that you can add and with a lot
of modules there's a whole lot of stuff
that they give you that you can
customize but at the same time you're
not forced to customize it if you don't
want to and they give you defaults that
make sense but if you want to change it
you could so anyway that's just the
basics of default parameters and how to
use them and why they're used and all
that so hopefully you can recognize them
and if you want to add them to your own
program now you can so that's it with
this tutorial if you guys have any
questions feel free to leave them below
