carlo and python tutorial video in this
video we're just gonna pick up where we
left off with this day allen bear
strategy but now what we want to do is
we want to use the money carload
simulator to find out at least a couple
variables so in this one we want to do
wager size and wager count
now again wager size is in direct
relationship to your full amount of
funds at least that's my argument so I
don't really see any reason why we would
want to make that as well a variable
because really we're looking for a
percentage size of the total amount so
for now we're just gonna do these two
variables so with that let's go ahead
and get started so what we're gonna do
is we're just gonna have a wild true
loop up here and what I'm gonna go ahead
and do it as well is let's go up here
where all of our constants are let's go
ahead and cut and paste those down here
so I'll just paste it right here I guess
we don't need lower bust and higher
profit so I'm just gonna move that up
here for now we don't really care about
that right now
sample size we want that that's gonna be
a constant starting funds that's also
going to be a constant but as I said
we're gonna want to switch up wager size
and wager count and then as well we want
the return that's gonna be contingent so
we want that to because we're gonna make
a while true loop so I believe all of
the rest of this will be contained in
the wild true so let's let me make that
Wow
true loop so it makes more sense to you
guys and so now we've got this so the
only constants up here are sample size
and starting funds now the next thing
that we want is we're gonna save trying
to think I guess that's really all we
need for now so then we come down here
wager size equals 100 and wager count
equals
a hundred thousand or at least what
we've got here what we might want to do
is switch this up a little bit so for
example we could do wager size of a
hundred instead what we're gonna do is
this so comment both of those out and
instead of wager size is gonna equal
random dot UNIF arm and let's do 1.0 to
a hundred point oh oh
and starting funds instead of a hundred
thousand we're gonna make that ten
thousand that way a hundred is a decent
enough 100 is one percent and I guess we
could actually we could go all the way
up to a thousand
that way we're trading up to ten percent
starting so wager sighs anything from
one two you know from one one thousandth
or actually it's even even smaller hey
you guys get the point it's a wide range
of wager sizes next wager count that's
gonna equal random dot uniform and this
is how many wagers are we willing to
perform let's do 1.0 and again I think
we should allow up to 10,000 wagers
anything between 1 and 10,000 and really
one is a horrible number to start with
let's do 10 and 10,000 so we've got
those down now so that's gonna be our
random two random variables now we've
got return that's always going to be the
case da profits da bus all of that those
stay the same then we've got a while
counter blah blah blah sounds good we
come down here and now what I want to go
ahead and do is we're gonna set I guess
we will use this but not right this
instant but we are gonna make an ROI
variable so let's say ROI equals that
and then we want to have like a line
that we draw so we want to know how
large
of a return-on-investment do we care for
now the next problem that we have is
let's say we have a first of all let's
make this sample smaller so what its
gonna do is for every random variable
it's gonna test the sample so I'm gonna
make this more like 10,000 that other
one was way too big that would take a
year to get anything decent uh where was
I
so down here and so we want to pick a
number now I don't really know if I want
to I hate to hard code this really we
should have you know ROI and then let's
make a total invested that and ROI
should be some form of total invested
right so what I think we'll do let's run
this a couple times to get a some sort
of a number and then we'll make this a
percentage so as long as ROI out of
total invested is greater than X that
way we can change the starting funds and
all of that dynamically and we won't
have to like pick a new number because
obviously if you do more wagers you
really are looking for a strategy that
makes more money and if you're starting
with more money obviously you want to
make more money so we don't want to
hard-code it so with that we should be
able to just run this so let me save
this and run and hopefully we can run
and as it goes through the strategies we
hopefully it's gonna spit out some stuff
so this one lost a lot of money and that
was a pretty big number oh you know what
let me let's break this for now so I can
actually read this print underscores
alright start again so anyway return on
in intra is here we got three hundred
thousand but this one was a huge number
this was 2 million 21 million actually
we lost 21 million on that strategy oh
these guys are getting screwed right now
although these are randoms right we're
just randomly picking numbers just for
the record so we did have a 21 million
that's an 18 million
so so far we're seeing like 20 million
to be I wish I knew maybe I'll go
consult that video and see what the
actual numbers were on the profitable
version of this strategy so this was the
typical Alan bear strategy right here so
total invested was a hundred billion and
we made eight hundred and sixty-five
million so zero point eight six five
percent so that's the number to be zero
point eight six five so let me close out
of this and so what we want to do is
total invested equals this and then what
we want to know is I guess percent ry
and that's gonna equal ROI out of total
invested this in parentheses times 100
point zero zero
now let's add one more print here just
to see if we got this right
percent or a wine and that's gonna equal
percent why save and run it and
hopefully we can see few examples so
percent ROI eight percent is what it's
claiming I can't possibly be correct
eight percent
oh let me pause this and check the maths
on that 8% err here
okay just really wanted to check that
math that is correct so the number to
beat really is 0.8 and this 8
percentages is nice by just keep in mind
that we're only running for 10,000
samples okay so that's very attractive
and we need to print out what the
interesting we should print out the the
wager size and the count as well I would
would like to know what that was print
wager size I guess we'll make this
typical wager size and print wager count
count and run it some more lost money
large wager size their wager count
and I suppose as well what we could do
is we could say ways wager size
percentage maybe well that's running let
me do that too so print wager size
percentage and that would be wager size
out of starting funds and then again
times 100 in case this bring that in
pretty sure you have spaces there I know
we don't want to find out
waitress size percentage okay so now we
got a percentage and we'll use that
later on as well so anyway it's run it
again did anybody make money on this one
I don't see anybody oh we do have a 3%
ROI that's pretty good anyway coming
down here this was a positive wager size
was a 2% wager this was also a positive
waiter size was seven goodness
this was a positive waiter size 0.7 okay
so anyways you guys get the point
now what do we want to do I'll just
leave this running and then we'll look
at it in a second but we do know that we
need to be at least positive 0.86% ROI
right so what we want to do now is come
down here and if percent ROI is greater
than zero point eight six five percent
then show us the money right so we don't
if it's not greater than zero point
eight six five percent ROI we really
don't care Wow look at this one
forty-nine percent ROI wager counts six
six six five thank goodness it wasn't
six six then uh wager size was pretty
big too anyway so we're seeing a bunch
of successful ones and a bunch of
unsuccessful ones you know what else
would be kind of cool I have some ideas
moving forward anyway so what we're
gonna do now is we've got this maybe
we'd want to make this number a little
bit bigger oh it looks like we're still
returning the negatives what would be
interesting is we are eventually gonna
plot this up so I was just gonna plot up
the positives but it probably would be a
good idea to plot up the negatives - so
the positives in green and the negatives
in red and then where there's crossover
that's risk and then whether it's not
crossover that's not ERISA I think
that's what we'll end up doing we're
gonna have a pretty badass looking plot
by the end of this so anyways that's
gonna conclude this tutorial video at
least we're at least right now what
we're doing is we're just returning
successful returns basically so anything
that has a percent ROI on average
greater than zero point eight six five
we return those variables so anyways
that's gonna conclude this video
hopefully you guys enjoyed you've got
any questions or comments feel free to
leave them below as always thank you for
watching thanks for all the support and
subscriptions and until the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
