9th Monte Carlo video so now that we've
got this far we found out that betters
are not necessarily allowed to go under
0 but we're not showing it very well
when they go bust so let's go ahead and
fix that now because it's kind of a big
deal that we kind of want to see that
visually so let's go ahead and fix that
so the first thing we want to do is
we're going to visit our double or
better and what we're gonna do is see if
the previous wager was a loss what we're
gonna do is we're gonna roll dice the
wager is going to equal previous wager
times two so we'll come here and then
we'll say if value minus wager is less
than zero wager equals value so this way
we will only wager what we have left we
won't be able to wager into the
negatives so we were allowing this to
kind of occur before and now we are not
allowing this to occur and we basically
need these same thing right down here as
well so there so this was a loss as well
so I'm both the winning loss we want to
make it clear what our wager was so now
what we'll do is up here where it says
zero we'll say if value is less than or
equal to zero we do this and then what
we're gonna do is let me think here
also if value down here I think we're
all set so Elif previous wager is a loss
and instead of doing this here what
we'll do is we want to put this let me
think
well we definitely need to make this
less than or equal to zero there and
before the break we really want to
append this stuff so let's just cut it
and paste this here although I think
that would just break that if so this
doesn't really matter let's go ahead and
run this now and let's just run double
or better simpler better where is
simpler better hiding it instead of less
than zero will do less than or equal
zero
he that's really all we had to do to
change it mind pretty sure mmhmm yeah oh
I think we're okay we didn't put too big
of a number okay so now we can a little
better see the people that go end up
going to zero yeah so it looks a lot
better so we can see how many people
actually go broke because before we
weren't actually being able to visualize
the amount of people that went actually
went broke so now we can now while we're
here the only thing I would want to
change at this point is to add one more
parameter to our better so for double or
better let's add color so and we'll take
this color and we'll put it in here so
we might want to use multiple versions
of double or better and stuff so for now
we'll put in color and then we'll do the
same thing here
simpler better color variable instead
and then when we go to plot instead of K
its color and then here
we do doubler better with cyan simpler
better okay so that should work let me
run that again just to make sure that we
did what we wanted to okay cool
and then obviously are pretty similar
end result here we'll close out of that
so that's gonna conclude this video in
the next video we're going to do is a
little bit better comparison of simple
or simple better versus our double or
better just to see and then we also want
to look at not only do we want to look
at you know life expectancy but we also
want to look at profit chances so
anyways that's what we have to look
forward to as always thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
