12th fundamental investing with youth
programming tutorial video where we left
off we were visiting this quando comm
pulling financial data and now that we
have the data we want to organize it
into an array and then we're gonna use
that array and graph from that array so
first up we need to create these arrays
and then start ordering things within
them so the first thing we need to do is
make the arrays so I'm gonna call this
net income R or net income array and
it'll be empty for now then Rev array
and then Roc right now the next thing we
want to do is scroll down and we want to
instead of printing these out here I'm
gonna we're going to change up this
array a little bit so so I'm just gonna
actually delete all of this and come
over here and now what we're gonna say
is split and I for split net income it's
gonna equal net oops
net income dot split by newline because
if you remember the output of this text
was you know line by line so first we
want to split it up by an each new line
and then if you recall the first line of
text was descriptive text so we don't
really want that text and the last line
was an empty line so we don't want that
line either so with that in mind we'll
say we'll print net income and now what
we're gonna do is use a for loop so
we're say for each and I for each net
income in split and I and then we're
going to use the first element or the
even that's not the first element right
that's actually one means number two
zero means number one but one to the
negative first element so this will go
all the way to the negative first
element so it will go all the way and
stop before that blank line
so now we'll say print each ni and then
what we're going to do is append it to
our net income right so net income or a
two piece append and we want to append
each n on
so now let's scroll down and the next
thing we want to do is we're gonna say
actually let's print like a little
divider here and the next thing we want
to do is split Rev so to split up a
revenue line basically equals revenue
dot split and again we're gonna split by
a new line and then we'll print out
revenue and now we're going to say for
each Rev and split Rev and again same
parameters as before for the exact same
reason as before print each Rev and then
Rev array dot append each Rev and then
again we'll print out these little
dividers down and now it's going to be
split roc equals roc dot split again by
new line then we'll say print return on
capital and then we'll say for each roc
in split roc and again one to the
negative first element print e
ROC and ROC arrayed out of pens each ROC
now we've probably got a type of someone
here so it might not work quite let's go
ahead and save that run it see what we
got and it turns out we did not have any
type of as well it's like a first so it
connected and you can see it's it's
still printed out everything just like
we remember it doing before no more
empty line either and even though we're
not seeing it being printed out
everything was appended to these each
thing was appended to it it's you know
specific array so now what we can do is
call that array turn it into an umpire
array then we can use the date that's
already in date format convert it to
matplotlib M dates format then we can
graph it in date format then we can put
together and everything and make an epic
investing program
so anyways in the next video we're going
to be discussing moving this into an
umpire array and maybe if we have time
in the next video without running it too
long we'll also go ahead and just
generate a graph out of it so anyway as
always thanks for watching thank you for
all your support your subscriptions and
until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
