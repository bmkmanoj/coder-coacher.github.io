tkinter tutorial series in Python 3
where we left off we made our window and
in fact we can just go ahead and pop it
up made our window here simple GUI
window we can resize it we enclose it we
can click on this button but we can it's
not doing anything so we want to have
some sort of event handling ability so
close this and what we're going to want
to do here is we say button we give it
you know self which could be the Jumba
tax equals quit but then there's another
parameter here that we can add in and we
can say command basically what command
is is what do we want to happen right
when we when someone clicks on this
button when this button is like
activated what do we want to happen well
what we might want to happen is the
following so self dot and then we're
going to call it a client underscore
exit ok now client exit actually has no
um doesn't exist yet so that's not
something that's you know built-in to
tkinter or anything like that so we
define client exits so it could have
been called really anything we wanted so
now what we're going to do is same you
know in our loops in our window class
here in our window class we have you
know all these functions and stuff so
now we can do is we can come down here
and we can define a new function now
this function will say define client
underscore exit and then we'll say self
and we'll just leave the parameters for
now and just as a quick aside I've been
getting some comments on one of my other
series entirely and the the comment was
that we're referencing functions before
they've been defined and so some people
have been having trouble because they're
trying to reference there it's like
throwing an error saying you know this
hasn't been defined yet and you're
trying to reference it and so they're
saying that in the in the code it was
Fritz for a high-gain tutorial series
and in the code it's basically something
like this where we're referencing self
client exit before we're actually at
self or at client exit right so we're
referencing this function before it even
exists and then we did it again up here
right and we can
doing it that's not against the rules of
Python because right here we're just
defining functions and so functions are
kind of like low you don't envision you
know functions aren't really loaded
until maybe the very end or it's hard
for me to explain how why this is okay
it's basically acceptable because a
definition of a function is not a
running so when you define a function
it's not being run it's just being
defined and so when it really matters is
when you call the function to be
executed it's gonna say okay it's go as
we load this function in it it's going
to you know tell pot or Python is going
to be built like okay so we've got this
quit button it's a button when it's
clicked we need to reference client exit
but it's not trying to reference client
exit right at that moment it's it's just
storing the memory like what does it
need to do with that function so right
now putting self that client exit before
the function client exit that's totally
fine that's not actually we're not
reference I mean we are sort of you know
in theory referencing it before it's
been defined but we're not actually
calling it before it's been defined
we're just storing it to memory so a
little bit different there so if at the
same time if like above class window
let's say we called a you know window
died in it window like that okay if we
did something like that then yes we
would be defying the principles because
we're calling first of all class window
before it's been defined but also init
window before it's been defined we're
calling it to execution and we can't so
just as a quick aside not really quick
but needs to be covered because like I
said some people were getting really
confused about that in the PI game
tutorial series and maybe some people
are getting confused about it now Python
is a scripting language so it will go
line by line but it's only going to
execute something that you're asking it
to execute so anyway moving along so
client X itself actually can be very
basic we can say client X itself and all
we really need to do is just exit okay
so you can call just this exit function
it's a built-in function into Python so
with that we can
this and so again quit button it's
button its text says quit and the
command for it is self client underscore
exit so when we click on the button it's
going to run that function so it comes
down here it says client exit what do we
do exit
done so we can say that and we can run
it and up pops our GUI and we can hit
quit and just for the record this pops
up the program is still running do you
make sure you want to kill it we do so
we'll hit okay and that's that's fine
okay so that is uhm some button or some
error handling we go away that is um
error handling event handling with
tkinter obviously we can make this much
more complex so in this sense all the
button did was run client exit not
client exit did was exit now you can
kind of foresee in the future some of
these buttons might do some more fancy
things than just that but that's
basically how you would handle it okay
so if anybody has any questions or
comments regarding this video as as far
as maybe what I was tying you can also
talk about referencing it before it's
been defined if you if you were still
confused about that but if anybody else
has any questions about whatever feel
free to leave those below as always
