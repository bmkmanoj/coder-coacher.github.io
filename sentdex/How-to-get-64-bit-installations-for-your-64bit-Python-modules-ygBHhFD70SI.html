explanation about 32-bit python vs
64-bit python some of the hurdles you'll
have to deal with whether whichever one
you use if you're on a 32-bit operating
system none of this really matters spent
to you right now because you're not
going to be able to use 64 bit anyways
you might still want to stick around
learn a few things just in case you ever
do get a 64-bit system in the future
let's talk about some real basics real
quick what are the what are the
differences between 32 and 64-bit when
it comes to python basically the major
difference here at least performance
wise is going to be your memory
allowance with a 32-bit program the
maximum amount of RAM that can be
allocated is two gigabytes or program so
I mean what kind of work you use Python
for this might not ever be an issue for
you if you ever embarked on like big
data kind of stuff then this two
gigabyte limit is is pretty much going
to stop you from being able to do that
so there's that functionally there's
some back-end differences between 32-bit
in 64-bit as well and this will
basically stop you from being able to
intermix these two things ok sounds you
know easy enough right I'll just get to
64-bit operating system and the 64-bit
Python will be good to go right well not
quite many of the Python modules are
actually 62 I mean 32-bit only even some
of these like most popular ones so for a
great example of this is if you are into
doing big data manipulation or huge like
mathematic problems then you're going to
quickly find out that numpy is one of
those modules its 32-bit only well we
just can't win can we doesn't but you
can there are actually a few options you
can custom edit registry keys and the
install paths which I really don't
suggest you start doing unless you're
very comfortable with it and either way
you better make some backups for you
anything with those registry values also
this isn't going to really solve
everything every time you might still be
able to install the file
well then I want to actually operate as
expected sometimes next you could
rebuild or recompile the import or
module if you have the source files or
you can go the easiest route and that's
to be to go to this website lfd uci.edu
and some Python lip stuff i'll put a
link in the description for anyone who
needs it but this website has basically
all is 64-bit imports and modules you
can ever want I love this stuff so on
here these are well this is like the
list of everything you have but as you
can see they've got everything all your
installers for 64-bit they also have
some 32-bit on I don't know every time I
visited this page it was because i
needed a 64-bit installer but anyway
they've got all these imports here so
basically for like some of the stuff i
justed like this base map projection
stuff like that if people had the
regular vanilla installation of like
matplotlib they probably had a 32-bit
pil installation and you needed to get
the 64-bit pil anyway kind of a mess
same thing with if you try to do numpy
in a 32-bit I mean an umpire with a
64-bit Python not going to work so you
can get numpy from here anyway there's
this huge list up in the link in
description so if you guys need 64 bit
versions of various Python imports and
modules don't give up your 64-bit python
and you're you know forfeit and go down
to a two gigabyte limit blue that sucks
you can use this website and I'm sure
this guy's like a donate button or what
not see any donate button on here but if
you own this website you should put a
donate button on here i would donate to
you anyway that's gonna be all for this
tutorial just want to show you guys that
heaven has that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
