scikit-learn with python for machine
learning tutorial video in this video
we're gonna now be testing with a new
data that we gathered so we wanted to
put together a list for training
purposes of stocks that either
significantly outperform the market or
not and we labeled these significant out
performers as ones otherwise we labeled
the other ones as zeros and we did this
because our return of companies was just
so high as far as ones to invest in that
our script thought would be good but
just to reiterate we got basically 50%
companies saying they would outperform
in 50% underperform which statistically
lines up pretty darn good so the
accuracy there at predictions might
actually be very good but anyway moving
along we we want to now test and the
last serious testing script was part 23
so I'm gonna just copy that and all and
paste and here we are to run our new
test and we the only thing we need to
change here is this build dataset okay
because this has the new values of
underperformer outperform this is within
a without any also moving on into the
future we probably could make a script I
mean we're not not probably we could
make a script that does the from CSV
loads this in and then just simply
modifies the underperformer outperform
or the status write modifies the status
based on a value we set and that value
is just you know SP 500 stock percentage
change - S&amp;amp;P 500 percent is change so we
can actually modify that really quick we
don't really need to run the whole
script through like we've been running
so keep that in mind so if you want to
like tweak this and maybe try seven
percent six percent 6.5 percent like you
can really get to that perfect number if
if you want so but watch out for data
snooping there
so with n/a so let me think you're I
forget what we titled the
so it's just an underscore enhanced so
underscore and danced like that and you
could even really build it into the
script actually I mean so many ideas are
flowing but you could actually probably
set like a global number here run
through this and you can set the value
of the status column to be 0 or 1 based
on that difference and you do that
really quick actually so kind of tempted
to not in this one but definitely
definitely like maybe one of these
coming tutorials I might add that of
initially this was going to be the last
videos but now that I think about it
that would be really simple to add
anyway let's test that should be the
only change I think that we have to make
at this point so let's run that real
quick syntax issue don't know where that
popped up from just get rid of that
let's try again
I should have ran this while I was
talking but yeah that idea just kind of
came to me actually that we could fairly
easily things like maybe we got our
information not no information
apparently with na let's try no na and
see what we did wrong
that's met some suggestions there it's
strange that with na would have them and
without whatnot we could run that maybe
one more time anyway so here are some
suggested or suggestions
these are would be the companies that we
might think about investing into so this
time I only have 28 as opposed to like
the 280 that we had before so there's
always that so let's see I mean heck
even Z could be the return of this minus
this you wouldn't even need or know you
can make well you can make a why
and return that anyway not important
sort of important I'm curious why no Oh
see this included with not available
line let's go up here really quick and
this is no na what have we say with
whoops with na it's almost like then the
mix is dogs going crazy on the floor
interesting you would expect more
results from the match right like at
least I would maybe because it matched
it didn't find matches I don't really
know yeah so within in here and then you
just need this and so obviously the
first time we did know na I think that
was down maybe here see if we better
answer yes still see zero that's
relatively frustrating and that's the
length there and then let's match no na
with no na up here with I suppose it's
possible that we literally get zero
companies to invest in but can I sounds
wrong to me because we have more sepals
they're less samples here but maybe
that's what's happening because we were
looking for a pretty highly like a high
value you know six percent or more out
performance so I suppose but you would
expect that these samples are included
in in these samples but of course these
have a lot that aren't included in this
and maybe that's something is you know
significantly changing our results but
anyway I think in the next video we're
going to cover how to vary the
performance output to decide you know
what number we want and we can actually
do that right in this script so we're
gonna cover that so stay tuned for that
