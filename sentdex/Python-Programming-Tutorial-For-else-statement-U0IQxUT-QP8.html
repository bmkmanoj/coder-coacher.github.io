Python tutorial this video in the next
couple videos will be covering the else
statement typically if people only use
the else statement with the if statement
but this isn't totally necessary you can
also use it with the for while and even
the try statements so and actually the
accept statement but we'll get to that
so first why would you want to use it
with something like the for like a for
loop so let's say you wanted to run
through a Python list looking for a
variable in that list and if you found
that variable you would want to do
something if not found you would also
maybe want to do something so in my case
whenever like I back test stocks like
say for example we're gonna go through a
list of parameters and if those
parameters are met then we would say
okay we've got to buy let's say
otherwise we don't have a buy continue
something like that right so let's say
that's the case so how would we actually
do that normally well first we're gonna
need an example list so let's say
example list equals and this list is
gonna eat one two three four and five
now next thing we're gonna do is we're
gonna say y equals three for now so
we're just going to kind of define this
fake variable and then we're right what
we have to say is like what we're gonna
do is we're gonna run through this
entire example list and we're gonna see
if Y is if the condition of Y is is
present within the example list as we
can see already yes it is but this is
meant to just be an example so the way
that you know you would probably do this
is you would have something like this
like matched equals and the default is
gonna be of course false and then you
would probably write a loop like for X
in example list if x equals y then print
matched and then we'll go ahead and say
like what we matched because not only do
we want to know like if that was in the
list because really if you just want to
know is this variable and there's a list
that's very simple you can you just have
it if Y in example list right but what
if you need to
like what that variable actually is
right that's in that list because
typically Y would be dynamic so anyway
continuing on so we actually we want to
know not only didn't match but what did
it match so the next thing that we do
now is we need to say matched equals
true but if there was no match we're
still not covered right so the next
thing we want to say is if match equals
false we'll just print no match back
right so let's say that run that and
make sure that works so it did indeed
match three now if we change this to
seven for example save that and run that
it's gonna say no match found but there
is a better more pythonic way to do
something like this and that's going to
be for else so instead of all this I
guess what I'll do is I'll just comment
this out so we can count the lines in a
minute it's gonna be one less line to
use for else but it's also going to be a
bit smarter thing to do so now oh and in
fact we need to this okay so now we're
going to rename this to three again and
now let's do the four else so we're
gonna say instead for X in example list
if x equals y print and we want to print
out the same thing as before so matched
and then what was matched and then we
have to throw in a break now let me get
through this and I'll explain why we
must have that break there so then we
add an else print no match found done so
the way you can think of a for else
statement see most people envision that
else statement is like if the prior
statement returns like a false you know
that's kind of how they think of it so
they expect it the else will just be
called if nothing actually executes sin
the for loop or something and the
problem here is that the for loop
doesn't really inherently break when
something happens it doesn't add return
of false and you could have multiple
throughs in theory right so you know it
doesn't quite work like that so the way
that you should really envision this is
like this is all one big loop so when
you break
you're breaking past the else right
because the else is part of that loop
right so that's kind of the way to think
about it and like later on you'll see
when we have like except else for
example except else works much more in
the way that you might think it does or
it should
anyway let's say that we'll run it and
again we have the same result it matched
three and if we changed Y to seven for
example no matches found now at the end
of the day this whole thing is one two
three four five six lines and this was
one two three four five six seven lines
so not a huge difference but this is a
completely unnecessary variable there's
also problems that could arise with the
depth like defining it like this this is
also more a little bit more efficient
because as soon as it's found its gonna
break for you so that's kind of nice but
obviously if you wanted to find maybe
multiple matches you wouldn't make it
all the way through before it actually
broke so you'd have to kind of consider
all these things but at the end of the
day this can also be used for a variety
of other things not just you know like
what I was saying so anyways hopefully
you guys learn something new if you have
any questions feel free to put them in
the comments below otherwise stay tuned
we have a few more else statements to
throw in so stay tuned for those and
otherwise as always thanks for watching
thanks for all the support in the
subscriptions and until the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
