if you have some good experience Tetris
skills you're able to fit everything in
there and get the top back on as you can
see this was based this is mine I was
able to fit the top back on there's not
much else in their cave I don't know how
you'd fit the little distance sensor but
somehow you could probably do it anyway
when you're all done
should look something similar to this
you've probably already found out that
it doesn't work very well on carpet the
motors are just pretty weak so you get
what you pay for the motors like five
dollar motors so I'm driving here on
just some laminate in my kitchen so
that's pretty much the only place I have
flat flat flooring the rest is carpet
but anyway once you're done you should
be able to just remote desktop in run
your script and now you can remote
control your car even now it you know
it'll turn okay still not the best
turning but it does okay I suppose then
pivot we did code that it's okay again
with pivots not really the best like I
can't I can't pivot the other way right
now just because the motors are just so
pathetic what anyway at least the code
works it's just we need more we need
more budget in R&amp;amp;D so we can actually
afford better stuff but anyway that's it
hopefully you guys enjoyed I know a lot
of people put pretty bad ratings on this
I was looking at the ratings for this
little kit online and most people were
complaining about
there's no constructions given really
for or the kit so it's kind of hard
putting it together but I learned a lot
hopefully you guys learned a lot I think
it was a good first kit obviously
there's not much else to it you
certainly can't do much with it because
the motors are so weak but it was still
a lot of fun and I appreciate the frame
I mean you could just switch out the
motors and put some better motors in
there and have a lot more fun with it
probably but anyways I enjoyed it
hopefully you guys did too as always
thanks for watching thanks for all the
support and subscriptions also if you
have any questions feel free to leave
them below and until next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
