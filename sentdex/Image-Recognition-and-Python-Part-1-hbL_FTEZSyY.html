recognition and image manipulation
tutorial series the series is just going
to be a simple introduction to the field
and the procedures used in those two
things initially it was mostly just for
image recognition but then some of the
stuff that we're doing in these earlier
videos you would also do if you wanted
to do image manipulation so image
recognition obviously views like a
screen reader like an OCR so an optical
character recognition program they would
use some image recognition for each
character and there's also a whole bunch
of like facial recognition and stuff
that you would use image recognition for
and as far as image manipulation if you
think about like automatic image
enhancers they're basically doing this
right
so that kind of stuff will be covered
here obviously we won't be doing facial
recognition or image automatic image
enhancements right at the gate but we'll
cover a lot of the basics for the
procedures so to start the series you're
going to need five things the first
thing we're going to get is this zip
file with a bunch of images in it that
we can use that I'll be using throughout
this series some text is my website so
you just go sent Dexcom slash and then
tutorial images that zip one word hit
enter and you should download this
tutorial images zip file and I'll just
bring it up show you what it is in the
inside you have a file or a folder
called images extract this to wherever
you'll be writing this script we'll get
back to that in a little bit and inside
images you've got numbers and then
you've got some other images one's just
a single dot and other ones got a dot
and another dot this is my logo and then
only thin numbers we've got a bunch of
numbers and then an example of each so
like these are all zeros these are all
ones these are all twos and so on so
we'll get to those in a little bit but
that's that's what's in the file now the
next thing that we're going to need is
Python we're going to be using the
programming language of Python to do all
of this Python is very
newbie friendly the syntax for
programming in Python is very simple
there's
not too much not to worry about brackets
no this kind of stuff and the
indentations automatic just very
friendly language yet very very powerful
for data analysis so that's what I
recommend you get it's definitely a good
programming language to learn if you
don't already know it I imagine a lot of
people watching these have seen my other
videos and probably already have Python
but if you don't go to download and wait
one is down a Python 2.7 point 5 don't
download Python 3 get to 7 and download
you know whatever operating system you
have is just going to vary if you do
have windows I highly suggest you get
the 64-bit version if you have a 64-bit
version of Windows subsequently the next
three things we need are numpy
matplotlib and pil and pil stands for
python imaging the library now if you've
downloaded anything like sy PI for
example a lot of times I'll come like
bundled with all of this stuff so you
might already have some of this stuff so
just try to do import on numpy import
matplotlib import pil and see if you can
now if you have a 64-bit version of
python you can't use pil you'll be using
pillow and that's actually what i'll be
using throughout this series and since i
recommend that everyone gets 64-bit if
you're on Windows I highly suggest you
get 64-bit and don't worry about not
being able to get pil otherwise ever all
the downloads will be here I use this
website lfd whatever so let me copy and
copy this real quick if you come up here
it's basically a bunch of these windows
binaries for python and they're just
like straight installers instead of
having to use setup dot exe or and I'm
sorry nuts set up that pi
so like setup tools or pip install and
all that so again very new friendly to
come here and you just download the
Installer so like for example with
pillow I'll put all these links in the
description but if you use my link it
should take you all the way down here
you would download whatever version you
need if you're on Windows and obviously
if you're on a like Linux or something
like that then you'll need to just find
a pillow install and install installing
stuff on
Linux is pretty simple so it so you need
this but anyway
same thing with numpy if you're on
Windows download the numpy version and
then I'm at plot live download the
version that you need again if you have
64-bit make sure you get all the 64-bit
if you're on 32-bit make sure the
Installer you download is the win32 and
so on so once you have all five of those
things let's go ahead and make sure we
have all five of those things before
moving on one check to make sure you got
that download the tutorial images zip
download to make sure you've got Python
and you installed it so if you did you
should be able to go to your Start bar
if you're on Windows and type in Python
and you should be able to get something
called Python and then parenthesis it'll
say command line pull that up to rag
that over and it probably will be black
with white text but it'll look something
like this and if you ever if you don't
know what bit version you downloaded you
can scroll over here and it should say
like right here like what bit version
you have now the next thing that we're
going to want to do to make sure that we
got everything downloaded and installed
correctly you're gonna want to import
each of the things so if you are if you
installed numpy you should be able to go
import numpy without any errors and on
air is going to look like this so let's
say we actually spelled numpy right but
we get this error no module that means
it something went wrong in the
installation usually the issue that my
viewers have is they just downloaded the
wrong bit version so that's pretty much
it anyway moving on import matplotlib no
error and you should finally be able to
import well if you if you have a 32-bit
version of python then the you will be
importing PIL and I happen to have PIL
but actually for this tutorial we're not
going to be using PIL well depending on
what you have anyway
if you had PIL you would just do import
image like that but if you downloaded
pillow you will do just import PIL but
we'll get to that in just a second but
as long as you could do um if you have a
let me say it one more time before we go
on if you have a 32-bit version of
Python make sure you can do import
capital ima GE and if you have a 64-bit
version of Python make sure you can
download or import PIL and the more
importantly make sure you can do from
PIL import capital I am a GE hit enter
okay so as long as everything is working
up to that point then you've installed
everything and you're ready to go to the
next video as always thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
