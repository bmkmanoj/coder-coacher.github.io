another video concerning trading of
Bitcoin this is gonna be the second part
in this series and what we're gonna be
talking about in this video is the risks
associated with trading Bitcoin in the
background I'll just put the same chart
I had on the first one it's just the
chart of the Mount GOx BTC USD price
compared to BTC dashi's BTC USD price at
the moment we're seeing them rally at
least right here they're very similar
all through normally you're gonna see
that they have a large gap and measured
down here is actually the gap so this is
what you'll typically see is a big gap
like this size and not so small like
this so it's kind of interesting to see
that they're so closely knit at the
moment our arbitrage errs are pissed
anyway so on to risk and again just I'll
point out you know we've got a high here
of about 765 and a low here so one from
765 and about 15 minutes to 680 so a
massive drop within about a 15 minute
period and then again it hung down here
for a little bit spiked all the way up
to about 7:30 ish but also if you looked
at and that was Mount Cox though if you
look at BTC - it was a little more
stable so it went just from 720 to 690
and then back up again but even 720 to
690 and then back up again is pretty
pretty serious swings and this is this
chart here it just only is an hour so as
we get a plot here knocks off a plot
back here and it continues that way at
the top here obviously of the relative
strength index and on the bottom the
MACD anyway this video is all about the
risks so the first risk pretty much
covered here volatility so the market
for Bitcoin consists mainly of
speculators right most of you guys that
are interested in this video even are
speculators and pretty much everybody in
the market
Speculator there's actually very few
businesses on the whole that actually
deal in Bitcoin and a lot of the major
ones are just kind of criminal websites
and they eventually do get shut down so
you wouldn't want to like put all your
eggs in that basket so so most of these
people are just speculators interested
maybe making a quick buck or even
trading it but they don't represent
anything but short term holding and so
this causes really extreme volatility
the other issue causing the volatility
is the trading fees so generally the
trading fees are quite low so for Mount
GOx the trading fee is point six percent
and so that makes it both ways one point
two percent and then the trade fees for
BTC is point two percent so point four
percent both ways but that's actually
quite quite low so like with a thousand
dollar investment we're talking with
Mount GOx your typical trading fees that
you might get with Scottrade or
something like that for stocks but for
BTC USD now we're talking about quite a
bit smaller leathered of that so it's
very cheap fee and that's if you're
trading with a thousand dollars but the
beauty of it is you could trade five
dollars worth of Bitcoin and you're only
paying a percentage not a flat
transaction fee so this really allows
anybody to come into this market and
just trade it just purely for fun which
is kind of what I'm hoping to do with
this series is is just show you guys
that you can actually plan in a real
market with real money so you're dealing
with real emotion and all of that but
you're actually not I mean you you could
put a lot of money down I wouldn't
suggest it for the reasons that I'm
going to get to but you know it is a lot
of you can have a lot of fun for
actually pretty cheap that's so it's
kind of cool so that's the volatility
aspect to it but again with the low
since everything is a percentage fee not
an actual dollar fee it's actually quite
nice so the next thing is hacking and I
say that was you know scare quotes
because no one actually gets hacked very
often these days so due to the
irreversibility of Bitcoin transactions
and they're unregulated and all of this
they make for a very nice item to steal
because there's no legal help for you so
it becomes pretty difficult
to track anybody especially if they know
what they're doing if you get your
Bitcoin stolen I mean that that's it
and if you decide to get into trading
bitcoins just understand that you will
be targeted right so I call this hacking
with scare quotes just because again
it's it's usually not the case right so
it's more of either social engineering
or just playing out right phishing you
know you get a phishing email right that
says there mount GOx you click on a link
and you log in and yeah it's not
actually Mount gosh right you're you're
just it's like a hundred percent
certainty that you're going to get these
phishing emails because there's you know
two main exchanges so anybody that knows
you deal with Bitcoin knows that you're
most likely on one so they have a 50/50
chance but also most people are on both
exchanges so I mean they're they
probably even have higher than a 50/50
percent chance to get it right so keep
that in mind so always you know check
links also like I said in the other
video I've been in this sort of business
for a very long time it's almost always
your friend don't trust your internet
friends okay just be careful and
hopefully you won't get all your money
stolen so not only are you gonna see a
lot of phishing links but also don't
download these trading BOTS I can't
believe some of this stuff that I see in
there they're like official stuff like
I've even seen some on YouTube here
where they have like 20,000 views and
fifty likes right by a brand new account
that clearly bought all of that stuff
don't do it just don't download that
stuff so maybe at some point I'll show
you guys like how we can program our own
trading both Mount GOx and BTC - we have
trading api's that you can use you just
need to understand encryption and a
couple other subtleties and you'll be
able to use them so so just use your own
trading API and don't take the risk
because it's you know you you just if it
if it says it makes you know a thousand
dollars a day then what the hell is that
guy selling it for and most of the time
they're like a free download link so
just you know use common sense here the
next thing hacking again in quotes of
the website that you use so the exchange
or BTC - II or mount GOx or whatever
this is also not uncommon
in the last few years even if it's your
favorite website again they can get
quote-unquote act usually this is also a
social engineering job or just simply a
front because the owner wanted to steal
your stuff so yeah there's always that
next you have identity theft along with
getting your Bitcoin stolen most of
these trading websites are in our choir
personal information on you for these
websites safety but they can easily lose
it and also be selling it on the side
for Bitcoin anonymously for you know no
paper trail
so so I'll keep that in mind a threat of
regulation China just recently imposed
those regulations on their banks in the
USA can easily follow suit with some
legislation as well and they've been
known to to legislate even if it goes
against these the Constitution so you
know you have no idea what to expect
uh-huh and at least with USA I mean
we're like you know the government's on
record you know saying that hey we're
thinking about doing this because it
seems kind of you know seems just like
any other exchange it which it is so
expect that this issues gonna continue
and not only will and can regulation you
know it's self cause trouble just the
threat of regulation can cause the
troubles you know just like corner or
you know I qe2 and all this stuff just a
threat of taking away that money causes
massive swings in the market even though
you know it's like oh just kidding we're
not actually gonna do that yeah okay
it's called manipulation anyway next
getting out of the system it's actually
very difficult to get out of the system
sometimes especially for example US and
European clients right now you can just
google it yourself and see how many
people are complaining about getting
their money out of somewhere like mount
GOx for example so you can transfer
money into mount cox and you can
transfer money out of mount gosh so you
could trade your you can deposit you
know hundred dollars convert that
bitcoin trade the bitcoin a bunch and
then you've got maybe uh you know you
did really good and you've got a hundred
and twenty bucks worth a bitcoin you
sell the bitcoin and you want to take
your money out turns out that that takes
an indefinite amount of time i don't
know anybody that has been able to get a
substantial amount of money out of mount
GOx
and that's very troubling because if you
time the system right it can become
totally a ponzi scheme but very close to
what a ponzi scheme is so so to make
withdrawals you're actually withdrawing
someone else's deposited money and since
bitcoin is just you know nothingness
pretty much you can you can kind of
cheat the system that way and also mount
GOx themselves can be selling their own
bitcoin not really your bitcoin so
there's a lot of ways that these
websites could become just the massive
scams also with the in the recent rises
in bitcoin that can actually just be a
result of mount GOx not cashing out
people's money right so they're just not
letting people get out of the market so
there's a lot of money coming into the
market and in theory that money's tied
up but no one can prove that that money
is tied up for real so it could totally
be the case that mount cox just you know
wanting to invest that money into
Bitcoin and since bitcoin was going up
so much and now they're trying to get
out of bitcoin right something like that
right and they just they're not able to
make it happen so there's always the
possibility that there's shenanigans
going on and again with mount GOx i mean
these these are relatively new people to
the to the financial industry you know
and at least with with mount gots for
example if this is you and you've got
your money stuck in mount gosh just
cancel the transaction take the bitcoin
convert that or transfer that bitcoin to
your wallet or some are somewhere else
and then convert it somewhere away from
out gosh my docs issue most likely is
the regulation they just recently got in
a bunch of trouble for being a financial
exchange but not you know filling out
the proper paperwork to be a financial
exchange here in the US so they're
having a lot of trouble there and so
it's either just a cause of them
laziness malfeasance or something or
there is definitely funny business going
on it could be any of those things
really like I said before it should
always just a measure of you know how
valuable is the reputation versus how
valuable is the scam you know because a
lot of people don't really have morals
anymore
so definitely keep your eye out for
Mount GOx if you are watching this and
you were thinking about going with an
exchange keep that in mind that you
might not get your money out of metal
 so yeah so because originally
mount GOx really was just you know
number one you know and so that's why
they're still getting a lot of money
pumped into them but no money is coming
out and so you're just kind of trusting
that mount GOx is not using that money
it really is just in float right now and
I don't really trust them for that
so anyway keep that in mind so so anyway
you should definitely you know do some
research on the exchange that you plan
to go with do some research on btc-e if
you want to go with them do some
research on Mount GOx it might be the
case that Mount GOx by the time you
you're viewing this video has completely
fixed all of their troubles and they're
good to go and to be honest with you
this graph almost looks like they fix
their troubles and they lowered their
fees or something anyway so those are
just some of the basic risks that you
want to keep in mind because it's kind
of easy to drift into this thinking it's
a lot like stocks or something like that
well with stocks you can easily place
trust in the companies that you're
investing or putting your money in you
know so they're not FDIC insured but you
know they're regulated and they're
controlled and they've got watchdog
agencies constantly watching them but
these companies don't and so there's a
lot of risk involved and so like here
you know I would just suggest that as
they usually say all right don't invest
with money you can't afford to lose well
I'll take that a step further and I
would say you can think of the money
that you're putting into this is money
that you're never gonna see again
because it's it the chances of you never
ever
Wow never ever seeing your money again
the chances of you seeing this money
again are actually low ish right or not
location but lower than you probably
think so just keep that in mind that
the money that you put in there just
just do it to have fun right that's
that's kind of the idea is you can just
you know buy five dollars worth of
Bitcoin if you want and play the Bitcoin
market you know it should just be kind
of like fun learning experience a chance
to play in the market without having to
put in a sizable amount of money right
and then maybe you know maybe once you
get comfortable you can consider getting
a little more serious with with doing it
and look at this mount docks
significantly now holding a price lower
than BTC Dashie we've not seen that in a
long time
wonder what's going on I have to have to
look after I'm done here see what why
that's actually occurring anyway so
that's gonna be the end of this video as
far as risks associated hopefully I
didn't bore you guys too much but you
know this is a real deal you know if
you're thinking of putting actual money
down into this it's a lot riskier than I
think a lot of people are realizing and
so I think it's important to consider
all the risks involved so anyway that's
gonna conclude this video in the next
video we'll probably be getting into
some of what we're looking at right now
various trading ideas and also where you
can get data like this and maybe even do
a tutorial on the chart itself a lot of
you guys probably recognize this chart
because I've actually given you guys a
tutorial on how to build this chart
pretty much except for plugging in the
prices so a lot of you guys can probably
figure it out on your own but anyway
maybe a tutorial on that if you want to
see it really badly comment below and
I'll take note otherwise it might not
actually include a tutorial on how to
build this exact chart but anyway yes
obviously a lot there's a lot of
interest in the idea of arbitrage where
you buy you know from oneexchange and
you sell on the other exchange for the
profit so like right now there's only a
three dollar or actually a two dollar
spread and that's not good enough
you needed a quite a bit higher spread
but a lot of times you can see a twenty
to thirty dollars spread what we're
seeing right now is actually very rare
it
leading up to this point so I'll be
interested to see how this continues
playing out or why this is playing out
in fact I bet I could go see if I can
find any information and why anyway it
is fairly uncommon to see that anyway I
couldn't find anything on it at the
moment I'm not sure what is causing this
maybe it's just chance I don't know so
I'm gonna go ahead and conclude the
video here anyways hopefully you guys
enjoy it hopefully you're interested in
this topic as always thanks for watching
things for all the support in the
subscriptions and until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
