tutorial in this tutorial we're going to
be discussing echo and a little bit more
depth echo is built into PHP and it's
used to output things to the users
browser which is done through HTML which
really HTML and PHP are going to
interact pretty heavily if you're going
to be doing any sort of really web
development so initially what we did was
we echoed out welcome to PHP here and
this was just kind of like a basic echo
text but you can also start echoing out
HTML tags I'm not familiar with HTML you
can just follow along there's really no
epic HTML stuff coming up anytime soon
so so we'll just throw on some HTML tags
and so to do that we'll save this and
we'll upload it back to the server and
we'll pop over here we'll refresh we had
misspelled our tag save it one more time
upload that back to the server
one last time refresh and now we have a
bolded welcome to PHP very strong there
is another way to output text and that
is with print so as you'll see we'll
save this we'll upload this back to the
server and actually let's let's add
another period just so you can believe
me that I've changed the file upload
that back to the server will come here
hit refresh and as you can see it's the
same thing it really there print and
echo are one in the same echo is just a
little bit less processing heavy it's
what you're gonna see most of the time I
can't say I've ever really seen
someone's PHP script that used print so
anyway use echo but if you did see print
hopefully you now know it what print
would even mean with
go you can also use you can put
variables into this and we'll go into
detail with variables a little bit more
later but let's just name a variable and
to name a variable use a dollar sign
than the variable name and we'll go over
some more rules for variable names and
in probably one of the next videos but
for now we'll just say it's equal to PHP
and then so you can do welcome to and
let's get rid of these strong tags so
welcome to and then you use a period and
that kind of just denotes what's called
it's a little too full stop and then you
can add things to it so let's actually
add a space at the end of the string and
then we'll just put Lang so it's kind of
like you're appending Lang whatever the
variable Lang is to the string but this
is what I'm trying to show you is that
you can use echo with you know not only
strings in HTML but you can input
variables into that as well so if we
come back over here and refresh and
we've got giving ourselves some sort of
error lovely oh we didn't I told you in
the first tutorial I'm gonna forget our
semicolons all the time and I've only
begun so anyway so here's our welcome to
PHP and this time you know the PHP part
is actually this line so that's just a
quick to show you the echo and again you
can use print but don't use print and so
in the next tutorial what I'm going to
be showing you guys is a little bit more
in depth about implementing PHP with
HTML so as always thanks for watching
and until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
