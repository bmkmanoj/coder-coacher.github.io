tutorial in this tutorial we're going to
get into one of the more basic
functionalities of pretty much any
programming language you have like
if-else statements and then you have for
and while loops that are pretty much in
every single language so let's do the if
statements first and you you don't have
to follow if with else but you can
follow it with else but for now all
we're going to do is show you a quick if
statement this syntax for an if
statement is you say if and then in the
in parentheses you specify whatever the
case that you're looking for is and then
what you actually produce if that is the
case is within these curly braces so and
with Python I'm not going to get too
into depth about this but they called
this kind of like your standards and you
could in theory code everything on in
one line you or or like you wouldn't
have to indent but generally what you do
is every time you have like a new
statement of some sort or something
that's within a parent of something else
so in this case whatever is encased in
this if statement like what you want to
do you would code it here and say stuff
you wouldn't want to encode it here and
say stuff so anyway we'll get more into
that and I'm not really or at least
you'll see me using these standards it's
just a good idea to get used to them
because for one for you to read your own
code and then also for other people to
ever read your code if you're ever
working with somebody or if you have
like a question nobody wants to answer
your question if your standards are
horrible and they can't read your code
this is really just kind of a pain so
anyway keep that in mind because like
some languages like it
coming from Python it just automatically
gives you beautiful standards it doesn't
request that you do any of this so if
you're not used to it you'll just have
to start doing it so let's do if and
we'll do name and then the way you do
this is if a regular equal sign is an
assignment this is a double equal sign
is a comparison so with name equals and
we're gonna say Harrison then we want to
do something right we've already said it
equals Harrison so this will be the case
now you might also see and we'll go into
detail with this in another video but
you might also see triple equals in the
case of string data it's not as as
useful as if like if we were doing age
like if we had an if statement regarding
age you don't type this out with me I'm
just going to show you like if we did if
age equals 99 that means one thing but a
few set of age triple equals 99 this
would be true but if you said if age
equals just 99 like the integer type of
data this would actually return a false
value but if you did if age equals
equals 99 it would return a true so
double equals just tries to compare it
on you know that the value itself not
data type but a triple equals is going
to require the exact same data type so
anyway just keep that in mind it really
doesn't matter in this case I'm just
going to double equals when you're
comparing string data it's not as big of
an issue unless it has you know numbers
within it so we're gonna say if name
equals hair's and now within this you
can do this is where you're going to
code whatever you want it to do so we're
gonna say echo and let's just have it
echo strong hello
and then closed off our strong tags
closed off our statement and that's it
so we'll save that put it up on the
server and actually let's delete this
part so we don't see a bunch of
different code and will refresh and
obviously named it equal Harrison so it
says of course hello Harrison</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
