second part of our Python three tkinter
tutorial mini-series in the last video
we made just a really simple basic
window we did it in eight lines which
would really take hundreds if not
thousands of lines to create a window
normally so we can already kind of see
the value of using tkinter but anyway
with that we're going to go ahead and
continue on so the first thing that we
might want to have in our window is
people want to maybe add buttons so
let's go ahead and add a button to this
so first thing we're going to do is
we're going back over here and in this
initialization we want this window to
pop up you know immediately okay so we
have a class window and it's really just
a frame and we've initialized this but
now what we're going to want to go ahead
and do is in our initialization we're
going to say self died and then we're
gonna go in it underscore window empty
parameters for now now in it window does
not exist okay so this is not something
that's built into tkinter
we're going to use this and we're going
to create this function right now so
we'll come down and we're going to say
define init underscore window and again
we're just going to pass through a
single parameter can you guess what the
parameter is going to be self that's it
:
um and now we're going to go ahead and
say is self dot master got title is
going to be we're going to call it GUI
okay and then we're going to say a self
dot pack and basically first of all
let's just go ahead and I suppose what
we should do is to explain what we're
doing here so again so we what you have
with a window is you actually have a
frame and then within that frame you put
really Windows and so basically here
we're initializing the window and then
um here we're saying the title of our
window is GUI so you're understanding of
what a window is where the title of that
window might go is going to be GUI okay
and now what we're doing is we're saying
self pack and what we're going to do is
we're going to say fill equals both and
then expand oops
spans B equals 1 and this what this is
saying is yes
we'll adjust dimensions as as needed and
then also we're filling up the window
and then we're going to come down here
and what we want to do is we want to
create our button instant so and then
pack we're basically packing this into
our frame okay so we've got let's say we
wanna have a quit button so we can all
not only can we make a button but we can
go from there into event handling so
we're gonna say quit button equals
capital bu TT ons for button and this
button is a part of tkinter so we're
kind of taking button from tkinter maybe
it would be nice for us to view that
really quick so 34 just a quick aside
TCL keep that in mind
you might want to check that out at some
point anyway tkinter and buttons
probably in in it maybe even in name I
should have found these before I guess I
won't find it because I want to spend
like 20 minutes searching for that on
film but anyway button is a function
within tkinter now again button self
gana Kavita Jumba or whatever you wanted
and then we're going to say text this is
the text that will be written on the
button so you could put anything here
for us we're going to say the text is
quit okay and then what we're going to
go ahead and do is enter enter and then
we'll say quit button dot place and we
want to place this button at x equals
zero and y equals zero so this will put
it at the upper left so if you're
familiar with like CSS or anything like
that generally what you do is you start
at the upper left and any additions
right or that many pixels over that many
pixels down okay a little bit different
than your the convention where it's
really the bottom left and then you know
X is over Y is up it's not really like
that it's actually x over true but Y is
actually down so to speak so anyway um
that should be good
we've got now a quit button placed it's
not gonna do anything but it's there
okay so we're placing that quit button
now it might be a good idea to once we
start saying hey we're going to use
these pixels and here's what we're going
to do a ball wha it might be a good idea
to go ahead and specify the default
shape of this window that way as we're
kind of placing things on it
we can do the math in our head say hey
this button will fit or no this button
won't fit because like if you say we
wanted to place this button at x equals
500 and y equals a thousand well we saw
the previous window the deep by default
when does not that big so it wouldn't
even be there okay so what we're going
to go ahead and do is after we've
defined root equals TK next thing we can
do is we can say root geometry geometric
geometric goodness I can't spell and
then here you can specify the dimensions
of this window so we're going to say
it's a 400 by 300 window okay and then
that's really all the things that we
need to change so now what we can do is
let's go ahead and save and run this and
here's our window now you can see our
default size of our window is different
we can still however you know modify the
size of the window and all of that the
quit button we can click but it doesn't
do anything but at least it acts like a
button like look at all that like we
didn't have to code any of that you know
the button being pressed pressed in and
out shape of the button the shadow of
the button I mean all this stuff that's
going into this window is pretty
impressive so anyway click the X so
that's how we can make a button but we
click the hell out of that button
nothing happened right so now what we
need to do is we have to give the button
an event handling ability so when
someone clicks it it does something okay
that's what the whole point of a button
is so in the next video that's what
we're going to be covering is event
handling and making this button actually
you know quit okay so if anybody has any
questions or comments regarding this
video please feel free to leave them
below as always thanks for watching
thanks for all the support and
subscriptions and until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
