Bitcoin video in this video I'm not
going to be showing you guys who need my
trading for today mostly because there
really was no trading done today Bitcoin
didn't really do that much in the way of
movement today this is the last few
hours from basically there 9am to the 17
o'clock this is pretty much all it's
done i did get some trading in early on
and then basically SAT through this
entire thing here with pretty much no
movement and then here it moved a little
bit but then again pretty much no
movement so not really anything to show
off for today overall i can actually
just bring it up this is just like all
of my bitcoin trading history and over
here you can see basically how much I've
how much u.s. dollars I've moved how
much I've made twenty dollars and the
percent profit and we started about two
two days ago now today of Bitcoin
flipping now this is within an original
two hundred and fifty dollar investment
so in two days you know I made seven
point seven percent which is you know
that's nice that's pretty cool but it's
been pretty slow the last few days and
actually bitcoins just kind of been
slowly chipping away at value so so
there's that and in fact let me show you
guys let's bring this over bring up the
Bitcoin prices here yeah so the top line
here is the actual Bitcoin price eyes
you can see I mean from the peak here
really over the last couple days it's
actually just been gone then mostly
today I mean look today's the 14th and
it's just just been like in decline same
thing with obviously like our sentiment
here sentiments just like so not too
much going on today and also I mean you
can even tell like the volatility of the
sentiment here is pretty big and then
over here just pretty small and in
decline so be nice if there was I don't
know some more news bits or something so
always seems like whenever there
big news or just news at all it doesn't
have to be positive or negative news we
just need some news there's stuff
happening but otherwise yeah it's pretty
boring day today so what I wanted to
talk about in this video is the
downsides to Bitcoin so you know we've
been talking about a lot of the good
things about Bitcoin the cool things and
all this and kind of dispelling some
things but there are some downsides to
Bitcoin and so let's just talk about
some of those so first they are indeed
pretty volatile um you know here we only
have a couple of days but you know you
can look at a really long term chart
like let's do something like this where
the price I mean especially as we were
leading up to the point with like all
that news and everything where it came
from 240 to over a thousand dollars per
bitcoin that's a lot of change and um
you know the currency has to level out
before before it can actually be used
like you can't be moving that much and
really made that move in less than a
month so you can't really have that kind
of stuff happening for a currency to be
you know usable but everybody references
that but if you actually look at like
what happened before all of that you
know the currency was relatively I mean
it was like in in you know constant
increase you know but it was kind of
stable and like I showed you guys with
like the two previous bubbles you know
they would have it and then it would you
know flatline for a long time before
getting to another one so then this is
probably going to do the same where you
know Peaks here and it slips down and
then flatlines i don't know i'm not
making predictions but you know
something like 400 and flatlines there
for a while until its next little bubble
anyway so that's that now anyway but the
issue is though it is indeed volatile so
this gives it kind of the untrustworthy
appearance so every time it's in the
news it's because of its volatility so
every time people hear about it they're
like oh bitcoins too volatile yeah so so
it's just kind of doesn't really work
out now people kind of associate the
high risk with it so with this not many
people even have adopted Bitcoin but the
sad part is as more people do adopt
Bitcoin
like when it gets popular and people are
hearing about in the news and get
curious the price skyrockets because
people were buying into Bitcoin and then
when the price skyrockets people are
like hey look at the volatility and so
so there's always that so the next thing
is Bitcoin in least in the media is kind
of painted negatively like that and then
also the people that use Bitcoin in the
media are just nerds and criminals so
one article yeah here we go I saw some
Bitcoin is a segue of currency so
basically you know anybody that you know
the Segway was really like touted like
it was like the Internet of scooter or
Internet of like I don't know foot
travel or something I can't remember it
was a big deal like I remember like um
the unveiling of the segway and i was
like what and and yeah you know people
do look kind of silly on the segway and
so that was the whole point was you know
anybody that uses bitcoin looks you know
absurd um so anyway don't really like
the article but it you know it just gets
a whole lot of you know bad rap
basically and then also with criminals
the Silk Road was a pretty big story
whenever that came out the site got
basically shut down the owner I mean
first of all I just want to say what is
he doing with his hand this is this
picture bothers me so much because his
hand is like contorted like why are you
doing this in the picture anyway I don't
like that um so anyway this guy you know
rants Silk Road and like if in the
article you here and you read about this
guy like basically at you know getting
this guy to kill this other guy that was
like threatening I'm what was he gets
red and white this guy named bread and
white to kill was it friendly chemist or
something like that yeah friendly
chemists because friendly chemist was
blackmailing uh what is this guy cause
some sort of pirate I forget what he
calls himself uh yes dread pirate
roberts ah is what he calls himself so
this dread pirate roberts or dpr calls
that a hit on this guy and you know
apparently he really was killed but
there's no record of this guy getting
killed
oh whatever anyway so that that story
came out and it was all bad i'll put
these links in the description this is
also like his uh you know the whole
complaint thing on this guy like the
official stuff here so so there's that
like it just kind of gets a bad rap
purely because of like a lot of the
people that use it are criminals and
also there's obviously a lot of
speculation you know going around it
next in the last video i showed you guys
how merchants would actually like
Bitcoin because it can't be charged back
and volatility really isn't an issue for
the merchant fees are cheaper that said
that is all fine and dandy but where the
merchants risk declines here the buyers
risk goes up so businesses like paypal
are set up this way like to make it you
know a lot of buyer protection because
that buyer protection encourages more
transactions more business to take place
so bitcoin isn't worried about the risk
of the transaction because the seller
takes on that risk not paypal and not
the buyer so this obviously makes more
business happen and more money made for
paypal so but i can also personally
attest that I've made some purchases
online knowing that like well I don't
really trust this website but if if if
it's a scam it's super easy to get my
money back over paypal so I I find
myself making more purchases by a paypal
to websites that I normally wouldn't
like I wouldn't buy some stuff like via
Bitcoin they like well I might not get
my bitcoin back so this makes um Bitcoin
kind of even though it's a bonus for the
merchants and even though like
everyone's like Oh nobody will ever
accept that because of the volatility
well that's not the problem the problem
is the buyers the buyers aren't
protected and so that kind of
discourages buyers but at the same time
as long as you have a reputation and a
reputable website you know you can do
both you can accept paypal and Bitcoin
you know you can do stuff like that too
so that kind of pores in the next one
the biggest downside of bitcoin is just
purely its lack of forgiveness right so
it can't be reversed so this is part of
just it not being regulated so it can't
be reversed but while that's a bonus in
some respects it's a negative in other
respects there's no undo button and
there are ways to kind of mitigate this
kind of risk you know of screwing up or
losing your wallets or whatever but it
requires a lot of responsibility and
also with this Bitcoin makes itself a
target for theft as well so that this
means both you and any exchange or other
online wallet that you use is a target
for theft and let me find what I'm
looking for I think it was maybe this
one yes the Bitcoin of the great Bitcoin
bank robbery um this was one of those
things let me like it's clue on this one
hopefully I can get the name I want to
get the name of the bank I can't
remember what the name was but like
everybody feels like linking to each
other like oh we got the information
here ah ok trade fortress that was the
right one so it was a bit coin bank
called trade fortress and so um the
story is that 1 million dollars worth of
bitcoin was stolen from the bank but no
one can really prove whether or not it
was this kid that stole it or if it
really was theft and if it really was
theft there's no way to find the thieves
and actually punish the thieves great
hopefully then just kill everything
anyway so you can't really find out
who's doing these these steps so so you
and the exchanges become a target for
the stuff because you can take the money
and run away and there's really no way
to come after these people now since we
landed on this page I was just going to
make this kind of the last thing but big
updates like this like china bars at
bart its banks from doing bitcoin
transactions so no longer can can the
china banks actually work with bitcoin
the you know chinese people can but the
banks cannot so that was kind of big
news because china's
I think at the time China was the number
one market actually for Bitcoin that was
where the most Bitcoin growth was
actually occurring so that was kind of a
hit to Bitcoin itself when they did that
and then also just recently the New York
was basically they released this
statement saying you know hey we're
looking into the possibility of
regulating Bitcoin but they don't really
say too much else about that it was
mostly just like an it was like it was a
notice of inquiry so not really much
there but still the possibility for them
to continue trying to put sanctions on
bitcoin is always a possibility the next
thing was also Bitcoin mining is kind of
a risk because it's profitable to do
Bitcoin mining but sometimes most of the
time it's inefficient actually in the
old days you know people would infect
your computer to use its performance for
maybe DDoS attacks and clicking schemes
or something like that well there might
be after maybe your personal information
these days and it's already happening
people are using your computer with
Bitcoin mining Trojans and they mine
Bitcoin on your computer so here's an
example of one this company that is a
gaming company find a million dollars
because they were secretly using players
computers to mine bitcoin now I don't
think it was this one but I remember
reading another article where it was
just in the terms of service right that
you accept that they said hey we're
going to use your computer to mine
bitcoin and that's totally legal or at
least I want to say it was ruled to be
totally legal so that could totally
change so it just depends but so don't
think that you know just because you
have some sort of software that you can
do this but it is kind of legal and also
you know in the form of
microtransactions and also like freeware
right this this is a form of freeware
like hey you want to use my product you
don't have to pay for it but you have to
mine it so so even though like this was
secretly using it and that's bad but
that also does kind of give you the idea
that it does open the door to Mike a
form of microtransactions where you just
use our product and while you're using
it you have to
secret or not secretly you have to mine
bitcoin like while you're using our
product stuff like that so there is you
know even though that's kind of this is
kind of sad to see but at the same time
this sort of thing probably can become
the norm and become part of freeware
even though that's not necessarily free
but it's a sort of freeware where you
don't have to pay for it actually so
anyways those are just some of the
downsides to Bitcoin I think the two
biggest downsides that I are going to
hinder Bitcoin overall and really just
the one is the lack of you know
reversibility and a transaction so this
means that buyers aren't protected and
then also it's just kind of opens the
door for a lot of theft to occur you
know especially because you can it's not
totally anonymous but there's things
that you can do to make Bitcoin
completely anonymous or at least very
difficult for someone to track much more
difficult than stealing money from a
bank or another person or whatever so I
think in the long term that's going to
be something that people have to kind of
hash out whether or not they're willing
to take the unregulated nature of
Bitcoin and make that trade you know and
decide that they want unregulated for
increased risks elsewhere and I think
that's something that you have to think
about yourself as well because it is a
serious decision to make but anyway
those are just some of the downsides to
Bitcoin I'm sure there are ton another
small ish downside is how its produced
it's not very environmentally friendly
way to generate a currency and then also
just like the banks have to run a bunch
of computers to process transactions
even once all the bitcoins are done
being created I want to say it's 2140
it's either that or 20 40 but i'm pretty
sure it's 2140 that all of the bitcoins
will be completed and then it's like
well what do people do after that well
after that you you could just get paid
the transaction fees and that'll be what
mining bitcoin is all for you know just
to keep the network going and the
transaction fees going
and the other curiosity is how big the
blockchain will be by that time because
that will only continue getting bigger
so that there's a few thing that'll have
to come into consideration in the future
to like what happens is that you know
anybody that you know download some of
this Bitcoin stuff now like Bitcoin I
think cutie like the full Bitcoin thing
you have to download I forget what the
size of it is right now like I swear it
was like two or three gigabytes or
something worth of you know blockchain
information as as the as more and more
people start getting on board and there
are more and more transactions taking
place you're going to find that block
chain is going to grow really fast and
get pretty big so that's kind of an
issue to consider but I've read a few
things that have kind of gone about that
maybe we'll talk about that more in the
future but that but I think that yeah
the biggest the biggest issue is just
going to be this this lack of
forgiveness and non reversibility is
going to be the issue so anyway that's
going to include it I'm sure I missed
some things that are bad if you want to
comment below and add some more things
that are bad with Bitcoin do feel free
anyway as always thanks for watching
things for all the support the
subscriptions and the donations and
until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
