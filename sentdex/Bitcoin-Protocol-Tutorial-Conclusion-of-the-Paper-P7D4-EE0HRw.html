section of the Bitcoin protocol paper
the conclusion this is not gonna be the
end of this series I know a lot of you
guys were like oh yeah nope don't worry
there are a lot of implications that
come out of this paper and mostly the
protocol that aren't directly addressed
so I do plan to address at least some of
those with that let's go ahead and
tackle this conclusion we have proposed
a system for electronic transactions
without relying on trust we started with
the usual framework of coins made from
digital signatures which provide strong
controls of ownership but is incomplete
without a way to prevent double spending
to solve this we proposed a peer-to-peer
network using proof-of-work to record a
public history of transactions that
quickly becomes computationally
impractical for an attacker to change if
honest nodes control a majority of CPU
power the network is robust in its
unstructured simplicity nodes work all
at once with little coordination they
don't need to be identified since
messages are not routed to any
particular place and only need to be
delivered on a best effort basis nodes
can relieve and rejoin the network at
will accepting the proof of work chain
as proof of what happened while they
were gone they vote with their CPU power
expressing their acceptance of valid
blocks by working on extending them and
rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to
work on them any needed rules and
incentives can be enforced with this
consensus mechanism and that ends the
paper quite possibly the most powerful
line is in this last paragraph and it's
the very last line of any needed rules
and incentives can be enforced with this
consensus mechanism referring to one CPU
one foe this is really what opens the
door to pretty much anything including
bitcoins evolution so changes to the
Bitcoin protocol can be made that the
Bitcoin protocol is just open-source
code so someone can edit that
code and pass it along and so long as
the nodes support it it will pass most
importantly the combination of rule
changes is what's voted on not you know
when it necessarily just be one rule at
a time and you wouldn't yeah you like
couldn't piggyback rules on each other
like we do with laws today if nodes
don't support it it simply won't pass
simple as that one CPU one vote this
also has some implications because it's
not one person one vote
it is CPU power therefore you could
assert that this voting system favors
the wealthy who can afford to buy more
CPU power my response to that is that
the wealthy who are indeed supporting
the network with their money should and
should get that extra voting power and
also there could be wealthy people who
choose not to support the network as
much and when you get that voted voting
power also I think it's important not to
get too tied up here as you're probably
viewing like this idea of a wealthy vote
being able to overpower middle-class
vote in terms of you know sheer money
and I think you're viewing the world
through the glass of our world today
you're framing it around our current
world where this very you know income
inequality gap with you know the richest
people holding the most money in the
world is really the result of corrupt
politics because politicians are people
and people are easily fallible and
misrepresent the people who voted them
to get into office and represent them
there are multiple reasons today why the
wealthy have so much of this aggregated
power and wealth today but quite a bit
of it is the direct result of greed and
corruption within politics so if you had
a clean voting system where everyone
truly does have a say and laws aren't
piggybacked on each other and we don't
have to rely on someone to do what they
said or be transparent the actual system
the system in an inequality in just the
whole you know ecosystem of the
structure will be completely different
and it would be extremely fair and as
far as the wealthy you know having more
of a vote let's say
I think that would be better seen as
people who participate most in the
network get the most out of it because
wealthy people can use their wealthy
your their money to do other things and
other forms of business and stuff so if
they're choosing to do it and work with
the network then they're really actually
participating more in the network so
they do get more of a vote because
they're a bigger part of the network but
more on the possibility of that in a
future video since I would like to cover
some of the other things that Bitcoin
has brought as a possibility into this
world so a lot of really interesting
concepts mostly based on the protocol
not necessarily money because Bitcoin as
money is really just the first medium
that is exchanged over the Bitcoin
protocol but you can exchange anything
over the Bitcoin protocol contracts
money cars whatever you can do it
businesses anything anything can go over
this protocol and this protocol can be
used for any mode of transfer and any
voting so anyways congratulations on
making it to the end I hope I've been
able to help those of you who cared to
learn more about Bitcoin in the Bitcoin
protocol if you have any questions or
comments leave them below as usual
thanks for watching thanks for all the
support in the subscriptions and until
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
