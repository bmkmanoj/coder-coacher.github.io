in stock indicators tutorial within
Python next few videos are gonna be
discussing this term right here a rune
and the indicator it was developed by
two sharks Shawn Dave back in the
mid-90s and Arun is Sanskrit for
literally meaning dawn's early light so
if that doesn't give you an idea what a
rune is here we go it's going to
determine whether or not it's stock is
trending and then that trend strength if
it is and the calculation for Arun is
pretty simple and this is one of the
more simple indicators that we're going
to even be covering and so to calculate
it it's going to be there's going to be
two lines here and you're going to be a
room up line in the Arun down line your
rune up line is gonna be time frame -
how long since the last high / that time
frame times 100 so it's kind of like a
percentage of how long and that
percentage is gonna be of whatever time
frame you choose so you can choose
anything you need to choose at five you
can choose a ten day or something like
that but the idea here is how long has
it been since the last high price right
the last highest price so I wouldn't
necessarily recommend you use something
as short as like a five it's probably
better to use like a fifteen to twenty
something plus and then the down is
basically the exact same thing only it's
just for how long since the last low so
with this indicator you could actually
forget about dividing by the time frame
times 100 for the percentage thing you
could just leave it and the indicator
looked exactly the same but this is just
kind of a way to normalize it if you
wanted to compare it to maybe you wanted
to compare it to another chart and still
display the Aroon line so yeah you can
just keep that in mind now finally
that's pretty much it now I'm gonna show
you guys a few examples including you
know what we're going to be doing with
this suddenly bring up the charting
application here and so now we'll just
pick something and we'll do we'll do
Apple first and here it is and you just
drag it over here and fit it
okay so here's an apple and down here is
our rune we're using it 20 time period
so it's 20 days although it's probably a
little bit more than that so our time
frame or the stock here is 10 years so
it's probably more like 60 days but
anyway so as you can see the idea here
we've got you know the a rune up line is
this green line the room down line is
this red line so every time you know
this trend starts trending up I mean
this thing the irune called it instantly
here right as that new high was
announced and then it keeps hitting new
highs so it continues trending up and
then you can almost see here where it
kind of pops down a little bit there and
so the rune down is kind of coming up
but we're still you know we still have
no crossover still had no crossover we
didn't even have a crossover until this
point here which you know is right here
and it did trend down sure enough and
that crossed back over again here and
didn't cross over again until really
here and then it continued going up and
then we finally had a you know a nice
strong downward and sure enough it did
go down so honestly for the simplicity
of this indicator I was pretty surprised
I've never actually used the aruna
indicator before I decided I was going
to do a tutorial video on it and pretty
interesting indicators say the least you
don't really hear too much about this
one or at least I didn't what maybe
that's just Apple right so let's go
ahead and let's look at it a couple
other ones so we'll do let's do a eBay
eBay has done a lot of fluctuating at
least recently it's like year to date
beta so you can see how eBay has been
doing this year so again you can see
here where we've got a definite uptrend
here sure enough it calls it at about
here and then says you know hey you
might want to leave right about here and
then again it says you might want to
leave right about here and sure enough
you should have left then signal you
here but then told you didn't nevermind
really a little bit after so like here
anyway down trend here uptrend there
sure enough I mean it's calling these
trends pretty well which again I'm just
pretty surprised I didn't have too much
faith in this indicator when I was
looking at how you calculate it
I should have let me go back here this
yeah so like if you were looking at a
shorter time frame this is an example
where you know you might want like this
would be just under year-to-date and
we're using each little thing is about
three days so to give you an idea here
let's uh plot let me plot up a one-year
of ebay will keep twenty and see how
that looks so let me close out of this
and edit the time frame here for us so
here is still an around twenty only
we're considering the one years data so
it's every day right and so as you can
see here with a highly volatile stock
you're kind of getting late signals
right so you're getting signal that it's
an uptrend here and you're getting
signaled that never mind here and then
you're getting signals uptrend again
here at the peak of this stock and so on
so again I'd like to use eBay because
eBay is like one of the most vol to like
up down up down up down up down stocks
like this year-to-date at least that
everybody knows about and so that's a
good example where as you can compare
this to maybe a company like Tesla who's
just only recently started coming down
but for the most part was just an
uptrend the whole way it was actually
quite accurate so for it for I would say
you know a long-term investing is
actually a pretty decent pretty decent
indicator right because here in this
scenario with a nice level non highly
volatile stock Newton's a year that
indeed if you would have made your money
to trade it up with Tesla but of course
Tesla was going up the whole time but
you can see where des loads going down
here and if you were warned of that you
know really right here which is quite a
good warning because you know the
crossover the limit average was pretty
late as well so later than this anyway
that's that with this this roon
indicator in the next video what we're
gonna be talking about is actually
programming this roon indicator into
Python and then after that we're gonna
actually graph it up just like this so
you guys can play with it yourself and
see what you think
so anyways stay tuned for the next video
as always thanks for watching thanks for
the support of the subscription
and until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
