parallel programming in super computing
tutorial video in the last video you
guys were shown how you can use if
statements with your parallel
programming or supercomputing and MPI in
this video I'm going to show you guys
one more command and some simple math
that it's gonna do by node based on this
new simple command so with that let's go
ahead and get started
so here's another blank document and
again we start with the same thing so
we're gonna say from MPI for pi import
MPI and then again comm equals MPI comm
underscore world rank equals comm rank
so we're just gonna make some shorthand
here and now we're going to introduce a
new bit of information I suppose and
that's gonna be size equals calmed
outside so this is gonna return this how
many nodes are in this system so later
on you can use some conditional
formatting keep saying conditional
formatting it's not really it's like
conditional setup I guess based on how
many nodes are in your total network and
then you can can you can reference size
so instead of hard-coding in like you
know we have 64 nodes node you know 1 4
9 and 12 do blah blah blah or whatever
you can just reference size and split
things up based on size so you don't
have to go through and edit it so
anyways with that we're gonna just do
some simple stuff we'll just a print
rank and that's gonna be rank print a
node count and that's gonna be size and
then finally just for kicks will print 9
^ rank plus 3 so we should see rank 0 be
9 ^ 3 so like 729 I think and then we'll
see rank 1 be 9 ^ 4 which is a number I
don't know so save that and let's go
ahead and move this
however type it twice if you're typing
these I'm using a sappy though okay so
come over here hit the up arrow and okay
a 64 - okay so we'll run it and sure
enough rank zero node count total
obviously is to 729 which I got rights
thank you I will take my cookie whoever
wants to give it rank one node count 265
61 I'll give my cookie to whoever knew
it that was and so that's it so now
you've been introduced a new command
which is size which you can reference
later on to do a lot of a little bit
more dynamic supercomputing so that's
gonna conclude this tutorial video nice
short sweet the next video what we're
gonna do is I'll give you one more new
command and that's going to be how to
get the name of the the processor
basically and then also I'll show you
guys how you can send and receive data
so that's pretty exciting so hopefully
you guys are excited for that stay tuned
to the next video as always thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
