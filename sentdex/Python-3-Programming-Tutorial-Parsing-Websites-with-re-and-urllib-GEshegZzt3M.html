3 tutorial video in this video we're
gonna be doing is combining two of our
standard library modules and using them
to parcel website so we're going to be
using URL Lib and re for regular
expression so with that let's go ahead
and get started so we're needing to
import a URL Lib dot request and we're
also gonna import URL Lib dot parse
finally we're going to import our e for
regular expressions and we're ready to
go
so first we're going to define our URL
that we want to visit let's go ahead and
visit HTTP colon slash slash Python
programming dotnet next we're going to
say our values so we're going to do a
search on python programming on that so
our values whoops we dictionary is s
will be equal to basics Baysox basics
and then we'll say submit : sir
okay so those are the values that we're
going to parse in and a post now we're
going to say data equals URL Lib parsed
URL and code and we're going to encode
values I'm going to say data equals data
died and code utf-8 oops and then we're
going to say rec for request equals URL
Lib dot request dot request capital R
and we're going to make the request of
URL passing through data and then the
response will be URL Lib dot request dot
URL open request just as a quick aside
I'm not really explaining any of these
stuff that we're typing because we've
already covered the URL Lib tutorial so
if you feel lost here if you're starting
on this video or something and you don't
know
I'm doing what I'm doing check out the
URL live tutorials for Python 3 so
response now RESP data for response data
equals rest read and then what we want
to do is we're gonna use regular
expressions so if you remember last time
what this printed out we could say print
rest data so we can save and run that
let's make sure that works first I
suppose anyway so we got all this junk
right um but within this junk there's
some normal stuff we don't really see
anything here at least so far for me I
don't really see it but here we go here
we got some math basics blah blah blah
here's a paragraph tag finally anyway so
here's a paragraph I'm not I'm not
seeing the opening paragraph tag but
you'll have to take my word for it
there's an opening paragraph tag
somewhere anyway the idea is we want to
parse out paragraph data so generally in
HTML people have you know header 102 for
like big titles and then name or maybe
even had a three then maybe subtitles
had a three out of four maybe header two
and then the content is almost always a
paragraph tag just a you know your
typical like this make some space you've
got a paragraph tag like that then
you've got content content content ba ba
ba ba and then you have a closing
paragraph tag now depending on the site
sometimes this might be slightly
different but usually it's paragraph tag
of some sort you just might have this
parse like this or something hmm anyway
moving on so that's what we want so we
want to use a regular expression that's
going to say hey I want to parse
everything between paragraph tags so
what we're going to say is paragraphs
equals read up find all and what we're
going to do is regular expression and
the regular expression we want is it's
going to be paragraph tags so like I
said if you want to search for specific
text you would you can just type in that
specific text and so so far we're not
using any special character so we don't
need to escape anything
and then uh parentheses can't blanket on
the name there this is where the pattern
that we want so like if you want to put
let's see we'll put the closing
paragraph so basically we're saying
paragraph tag paragraph tag will be here
and then here is what you want to search
for so you put between these little
curly braces or curly braces parentheses
and put between these what what data do
we actually want to search for so like
what is the data we want to output
because so far we're saying nothing and
but it's like find something between
paragraph tags but we have to specify
what that something might be now my
little favorite combination to look for
just anything is a period asterisk
question mark okay so that basically
means find me everything between
paragraph tags and so if we look back at
what these characters actually mean the
period is basically the period is going
to say any character right except for
your new line the asterisk is 0 or more
repetitions so if there's 0 that's okay
and then anything more than that that's
fine and then so we're basically that
this applies to your period and then
finally the question mark which is match
a 0 or 1 repetitions so it's basically
finding anything between paragraph tags
and then only 1 0 or 1 repetitions of
that and then it will break because
that's the end of your paragraph and
then continue on so I just always like
when I'm parsing websites sometimes it's
not between paragraph tags might be
between something else but though the
combination of regular expressions that
I will use is always a period asterisk
question mark just because it works so
well so
what we'll do now is we'll say for each
P in paragraphs print each P okay so
let's save and run that and see what we
get and it's going to take a second to
pop up there it is oh man I think we're
a printing source code there hold on
yeah we printed the response data let's
go ahead and comment that out we don't
want to do that anymore so let's try
that one more time
you definite okay so paragraphs
redefined all great regular expression
but what are we looking in to here and
we're looking for it in RESP data you
need to convert this to a string because
it's not in string but anyways try it
one more time and now we get this right
so this is all of our paragraph data
okay so that's going to conclude the
tutorial of using URL live and regular
expressions to parse a website if you
guys have any questions or comments on
this feel free to leave them below as
