another Python robotics tutorial video
in the last video we programmed our
little car here to go forward and
backwards now we actually want to make
the car be able to turn maybe left or
right so that's the next thing that we
want to do so let's go ahead and do that
so to start let's do sudo nano and I
guess we'll just continue editing robot
to that pie so robot to pie enter and so
here's our code from before we've got
our forward and reverse and now maybe
we'll want to get some turns on so first
of all let's not go ahead and delete
these we don't need to run these anymore
we're confident that they work now let's
define a turn underscore left for time
frame one two three four our typical
initiation point is before and now we
want to begin so to turn left first
we're going to want to have seven true
so GPIO to output seven true now we're
going to want to have four left eleven
is true and really everything should be
true except for fifteen
so GPIO output eleven true GPIO dot
output thirteen true and GPIO to output
fifteen false and now don't forget your
time dot sleep for time frame and then
the thing we forgot before GPIO dot
cleanup actually for out the sleep and
they clean up really I guess what we'll
do is we'll run this one first just to
make sure it works
turn left one so in order for this to
turn left let's go ahead and save yes in
order for this to turn left
since forward is on screen to go right
to turn left would mean the closest
wheels to us must spin to turn left so
let's go ahead and run that so sudo
python robot to
pie and sure enough the closest reals to
us did spin let me look at it
yeah okay and they spun the right
direction so we're confident in that
that would make us turn left or at least
we expect that it would will we have yet
to really test it but we assume so
so now let's go ahead and get turn right
so let's go sudo nano robot 2 pi all the
way down to the bottom and let's define
turn underscore right time frame same
with our initiate and now everything is
you guessed it flipped so false false
false true
so GPIO dot output seven falls GPIO tau
11 Falls GPIO dot output 13 false and
finally GPIO to output 15 will be true
time sleep for time frame and GPIO dot
cleanup and that's our turn right
function so now what we can do is we can
actually just say instead of turn left
we want it to turn right for one second
exit save yes
overwrite and now the wheels farthest
from us to make it turn right so it's
been forward so sudo python robot 2 pi
hit enter and we did something wrong
obviously because the wheels closest to
a spun and they just spun in Reverse
okay let's go let's do sudo now robot -
hi
- right plus false false true let's see
eleven okay so eleven should be true and
I think fifteen should actually be or
false there so let's try that one oops
pie enter and now let's run robot
tune-up part again okay I think we got
it now yeah that looks to be the correct
direction so let's go back sudo and a
robot to dot apply and see what we did
wrong so left and then turn right
so the actual difference here is seven
is false eleven true thirteen and
fifteen or false okay so now we've got a
turn left to turn right forward in
reverse now the only other things that
we might want to have it would be some
sort of pivot and then after that we'd
want a way to actually control this
rather than having to pre type it in so
in the next video what we'll be doing is
we'll code in a couple of pivots so
it'll pivot instead of because like when
it turns like this it's going to have to
move forward that's going to have to
gain forward ground whereas with a pivot
in theory it would move just in place
and just spin in place so that's what
we're gonna code in the next video as
always thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
