new Python for Finance tutorial series
in this series we're going to hopefully
go over pretty much everything you could
want to know for using Python with
finance to start we're going to do
pretty basic things like how to actually
get data and work with that data for so
to begin we'll just use one company and
then we're going to get into okay now
let's work with data from the entire S&amp;amp;P
500 companies how do we kind of combine
all night data together how do we
visualize that kind of information how
do we start to analyze relationships
between companies how might we formulate
trading strategies and also how might we
analyze such trading strategies so we
have a lot of work ahead of us so let's
go ahead and get started before we get
too far here are some of the packages
that you're going to for sure need for
this series also I'm assuming that you
at least know the basics of Python
before you start this series if you
don't that's okay I've got tutorials for
that you just probably need to follow
them so you can go to Python program it
come down to Python fundamentals go to
the basics you don't need to do the
entire course if you look at the sidebar
that's the entire course all the way
down there you have to go all the way
down there but you definitely want to
get to how to install Python packages
and modules with pip so I think it's
like 11 or 12 or something tutorials
it's really not too much but that will
give you enough of the basics so you can
pretty much follow any tutorial not just
this one also of course you'll need
Python will be using actually I'm on
Python 3.5 I'm not updating the Python
3.6 just yet because it's not fully
supported by all the libraries I use but
you can feel free to follow along all
the libraries that we'll use here I
believe will support three six so a
follow along with whatever the latest
version is hopefully just make sure
you're using three or greater
Python tune you can try following along
there's gonna be a lot of little things
that you're going to change once you
have those things you're going to need
the following third-party module or
third-party libraries really you're
going to eat pandas pandas - data
readers so when you go to use pip to
install these you'll do pandas - data
reader William import
it's punished for because you can't have
a - you need that you're going to need
matplotlib you're going to need
beautiful soup for and I am sure there's
something else I'm forgetting but that
it should that should get us oh the
other thing will be scikit-learn so
scikit-learn
and then when you go to actually import
it it's SK learn so if you don't have
all those packages go ahead and pause
this get them a dependency of pandas is
just numpy I'm pretty sure if you use
pip install you will just Auto install a
numpy but you might need to install them
PI first anyway do that pretty sure
matplotlib is also a dependency so you
might get away with just doing these
things but anyway that's we're going to
be using without further ado let's hop
into it let's get some data so the first
thing we're going to do is import
date/time as VT in of daytime just so we
can set some starting and end dates for
the data that we're going to pull then
we're going to go from that punt live
the pipe lot routes plus we're going to
import matplotlib dot pi plot as PLT
then from matplotlib we're going to
import style so PLT
just lets us utilize pi plot which lets
us make plots charts graphs these sorts
of things we're importing style so we
can make our graphs look a little better
pretty much the number one rule in
finances at least have good-looking
graphs so if you're losing money as long
as your grass looked good everything's
good now we're going to import pandas as
PD and then we're going to import pandas
underscore data reader Godot reader dot
data as well if you're following along
you already have pain is installed
chances aren't you don't have pandas
underscore data reader this replaces of
the pin I forget if it's panda io data
or pandas data to IO but one of those it
replaces that so just it's another
library that you'll need regardless cool
that's what how we're going to actually
grab data from from the UM and Finance
API there's a lot of ways you can do it
this just makes it really easy because
it's going to return us a panda's data
frame
so what's pandas pandas is a really
really popular data analysis library
also just as a
quick aside if you want to learn more
about any of the things that I cover
here I'm going to be covering especially
matplotlib and pandas like really fast
I'm not going to be spending a lot of
time on them if you want to learn more
about them though you can just go to
python tournament data analysis and then
there's this data visualization and then
data analysis with pandas and there's
entire series i'm just about everything
you could possibly want to do with both
matplotlib and pandas so check those out
if at any point I'm doing something or I
went too fast or whatever feel free to
ask questions I'll do my best to help
you out chances are if it's on a
tutorial on I'd like a topic or a module
or something I probably already have it
so I got tutorial on it already that I
could link you to you can also just come
here and search ok so if you want to
know how to like moving map functions or
something like that for pandas for
example we type maps there's rolling
apply a mapping function for data
analysis with pandas you can find that
out so you can also use search but you
can feel free to ask if you're stuck
anyway moving this along what we're
going to do now is styled I use ggplot
it's just a one of the mini styles you
can use if you can if you want feel free
to look into you all the other styles
you could use now we're going to say
start equals actual over to ADT
date/time nor should I say the start
date is the year 2000 month of January
and the first of them once I'm going to
like copy this paste in say end is now
going to be 20
we'll just do 2016 12 31 so if you live
in the United States
this should somewhat for unto you this
one might not be absolutely clear but
yeah December 31st 2016
we like to not do things in proper order
now what we're going to say is we can do
DF DF is going to be short for a data
frame and what we're getting a data
frame from don't worry I'll explain the
data frame in a moment is web dot data
reader so web here which we're getting
from this what does a reader now we're
going to specify a ticker a ticker is
just a symbol for the company it's
usually somewhere between like three
five letters for a stock in this case
TSLA it's Tesla then we're going to say
where we're going to get it from we're
going to get it but just because
someone's going to complain about the
mixture of quotes we're going to get it
from Yahoo and then for what times
you're in say the start time and the end
time okay so that gives us data frame
the data frame you can think of a data
frame like a spreadsheet or something
like that so we're in some looks
hopefully pretty familiar to you if you
use spreadsheets that is and what we can
do is we can print DF head this is just
a really useful kind of debugging thing
that you can do so I'll press f5 to run
that and no module called map poll lot
of Lube let's fix that mat up that's not
a fix mat plot Lib let's try again let's
try again beautiful so what we have here
is a nice data frame just making sure
you can see that so so what DF dot head
does for us is it just prints by default
the first five rows in our data frame
you can change it there you could say I
want six so you could pass six and
you'll get six six rows instead okay
that'll give you the first ones you can
also get two last ones with DFS tail so
as you can see we get data all the way
up to December 30th okay so you can do
that now what was I gonna point out okay
yes so so these are your columns open
high low close volume and adjusted
clothes adjusted clothes is adjusted for
what's called stock split this happens
when a company decides their price maybe
is too hyper share they say okay every
share is now two shares actually so
let's say you have one share of Apple at
$1,000 now they're going to say okay you
actually have two shares of Apple of
$500 well historically to the data like
if you were to go through that
historically suddenly price would go all
the way up to $1,000 and suddenly it
crash to 500 so we have adjusted columns
this one only has clothes a lot of data
will have adjusted open high low and
close but this is adjusted for stock
splits over time Tesla as far as I can
think right now does never never had a
stock split yet but like Apple has
and so on and coming in to do it because
most people can only buy a single share
increments of single shares so a
thousand dollars kind of precludes a lot
of people from being investors in that
company so many ways that's just a
really quick introduction to pandas and
bringing in data in the next tutorial
what we're going to talk about is a
little bit more on input-output because
it's not necessarily always going to be
the case that you're going to be using
the Yahoo Finance API maybe you've got
your own spreadsheets or whatever and
then also we're going to just show a
really simple way to actually graph this
data and all that so if you have any
questions comments concerns whatever up
to this point please feel free to leave
them below otherwise I'll see you in the
next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
