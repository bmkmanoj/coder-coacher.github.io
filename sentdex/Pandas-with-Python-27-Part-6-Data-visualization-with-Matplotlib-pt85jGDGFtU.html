another Python and panitch tutorial
video in this video we're going to talk
about how we can actually graph with
pandas so pain is actually really good
at intuitively plotting your data so if
you're familiar with doing matplotlib
and all of that with some of my other
videos sometimes especially when you
involve dates it can get kind of
difficult to plot but with pandas it's
actually quite simple so anyway with
that let's go ahead and I guess we don't
really need this stuff anymore but we'll
need it a little bit so obviously bat it
there but anyway to plot we're going to
go ahead and import mat plot live that
pipe lot as PLT for folks who are
following along with ipython notebook
you actually don't need to import this
we just have to import it here so we can
do plot show otherwise the plot never
shows up but pandas actually does this
entirely pandas has math lot live
built-in to it so when you tell pan is
to plot it will plot and if you were in
ipython notebook it would show it to you
but if you're not you have to call plot
osho so anyway if you're on ipython
notebook you don't have to do this I
it's funny a lot of people use pandas
with ipython notebook because to them it
helps them develop faster and also test
things faster and save settings and all
this I sort of understand that but at
the same time I develop much slower with
ipython notebook simply because every
input produces output and this is very
annoying but anyway just as a note if
you're on ipython notebook you won't
need to do that moving on oh let's get
rid of all these prints here we do that
we can leave everything else though I
mean we can leave the definition of 100
moving average and all of that and to
plot it's actually super simple you can
do something as easy as and in fact
actually I changed my mind
let well I will leave all there we can
do it's as simple as this dff plot so if
you had a data for
and it only had data in there that you
really wanted to plot all in the same
chart it's as simple as doing DF dot
plot and then we could do PLT show might
take a second but probably not too long
I think it's that much data right and
here is our plot now there's a couple of
problems doing it this way is one we see
clearly this purple line what is that
well that's volume because that's our
largest value so we plot it everything
on the same chart and so the biggest
thing is volume as you can see with our
exponent here but all the data is
actually plotted here we could probably
find it if we zoomed in a lot for
whatever reason it zoom in there keep
going
go it's looking better looking better oh
look at us anyway so you can't just plot
it so simple to plot look really quick
but another thing that you can do is
instead of saying say DF dot plot the
other thing you okay a couple things one
you can ply doing like say for example
you want to do PLT PT dot plot and then
you could plot data in here so you could
say DF um 100 ma and that should
actually work just fine let's try it
real quick
right and so it plots the 100 moving
average but you'll notice down here it
doesn't have a date there and so that's
kind of a bummer and so you can plot but
this is using the typical matplotlib
right to plot where instead we can use
pandas to plot and pans is smart it's
intuitive so what we can do instead is
we can do something like this D F and
then we could say just let's say we just
want to be closed if not closed dot plot
empty parms
save and run that and now look at us we
have dates at the bottom and again if
you have not followed my other tutorials
or if you have you know that's pretty
nice that you didn't have to do any date
formatting it just does it for you so we
can zoom into spots and it kind of gives
us the actual day and all that now it
doesn't get any higher granularity just
simply because our data isn't it just
the highest it gets us by one day so we
have our day data so that's how we can
do simple plots if you don't know much
about matplotlib real quick to get back
to the original screen you just hit this
home button to go back to the previous
screen you can do this this back arrow
and then back to the other one forward
arrow this is so you can drag the whole
thing around and this is so you can zoom
into a spot and then finally this is to
configure if you have a bunch of
subplots sometimes the spacing is funky
so you can just play with these this is
area from the top right bottom left this
won't change anything here cuz we don't
have any subplots but that's you know
space in between other two sides so with
space and then h space for head space
but again we don't have subplots but
anyway if you're not familiar quick
run-through about those options so
anyway we'll close out of this and so we
can see how we can plot clothes now the
other data that's pretty similar to
clothes or you know at least of the same
scale is close we have close hops that
capitalize it hi
whoa open and then we did just to find
100 ma so we might as well show 100 ma
so we can save and run that now wait for
it
oh something's mad what did we do
Oh big dummy okay it's gotta be a list
within okay so put your brackets around
one more time there we go beautiful plot
super fast no issues of loading now let
me show you guys something else that we
find nice I believe that this would be
pandas matplotlib version only if you
just saw our little legend be-bopping
around very nice code sometimes the
legend gets in the way but as you can
see with this current version the legend
just is running away from our plots as
best it can sometimes that doesn't work
for you if you're just plotting normally
with matplotlib so it's actually really
nice to use pandas are their renditions
in their code of matplotlib now this is
probably matplotlib code i don't know
what code you can do for the legend to
make it run away like that that's just
nice because map or I mean pandas
understands that that should be the
default matplotlib does not so anyway so
that's it that's with just some quick
basic plotting with pandas it is super
simple to plot with pandas and so it's
just really nice to have the simplicity
there and yes so especially with the
dates so that's going to conclude this
tutorial just a really quick graphing
there's a whole lot of other things that
we can do with graphs a lot of people
want to do like candlestick graphing and
all that and if you're interested in
doing really fancy stuff I do have
tutorials on all kinds of fancy stuff
for graphing you can check those out if
you want otherwise you can just use this
basic stuff that's going to include this
tutorial on 2d graphing now in the next
tutorial I'm just gonna show you real
quickly 3d graphing I don't think that
pandas has 3d graphing built right in
because you have to import that
specifically from pandas I mean from
matplotlib but I'm going to show you
guys how to do 3d charting just in case
you want to so stay tuned for that if
you have any questions or comments
