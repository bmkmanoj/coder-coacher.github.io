video this video is also going to serve
as the first video in my Python 3
programming tutorial series though there
will be nothing more than just
information on Python 3 vs Python 2 in
this video and why you would you should
choose Python 3 video 2 will begin with
the downloading and installation of
Python 3 also I'm going to mention here
and again later on in this series that
this series is going to be geared
towards the complete noob for Python so
if you're used to Python 2 7 already
making the transition to Python 3 is
really not that difficult I will
probably make a PI to 2 pi 3
transitional video after I finish this
series but that's probably a little bit
away so on with the video
why Python 3 so throughout my time with
Python programming I've visited and
revisited the idea of Python 3 countless
times when I first started I that's
exactly what I did and I've always come
up with the exact same answer every time
Python 3 on the whole is not better than
Python 2 yet it has less support
documentation and libraries basically
all of the good things in Python 3 for
the most part not all of them but a lot
of them have actually been ported
backwards into Python 2 so more on why
that might must be really frustrating
later but anyways a few months ago I
watched a YouTube video of a
presentation about why one should choose
Python 3 it was something like trust you
know why Python 3 trust me it's better
something like that right and it was
given by an actual developer for Python
3 through the entire presentation now
given it's probably just the case that
because I'm not an expert or
professional I guess professional is a
bad word I am a professional but I'm not
an expert um through the entire
presentation I was still left not really
seeing any reason based on that
presentation and what was said in that
presentation I saw no reason to switch
right but instead I could I could really
sense like the frustration in this guy's
voice right the lack of adoption for
Python 3 is actually an interesting
topic of discussion right the story of
Python 3 could make like a nerdy Greek
tragedy movie or something seriously now
this stuff said you know I'm not
suggesting people move to Python 3 out
of pity that's not a very valid reason
or a good idea at all
but there are some good reasons why you
should move to Python 3 see Python 3 is
really the future Python 2 is not if you
if you stick with Python 2 and Python 2
only and everybody does this you're
going to be able to get away with it for
a while and then you'll find yourself
using Python 2 in a time where it's
comparable to using something like
Pascal today right
at the same time Python itself will
probably fall behind as a developmental
language or a programming language just
simply due to the lack of support and
community overall
you know Python and my honest opinion is
is simply the best language out there
it's it's very high level and yet it has
incredible power and due to its
high-level nature it's also very
simplistic it's just a great language
and it would be a shame to really see it
become outdated just simply because the
community was disinterested in moving
forward with the language and I you know
I really can't imagine how annoying it
must be for for the pi3 developers you
know that people just simply aren't
adopting the new language for but not
too great of reasoning in my opinion so
in the end the deciding factor for me to
not adopt Python 3 was the lack of
documentation in support right it was
when I was a noob to programming in
Python and I really needed that support
just as anybody new to any language
needs some sort of you need the
community in the support in order to
progress in that language right and I
looked at both languages and to me they
seemed equal right equal but the
community surrounding them was very
different in size so it seemed to make
sense for me as a noob to go with Python
2 7 and I believe that's a logic I think
that was a very logical choice and so
anybody else that's doing the same thing
I completely sympathize with why you're
why that is the choice at the moment now
that I'm someone that you know has had
this channel and
making all these videos on YouTube I
seem to be doing something right enough
to aware at least a decent amount of
people enjoy how I teach and I think
it's almost someone of my responsibility
to share and teach Python 3 at this
point this way maybe in the future when
you know someone does a search for
Python 3 versus Python 2 7 maybe they'll
find my video or maybe they'll find
stuff from people that I helped get
started or or you know whatever and in
Python 3 can actually start to grow you
know because for the most part right now
when you hear a Python 3 verse Python 2
discussion the differences are really
only geared towards I would say the
expert or at least professional Python
developer but I would argue most
professional Python developers couldn't
care less about these tiny differences
and then the main question of
performance is is PI 3 or PI 2 faster
they are pretty much equal all the way
down so there was in that in the video
from the guy and trust me Pi 3 is better
I forget the title but in that video he
does compare the you know the
performance and depending on the task
sometimes PI 2 is faster sometimes PI 3
is faster the differences are so my new
that performance isn't the issue so it
really comes down to a few just tiny
differences that at the moment are so
tiny that it just doesn't make sense but
I in the future if Python 3 is allowed
to continue growth and development
Python 3 will be the victor but if
obviously no one supports it then that
sort of stuff is never going to happen
and you won't have modules and all this
kind of stuff so back to you know a
video like like this guy though you know
by this time you know that video is kind
of geared towards at least you know most
likely an expert and and by that time
that you know PI 3 makes sense to the
expert the developer has already gone
through their noob stage and probably
did the whole Python 2 versus Python 3
decided PI 2 was the best start and then
got ingrained in their ways right and
then it's very hard to get them to
switch and a lot of people don't see a
reason to
bitch so here my goal is to offer a full
slew of beginner in in partially
intermediate Python tutorials all using
Python 3 right so my Python 2 7
tutorials will remain here I'm not going
to delete them or anything but I'm going
to be doing my best to offer the same
topics only in Python 3 and some modules
that are pretty popular in Python 2
still aren't available in Python 3 so we
can work on at least probably covering
at least one of those modules as far as
like how you could port them because
really porting them isn't that big of a
deal some of them are harder than others
but anyway this way hopefully you'll be
able to get through that noob and
intermediate stage of learning Python
and you'll be able to do with Python 3
so with that let's go ahead and start
python 3 as always everyone thanks for
watching thanks for all the supported
subscriptions
