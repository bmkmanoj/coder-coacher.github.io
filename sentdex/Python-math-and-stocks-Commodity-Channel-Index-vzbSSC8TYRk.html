hello and welcome to another Python
mathematics and Finance indicators
tutorial series in this video the next
couple videos we're going to be talking
about the commodity channel index or CCI
the commodity channel index was
developed by a Donald Lambert back in
the 1980s the idea of the CCI is to
measure deviations from a securities
mean or average price basically and it's
going to act as an oscillator and often
times it's going to be leading but it's
mostly there to indicate either
overbought or oversold scenarios like
our RSI and some of the other ones that
we've discussed also before we get into
the calculation CCI despite its name
commodity channel index the CCI is
really used with anything it doesn't
have to be commodities can be stocks
forex etc so the calculation of our
commodity channel index or CCI is going
to be TP and TP is going to equal
typical price and typical price is the
high plus the low plus the clothes / 3
so kind of like an average of those
three numbers then it's going to be
minus the simple moving average of that
typical price and the timeframe for that
simple moving average is at your
discretion then that top part of this
fraction is going to be divided by
usually people use a point zero one five
x the mean deviation but again you can
kind of play with this number as well as
obviously the time frame number let's go
ahead and get into some examples before
we start actually programming this let
me bring up our example chart here so
this is our charting application if you
want to know how to make it check out
our Python shorting stocks tutorial
series otherwise so here is apple or not
Apple ebay and failing it
here we go so this bottom one here is
our CC I generally if it's above the 100
mark that would consider it overbought
and if it's below the 100 mark oversold
but also you can just see that many
times it is indeed a leading indicator
as you can see here it starts going down
really before this one actually started
going down then again same thing here it
starts warning about you know the
decline pretty well in advance there
again here and so on so anyways not only
can use it for just overbought and
oversold you can almost use it for
trending especially if you supplied a
simple moving average of the CCI line so
that's kind of a repeating thread across
a lot of these oscillators is you can
throw on a simple moving average of this
line and then you can actually turn it
into a single signal line for trend
changes not just overbought and oversold
scenarios so it was a definitely an
interesting oscillator so now let's go
ahead and in the next video what we're
going to be doing is actually
programming this oscillator into python
and the video after that will actually
chart it up just like this chart is so
anyway stay tuned for those videos as
always thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
