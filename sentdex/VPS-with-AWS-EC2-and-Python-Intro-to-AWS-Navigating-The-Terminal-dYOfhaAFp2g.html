Amazon Web Services tutorial video in
this video what I'm gonna be doing is
acquainting you with the command line
here and getting used to working within
a terminal instead of your typical
desktop with folders and you can see all
this nice stuff so initially when you
start looking into maybe running your
own web server you look into this stuff
and how you know connecting via SSH
works and all that and this whole kind
of thing is just so intimidating they
probably just get scared away you just
don't want to deal with something like
that that's just that's just too
annoying right so some people either
just give up from there or they just
stick with something like FTP and a lot
of web servers are actually not even
well they don't even come with FTP
installed you can install it and then
there is a couple options usually that
you're gonna have to switch up to allow
for FTP transfers but really you should
just get used to working within the
terminal because you can do a lot of
stuff and it's going to empower you with
whatever server that you buy to do a lot
of cool stuff and at least with Amazon
Web Services I'm not really sure what
you're gonna do if you don't actually
you know use the command line so this is
just gonna be a quick crash course in
the various commands that you're going
to be using pretty much all the time so
with that let's go ahead and get started
so to figure out like where you are you
can type PWD and what that's gonna do is
it's going to output basically the full
path to where you are so I meant slash
home slash ec2 users like that's my
username right I'm an ec2 user so that's
gonna give you where you are now you all
there's also a command for where you can
go so you can do LS that's going to list
out all the directories that you can go
to in our case we literally have nothing
here that's because the server is just
is just brand new they give us a clean
server Plus this is my user file so
there's nothing here but there there are
plenty of things on this file or on the
server
all ready so to get there and kind of
see what else is here the other things
that we can do is you can change
directory so if we had a directory to
move into we could go CD and you know a
new directory or something like that
like say we have another directory but
we don't so to move back though you do a
dot dot and then sometimes you also see
does a dot dot slash and so on but for
just easing simplicity it's just dot so
now we've moved backwards and now we're
in remember we were in slash home slash
ec2 user now we moved back and now we're
in home so now if we do LS we see that
we have an ec2 user another thing that
you can do is you can list basically all
so you can do LS dash L a and that's
gonna list even hidden files and usually
they're hidden with a period in front of
them and then there's like files like
these like D rwx are honestly don't know
what those stand for I've seen them
before I remember doing a tutorial like
this from my PI I don't know what those
files are if you if you happen to know
feel free to leave a comment below but
we're not gonna mess with those but
anyway you can do that to see also like
hidden files and stuff like that
subsequently we can you know go back
again and then another thing you can do
this for quick access is you can hit the
up arrow and it gives you like the last
thing you type and you can continue
hitting the up arrow for all the things
that you've done so anyway we'll just
continue going back so we can see that
we can't go back any further so where
are we we've got all of these files here
and or folders rather they're actually
proper name is directories anyway so
that's that so that's how you can kind
of navigate and so you could be like ok
well I want to go back to homes of CD
home now we're in the home directory LS
c dec 2 - user and now we're back where
we started so that's how you just kind
of bebop around now let's say you
actually want to start doing stuff on
your server now if you're just you know
it's just you you could put stuff
wherever the heck you wanted to but if
you ever you know if you're gonna have
multiple people working on this server
sometime that make sense to keep
everybody's files underneath their
username
so we're gonna just assume that's the
case and we want to keep keep that
working so what do we do so if you want
to make a file making files pretty easy
there's two commands basically to make
files the first one is touch and that
just literally makes the file but I
honestly I never use touch because you
if you're gonna either you want to open
the file or you want to make you know
like a new file but the only time you're
going to make a new file you're probably
gonna edit it right so anyway the other
thing you can do so you can do touch and
then you can call it in a new file dot
txt right but I'm not gonna do that
we're gonna do Nano new file dot txt and
not only does it create it if it doesn't
exist it automatically opens it up and
your whatever editor you're using here
right so so with Nano being our editor
now we can do pretty much anything we
want you know example toes yeah and then
to exit you can see all of the commands
down here so control X like that up
arrow just means control X then it says
do you want to save your changes yes and
then as long as you always want to you
know save them to the same file just hit
enter otherwise you can change the name
and you've created that file now if we
tell s now we see a new file dot txt
exists and again if we nano into new
file dot txt it's still there and it
saved it for us now that we've done Nano
and what we can do there the other thing
that we might want to consider is maybe
we've started putting a lot of files
into ec2 user and now we're like whoo we
should make another folder or directory
and maybe store some files there so we
can start organizing all these files
that we've made so to make a directory
it's pretty simple it's just MK der and
it's obviously gonna make it either
wherever you say or you can specify a
path but if you don't know specify it's
just gonna make it right there same
thing with files of course so I think of
what we could call this I don't know
what make this this MIT this directory
called epic hit enter now we have that
with we LS we can see that we have this
EPIK directory and a new file dot txt
it's having a CD into epic and here we
are
now let's CD back out again and let's
say now we made this directory and now
we start we're like well we want to move
these files right we want to move them
into that directory so how do we do that
well it's pretty simple all you're going
to really need to do is you type out MV
and then whatever the file is so in our
case we want to move this new file dot
txt and then where do you want to move
it in our case we'll move into epic so
now I want to go LS you see we no longer
have new file dot txt but if we CD into
epic and then LS we see that we do
indeed have new file dot txt in there so
we've moved it into that file or that
folder rather now what if let's go back
to our user LS here and we have epic now
let's make the recycle or actually let's
call it trash LS now we have epic and
trash what if we want to move every epic
and its contents to trash well we would
do mV epic trash right so now we LS it's
not their CD trash and here we are we
see epic is in there so not CD back and
that's how you move folders around
finally let's do now del me dot txt and
we'll just exit we just brought some
random stuff in there yeah we want to
axe it so there's our file how do we
actually get rid of a file that we want
to get rid of well to remove them you
just do our m and then del mean dot txt
for example LS again in dummy text is
all gone what if we got make derp
delmy so we've made a directory called
delmy and if we want to get rid of what
if we want to get rid of that well to
get rid of the directory it's RM Durer
and then what directory in our case tell
me and now you can see it's gone so
that's going to cover the basics to
navigating the terminal and doing a lot
of you know basic simple tasks in the
next video I want to be introducing you
guys to Python putting up a script and
you know making a script and running
that script within the terminal and then
I'm also going to show you guys a few
key files and point out just a couple
things that I had mentioned earlier so
anyways stay tuned for those videos as
always thanks for watching thanks for
your support and your subscriptions and
until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
