our tkinter tutorial within Python 3
where we left off we have a window that
we can generate and looks like this and
we can resize it clothes minimize all
that and we can hit quit and we are able
to actually exit the window now what we
want to add really is on most windows
you have you know this like menu bar
here and you can hit file and then exit
so the exit button that we built was
mostly just for show of how you make a
button how you can event handle with
that button and it just so happens that
a quit button is one of the easiest ones
to program so that's what we've done but
really we're actually probably going to
more more likely want to have a file
exit so I'm going to go ahead and
comment these out and then what we're
going to do in this video is actually
make a kind of a main menu and have file
and exit in that menu so what else go
ahead and get started so we'll just
comment this quit button out we don't
really want there anymore and let's go
ahead and make our menu so this might
get a little confusing
I'd like to confuse myself on these
steps as well so sorry if I do that in
advance
so under our define init underscore
window self function here this is where
we're going to add our menu so our menu
is actually going to be a part of our
main window frame or main frame so
that's where we want the menu to be and
then we want to obviously you know put
all the little parts that menu on that
menu so the way it really works usually
as you kind of go not really top down
but maybe down to the top so so first
you define you know you're going to
define your - let's say you want a menu
bar that goes you can go file exit on
you're going to define the exit which
you're going to append to the file which
you're going to append to the main menu
bar which will be appended to the main
frame ok so it gets kind of sticky like
that to think of it that way but that's
pretty much the way it goes so let's go
ahead and get started so first we're
going to say menu lower case menu equals
capital and menu and then we're going to
say self dot master
what we're saying here is we're saying
this is the menu of the main window okay
though we're going to say self dot
master dot config and we're going to say
the menu here equals this menu that
we've just defined so we're defining
that the instance of the menu so far and
this is so we can start adding things to
the menu and then we can place the menu
on there now might get a little
confusing a menu capital m is a
reference to something that's built into
tkinter okay lower case menu is
something we're just making up so don't
get to confusions remember lower case m
menu is ours capital M menu is something
that is a part of tkinter also this is
probably bad practice but I can't think
of a better name than menu so we're
going to get away with that so stuff
that master um equal or self taught
master config menu menu so we've defined
the menu now we want to create our file
object right so when we go I guess I'll
just leave this down here for now so
when we go here we have to make
something that is this file button right
so we're gonna say um file equals
capital menu menu menu so it's a menu
file as part of our menu menu we're
going to say file dot add underscore
command and this command that's a part
of our file menu so like we hit file and
then we've got all these things here
right these are basically commands right
new file open recent files open module
class browser will save print exit
clothes whatever these are commands
basically so now what command do we want
to add well we're going to add label
equals we're going to add an exit okay
so that's kind of an integral part of
your file you know file quit file exit
and then we're going to say the command
for this so kind of remember our button
where we said you know our label was you
know whatever or command equals what and
so our command here is equal to self dot
client underscore exit so that's
referencing this function that we made a
while ago okay so that's our exit now we
want to add this we've got a command
added to file now we want to add file
to our menu so we're going to say menu
diet ad underscore cascade so this is
you like this is your cascade right you
file and it's like this cascade of
options so menu dot add cascade a label
equals file and then we're going to say
the menu that we're adding here right
the menu that we're adding to menu is a
five so this so as you can see we've got
menus and menus here so it's like menu
menu menu but anyway so menu equals menu
menu interesting so so we've added we've
got our exit we've got a file and now we
want to do is like let's say um we could
just we private like we could probably
get away with this for now so let's go
ahead save and run this lets see you if
we've screwed anything up so far okay
good so we've got a file you click this
we've got an exit you can hit exit
you'll probably get this little warning
here for killing the script but yes and
so we've got a file in our exit works
now what I like to do in a tutorial like
this especially we've got menu is it's
one thing to create like one little
button and then one thing that you can
do in that button but it's another thing
to get like add one more so this might
make a little bit of sense to most of
you guys but it might still be really
confusing so I think probably the most
helpful thing to do at this point is to
make one more menu item so the next item
that typically we have is an edit right
and here we have edit undo okay so why
don't we add an undo okay and edit undo
so we've got that and now what we want
to do is we're going to go back down
here so if you recall we've done
basically this is what we created for a
file button right and then from that to
that file button we added an exit and
what did that exit did right and that's
what we do with these three lines but
these three or these two are just
defining the menu where that menu goes
and all that and then as part of our
main window so now let's go ahead and
add edit so here we go edit a equals and
then
menu menu so it's part of our main menu
now we're to go edit dot add underscore
command label equals um undo okay so
we're not going to really have anything
to undo so I'm not going to add a
command to this but as you can see we've
got edit we add the command that we want
to edit because if we added at it first
and then tried to change it it wouldn't
necessarily you would almost be
displaying the edit before you've
actually made the change so it's kind of
like in in well I haven't really covered
matplotlib but if you're familiar with
matplotlib we've covered it in Python
2:7 anyway wait the way it works is
first you draw something and then you
display it okay so if you if you draw it
display it then draw some more you'll
have to read display ok you know dot
show you got to redo dot show in order
to see the difference ok so it's a lot
like a window where you want to make you
exactly what you want add it and then
show the window and it'll be there but
if you first add you know let's say file
to the window then you try to add to
file it works it doesn't really work
that way it's not a good idea to do it
that way so anyway edit add command undo
we're not gonna throw in a command
because we just don't have a command to
do and or at yet like literally good
Union add command to edit right but that
edit or bruise basically we're not
adding a command to undo so it's really
confusing when I say add command but and
then we're saying we're not adding a
command but whatever anyway edit the add
command and then we're going to say menu
dot add underscore cascade and then what
are we going to add the label is going
to equal edit and the menu is going to
equal um and though we're adding
basically so we can save that let's run
that and we get this right so we've got
file we can click exit we've got edit we
can go undo ok so now we've got these
two little buttons here and you can
basically see the pattern that we go
let's exit this you can see the pattern
that we go through to add buttons right
this is to add your button now we could
actually just do this right if we just
if you just simply wanted to add a
button right so none of these buttons do
it but say help lead to maybe a webpage
or something you could just do you know
something like this right and now you've
got the button but you don't actually
have anything that you know pops down
from that button um but we've got that
and so you can see basically how do you
add a button if you only have one option
it looks just like this just this little
three things now we could add commands
to the buttons so we could do something
like file um
maybe something like this so what if we
just added one more line label and
instead of exit we want to have save the
command we'll just leave as client exit
just for now just for example purposes
so we can save and run that and we've
got file and now we've got save exit now
personally hit save it's going to exit
so we'd want to you know change the
function but that's how you can continue
just adding things to your menus so
really making the making of a menu
object you just you know say where
you're going to put it you're going to
add commands for you know things that
you can do with that and then at the
time you're all done with that you add
that cascade to the menu okay so that's
