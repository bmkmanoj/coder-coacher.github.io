matplotlib 3d graph series in this
tutorial video we're going to be talking
about putting up three-dimensional
scatter plots and then also adding
labels to our plot color and plot a look
or feel or whatever you want to call it
with the first video in the 3d series I
just kind of wanted to keep it as basic
as possible and then as time goes on
we'll continue adding layers not only to
the you know because basically we're
going over different chart types and
then now we're going to start adding
stuff that is kind of similar like
you're going to have labels all across
and then the colors and the line type
and all this kind of stuff kind of
follows you no matter what you're doing
in the 3d plotting so that's kind of
what I'd like to do with this 3d series
so anyway with that let's hop right in
same things before we're going to need
from NPO underscore toolkits dot and
plot 3d import axes 3d and then the next
thing we need is import matte clock Lib
dot pop plot as PLT done next thing we
want to do fig a equals plot figure
nothing new new axis equals fig dot add
underscore so lot nothing new same thing
as before and then projection equals 3d
same thing as before there as well
now we're going to toss it up a little
bit the last time we what we did was XYZ
equals and then three arrays instead
what I'd like to do if since we're
having kind of long arrays I think that
it's better to do x equals an array y
equals an array and Z equals alright
since our data is so long but I would
you know probably in the at the end of
the day you're going to end up finally
doing like an XYZ and equals that numpy
array that we had done in the matplotlib
series prior to these videos so with
that this is just another way
think about doing it if you do have a
lot of data but chances are if you have
a lot of data you're probably um pulling
from a file or something like you're not
here and typing it in but anyway we're
just gonna I'm just going to show you
you know there's multiple ways to do the
same thing in programming and so it's
just good to show the multiple ways to
do it so anyway we're just going to make
up some data again if you still have
your data from before you can start
arranging it this way or you can leave
it the way you have it it doesn't really
matter you know something like that
okay so now we have what I believe to be
10 of each hopefully the next thing we
want and this will be a little different
it's going to be a X dot scatter or
scatter plot and then we're going to do
X Y Z to plot the next thing we have is
C for color and we're going to say the
color is going to be real red and then
now we have marker and this there's all
kinds of different markers and in this
case we're going to use the just a zero
for like a circular marker and finally
you can also set labels so we're going
to go ahead and do that so ax dot set
underscore and X label and we're just
going to call this x-axis and then the
same thing for the other ones let's just
copy and paste this saves of time so
this will be x y and z z Y and X so now
the next thing obviously plot show plot
shop go to shopping save we'll run this
over you know errors of course we had
errors ah we need to capitalize the D
it's actually three capital D or
dimensions let's try again all right
here we go and we have our plot let me
fit it to screen now you can see that
instead of like lines they're you know
scatter plots on the chart and the red
in circles and beautiful we also have
our x axis or y axes and our z axes
labeled here for us and
the other thing you'll note that I think
is pretty impressive again it took quite
a bit of coding is this visually it's
very hard for you to tell which plot is
closer this one or this one now if they
were the exact same red that is but
visually you know because this one's
obviously closer as you can see as you
turn it you can see it visually but also
when it's a static chart say you only
took an image of it you'd also know
because this is kind of faded a little
bit so it gives you the the really it's
an illusion that this plot is further
back so as we rotate you know you do see
that it it was further back it's still
further back and then as it comes closer
it's clear that okay now it's really
close so anyway um just a little subtle
things like that I just definitely
impress me I think that's really awesome
for this uh graphing is so it's just
such a simple little graphing program
and it's really lightweight so it's just
a great great program anyway um that's
basically it as far as making
three-dimensional scatter plots as
