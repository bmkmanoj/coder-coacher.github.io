3 basics tutorial video this video is
going to be covering the basics of at
least understanding classes in Python
for the most part I just want you to
understand how to like read and follow
along with what's happening in someone
else's class not necessarily to teach
you guys how to write really good
classes and all that the idea of class
our classes is to kind of encase a group
it's almost like a way you could use
classes instead of modules that's
usually the way I see people using it is
to save up almost like as if they were
writing like scripts like like people do
with Java let's say they have classes
and then underneath the classes there's
got other functions and it's just kind
of treated as if class is equal to a
module almost but anyway I just want to
show you guys how to follow them class
is really just a way of grouping things
together I suppose but you can do some
really neat things with classes and but
actually I would kind of consider
classes more of an intermediate kind of
thing I think at least understanding
them is good for basics so with that
let's go ahead an get started
one of the simplest things I can think
of to use as an example would be to like
create a class and make that class
calculator you have to put any
parameters here just colon and that's it
so class calculator so our calculator
class should contain obviously some
pretty simple things like what is a
calculator do well it's very basics a
calculator should at least add subtract
multiply and divide should be able to do
all of those things so we definitely
want our calculator to be able to do
that so let's go ahead and do that so
for addition we'll say define addition
and for addition we're going to say we
can only have two variables so for
addition we have XY and we'll say added
equals x plus y and then we'll do prints
add
okay so that's our definition but now we
also need this calculator to be able to
do subtraction so define subtraction and
again X Y and now what we do is we'll
say sub equals X minus y okay
then we'll go ahead and print sub
continuing ride-alongs we also need to
be able to do multiplication so define
multiplication X Y again :
and now we'll say mult equals x times y
finally we want to be able to do
division to find division X Y : and div
equals x divided by Y and print div okay
so now we've got our basic calculator
class all the things that are
encompassed within our class and let me
just push this up one a little bit and
now let's say we actually wanted to use
our class so an example of someone using
class would calculator you would
basically do the following calculator
die and let's say we wanted to do
multiplication calculator dot mol tip
education X Y we want to do 3 5 so that
would be how you call the multiplication
division of multiplication thinking like
division as in like a division of a
company anyway that's how you would do
multiplication within our calculator
class so let's go ahead and save it run
that and oh it just so happens we never
printed half molds will have all the
ones that we didn't do so if anyone
prints molds
okay now let's run it and sure enough or
multiplication gave us 15 now we can
call the other ones so calculator dot
addition
five two and that's going to give us a
seven calculator subtraction 10 9 10 9 1
you guys get the idea so that's
basically how you can kind of read and
understand a class like I said there's
all some other things that people do
with classes to give them quite a bit of
more functionality to them but for now
these are just kind of the basics of a
class on how to understand like what
people are doing when the huge classes
so hopefully that was helpful for you
