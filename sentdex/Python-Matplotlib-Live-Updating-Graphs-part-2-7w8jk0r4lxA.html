second part of the live updating charts
within matplotlib I know you're already
just itching to get these charts out so
sorry I made you guys look at
documentation pretty much nobody likes
it but you can find all kinds of gems in
there so with that let's go ahead and
get started we're going to need to
import a few things from matplotlib
first we're going to want to import PI
plot so we're going to import Matt plot
live dot type lot and PLT that just
makes it so we can instead of having to
write all of this out we just put peel
to my stuff and pour Matt plot live dot
animation as I guess we'll just do
animation we're only going to mention
this one time so it's kind of useful to
have the whole thing right now and then
finally we're going to import well we
don't we don't totally need it but we're
going to go ahead and import time anyway
just in case I want to sleeper so next
thing we want to do is we define our
figure just like always so big equals
PLT big year empty parameters there you
could specify figure size and some other
stuff in there but for now let's leave
it blank
now we're gonna specify ax 1 for axes 1
for now it's going to be our only axes
but if you're coming from any of my
other ones a lot of times you might have
a lot more than just one accidents so
anyway Figg dot add underscore subplot
and in here it's going to be a one by
one and obviously there's only one
option so it was a chart number one and
that will box there now what we need to
do is define our function here so what
I'm going to do is define animate and
within animate we're going to have a one
parameter which is going to be I or now
the next thing that we want to do is we
need to have somewhere that we're
getting data right so what I did is made
a sample file called sample text and let
me just bring that up in notepad
and here is our sample file so the it's
just a bunch of x and y's right so one
two two three three six four nine and so
on so if you don't already have one why
don't you go ahead and make one with a
right-click new makes them some sort of
text document and just put some sample
variables right on in there and then
just go ahead and leave it open because
then we're going to we're going to
reference this and then we're going to
edit it live and you don't need to make
it with a notepad plus plus obviously
you can make any any text editor really
so once you've made up your sample file
of X's and Y's the next thing that we're
going to do is finish up what we were
doing and come over here and we're going
to say pull data equals open and within
here we're going to do I called mine
sample text text so sample text text
with the intention to read it and let's
go ahead and read it next we're going to
say data array equal fold they did that
slit my new one and then let's specify X
R or X written and then why are or
wiring subsequently now or new is for
each line in data array I would just I'm
going to throw in this little if
statement here you don't have to put
this but a lot of times text documents
are going to come with like an empty
line so I just throw like a quick stupid
if statement here like if Len each line
greater than 1 X we need at least two
variables here then we'll do the
following that way if you do have an
empty line it will will kill you so a
lot of a lot of sources will have empty
lines just because of like the way you
append a file usually end with a newline
and so that's why you always end up with
these extra lines but anyway if that is
the case X Y so X comma Y so this is
unpacking the thing here so it equals
each line dot split by a comma so this
makes two variables the first one will
be X that won't be Y so
as a xr4 x-rayed out of hand and then we
need to convert it to the manager
because right now it's a string and then
we'll do the same thing with y yr and
int x and that's it now we come over
here and we want to do is a X 1 dot blot
XR y R nothing else we can make pretty
colors on this stuff but we're going to
do that for now so that's our function
and there's going to be one more thing
added to that function but first I won't
do it
I just want to finish this for you guys
so then we're going to say an e for
enemy equals animation dot bump and
nation pay attention to the
capitalizations here and then here we
put big animate so this is the figure
right it's corresponding to this figure
up here so that's the figure that we're
putting in there the function we want to
pass through is this animate function
and then interval equals and we're going
to make this 1000 so the interval is how
often do we want to refresh this and
this is in milliseconds so this will
equal one second so every second this
will refresh and then what we're going
to do is plot that show so we'll save
that as long as we haven't had any
errors this will generate a graph and it
will change colors because of what we've
done so here's our graph and as you can
see it is changing colors on us lab just
looks so beautiful now the reason it's
changing colors is it's actually
redrawing a line over a line every
single time and what this is going to
eventually do is just brutal eyes up
your memory so the next thing that you
want to do is uh just so you can see
that it was really live updating I
decided to do that but what you want to
throw in here is x1 clear empty
parameters and that will clear the plot
so let's bring that up one more time and
now you see that it looks a little bit
better now and if I was to like let's
say we throw
oh I see what I did
he's weird a straight line anyway why
are a dot append you append why let me
close this out let's see that one more
time here
save that run it okay that's more of
what it ought to look like and we are
already running the clear so your line
probably looks like that because you're
probably not as silly as I am but so now
what we can do is we can bring the text
editor over here and since you don't
know that it's really live we can do ten
seven in our text editor hit save and
now you can see that the line updated so
then we do 11 500 and then now you've
changed again so anyway those are just
the basics and a real quick example of a
live updating chart so with that I'm
going to conclude this video as always
thanks for watching thanks for the
support of subscriptions and until next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
