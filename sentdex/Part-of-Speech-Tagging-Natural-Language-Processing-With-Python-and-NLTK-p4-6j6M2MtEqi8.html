part 4 or n ltk with python for natural
language processing tutorial video in
this video we're actually talking about
something I think is really cool and
exciting and that's part of speech
tagging so after this point we've talked
about pre-processing and stuff and and
part of speech tagging is pre-processing
but the other stuff was kind of man this
is cool there at least to me I hope it
is to you too so we're going to be doing
part of speech tagging it means just
what it sounds it's labeling the part of
speech to every single word in it
whatever you're feeding so usually it's
in a sentence but you might feed in
whole paragraphs if you want in so first
of all we're importing on CK mmm then
we're going to go from NLT cat corpus
lovely lovely corpus we're going to
import state Union so these are State of
the Union addresses by various
presidents over the last like sixty
years or something actually now it's
probably more like seventy years anyways
uh ltk is it Union is good and then from
mmm LT k dot tokenize import and we'll
use a different tokenizer throw you guys
for a loop or here's the Pumped sentence
tokenizer
so the punx I could set I can't just be
the punked sentence tokenizer is a sort
of unspecial e not sort of it is it's
unsupervised machine learning sentence
tokenizer learning yep tokenizer you can
train it if you want it's comes pre
trained but you can retrain it on other
stuff if you so chose we'll just prized
use the default one but I don't know
I'll show you guys probably how to train
it so maybe it won't and that's good
enough for now now we're going to need
to pull in actually we'll just keep on
CK because we're will do an else you got
POS tag so now what we want to do is
let's get the sample text and this will
be state underscore Union and then dot
raw so we're going to grab the raw text
for what Tet
we want 2006 from GW Bush dot txt that
will be fun now we're going to say the
custom sent
tokenizer so this is how you would go
about making your pump sentence sentence
tokenizer you're very very own so that
will be equal to Pumped sentence
tokenizer and we're going to kind of do
something Prussian normally always do
but this will be fine custom sentence
organizer is the Punk'd second set home
I guess I can I can't say this Punk'd
sentence tokenizer on sample text
especially you're training the Punk'd
sentence tokenizer on that text you can
bring through a different text see stay
the Union that should occur every year
so there should be train text 2005 there
we go
will be legit about this so a custom
sent tokenizer Punk'd sentence tokenizer
train text now we're going to say uh
tokenized equals um let's say tokenized
equals and that will be the custom sent
tokenizer dots tokenize of sample text
so much okay now let's go ahead and
start using some functions it's a fun
process contents okay so we're going to
try except exception as a here and for
now we'll just print out string e so
what we're going to try is gonna say for
I in tokenized
this is for each little element in the
tokenized
we're gonna say uh words V equals l TK
dot word underscore tokenize and we'll
do I so those will be the words and then
eggs now is the following and let's see
K dot POS on our score tag and that will
be words okay so now for AI then let's
go ahead and print tagged that should do
for hold on everybody settle down this
is the whole state of the game so we
might not want to do area before I and
tokenized this will be a sentence so
let's just do how this would be fine
let's do it full steam ahead
this might be a way to pay yeah that's
okay oh we're not processing the content
let's let's call this function first
find a full steam ahead everybody whoo
Oh
how long did George W Bush uh yeah pond
for the state there we go
okay we made it all the way to the
bottom awesome applause okay so let's
just I don't know uh you can go wherever
you want let's go to the top so
everybody can follow along so president
george w bush this gets these are nouns
before this is just too much
courageous JJ so actually that'd be a
good time to talk about what these
little meanings are okay so I'm looking
at him um like yeah that makes sense
y'all are probably looking at these
words like what knock it so it when you
do this part of speech tagging it will
take and create tuples of the word and
then the part of speech and instead of
writing them all out I'm just going to
go and copy and paste them for you guys
this come over here make some space and
paste okay these are your part of speech
tags so si si coordinating conjunction
and then like NN P is a proper noun then
you've got you know verbs so vbv be DS
past tense blah blah blah the only one
that's weird I think is our yeah our is
adverbs so when you see that you might
not like in your head like when I see
these like PRP obviously actually I
would say that's a preposition but the I
n is our preposition so no it's good
idea to have this around because you can
quickly confuse yourself as I just dude
so that's it so we can come back over to
our output here so now you can see okay
now yeah yeah and then fellow-citizens
today courageous blah blah blah so it's
courageous for example JJ adjective okay
so that was a success
good um served
let's see verb good good America good
got that so anyway you can go through
and look at all of them but for the most
part this actual part of speech tagging
is like hmm perfect it is nice it's
going to mess up from time to time
especially unlike do I think of some
good examples of when it messes up
definitely on some nouns like a lot of
times it's not going to recognize nouns
especially if you're reading like
Twitter so eventually we may or may not
use Twitter as a dataset I'm
contemplating using like streams from
Twitter and you'll find that a lot of
people do not capitalize they're persons
working so a lot of times they'll have a
person's name but it's under lowercase
and NL CK is like what is this so that
can be kind of a problem sometimes over
the most part it's pretty darn good
so that's part of speech tagging pretty
simple again most of what we did before
we even got the part of speech tagging
was just getting some data and getting
some example sentences plus I want to
show you the Punk'd sentence tokenizer
look at me same
and also loading in corporate like this
study Union Ron George W Bush again
we'll be talking more about cobras very
soon because this is probably one of the
biggest things that like I think
probably most people that have used I
don't see K don't actually like go and
look and see what they have in their
corpora because it's actually our corpus
it's actually a lot of really good stuff
in there
a lot of golden nuggets so to speak so
anyways that's it for par speech tagging
it's really quite simple really boils
down to after you've split by word you
can pass through the antique a part of
speech tagging now um now I will show it
to you yet when we get to chunking I'll
show you how you can display everything
that's really pretty so anyways that's
it for part of speech tagging if you
have any questions or comments concerns
whatever please feel free to leave them
below otherwise as always thanks for
watching thanks for all the support of
subscriptions and until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
