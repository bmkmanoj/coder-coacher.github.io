Lo and welcome to my tutorial on machine
learning and programming for the use of
Forex or stock trading and analysis with
the programming we're going to be using
the Python programming language
specifically Python 2.7 we're going to
be using Python mainly for its user
friendliness plus it's my programming
language of choice but it also makes a
good teaching programming language the
purpose of the series is to teach you
some of the principles to machine
learning back testing statistical
analysis and some programming not to
influence your trading decisions this is
my verbal legal statement this video
series is for educational purposes only
and is not an offer or suggestion to
deal with any financial markets how you
use this information is completely your
responsibility and I'm not to be held
liable okay sounds good
our goal here is to use very basic
machine learning principles to locate
actionable trading rules within stocks
or Forex now I say basic for two reasons
one I'm going to do my best to keep
things purposely pretty basic
both mathematicians and stock traders
alike tend to use big words to purposely
make things sound more special than they
really are or maybe make themselves feel
better you're not going to really find
any that here or at least I'm going to
do my best to keep it simple - we're
going to be doing most of these things
by hand the idea here is to help you all
grow in all of those fields mentioned
above there's plenty of pre-made
packages for things like support vector
machines and neural networks the problem
here in my opinion is this doesn't
actually teach you anything and it
leaves no room for innovation
now using basic machine learning
principles to find the algorithm that's
going to be our first step and that's
usually the step most people finish on
whether or not they use machine learning
the next question is not only to
backtest the algorithm you found since
that's what actually but what's actually
going to end up happening is we're going
to wind up with a quote unquote live
trading algorithm which basically means
it's going to change over time it will
be a dynamic algorithm but we're also
going to do the next in my opinion very
important step
and that's to backtest that method that
was used to find that algorithm so what
I mean by this is the following it's
with statistical certainty that if you
look at a data set that you can find the
best fit line right that's nothing
special yet we see this all the time
where someone said hey look what I found
you know here's this back tested
strategy and it makes X amount of money
that's no good right
the true test is the forward test the
test on unseen and unaccounted for data
therefore if you've created a sort of
quote-unquote algorithm to define or
derive the best trading strategy then
that algorithm used to find that
strategy right the method to find that
strategy must also have worked in the
past against its quote unquote
theoretical or actual literal future
results right so you should also test
that strategy against data yuvan you've
in theory not seen so you can actually
back test that method itself and this is
basically to decide whether or not it
would have worked to use that method in
the past to find an algorithm that you
would have also done some back testing
on anyway if you're just looking at the
data set you found the best algo for for
that you know including the back testing
that's really cheating and the
likelihood of that algorithm continuing
account in the future is statistically
unfavorable so now that we've swallowed
that pill let's go ahead and get all the
tools and things that we'll need to do
this so first we are on syntax comm
which is my website and all we're here
for mostly is a file I do suggest you
guys take a peek around but that's not
what we're here for I'm not trying to
sell you all anything what we're going
to look for is the zip file I've got two
files located within that zip file and
to find that you're going to go to
syntax comm slash gbp/usd dot zip hit
enter and that should download a zip
file and that zip file is going to
contain two files within it and these
are the two files that you'll find the
first file is gbp/usd Forex ratio for
one day and the other files the GB
USD ratio for one month obviously your
any need to extract this but once you've
extracted it you can open up either of
these so we'll open this one and you'll
find yourself looking at one day's worth
a Forex data now I didn't cheat you guys
or give you guys nothing to work with
this is actually as you can see 62,000
bits of data
it's bid-ask tick data for this Forex
ratio so it's pretty good data to train
on to start with the next file is a one
month of the month of May I think is
what I cut out yeah so you've got it now
you've got a month's worth which is
actually just over one point month one
point six million lines here so a lot of
lines to work with and a lot of data to
work with so it should be pretty fun to
use them and the reason why I split them
up is every time we're trying to work
with at least develop this program using
only you know 100,000 lines versus 1
million lines is going to make a sizable
difference so that's why we're going to
do it that way now back to all the other
things that we need we're going to need
a few more things just besides this 4x
data of course and I also want to stress
that even though we are using 4x data
you can do these principles that we're
going to go through can be used
obviously for stocks as well so don't
feel like if you're looking to do this
with stocks that this isn't going to
work out for you now the next most
important thing a quite possibly more
important than even the tick data is
that we go ahead and get python and
we're going to be looking for the python
2 7 so to get python go to python org
then go to download and what you're
going to want to download is not 3-3 you
want 2 7 5 and depending on what
operating system you have is going to be
what you download if you do have a
64-bit operating system I highly suggest
that you download the 64-bit version of
python next we have Matt plot Lib it is
also well first you get there with
matplotlib dot org then you will go well
it used to be up here but I guess
they've moved it on me right here
downloads and then here you
get the downloader and again you're
going to want to match the download of
what version of Python you downloaded or
your windows again I recommend 64-bit if
you have a 64-bit system on if you did
download a 64-bit Python you must
subsequently you're also going to need
numpy now if you followed my rules and
you've got a 64-bit version of Python
maybe you're wondering why you get a
64-bit version of Python I've said this
quite a few and/or quite a few times in
most of my videos so the reason you get
64-bit verses 32-bit is because 64-bit
has no memory well it has one but it's
huge
32-bit programs and applications are
limited to two gigabytes of RAM usage
maximum so naturally if you have a
relatively large file sizes you're going
to max out that two gigabytes of RAM
pretty easily so that's why I recommend
64 but you'll be able to get through
this entire tutorial series and you'll
even be able to do some pretty cool
stuff even with that two gigabyte limit
so don't run away if that's you so if
you did do that the next thing we need
is numpy so what Python allows us to do
is program matplotlib is a package that
works with Python that allows us to do
graphing and numpy is a helpful little
tool for doing mathematical calculations
so to get numpy if you followed
everything up to this point you do have
64-bit you're going to need to go to
this link here I'll put all these links
in the description especially this one
so it's harder to find or at least read
but what we want here and what this
website is is it's a bunch of 64 that's
a bunch of installers and it just
includes 64-bit versions of a lot of
packages that don't naturally or
natively offer 64-bit installers so a
good example of this is numpy which find
here I use a control F and type out
numpy it's about halfway down the page
and again there is the installers here
if you do have only windows like a
32-bit you can also use the install link
here or you can go to like
sourceforge.net I believe and you can
get the other numpy
source code or the Installer depending
on what kind of computer you're on so
obviously you know if you've got like a
Mac or something or if you're on like a
Linux distribution something like that
you can get whatever but in the end just
make sure you've got Python to seven
matplotlib and numpy and when you're all
done and you've installed all of these
things you should be able to go to your
Start bar and pull up the python command
line it'll probably be black and not
like this but you can customize it so
that's just why mine's white but anyway
you should be able to type these
following things and you should be able
to say import matplotlib you should be
able to say import numpy and you should
be able to say input well that's it
that's not the same port python derp
anyway you should be able to import
matplotlib and you should be a little
important numpy if you can't do those
two things like if you go import and you
actually spell numpy right but this and
you get this on something that's gone
wrong so if you're having any trouble
installing or you've got some sort of
error going on feel free to post a
comment below and I'll try to help you
guys out so that's going to conclude the
introduction to what we're going to be
getting into and hopefully you guys are
excited and as always thanks for
watching thanks for your support your
subscriptions and it's all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
