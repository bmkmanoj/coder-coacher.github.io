another Python mathematics and the
finance indicators tutorial video in
this video in the next couple videos
we're going to be discussing the ease of
movement indicator commonly denoted as
the EMV not to be confused with the DNV
where there is certainly no ease of
movement the ease of movement indicator
is a volume-based oscillator as the name
suggests the idea is to measure how
easily the price can move in a direction
although I would really more so consider
this a closer to like overbought and
oversold indicator to be honest but it
is directionally based it's based on
volume and it's based on the price
movement so it does really meaning ease
of movement but I'm not really sure that
it is exactly accurate in its intention
anyway it is directionally based and
will oscillate around a zero line
calculation of ease of movements a
fairly simple calculation it's going to
be the high plus the low divided by two
so that gets you like your price minus
the previous high plus the previous low
divided by two so what was the change in
price divided by the total like bought
or just that volume for that one day
right divided by that high minus the low
obviously pH as I said was previous high
PL previous low volume you can divide it
by pretty much anything you want you can
divide it by 15 if you really really
wanted usually you're gonna see one
million or even a hundred million being
used it's basically just trying to get
that volume number down a little bit so
anyway that's the purpose but no matter
what you do it by it will it doesn't
really matter but it does kind of matter
if you're trying to compare two
companies so if you were to compare them
you would e that you'd want to normalize
this line either with percent change or
make this volume divided by something
some measure of the volume you'd want to
make it more of like a divided by some
factor of that total volume something
like that to normalize the two lines but
just keep that in mind so let's go ahead
and look at a couple examples now of
this only bring up our charting
application here
so here's our charting application we'll
go ahead and plot out eBay and so here's
our eBay indicator here with EMV of 14
if you can see we drew the zero line let
me go ahead and fit this to our window
so as you can see as it's moving down
quite quickly the ease of movement to
move down is only increasing and then as
we go up it increases again as well and
down and up and down and up a bunch of
times there's a couple of interesting
ones like over a long period if you look
at a company like Apple for example this
is how it will defer a lot from like
your typical RSI and it's going to do
something like this because it's
normalized across the entire thing right
so so only until real recently like the
ease of movement has been you know
pretty stable compared to the recent
stuff and it's just kind of flirted
around then it really went crazy and
it's not to say that it didn't really
move it's just more of like a charting
issue where you can see you know here it
looks like almost like it didn't move at
all but if we zoom in like let's say we
want to zoom in just to this point here
and let's do this that's good enough I
suppose and we just you just have to
understand that this line is fluctuating
a lot less and this is a really good
example of showing you guys the change
in in the actual trade volume for even
Apple right and like right here you know
you've got a lot of volume not too much
movement the price has been this way and
then as we get over here the prices have
changed quite a bit and there's a lot of
movement so this stuff like dwarfs the
stuff over here another decent one to do
would be like Morgan Stanley I think is
recently giving us a flat line
so there's a couple of examples how it
will actually indeed defer from like the
RSI because the RSI is almost normalized
no matter what the price and volume is
right it's always going to be wiggling
around and going crazy and it kind of
like resets itself every now and then
whereas like this line isn't going to
reset itself it's going to be everything
is plotted based on the same parameters
so
anyway that's just kind of like an
example of where this indicator can go
kind of strange but again you can kind
of zoom in just on like that one
you know section and now you're starting
to see some movement again so anyway
that is our EMV or ease of movement
indicator in the next video I'll be
showing you guys how to calculate it
within Python and then in the video
after that we'll actually plotting it in
pythons matplotlib so as always thanks
