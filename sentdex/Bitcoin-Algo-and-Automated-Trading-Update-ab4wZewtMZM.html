to another Bitcoin trading ish video I'm
making this as a sort of follow-up to
the whole 8 percent profit in 30 minutes
Bitcoin trading video I did about a
month ago a lot has changed and a lots
been learned and I've I figured I could
share at least some of that with you
guys so to start that video at the
moment has like a bit over 700 views so
not really that many but by far has been
like it's been the most
I don't know interactive or the most the
most contacts I've ever had from any
single video I've had about 40 emails
because of it so far with people either
asking about strategies the bots and
even investing in me so within actually
24 hours I was contacted by two
different people pretty interested in
investing and automated trading with me
one of whom is actually a large investor
now so more on that in a bit first I
wanted to hit on some of the things that
I've learned since then so the whole 8%
in 30 minutes was was really meant to
just be kind of for fun same thing with
the whole algo trading of Bitcoin I just
wanted to kind of play around in some
free time with it but without much
attention in that and the people that
were interested Bitcoin algo trading
kind of became a huge focus for me for
quite a bit and still is so the first
thing I did was actually back test the
simple moving average crossovers and the
MACD crossovers so I like first glance
on something like Bitcoin wisdom or
something you might think that both of
those are actually pretty decent
strategies to trade with I know I sure
did so I thought what would be kind of
neat is I can at least I did backtest
them and they are not good long-term
strategies so what I thought I could do
is actually show you guys a few back
tested strategies like with the MACD
since actually that's what I was kind of
trading on the MACD and then also simple
moving averages for those first few days
I thought it's pretty good but no so
anyways I just kind of pre-built a
couple of scripts here to test it and so
the first thing we'll start with is a
low frequency so very high numbers
on the the moving averages so what I
have it doing here is here's the actual
graph that it spits out the MACD is down
here at the bottom
everything the timestamps here are UNIX
timestamps so anyway and it's actually
UNIX plus but anyway don't worry about
that what we had here was only 17 total
trade solos again trading the crossover
of the MACD so you had a crossover here
another crossover here another one here
so yeah basically every crossover
something changed right and there is
profit I mean it clearly did you know
makes some decent profit here and it
continued going up and then it kind of
dropped down here obviously in price and
for a brief time it was actually market
beating but anyway that was the low
frequency and then these were just the
results basically so the total profit
you know if you started everything with
starting with one Bitcoin so the total
profit by the end of all this and after
17 trades and paying a trade fee I use
BTC ease fees for example so it's a
point two percent per trade anyway
throwing all that in we have a basically
the the total profit was 265 so you did
265 plus the starting value of Bitcoin
was you know right over here like it was
like 249 and two pennies I think so oh
I've actually written it out here silly
me anyway starting price to 4902
and then the profit was 265 so those
together equal to 4 442 or the buying
hold profit is 442 the ending price is
691 compared to the MACD dollars changed
though we had we basically saw 442
profit if we just bought and held versus
trading you made 265 so significantly
less there so so that's that but then
some people might be like well I was
never trading like those massive trends
so that doesn't really pertain to me so
then I got another one here that's kind
of a medium frequency of trades and I
bring you
so as you can see it's a little more
wild here it's kind of hard to see even
the crossovers so let's just zoom into
like a specific spot so it's a little
easier to see him now
so anyways again you can see where you
know profit went up and down and it kind
of tends to go with the trend but it no
matter what it's pretty much under
performance all the way through even in
the last one we actually had some over
performance or you know better
performance right around here I believe
but not in this one so that was kind of
the medium but again I'll show you guys
here this one actually made less money
than the other one but kind of looks a
little bit more reliable to me but
anyways made less money buy and hold
again you would have made four hundred
forty two versus this silly strategy
here 147 part of the reason why this
probably made a lot less money is you'll
see the total trades was over ten times
as many as the trades from the previous
back test and so trade fees are playing
a huge role here so let's close this one
and let's look at one last one that's a
high frequencies when I bring it on over
this one really drives the point home I
think you can already see the loss there
but the graph is just really uh
saddening so you can see here that if
you're trading real high frequency with
the MACD for example you are pretty much
certain to lose a lot of money
so anyways those are kind of the initial
things that I tested and I was seeing
this and it just didn't look like the
MACD no matter what parameters you chose
was a very good idea at all so then I
started looking at like a bunch of the
other indicators just to see if there
was something I could start with and
then we can start doing things like
machine learning and even genetic
programming to really hone in on getting
the most out of our most bang for our
buck so to speak so I tried the ADX
which is the average directional
movement system the Arun indicator EMA
is SMA is MACD all that stuff I tried
and didn't really get too too far
cracked out machine learning and pattern
recognition just to see decent results
but still nothing really worth writing
home about
and certainly not enough to justify
going live so then I looked into the
grid strategy which if you don't know
what it is it's a fairly basic strategy
where you're just trading based on
preset margins usually with no stop-loss
so it kind of scares a lot of people
away but as long as you're you know
bullish Bitcoin let's say long term then
you should have absolutely no problem
with that and all of the investors their
goal everyone that's contacted me for
investing their goal is actually not to
make US dollars they want to accrue more
Bitcoin so as long as that's their goal
then it actually does kind of it makes a
lot of sense to not use a typical
strategy that you would find was
something like Forex even though the
grid strategy actually is most commonly
used with Forex but actually it's almost
like the trend is not your friend with
the typical grid strategy but anyways we
looked into that and so I got started
there with seeing a lot better results
than I print pulled out the machine
learning especially for the grid
parameters so you kind of have to set
you know a grid size and that's gonna be
dependent on a lot of different things
that I'm not really going to get into
but then finally we kind of we went live
with the grid immediately but there was
some some small problems and about a
week and a half ago
pulled out some Genetic Programming just
just for fun and actually came up with
another great variable that really
hadn't even considered yet and I don't
know how familiar most of you are with
machine learning and genetic programming
but sometimes you'll be actually
returned a variable that you don't
actually know what it even is there's
really no way to figure out what that
variable is you just kind of have to
trust it which is kind of problematic
because there's no way to find out if
it's actually truthful like a good
variable or if your program is glitching
or something you know so it's very
disconcerting but at least this one it
was pretty easy to figure out what it
was so that was neat and actually I have
that here as well so I'm gonna close out
of this and this is the ending strategy
here it's a little bit slower it's using
this higher granularity data so it's
gonna take a second to do the full back
test and all that but
yeah so this one is a little bit more
in-depth as far as the output simply
because this is what was given to the
investors but basically at the end of it
you can see the various results if you
convert it out like at the end of it we
were left with 2.5 yeah everything
starts with one Bitcoin right at the end
of it we had two point five six Bitcoin
and we had fifteen hundred almost
sixteen hundred dollars on balance and
then if you converted it all the dollars
it was 37 24 versus the buy-and-hold
eight thirty nine and then if you
converted it all to Bitcoin 4.4 versus
obviously if you just held and then this
is just a little graph for it again the
UNIX timestamps at the bottom plus you
know that one point three eight four
anyway we're live with counts on both
 and btc-e now five total investors
the funds actually about 150,000 US
dollars and as of our latest track
records out of beta testing we're
currently already doubling the market
which is pretty awesome it's really neat
to see everything take off so fast and
what's also kind of interesting about
the exchanges is with these API is that
they offer so you can actually connect
and trade with a program for someone
like me to manage someone else's funds I
just used the API I don't even know
their login info you don't have to
transfer money out you can't transfer
even if you wanted to all you can do is
trade so obviously that represents a
huge decrease in risk for you know
people they don't even give me their
Bitcoin besides the deposit so it's
actually kind of neat for everyone I
don't really see that kind of stuff
happening with investing and like fund
management at all and maybe that's for a
host of like legal reasons and stuff but
kind of interesting difference there
anyway enough on that I really just
wanted to kind of add an update as to
what's been up with me and what I've
been doing I've been getting a ton of
emails from a lot of curious people and
I also just wanted to correct a few
things I had said since before I was
really trading on SMA and MACD and I did
make a lot of money or at least I didn't
make a lot of money I would say I would
made a lot of percentage gain but it's
definitely a dangerous endeavor so I
would not
just anybody go down that road so
hopefully you guys enjoyed the update as
always thanks for watching thanks for
all the support of the subscriptions and
until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
