3 specifically Python 3 3 though it
should work with pretty much anything
throughout Python 3 series for any of
you guys or girls who are new to
programming I will just say that
learning to program has been easily one
of the best life choices of mine
definitely in the top three it's just
giving me so many options in life and
really my freedom to do what I want so I
do these videos because I hope that I
can help other people get to the point
like that I really feel like at least
these days knowing how to program is a
lot like having a superpower it sounds
kind of funny but it really is it gives
you the ability to create things pretty
much you know seemingly from nothing and
do it pretty fast so with especially
with things like data analysis and all
that as well it puts you ahead of pretty
much everyone else uh that isn't using
it because they're using Excel or
whatever
I really see it as a superpower it
definitely falls under the categories of
a superpower so let me pass on this
superpower so now for some of you guys
um you're probably well I imagine a lot
of people are coming here having never
used Python or programming at all that's
not a big deal this this series at least
the introductory in basics is geared
towards somebody completely new to
programming and Python and all of that
but I do expect some Python especially
2.7 users or other versions of - sadly
maybe even one and I also know a lot of
people that watch my tutorials do it at
the same time as they're taking classes
and many times those classes have you
using Python - not Python 3 one of my
buddies just told me that here in 2014
his class is actually using python 2.5
since um I guess it's a lot of effort
for them to update the course work I'm
not really sure sure why and I'm doing
my best to not be so lazy since my
channel did also start off as 2/7 and
Here I am trying my best to update it to
3/3 so um while I'm trying to do that I
also realize that people will have
indeed reasons to have multiple ver
luckily by this time there are a few
nifty ways to handle at least using
Python 2 and Python 3 together on the
same machine they can even work with
each other so I'm going to cover that as
well
so both how to like run Python 2 7 and 3
3 scripts so I execute them as well as
actually edit them in idle and work in
their specific environments in idle so
anyways enough on that well let's go
ahead and get python 3.3 so to get it
you're going to head to python org it's
up there and then a half bar
hopefully you guys can type that out
then you'll come down here to download
and that's what you're going to want to
click on here now eventually well I get
I don't see it here but if you if you do
look at the home page Python 3.4 beta 1
and 2 are actually already out so it's
conceivable that relatively soon Python
3.4 will be joining us and if during
this series I imagine it might even you
know come out in full so if that happens
I will just switch to 3 4
usually the the differences between
python 3 3 and 3 4 especially for a
beginners introductory tutorial they
won't change anything so if by the time
you're watching this you're you know
they've got a 3 4 3 5 3 6 as long as
it's Python 3 it's highly unlikely that
Nene's like basic introductory topics
are going to change in the slightest so
go ahead and download the most recent
version of 3 so anyway so what you're
going to do is you come down to the
Downloads here for me it's 3 3 so you
want to download whatever version you
have by default like if you download
like let's say this version here that's
going to download 32-bit this will
download your 64-bit and then and so on
so I I would recommend that you get
64-bit if you have a 64-bit operating
system just because 32-bit is limited to
2 gigabytes of memory so it's useful to
be able to pass that sometimes
so anyways um go ahead and click on
whichever one is yours this one will be
mine and let it go ahead and download
and whenever it's done
we'll install so I would suggest you
just POSIX I'm going to cancel this
download so I've already downloaded it
so pause the video until you're done and
then we'll continue on with the
installation
so once you've completed the download I
don't know wherever you saved it go
ahead and open that up and run it and
you can choose what you want to do I'm
just going to install it for all users
next it's going to ask you where you
want to install it I would just leave it
there next next and wait for it to
install and you're all set so whenever
that's done you finish now I will say
that at least me I have two versions
right I've got both Python 2 7 and 3 3
running on my machine and actually I
have scripts that must run to 7 like the
written in to 7 and I just have not
ported them to 3/3 yet so I want them to
continue being able to run so the
question is how do you do something like
that so the first thing I'll show you
guys is the most basic and that's going
to be what you need to put at the top of
the script to make sure they execute and
this is only for when you install in the
order of Python 2 and then after that
you installed Python 3 on top of Python
2 as far as I know someone can can let
me know but in order to go from Python
let's say you installed Python 3 and
then you later decide to install Python
2 it's actually really hard to get
python 3 to run I've you can get it in
kind of a finicky way and I think you
can just change like registry keys or
something but for the for the purposes
here I've installed Python 2 first then
python 3 and that seems to be the best
way to go about having both installed on
your machine so anyways let's continue
on and I'll show you guys now how to run
both versions so what I've gone ahead
and done is I've got two scripts here
let me just pull this over here now
now what I've got here is I've got run
to seven and run three three and so let
me go ahead and edit a couple of these
so this one a couple of these both of
them I'll just have it both at the same
time multitasking so as you can see at
the top of the script if you're familiar
with programming this is like your
shebang line right so generally if
you're on something like it's not really
too necessary if you're on Windows but
if you're on something like Linux and
you want to be able to execute Python
from the command line without actually
saying um you know Python in front of it
so if you're like running a cron or
something like that what you would do is
you would give the path to Python like
you know use urban environment Python
but for the purposes here what we're
actually going to do is we're telling
Python like which version of Python we
want to run and this comes with Python 3
so this is why if you install Python 3
then python - I think it's your
environment variable that gets edited
and so this actually won't do anything
for you if you install in that order but
if you install in Python 2 then Python 3
you'll get this functionality so and I'm
not positive it comes like so if you if
you're running like let's say Python 3 1
or something I'm not positive that
functionality is there yet I think it
came later like but after the first
version of Python 3 but anyway moving on
so what we've got going on here both
scripts are actually identical um they
import system import time just so we can
see it with enough time and then you can
see all it does is print out the system
version but I will show you guys that if
we go let's say we go f5 to run we're
actually running in three three because
idle wants to default to 3 3 since
that's the last one we downloaded and
changing that is possible and I will
show you guys how in a minute but first
I want to show you this so it's still
going to run in three three and just for
anyone that's curious
um this print like functionality you can
do this in Python 2 7 so even though
this did run indeed in 3 3 you're able
to do this like the add the parentheses
like this into 7 so
just just for anybody that's like well
that's the 3/3 way of doing it anyway
they're identical and all they're going
to do is just print the version of
Python so what I'm going to go ahead and
do now is close them both and the only
difference between these two scripts is
just what we call up here and this one
just says hey I want to run in Python -
this one says hey I want to run in
Python 3 and actually this is not
necessary since we downloaded Python 3
last I believe the default will be
Python 3 but now they think about it I'm
not positive on that but anyways in fact
let's just run another one I'm pretty
sure it's Python 3 but now I can't
remember
let's run edit this one and just not
have that ok so let's go ahead and we'll
run this first one ok yeah so so the
default is actually 2 7 if you have both
installed interesting so then it only
makes sense that this 2 7 is gonna run
too so let's hope so that would be
really bad so again we run this one it
is indeed running 2 7 and if I ran this
one it is indeed running 3 3 so that's
how you would do that now I imagine some
of you guys are like what how did you
even get here like how did you even get
to make these scripts and all that stuff
alright so let's talk about that let's
say like how do we actually do stuff
like this but I did just want to at
least show some people right off the bat
how you can handle having both versions
so really in your old versions you don't
even really need to put anything at the
top because it's going to default but
just in case they ever change that in
the future you might as well just keep
it up there so now what about all the
poor folk who have never used Python
before so once you've installed Python
you should be able to at least go you
know to your directory and go to you
know Python if you're on Windows should
be able to go you start bar really any
machine go to your Start bar and then go
you know all programs and at least for
me
mine's going to like I've see Python 2 7
and 3 3 here so since we used Python 3 3
you should click on that and in fact let
me bring my window down here so here it
is
3 3 and then here you have idle module
Docs Python command line uninstall and
manuals
um so the command line when you click on
that that's going to bring up kind of
like a live interpreter for you and so
what you can do is you can do stuff like
this like print hi right that's going to
print out hi for you and you can coach
straight in here but I don't actually
like doing it because it is uh it is
live and so it's a little tedious to use
it because uh it's going to work your
program step by step now in some senses
like for debugging purposes that can be
useful but also there's no easy way to
save this so really only for like really
short tests and stuff like that would I
recommend using this but the next thing
will come over to 3/3 and idle is what
we want so there's actually a lot of
what's called ID es which is your at
least with with Python they call it idle
it doesn't really matter it is an IDE
it's just interactive development
environment or it's like I think it
maybe it's integrated doesn't really
matter but it stands for the same thing
as every other ID e stands for Python
just added an L there it's just for
development I'm pretty sure anyway so
click on that and that should bring up
this bad boy here and as you can see
this says Python 3 3 so let me drag this
window over now so again if you wanted
to so I showed you guys how to actually
run the script um in whatever version
you want but check this out if I right
click here like generally once you've
installed Python you should have an edit
with IDL e if we click on that even
though it's Python 2 7 right that's the
one we've wanted but if we click on that
and hit run run module it's actually as
you can see at the top here at 3 3 and
it sure enough ran in 3 3 so that's kind
of annoying if you still want to develop
in Python 2 7 so the same way that we've
opened up the idle in Python 3 3 you can
go here all Python to 7 idle and that'll
bring up idle for you let me just bring
this back over again and what you can do
now is you can see this is 2 7 at the
same time when you go to open you can go
file open and we come over here and
let's say I want to open this one
we've opened that up now and when I go
to run you could even close this if you
wanted to or at least you should be able
to let's find out
yeah so we opened it into seven and so
as you can see now we're actually
running into seven and you can do your
edits into seven so that's how you can
get around it because natively if you
edit with with idle now it's going to be
in three three but anyway so I'm going
to close out of this and so so whenever
you have a script like you bring up idle
the first time like if you don't have
any Python files you won't really have
anything to make but if you know don't
have any Python files you would open up
idle and then go file new file and you
have this like untitled document and so
for now what I'll just say is like you
will make it do something and so we'll
just put a print in here and it's just
gonna print a space and then what you
want to do is you go file save as and
then we'll bring it over here and then
for now I'll just say what we'll call
this Tut and interestingly enough it
looks like it saves it as dot PI into
seven whenever you like save an untitled
document in Python it won't save it as
pi it'll save it as like I think it's
text and or maybe even like no extension
I don't even know it's just really
annoying so I'm actually now I'm curious
because normally like you save it and it
saves it as all files and it's really
annoying so I'm gonna hit save let's
find out yes nice well in to seven so if
you are brand new to Python and some
teachers making you use to seven or to
five when you go to save originally you
must add the dot PI at the end otherwise
it's going to save it as like a blank
text or like a regular text file that's
kind of annoying so I see they fix that
in Python 3 so that's great so very long
installation and you know how to run all
the various versions if you want to but
there are there's definitely a ton of
questions online about like how to get
that how to get both running at the same
time and generally if you're going to do
Python right at least at the moment
there's going to be times where you
might need Python to seven so that's how
you can do it that's how you can get
yourself all set up and now you're ready
to learn
program so uh anyways that's going to
conclude the installation you know
initial setting up of everything as
always thanks for watching things for
all the support and subscriptions and
until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
