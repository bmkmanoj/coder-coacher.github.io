another Python a panda's tutorial video
as you well know all the cool kids plot
in 3d now so now we need to teach you
guys how to do it so with that let's go
ahead and get started so we have we do
need to have Matt putt lips pipe lot
still but we also have to import MPL on
your score are actually rather from MP L
dot or underscore tool kits dot and plot
3d import axes free capital D now that's
why I don't think it will work with
pandas if anybody knows how you can plot
3d with pandas feel free to let me know
pretty sure you're going to have to do
it this way though we can leave all of
this other data here except all the
plotting basically so we'll just do that
answer well we can lead plot show there
I suppose now so let's say we want to
compare maybe price to the high minus
low and then see if there's any
correlation between the high minus low
and price visually okay so I don't know
anybody that does this I just want to
show you 3d plotting with the data set
that we're using so we're going to say
3d equals P Ltd figure empty palms GC a
and then parentheses projection equals
3d and basically what this does
oops put quotes are not this is what
this doesn't notifies that hey we're
going to plot in 3d now next thing we
want to do is we're going to make a
scatter plot so we're gonna say 3d dot
scatter and first we're going to say D F
dot index and if that index will just be
the index of the date okay so DF index
and actually let's go ahead and we want
to get rid of index column for now we'll
bring it back one of these days but for
now we want to get rid of that so DF
index is not dates I don't think it's
going to handle the dates very well map
plot live 3d and so DF dotted X now
that'll just be a I think I'll probably
start at 0 1 2 3 4 then just goes all
the way through my sort of one I'm not
sure which one it starts with we'll find
out so DF index and then we're going to
say DF will do H - oh and then DF close
ok so those are the three things we have
X Y and a Z now for the scatterplot that
we're going to do and then we're going
to say 3d dot set underscore X label and
then makes important our quotes there
we're going to copy this paste paste X Y
Z or X label is just the index or Y
label is H - L and then finally our Z
label is close and that will should be
enough we'll find out I suppose and so
let's go ahead and save and run that and
we sure enough we get our 3d plot here
so here we have and just has for the
record I think the back arrow ok the
arrows don't do anything this pan
basically does what all the clicks do
soom works and sips I mean hits a figure
and I don't know if subplots works or
not I guess we'll find out oh it does ok
so we can do that but basically the
arrows don't work there's no point to
this and zoom works at least though now
so if we do this we can see ok so this
was the price looks like I think it
starts at 0 I don't know
so this is price right and then what we
can do though is we can turn this a
little bit right and we can see this is
high minus low so as the high minus low
goes up it almost looks like that mostly
happens when price is low right because
this was the close price so this seems
to happen more often like
hi - low variance of volatility I
suppose we could call it seems to happen
more when the close price is lower than
when the close price is higher seems to
get pretty tight as you get higher price
which is odd you would kind of assume
that high - low is either at the
extremes on either end but looks more to
me like it's kind of low but anyway so
that's just an example doing some 3d
plotting thought zoom worked but it does
not look like zoom works I lied anyway
so there's your 3d plot we have a lot of
plots on here so it kind of lags on my
computer and depending on what kind of
computer you have it probably lags even
more this is all plotting with your CPU
rather not your GPU if you plot it on
your GPU you get a lot better results
but this is CPU ear so anyway we close
out of that and so there's always that
all kinds of stuff that we can plot here
we could plot something like this like
we can have index high minus low and
then we could do let's say volume and
India volume here and so we can compare
you know does how it is the high minus
low react with volume right so we have
index that's just so really we won't
notice anything here but as volume goes
up while volume first of all volume has
gone up since the beginning interesting
uh-huh and then here we can compare as
high minus low gets larger what is
volume do or as volume gets larger what
does high minus low do so we can see
that as the two of them rise to kind of
together because there you can see like
as this goes up it seems as the volume
goes up but there are some more volume
is still kind of low anyway probably no
no no money to be made in this kind of
analysis but I just want to show you
guys 3d plotting just some basic
examples now you can do all kinds of 3d
plots you can do planes you can do bars
and all that I have tutorials on those
as well if you want to dig into more 3d
plotting you can check those out so
anyway that's going to clear this video
if you guys have any questions or
comments feel free to leave them below
as always thanks for watching things for
all this for the subscriptions
until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
