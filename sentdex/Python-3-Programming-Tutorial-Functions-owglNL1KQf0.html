Python 3 basics video in this video
we're going to be discussing the basics
of a Python function the idea of a
function is to assign a set of code and
possibly variables known as parameters
to a single bit of text so you can think
of it a lot like why you choose to write
and save a program rather than writing
out the entire program every time you
want to execute it or in a much smaller
scale why we use variables so to begin a
function you define the function
by using the keyword def d EF short for
define in this notifies Python of the
impending function definition from there
you're going to type out whatever name
you want to refer to your function as
now you want to be kind of careful in
the name of your function just like you
would want to be careful in the name of
your variable you want to choose
something unique and it's not going to
conflict with anything else like time
now if you define a function and you
call the time it's going to conflict
with the time module should you use it
so you don't want to use time so for us
we're just going to use example and
after the definition of the functions
name you have the parentheses and within
the parentheses you have any parameters
if you have any parameters that is for
now we're just gonna leave those empty
but I will show you guys in some future
videos how to use parameters after the
parentheses you have a colon and the you
hit enter and basically everything you
type under here is going to be your
function block so as you type code and
you hit enter you've got this is all
contained in your function and then
finally when you come over here and
start typing more code that's outside of
the function so this is the function so
that's kind of the idea of Python
standards whereas other programming
languages generally you're going to have
curly braces and you type within the
curly braces and blah blah blah we use
just indent and indent only so for
example we're just going to say print
basic function and then we'll actually
you know call a bear or assign a
variable that's going to be 3 plus 9 and
we'll even print that variable out when
we call this function
and that's basically it now if we go to
run this program you'll find that
nothing happens so we hit run and
nothing happens now sometimes just like
trips people up and what's happened is
we've defined the function but we've not
actually called the function into action
so to do that you can either type it out
so example empty parameters hit enter
and it says basic function 12 another
thing that you can do is literally
within your script you can type out
example and when you go to run it it
will just automatically run so you don't
have to actually type it in yourself so
this is the function basics in the next
video what we're going to be talking
about is parameters in the function
because parameters add quite a bit of
dynamic variability to your function so
that's what we're going to talk about in
the next video stay tuned for that as
always thanks for watching thanks for
all the support and subscriptions and
until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
