part 14 of our Python with PI QT for GUI
application development tutorial video
series in this video we're going to be
talking about how can we open up a file
so it turns out that built within QT is
a file picker so to speak where we can
pull it up and actually choose a file
from our operating systems kind of
directory use so that's pretty cool cuz
it's built right in to Qt so let's just
go ahead and jump in because how can we
have an editor gonna have a file to edit
that doesn't make any sense so what
we're going to do is we're going to add
another bit like we've got open editor
well also we want to have is like file
open so we want to be able to go like
open file for example and we'll say that
is equal to and in fact let's just copy
and paste all of this that would make a
lot of sense and and then just start
renaming stuff so open file copy paste
paste paste instead of control e that
would make sense to be control oh we're
going to make this open file and then
status tip can be open file and then the
triggered method will be file underscore
open and that should be it the only
other thing of course we need to add it
to the file menu so what we'll do is
file menu dot add action and we want to
add open file so open file awesome now
we need to add our fire or what do we
call that method file open let's just
copy and paste or we forget it
scrolling on down we add another method
whoops oh dear we almost made a huge
mess of the place
uh we were gonna do it I don't know
what's do it right here so define file
actually spaced yeah file open and then
it was past self and now you're ready to
go so first of all we have a name in a
file so first we'll say the name here is
going to be equal to Q T GUI equals
um I'm just kidding dot Q file dialogue
dot get open file name self and then
this will be the title basically to the
little window that pops up and we'll
title it open file then we're going to
say file equals open whatever that name
is and we're going to open it with the
intention to read okay so then so when
you when we open this file
what are we opening the file for so we
can open it and we can read it in or
well this is just opening it with the
intention to read we haven't actually
read a thing but so the nails let's go
even past that so we know we want to
open the file what do we want to do with
it well we want to load it into that
text editor and then up here how do we
get that file name this just it's the
file dialog built in a QT and whatever
file we pick that's being returned as
the file name done so anyway moving
right along after we have the file name
what do we want to do well first of all
we're going to call self dot editor why
are we calling self-taught editor we
need the editor to be there if you
recall the editor is not there by
default right we were going like show
editor so if we don't call self editor
it won't be there the file will load and
we can even populate the editor with the
stuff but until we call you know to set
it as a central widget and all that now
it won't actually show up anywhere so
anyways now we'll say with file we're
going to say text equals file dot read
and then we're going to say self dot
text edit dot set
text text and that should be all we need
text edit you should make sure even was
texted I don't even know we're gonna run
this and see how it works okay so first
of all I want to change to maybe
plastique so pretty now um first let's
just open the editor cool so the editor
works now let's try open file and then
here are the list of videos that we're
writing right now how about we open the
same one that we're making right now do
it here it is lovely lovely so there is
our file that's pretty cool if these
things excite me whenever you finally
that get to this point and you're like
wow that's awesome it worked anyway so
that's cool it's a pretty good-looking
editor I mean we have this babyface I
mean that's nice
anyway um but just just just admire the
beauty of Pi QT all the things that we
have so far and this is a pretty darn
good-looking window you just want to
have a good-looking window like this if
you had tkinter so anyways now we have
the editor we can open a file and again
you've got this nice file picker that is
like already there for you it's easy
easy to use and all that so anyways
let's close out of this and now the next
and final thing that we really need to
do to finish up this little editing
application that we've built for
ourselves is we need to be able to save
the file to whatever we want so this
we're going to be talking about in the
next video so if you have any questions
or comments up to this point please feel
free to leave them below otherwise as
always thanks for watching thanks for

until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
