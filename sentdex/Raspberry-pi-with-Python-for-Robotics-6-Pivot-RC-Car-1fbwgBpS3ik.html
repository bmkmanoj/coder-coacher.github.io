back to another Python and robotics
tutorial video in the last video we got
our robot car to turn left in turn right
and in this video we want to do is we
want to program it to pivot left and
right because then the turn it would
have to gain forward ground whereas in a
pivot it would just spin in place so
let's go ahead and sudo nano robot too
high and here's our file let's go down
to the very bottom we don't need it to
turn right anymore and now let's go
ahead and define a pivot underscore left
time frame : 1 2 3 4 in it and now we're
ready to go so now to pivot left what we
would need is sense forward is in the
direction of you know going right
on-screen to pivot left the wheels
closest to the screen would need to move
forward whereas the wheels in the back
would need to move backwards and that
would help its spin in the left
direction or maybe the better word to be
would be pivot or turn counterclockwise
so to do that to make that happen what
we want to do is we would want to use 7
as true so GPIO 2 output 7 true and then
we're going to need 11 to be false the
GPIO dot output 11 falls and then 13
should be true and then 15
should be false now that ought to give
us a pivot left let's check it have it
left for one second X yes save and up to
sudo python a robot to type I enter and
we forgot our clean up as usual good
stuff
how come nobody warned me about this now
let's go down to the bottom and first of
all we want to do time Don sleep for
time frame and then GPIO dot clean up
clean it clean up yes and now we're
going to run it once just to clear
everything for myself and battery and
let's run it again
okay so that worked out so that would
make it pivot left now the last thing
that we really want to do is pivot right
and that should do for all of our
commands or at least you know not
commands I suppose I guess commands yeah
as far as you know what we want this
robot to be able to do so now define
pivot right time frame as usual we need
the individual arms and now we want to
begin so what's going to change well
basically I know this got us last time
so I hope it doesn't get me again but we
should just have to flip everything I
think we'll get away with flipping
everything this time so did you pee out
an output seven bowls GPIO output eleven
true GPI head and I'll put 13 false gb
out
fifteen true now don't forget to sleep
time dot sleep for the time frame and
GPIO dot cleanup now we want to pivot
underscore right for the time frame with
one save yep same file suit a Python
robot tune-up I run it and sho'nuff so
the wheels closest to us spun backwards
whereas the ones furthest from us spun
forwards thus making us turn in a
clockwise rotation or pivot right so
that's it for that now what do we want
to do well now that we've done that we
want some way to be able to control our
car so you don't want to have to like
pre-program the car now there's a few
ways that you can do this either you can
allow the robot to accept controls from
you the user or you can make the robot
somewhat autonomous now the problem
right now with our little car is we
don't have any sort of real sensor to
sense when anything is happening so we
can't really make it autonomous just yet
so first we want to make it controllable
and even if you made it autonomous you
want it you would want to kind of
eventually have some sort of control to
it as a sort of failsafe if anything so
what we're going to be doing in the next
video is actually working with some
input that we can give to this robot to
use our functions however we see fit
that way we'd have to pre-program
anything so that's what you have to look
forward to hopefully you guys are
enjoying if you have any questions or
comments feel free to leave them below
as always thanks for watching thanks for
all the support and subscriptions and
until the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
