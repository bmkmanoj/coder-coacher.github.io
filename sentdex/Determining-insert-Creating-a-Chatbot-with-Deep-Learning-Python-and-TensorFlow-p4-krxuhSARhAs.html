part four of our chat bot with Python in
tensorflow tutorial series
in this tutorial we're just gonna keep
building on last one so we've begun kind
of pulling out the data that we're
interested in the other thing I wanted
to do real quickly is bring up buff the
buffer in parameter so I wrote buffer
here in that file open it needs to be
buffering and at this point just to make
sure you got it right you can print the
row so for row in a print row and if you
run this you should see you know data
flying by okay so make sure that's
happening for you that's not happening
something is wrong so I'm gonna get rid
of that dose that's gonna be really slow
especially with idle now what we're
going to do is basically at this point
we've got the information we're
interested in inserting it into our
database but should we so the next
question is basically first of all like
I was saying before I don't want to just
insert every comment there's a lot of
useless comments on Reddit who'd a thunk
but so so basically were gonna have a
threshold here we're gonna say if score
is greater than or equal to two and you
could pick something else I mean I feel
like you know even like 5 or 15
especially if you've got the entire just
torrent dump from reddit or you know if
you're doing bigquery or something like
that and especially with bigquery you
could actually throw this into your
bigquery all right before you even fold
the data you can use a pretty
substantial number here anyway
I'm gonna go with 2 for now just
something more than one so this just
says basically somebody saw this comment
in somebody somewhere was like yeah and
they hit ok so yeah so if score is
greater than or equal to 2 what we want
to do is basically at that point we're
thinking hmm we would like to insert
this data into our database but what if
we already have that a comment you know
what if we already have you know
basically what if you know that comment
score is greater than 2 but it has a
parent ID right what if we already have
a reply to that parent ID like what if
we don't need one and if we do already
have a reply
basically what we're gonna want to know
is like okay well what's the existing
score of that comment does this score or
this comment have a better score so so
we need to find that out so we're gonna
say if score is greater than or equal to
two we're gonna say existing underscore
comments underscore score equals find
existing score now we're going to search
for the existing score by parent ID so
we're going to search for the parent ID
and see if is there a comment and reply
to this parent ID that already has a
score greater than greater than our
current score if not we don't care if so
we're gonna go ahead and update that row
with a new reply in the new score and
all the other new data okay so so yeah
we want to do that now what we want to
do is actually create this find existing
score function so I'll copy that I'll
come up here define find existing score
and basically again we're gonna search
for that by parent ID so what we're
gonna do is let's just listen I like the
idea of try and accept and return false
if if all else fails so let's go ahead
and paste that that lovely logic in and
honestly a lot of this stuff is gonna
remain the same so let's do yeah this is
like almost an identical function
honestly so so so in this case we want
to not select comment but we want to
select score from parent reply where not
comment ID this time we want to do
parent ID where parent ID is equal to
blank limit one format parent ID see
that execute SQL result fetch one none
return zero otherwise we return false
and then return false yeah I think
that's right
I hope that logics right
we'll find out anyway cool so once we've
done that awesome so then we're gonna
ask you know if existing comments score
so basically if it has any value
besides false this is going to be true
so if existing score then our question
is well is our current score greater
than the existing comments score
question mark and then if it is now
we're thinking okay we're ready to
possibly insert this data and in this
case we would actually be updating a row
rather than just a straight-up insert
now the other thing that I want to go
ahead and do is create the acceptable
data so because the other thing we're
gonna ask before we do an insert is is
this even an acceptable statement and in
theory actually we probably should ask
that even like up here like before we
consider anything else it needs to be
acceptable but let's go ahead and build
it real quick so we're gonna do is
define acceptable it's gonna take in
data which is going to be the comment
basically and then if Len of data split
and we're split by space but we're just
gonna tokenize it real quick and see is
that length greater than so that we're
going to be doing multiple models here
but one of them is going to require that
we buck it to a maximum length of about
50 50 words so I'm gonna say 50 here but
later we might want to modify that a
little bit but anyway for the Len of
data is less than 1 so like let's just
say that was like an empty comment for
whatever reason maybe someone edited or
something like that what we want to do
in this case is return false Elif the
Len of the data for whatever reason is
greater than like a thousand so it's got
more than a thousand characters chances
are that's something we don't really
want so we're gonna go ahead and return
false there as well Elif data equals
and here are two versions of comments
being removed or deleted there's deleted
elif data equals deleted or data equals
removed we want to go ahead and return
false else
let's return true so again I'm not
really sure why but when Chi maybe it's
like when a user deletes verses when a
mod deletes or an admin deletes I don't
know but they these two things exist to
me they mean the exact same thing okay
anyway I think this is a good stopping
point we've been building a lot of stuff
here so I'm trying not to keep keep my
videos from being 20 minutes long each
so so we'll go ahead and stop here and
in the next tutorial we'll continue kind
of building this out will actually ask
if something's acceptable and then we'll
probably in the next tutorial be able to
actually finish this and press go and
start populating a database so that's
what you guys have to look forward to if
you have questions comments concerns
will whatever feel free to leave them
below otherwise I will see you in the
next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
