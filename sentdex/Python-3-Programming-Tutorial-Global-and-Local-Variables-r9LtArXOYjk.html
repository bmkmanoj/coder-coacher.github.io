another Python 3 basics video in this
video we're now going to be discussing
the concepts of global and local
variables so when users start using
functions they quickly get a little
confused
when it comes to global and local
variables and they get this you know
dreaded you know variable not defined
even when they clearly see that it is
defined or so they think
so these terms of global and local
corresponds to a variables reach within
a script or a program so a global
variable is a variable that can be
accessed anywhere a local variable
opposite means it can only be accessed
within its you know environment or its
frame so a local variable cannot be
accessed globally inherently anyways and
a global variable can be right but
you've got to turn it into a global
variable and some people have a
misunderstanding of what a global
variable actually is so let's go ahead
and give some examples so if you if you
haven't committed this to memory no
problem I think actually seeing help
centers helps you to understand so x
equals x this variable has no parent
function but it's actually not a global
variable it just so happens that it's
committed to memory before any sort of
function or anything is called so for
example we can say define example and we
can actually say you know Z equals 5
print Z and that's totally fine and we
can call example and as we expect it's
going to print 5 so we know that works
but what starts giving trouble to people
is instead of let's get rid of this and
let's say you want to print X well we
run this function and we see we can
print X so we were able to access X from
this function and
what happens is users naively think that
because they were able to access it now
they're able to play with this variable
led site so print X plus five okay so
they start playing with it they see okay
well we can start modifying it and all
this cool cool cool so we have you know
access to this but the problem is when
they start to do something like this X
plus equals six and they go to run it
mmm and you see unbound local error
local variable X referenced before
assignment yet this makes people just
pull out the hair because first of all
they never got there they didn't get the
things printed so they're freaking out
like so they didn't get the you know
confirmation here because when you get
rid of this it does print him it's only
you only get that error whenever you try
to actually do something like add six to
that variable and so they start pulling
out their hair because up till now they
thought they were getting away with
doing that but the problem is X is not a
global variable so there's a few ways
that you can get around this obviously
the easiest thing to do would be to
convert X to a global variable so to do
that you type out global space X and
what that does is it's notifying Python
that hey guys X is actually a global
variable and so now what we can do is
print X and then we can even do X plus
equals five for int X so now we go to
run this sure enough six eleven
everything worked we were able to use
our global variable now that's it for
global variables but a lot of teachers
you're going to find or maybe you work
for a company or something and the CTO
says nobody gets to use global functions
or I mean global variables don't use
them though some people don't like the
idea of using global variables there's
actually you know a couple of things you
can do to get around this one one way
that people will do it is the following
they might say globe globe x equals x
because we already know we can access
X we just can't modify it so then you
could print globe X and then we could do
globe X plus equals five and print X and
we're able to do that six eleven so we
get the same output that we wanted but
maybe we're not happy with that because
when we do this now we've changed
variables here so and also globe X is a
local variable and so we're not able to
access globe X outside of this function
so say we've got multiple functions and
we want them to work together we're
going to be able to do that so what do
you do instead well generally what
you're going to see is instead you'll
get everything up to this point no
problem but instead what we'll have what
users will do is they're going to return
globe X with example so when this
function is run it's going to return a
value and what this means is it's almost
like when you do five plus five in
Python what five plus five does is it
returns ten and so by that same token
what we can do is if you wanted to set a
value to five plus five or set a very
five plus five equal to a variable what
you would do is you would say maybe x
equals the function of example and now
print oops print X save and run that we
see that we were able to do that so this
is one way that you can actually end up
modifying this and within the main loop
let's say without using global variables
because again some people really just
are very anal about global variables so
hopefully that helps some of you guys
out especially with the whole accessing
this local variable but then not being
able to modify it so hopefully save you
guys from pull out your hair this is
something that did give me some trouble
when I was starting out so well if I
save you guys some of that so hopefully
you guys enjoyed as always thanks for
watching things for all the supporting
subscriptions and until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
