tutorial in this tutorial we're going to
be discussing putting HTML within PHP
and then putting PHP within HTML so
you've already seen us put HTML
initially at least into PHP in the
previous tutorial where we put these
strong tags so first let me just show
you throwing in a quick PHP script
within an HTML script so what we're
going to go ahead and do is make a quick
just HTML input text box so and again if
you're not too familiar with HTML just
follow along HTML it's really really
basic and there's plenty of tutorials I
might have in tutorials on the HTML at
some point if I do I'll just edit this
and append or put up one of those little
annotations or something but anyway
we're gonna put an input type equals
text
oops tags and we'll say value equals and
what value is is like what's going to be
in that that text box initially like
before someone actually types so that
value what if we made that value be some
sort of PHP script that derives the
value so let's add PHP tags and let's
make the script so there's our tags
question mark PHP and then ends with a
question mark closing tag and within
those PHP tags let's say we want to echo
the language so we'll just echo dollar
sign length for the for our variable
that's defined up here as always with
PHP end with the semicolon even though
this is really one line so I guess you
went in half to end with that semicolon
but you might as well get used to put in
that semicolon so and at least I might
as well get used to it so I'm going to
keep doing it so anyway this is really
HTML and then we've got a short but
is a PHP script within the HTML so with
that let's save it and let me put this
up on the server hopefully I didn't typo
anything I like to typos and we'll run
it and it says welcome to PHP oh we
didn't remove that but that's okay but
as you can see we've got this text box
and the default value in this text box
is indeed PHP but of course we can
delete that and type whatever we want so
let's pop back over here and let's get
rid of this HTML or actually let's just
change up the HTML a little bit and
let's just say the value here is just
HTML example and let me get rid of this
echo and real quick let me pop this back
on to the server so you can see what
we're dealing with see this is HTML
outside of the PHP now and there's no
PHP within the HTML so this is just HTML
well what we can do is we can throw this
HTML within our PHP and that is going to
be just echo and then you echo a string
and what we're gonna do is literally
just copy and paste or actually cut and
paste that to the echo now if you'll
notice within this echo we've got the
text is kind of finicky here we've got
this literally going black on us and
that's because we encased everything in
a quote so it gets this single quote and
it thinks this is the end of the string
and then at this point it's like what
and then it's like okay we opened up at
a quote again and then we've got double
quotes and then things got really messy
and so in fact what we can do is we can
replace these double quotes with single
quotes first off and then what you do is
use the backslash it's above your Enter
or return key and you do that and it's
called the escape character and you just
escape all of these quotes that you
don't want to actually hold you know a
value of a quote so anyway after we've
escaped all of those the other thing you
can do instead of escaping all of these
is just encase the entire echo statement
in double quotes but for the most part I
pretty much program everything in single
quotes
but anyway yeah the options are there
for pretty much whatever you want to do
I'm pretty sure the standard usually is
actually to code everything in single
quotes and escape the inside quotes but
I have seen people that will say you
know how you should really encase
everything in double quotes but whatever
anyway save that upload it back to the
server and now as you can see we've got
PHP script here and within it we're just
echoing some HTML which will be read by
the server and inputted most likely and
we say that we see HTML example but let
me just switch this up a little bit and
say it or HTML in PHP just so you know
like it really did just get uploaded to
the server and change and we'll pop back
over here save it or refresh and yeah so
now you've got HTML within PHP so those
are the basics of PHP within HTML and
HTML within PHP you might decide to do
it whatever way for a whole variety of
reasons so anyway hopefully y'all enjoy
it as always thanks for watching and
until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
