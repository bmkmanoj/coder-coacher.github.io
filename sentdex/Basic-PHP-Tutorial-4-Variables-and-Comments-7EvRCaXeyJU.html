tutorial in this tutorial we're going to
be talking a little bit on comments
variables and just a little bit on like
string concatenation as it's called but
mostly how do you put variables with on
into a string basically so with that
let's hop right on into it the first
thing is commenting there's two ways to
comment then you can do a slash slash
and that's good for a single line of
comments as you can see when you hit
Enter and you come down no longer is it
the same color and now it's going to
throw you some errors whereas it's just
a single comment let's just do echo low
we'll save that put it back to the
server pop over to our old one will
refresh you see hello but you don't see
the this comment here now if you're
planning on commenting just like a huge
comment or you want to put up like a
list like sometimes in tutorials I want
to put up a whole different like a whole
bunch of examples or defining
characteristics for something and you
want it you'll just want to be able to
list things out without doing slash
slash this slash list you know the way
to do that to do a multi-line comment is
a forward slash star and then wherever
you want to end it star forward slash in
everything in here is now classified as
a comment so we can save that and throw
that back to the server refresh and we
still have hello
so that's comments now I'm gonna go
ahead and delete that since wasting
space so the next thing is variables so
variables are defined in the following
way use dollar sign and they can start
with any kind of letter uppercase or
lowercase and then also you can start
with an underscore you can't start with
a space and you can't start with a
number
so if you really wanted to start with
some sort of digit you know you can
either write out two or you can do like
underscore two something like that but
yeah you just can't start with the digit
as you can see it's already getting
angry with me so that's how you defined
a variable so we're just going to
literally call this bar one then you use
an equal sign and you're basically it's
like an assignment operator basically
you're assigning something to this
variable and what we want to assign to
bar one is how are you so the way that
you can use variables at least in the
echo statement is let's say you want to
do hello how are you
so you want to say hello and then what
you'll do is to put it like something to
another like to put a variable to
concatenate variable to the string use a
period that's called a full stop and
then you can just put the variable out
now what this is going to do is make
somewhat of an ugly addition like in
Python you can use either the plus sign
of the comma comma just automatically
add to space and the plus sign is not
whereas here in PHP you just have the .
so when we refresh this and we didn't
add a semicolon I'm sure yep when we
refresh this you'll see the it's kind of
jammed together so naturally what you'll
have to be used to doing is spacing
things so hello and really you want to
hear space save that and you'll put that
up to the server and you'll refresh and
now you see hello space how are you it
just looks better so that's how you add
variables and echo out variables
naturally as you get further into this
with you know using more HTML concepts
and stuff it becomes really useful to be
echoing out various variables so now
just to expand this just slightly
further let's say the first variable we
want to use is going to be name and
we're going to say name is Harrison and
we'll do age equals
99 let's say you want to do you want to
echo out hello and then you want to bold
their name and then you want to say your
ages and then you want to fold the age
you and probably gets sort of how we
might do this or a wholly how we might
do this but just as a quick example it's
good to just kind of run through this
stuff so let's say we're going to do
this hello
and then we want to do the bold the name
Harrison but when you spit out a
variable you can't you know put unless
you put literally the strong tags in
front of the variable you could do it
that way
but instead what we're gonna do is just
do strong and then we're gonna append
name and then again we want to append
some more tax you'll have to add this
space obviously we already out of the
space here and then we wanted to go
ahead and close off the strong tag so we
just want to bold the name then we
wanted to say you are and then again we
want the strong tag close that off
period age period we already opened up
that parentheses early go quotes there
and then we'll just do years for it okay
so now it should say hopefully oh we
better close off the next strong tag
close that off so now it goes hello
initiates the strong puts in the name of
Harrison space you are initiate strong
again and then says the age whatever
that is and then years old so we'll save
that put that up to the server refresh
and sure enough it builds just the name
and the age so those are the basics of
defining variables doing comments and
kind of you know starting to work in
variables and to string tags and all of
that so as always things
watching and until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
