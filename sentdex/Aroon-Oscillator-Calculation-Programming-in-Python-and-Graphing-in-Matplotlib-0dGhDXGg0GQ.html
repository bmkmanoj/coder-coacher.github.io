Python mathematics and charting stock
indicators tutorial video the last
videos that we just made with the arune
indicators right so this is where we
left off and that a rune indicator gave
us something like this when we ran it
right so we had this and actually let me
change this let's go let me change this
back to ten years not just one year 10
year data running one more time
Apple and here's our indicator so so
this is what the Arun indicator had been
giving us now the next thing is the Arun
oscillator and luckily the difference
between the Arun indicator in the room
arun oscillator is so minut that i'm
just going to do it all in this same
video so the idea of the roon oscillator
is the same as the indicator the only
difference is to is to kind of combine
these two things into one thing and then
you just usually fill between you could
just make it a single line but generally
people fill between because the it's not
necessarily a directional indicator it's
more of like an intensity indicator so
you wouldn't want it to just be a single
line you kind of want to use a fill
between just to kind of bring that point
home but anyway so that's what we're
going to be doing in this video the
calculation for it is simply the high
minus the low that's it and then the
rest of it is just kind of some
matplotlib coding to get it to fill in
between short enough for me to do it in
this video now a couple quick images of
what we'll be doing that was just the
regular like this is the image of what
we've just made right this is your a
roon normal typical Runa indicator and
this would be a typical arun oscillator
right so you've got the high minus the
low obviously as it's going up you're
gonna see it you know it goes up like
this and sure enough it's that way until
it reaches this point kind of low then
back up again and then again about this
point just after it starts saying hey
watch out and sure enough there it goes
all the way down
now the next thing I would like to do is
change this and you spill between the
make up green down red just to make it
even more clear so that will look more
like this and so we'll be doing that now
with in matplotlib so let me just stop
this from running I'm gonna come over
here and go down to where we actually
coded this which will be here now what
we all we need to do is create a couple
of new things we're gonna need to make a
new array for one so we're gonna want in
arun oscillator array that'll be an
empty array for now and then we need to
start populating it so within this while
loop we'll want to call the arun
oscillator so we're just going to give
it a simple variable here arun
underscore o SC and that's gonna equal
arun underscore up - arun underscore
down so that's really all the
calculation required for the yeren
oscillator which is why i'm just gonna
go ahead and condense it into one video
after we have to find it we're gonna
append it to this one so I'm just gonna
copy that hit paste dot append and
append arun underscore that's it now
when we go to return we want to just add
that to the end so we'll also return and
I'll just paste again since it's still
there
arun oscillator now when we come down
here and we say what this function is
going to spit out we need to add one
more variable and that's going to be a
o4 a rune oscillator now I'm going to go
ahead and silence these two bad boys
because we don't need them anymore and
now we need to do a fill between
function so the simple fill between
where it's not colored would be a x2 dot
fill underscore between and between what
a date - SP :
that's your Y or your X rather your Y
variable is going to be a Oh
- SP : then we want to feel between what
well the zero line is is the kind of
feel between line there and then we're
gonna make the face color equal to just
a non discrete white and we're gonna
give it an alpha equals zero or 0.5 and
that just kind of alpha is the measure
of how opaque something is so the more
Oh peg the more transparent or the less
Oh peg the more transparent there we go
save that looks good let's go ahead and
run it see if we did everything right
bring it over we'll plot apple sure
enough we did everything right we've got
Apple here that oscillator is all fine
and dandy now let's go ahead and talk
about how we could color it if we wanted
to so to change this we really let's say
we want to do the upward one first I'm
just going to delete all the way back to
this zero mark now you add a function
here called with we're equals something
and what we want to do is wear a o- SP :
is greater than greater than equal to
zero we would like that face color to be
green and then we want the alpha again
equals 0.5 close off your parentheses
there now we can't run this just yet
because this where Clause is gonna
require an umpire array it can't just be
a Python list so what we've got to do
now is turn this AO into an umpire array
luckily it's really simple it's just MP
dot array and just in case all the way
to the minus SP part in that and you're
all set now what I want to go ahead and
do is we're just
highlight this entire line copy back
over paste change this to red change
this to less than or equal to zero and
that's it
now let's go ahead and save that run
that plot up again we'll just do Apple
and here is our new arun oscillator
that's color coded now so it just looks
just slightly better in my honest
opinion and it's a lot more clear to
anybody who's looking at it what this
actually means so anyway that's the
conclusion to my short tutorial on the
arun oscillator short enough so we can
just jam it all into one video pretty
cool little thing you can do here with
it it makes just the chart that much
better and a lot more clear to actually
read for somebody so anyway hopefully
you guys have enjoyed as always thanks
for watching thanks for the support in
the subscriptions and until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
