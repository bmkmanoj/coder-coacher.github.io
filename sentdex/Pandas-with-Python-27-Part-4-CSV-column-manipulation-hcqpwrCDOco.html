another pandas tutorial video in this
video we're gonna be talking about is
how we can modify various columns and
stuff like this within pandas so to
start we'll just take this code here all
the way down to print D F head we can
continue printing that head there just
for now and now I want to just show you
guys some of the column operations that
we can do so first off if you wanted to
let's say only reference one specific
column in conjunction with the index you
could do something like this so for now
I'll just put a number you could just
rename what DF was so you're not storing
DFM memory and then what we're saying
here is DF 2 so you're not going to have
to in a memory but so we can kind of go
through this tutorial linearly this is
what we'll do so DF 2 is going to equal
DF and just open okay and so now we'll
say print DF 2m and the output we get is
just date and open okay so let's all we
get when we do something like that so we
we just want to specify one column
that's all we do now the next thing is
if you want to specify multiple columns
you would do something like planting
some space DF 3 equals D F and then
brackets and then we're going to make a
list so brackets within brackets and
we're going to say let's say we want to
have clothes and we also want to have
open okay so we can go ahead and now do
print the F 3 head run that oops where's
my mouse there we go and we come down
here and we have clothes open date and
all that so now we're just referencing
like those two columns now this will
work with as many columns as you want
you can make this close open high and so
on so now the next thing that we want to
do is
we could say for example let's say we
want to I guess what the next thing I'll
show you guys is we can delete columns
as well so right now df3 has these
rights got closed and open what we could
do is we could say del D f3 oops not def
del D f3 and then closed and then we'll
again print the f3 head save and run
that and now we've actually deleted that
column so a couple things that we could
do is one we could just if we wanted to
just delete one column we could do that
or you can just redefine that same
variable and dump whatever you know was
stored in there before it just depends
on what you're looking for if you're
just looking to make like one change you
might as well just delete or something
like that so the next thing that we're
going to do is we can also rename
columns so I'm gonna go ahead and get
rid of this delete for now and let's go
ahead and rename clothes so we could say
something like this DF 4 equals DF 3 and
then in brackets here we're going to say
we're actually rather the F 4 equals
let's say DF 3 dot rename and we're
going to rename columns equals and
basically where the column is equal to
close we're going to say we want to
rename back to all caps clothes okay and
then what we'll do on outside of this
bracket is we're going to say in poops
let's say in play in place equals true
and that's it now let's go ahead and
print D F for dot and save and run it
for three
I guess it's not gonna let us do what I
wanted to do well instead then what we
can do is this it's odd that I can't get
away with this anyway so we'll say DF
three equals that run it again and this
time we do get a warning but it still
comes through so it renames clothes with
all caps clothes and this warning is
something to do with like chained right
okay so anyway that could get
problematic as you go on but for our
purposes of just renaming a column
that's how you how you're going to do it
if somebody has a better way that will
annoys setting with copy warning let me
know but there's nothing wrong with
doing it this way as far as I know so
now the next thing another thing I could
show you guys is so for example we have
let's go ahead and just print DF 3 so
this will be kind of a longer version
here so this is DF 3 as you can see
we've got quite a few numbers who have
got some 1300s and 1400s well let's say
that we only want to consider where
where the value is higher than 1400 so
we can actually throw in conditionals
here so we could say something like this
we could say DF 4 equals DF 3 and then
in brackets here we're going to say DF 3
and we said close so we're gonna say
we're close is greater than 1400 volt so
we're basically throwing an if statement
into here so what we're saying is DF 4
equals DF 3 where DF 3 s close is
greater than 1400 and we can do this
also with instant all that not in sorry
strings and it's obviously in floats
whatever and you can use greater than
equal than and all that stuff so or
exactly equal to and so on so now what
we can do is we can say well it's print
DF 4 and now all we get obviously we get
this massive list but all we get is
so let's see here oh these were opens
okay so that's all I was like looking at
I was like no anyway close we can see
all of the closes here our closes where
they're above 1,400 okay so anyway those
are just some brief example of all the
things that we can do so we can
reference just a specific column we
could rename if we only wanted to
consider that column we can reference
multiple columns using the list we can
delete columns with del and we can also
select well we can change names and then
finally we can select using conditional
statements specific bits of data based
on that conditional statement that you
throw in there so those are just some
really really quick commands that we can
do there's still a whole lot of other
things that we can do with columns but
those are just some quick basics that
you're probably going to want to be able
to do so anyway that's going to conclude
