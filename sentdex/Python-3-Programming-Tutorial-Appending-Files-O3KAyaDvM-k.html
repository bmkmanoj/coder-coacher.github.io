basics tutorial video in this video
we're going to be appending a file in
Python I'll just say it again that
writing to a file will clear it while
appending will just simply add to it and
that said when you actually go to add to
the file you will still use dot right
okay so you only specify that you'll be
appending instead of writing when you
actually open the file and state your
intentions so basically let's do append
me equals and we'll do
exbest backslash n for a new line
because we want to make a new line and
then we'll say new bit of information
and that's that so you don't have to
throw in this new line if you don't want
also what some people do is before they
actually write what they intend to write
they'll just very quickly do a dot right
new line like that and they'll call like
you know a pen file that write new line
ok
so for example anyway let's just
continue on with our new line here so
we'll say a pen file equals open and
again we're going to open oops I'm going
to open example file dot txt and this
time we're going to specify our
intention a to append and then all we do
is append file dot write like I said we
still say dot right it's just we we've
writing in append mode basically what do
we want to write append me and here's
what I was saying like if we didn't have
backslash n another method you could do
is append file dot write new line like
that so there would be a new line before
the stuff that we were writing sometimes
adding a new line to a bit of
information can be hard or it just
depends it's kind of like a stylistic
sort of thing anyway when you're done
writing as usual a pen file dot close we
want to go ahead and close the file so
when you're done save and run that and
if it runs it will do nothing so to
speak and your output here but if we
head over
our folder we open up example file and
sure enough we have sample bit new line
and new bit of tip new bit of
information so our pending worked out
well so that is appending to a file now
there's one more thing that we can do
with files and that's reading from file
so we know how to write to a file how do
we read from a file so what we're going
to be covering in the next video as
always thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
