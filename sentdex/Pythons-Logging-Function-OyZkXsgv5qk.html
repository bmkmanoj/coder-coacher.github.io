concerning the logging ability of Python
which is actually built right on in so
you don't have to download anything you
just have to import logging once you
begin building larger programs
incorporating a lot of variables it can
be pretty useful to utilize logging the
logging feature also if you're maybe
like adding to the program over a long
period of time and you might forget some
of the older stuff that you had done
even and all that and not quite under
how your program typically goes also if
you're working like with a team it can
be really really helpful like when
you're collaborating to use logging just
so someone can figure out what why
something isn't quite driving with your
function or whatever it is possible to
do pretty much all of the same logging
stuff with just you know saving and
appending to a notepad file all the
stuff that I've already shown you guys
how to do but what's nice about the
logging feature is it has one built in
quote-unquote levels or hierarchical or
hierarchies for you know what kind of
log that string will be so it kind of
saves you a lot of time down the line if
you want to change the amount of logging
so to speak that you do because right
when you make the program you're gonna
do what's called debugging and you're
going to need to find you know exactly
where everything is going wrong so
you're going to do either a lot of
printing out or a bunch of logging to a
file but then over time once you've you
know worked out a lot of the bugs you're
going to not want to be printing out a
bunch of stuff or logging a bunch of
stuff to a file and so that's where this
logging hierarchy comes in and you can
also kind of customize what level of
logging you really want to do logging is
also really helpful for applications
that you deploy especially with things
like beta testing so if the users having
problems they can simply turn on
debugging mode and this will hopefully
log everything that the user is doing
and will find you exactly where the
users having a problem instead of having
to use like process and elimination and
guesswork and you can also like if you
have some sort of like user settings you
can have the triggering of
warning error or critical error log
change the logging level that's set
right so normally by default it logs
warning and above which is a good good
thing once you've finished your
debugging that makes sense but like say
the user encounters in a critical
warning or something like that then that
can trigger the logging setting to drop
down to level one debug and it logs
everything again so anyway it's just
really helpful and it's definitely
something you want to have in your
arsenal as time goes on so let's go
ahead and get into it all you have to do
is import login the next thing you'll
want to do is specify a file you don't
have to save it to a file you can just
print out on the console but generally
you're going to want to have a logging
file so you do logging dot basic config
this is basic configuration and here
you'll specify the file name that you
want to be the log file it could be
anything you can have a dot txt or dot
whatever but just for the sake of it
we're going to call it log file dot log
and then you specify the level equals
and what this is is is that level I was
just referring to this is the level of
logging that you want to do so when you
first make the program it's probably
going to be debug in all caps so this is
going to log everything right and there
are five levels of debugging and the
first one level one is just debug and
this is just a lot of detailed
information the next level is - this is
info and this is just confirmation that
things are going according to plan the
next one is the third level and that's
warning that's the default it'll be set
to if you don't specify anything here
it's just going to say warning that's
going to be the level warnings is
reserved for something unexpected
has occurred number four is error some
function fails and then finally number
five is critical something failed and
the application must close because of
this critical failure so those are the
levels and you can say right in here you
can use these debug info warning err
critical obviously written in all caps
to decide what level of stuff you want
to do but for this we're just going to
use debug oh we need to close up our
parenthesis so once you do that now
let's let's go ahead and make a main
loop we'll just define main this we're
gonna have a try and we're going to also
have an except exception e all this
stuff we've already done before then
we'll call the main loop here now let's
put some stuff within the trial oubli
let's purposely fail this try loop so
say you've got something you're going to
define a variable we're going to call
this math fail equals one divided by
zero and you can't divide by zero so
this is obviously going to break but
this is the main part of the main this
is this is it for our main loop so our
whole main loop is going to fail this
means the application is definitely
going to fail so in this exception down
here you're going to want to do logging
dot critical and you'll just want to put
in the string version of e whatever that
exception was but what your with this
you say logging so we know we want to
log this information if it's at the
correct level anyway and this is the
level that we're calling it you could
call this little warning what this is
actually a critical error because the
application will not run
so we're saying this is a critical error
please send it in so we'll save this and
this is our logging here obviously there
is no logging file but it will show up
just a moment whenever we begin our our
little program here so we'll go ahead
and run it and sure enough we didn't
actually see any error or anything like
that but obviously we got an
so we'll close this and we'll come back
we'll come over here to our log file and
we're going to open this up and here you
have a critical error root integer
division or modulo by zero so division
by zero so it's logged in this little
file for us that we had a critical error
now let's say that was deeper or
something in the program so let's say
try and since we're in the main try loop
let's go ahead and log debug we are in
the main tribe that way if you do get an
error you know that what was the last
thing we did well we entered the main
try loop and then we failed so again if
we were to run this we just ran it
failed this it big close it come over to
our log file we open that up now keep in
mind it's going to append so this was
the old air but so this is the new stuff
right here debug route we are in the
main try loop so we can close that out
we're not going to save and let's go
ahead and delete it and so we can start
a new and then down here what we're
going to do is we're going to say if one
is greater than two
logging info entered into the first if
statement and then else
logging dot info entered into the first
else statement right this is just we're
just saying what are we doing we're just
making some info this is where we are
you would also just say this is also
debug right like this is probably more
likely to be debug information to be
honest so you could say that and then we
can you do some things like hello oh
yeah these are
awesome little functions going on so in
this sense we can save this we'll run
this one and nothing really happened but
we'll come over to our log file here
we'll open up the log file and you know
okay we're in the main loop still same
thing as before kind of divide by zero
now let's do you know one more one more
example and I think you'll probably
pretty much have the get the point so
let's say we want to continue with the
safe statement if one is is less than to
do these things print hello and then try
we'll try URL Lib two dot open or yeah
it's URL open is the correct thing URL
open HTTP colon slash google.com da tree
we're going yeah we're going to read
that but oops we didn't import URL Lib
too so finally accept Nessie in here
this isn't gonna this isn't something
that's going to break the entire script
it could I suppose if you if you didn't
have these tried except here that would
indeed break the entire script but in
this case it's not going to break the
entire script and the only reason here
that it did break the entire script is
nothing in our script was able to run so
we called it a critical error but in
this one I want to really call this a
critical error it's more like what is
called an error so you would say you
know like logging error because this
function whatever we're attempting to do
here has failed but the rest of the
script is going to continue working and
everything else worked fine but this is
kind of messed up so you would just say
logging error and then I would say yes
probably we would just call it a
function probably but we would say the
URL up to URL visit failed
filled for the reason of these % as we
get started getting really fancy and
then we'll say oops not that this and
then we're going to say % e I guess
we'll say stringy this so it's going to
log this right
yes a URL it to your visit failed for
the reason of % s which just means this
some sort of string and then this is
saying this string and then the string
version of e so you know we've done this
before with the how to work with
exceptions and just print out that
exception so we're going to pop back on
over here and let's save this let's run
it let it do its thing it's going to
save to that log file we're going to
close out of this come over to our log
file open up our log file ah and we
didn't even get past it because of the
stupid division by zero error so let's
pop back over to our division by zero
comment that out I was getting in our
way before as well so we printed out our
hello so we know we at least got this
far you can also use the debugging to
print to the console as well so anyway
we're going to close this out we'll come
back over to our log file open it up and
then we see in our log file that air
root your lib to URL visit failed for
the reason of and then this is the error
that is saved to the exception right
this is kind of like the stuff that
would be printed out and read on your
IDE so you can even save you know
variables that are generating
dynamically into your log file and with
that I'm just going to show you let's
say your your pass to debug so like we
only want to log
running now so we'll save this let's
close out the we'll just delete this
come back to it in a second we'll
minimize that save it run it print out
our hello probably got to URL Lib -
failed so let's bring that back up
here's a log file open that up and sure
enough the only thing it printed out for
us it didn't print the debugging stuff
didn't print the info stuff it only
printed out our error problem and which
was of course the URL of to the visit
failed because of this reason here so
anyway that's basically it to the login
function there's a few more intermediate
to experience details that you can use
with this login function but for the
most part this is it this is what you
want to use logging for it's definitely
a great little addition to any big
program that you've got and then also
again if you're going to be deploying
out programs to use you definitely want
to have logging brought into it and it
also saves time as far as debugging
purposes or concerned you know whenever
you want to debug you can just boom flip
this into debug mode instead of warning
mode and you're set</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
