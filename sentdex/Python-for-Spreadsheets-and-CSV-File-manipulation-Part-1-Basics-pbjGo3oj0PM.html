this tutorial be covering spreadsheet
manipulation within Python I believe at
least in Excel you can do pretty big
commands and I think there's a few other
like spreadsheet applications that you
can purchase and I don't know anything
about like max and all that but I know I
don't have Excel and the Google Docs
spreadsheet doesn't really give you the
opportunity to apply the bulk amount
like let's say you want to apply a
formula to a hundred thousand rows
there's no way to do that immediately at
least not that I know of if you do know
away great also the other downside is
you can't really apply a really tricky
formulas and if you can it's like you
add 15 layers at least to that
trickiness right to do it within a
spreadsheet it's just like really
confusing with the whole columns and
rows and the numbers and the symbols and
it's just a huge mess so if you can
learn to do the manipulation within
Python just makes things a lot easier so
so that's what we're going to do in this
video as long as you already have Python
great if you don't already have Python
then you need to pop over to python org
and download Python one sec I'll bring
it over so this is Python org all you do
is go to download and download Python
2.7 and get either 64-bit or 32-bit
depending on your system so once you
have that the next thing that we're
going to need is actually numpy I
imagine a lot of my viewers already have
numpy but if you don't then you're going
to go over to Google here and oh cool is
falling apart again this is why we can't
have nice things
guys anyway we're going to search a
numpy Python 2.7 here search that oh
goodness
so probably the best thing to do we get
to the pi pi package index and download
and install for python 2 7 now if you're
operating on a 64-bit version of python
then this will not
now it's not going to work out for you
very well so the next thing you're going
to want to do if you're on 64-bit Python
which you should be so if you ever want
to edit files larger than two gigabytes
you can the other option is to go to
this website over here and we put the
I'll try to remember to put this link in
the description but here's a bunch of
binaries for Python and you can download
64-bit binaries so we can go a numpy
here and all of these packages require
numpy so that's why we're fining a bunch
of it but eventually we get to number I
and this will be where you want to
download if you have a 64-bit you'll
download this one right here and that'll
make it real easy to get numpy so once
you've done that you'll want to make
sure that you've done it so go over to
your Start bar bring up the Python
command line looks something like this
and if you don't know what bit version
of python you have you can kind of
scroll over and see right here it'll
tell you and I have 64-bit and make sure
you can do the following import coups oh
my goodness can't type import numpy like
that and as long as you don't have any
errors you're free to continue if you
have errors and you can't figure it out
leave a comment below and I'll do my
best to help you out with that let's go
ahead and get right to it so I've got a
blank Python window here if you don't
how to get there go to your Start bar
type in IDE and what will pop up is
something pretty similar to what we were
just looking on actually it looks like
this you can go to file new window opens
up this little untitled window then you
can save it make sure when you hit save
you save it as whatever the file type is
plus py so let me bring it over and I'll
hit save as and you'll see here there's
a bunch of files here you know first of
all pick whatever directory you're going
to be working in but when you save the
file name you'll just do file name and
don't forget to do dot py otherwise I'll
save it as like a regular file and it's
really annoying so once you've done that
you should have you know window like
this I'm calling mine CSB minute so the
first thing that we're going to need to
do is go ahead and import numpy as NP
just so we can shorthand the numpy when
we need it next we're going to define
our main and within here
I'd like to put everything and try and
accept loops that makes it easier when
the program fails so I'm going to put
try and then accept exception with a
capital e and then we're going to call
that an e and then we'll just print
string e now in our try loop this is
where we're going to actually start
using numpy so the file that I've got
here is going to be to cheat dot CSV so
it's just kind of a sample file here and
in fact I'm going to do y'all a solid
and give you guys this exact sheet one
sec so if you want to follow on exactly
what the tutorial go-to syntax comm
slash and Tut sheet dot CSV hit enter
and that will download the to the same
sheet that I'm working with so you can
work alongside with exactly the same
stuff that we're using you don't have to
but you don't have to but it will it
could make it easier if you're confused
so with that this is the file as you can
see we've got date here we've got this
little arbitrary name here we're saying
gbp/usd we've got an arbitrary number
here as we can see it really is
separated by a comma
spreadsheets don't have to be literally
CSV which stands for comma separated
variable but they can and this one is
going to be so what we're going to do
now is with numpy numpy has a built-in
functionality called load text it's also
got something like gen text or something
like that that you can use it just it
really doesn't matter so the next thing
that we're going to do is define the
variables here and as you can see we've
got like date this is a Forex rate or
ratio so it will just say date here rate
and then we'll call this arbitrary
number or something so what we do is you
define the variable so date array and
then parb for arbitrary number and this
these three variables will equal NP for
that numpy that we short-handed load
text so load txt and the file path if
the files in the same directory as this
script then you can just do what I'm
doing here and just type it in so touch
sheet dot CSV
and uh the next thing we can specifies
the delimiter so I'll just come down yes
here and say delimiter equals and our
delimiter is a comma in this case it can
be anything you want this you just
specify it here and unpack needs to be
true so we can do this right here so we
can specify like multiple variables and
then finally D type is going to need to
be string and that is because date is a
string variable and so is the label even
so we need that to be that way now the
next thing we're going to do here in the
last part of this video anyways is just
show you guys how this works if you're
not comfortable with this like multiple
variable kind of thing but if like say
we want the right here this is each
column right this is the date column so
everything like in date it'll print out
all of the dates in that comma or column
so if we just call date or let's just
print date like this we'll save that and
let's run that and we haven't called
main yet so we'll just type out main to
call it and this gives us an array of
all of our dates subsequently the next
thing you could do is you can do like
date you get like the five it's not the
fifth element it's actually the sixth
element everything starts at zero just
in case you didn't know date and then
rate five and arm five we'll run this
again and if you don't know how to run
anything I guess I didn't say anything
but there is a run button here or you
can hit f5 and again we'll call main and
now we can see the sixth row the day
gbpusd and the numbers and obviously
they're not comma separated you could
kind of like superimpose some in there
but you don't need to so those are just
the basics of like loading it getting
numpy if you don't have in python if you
don't have it and how this works in the
next video i'm gonna be showing you guys
how to actually be in manipulation now
if all you really wanted to do is say
get rid of a column you could just
basically leave it out and then make a
for loop which I'll show you guys in a
little bit but if you could do this
where it just prints the date in the
arbitrary number right and so you've
already taking it out so
can get removed columns pretty easily
now you're going to move columns really
easily in like Google Docs and most
spreadsheets as well so I imagine the
application of formulas to rows and
making like a new column is what most
people are interested in so we will be
getting to that but in the next video so
as always thanks for watching thanks for

until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
