something like the statistics module now
it'd be a pretty good time to talk about
the syntax for importing modules and all
the kind of tricks that we can do with
importing modules because if you're not
familiar you might see some example code
you might not understand how they're
doing something or how they're able to
reference a module or a function within
a module without actually saying the
module and all this stuff so I'm going
to show you guys some of the various
ways that you can import a module to do
exactly how what you want I guess
so with that let's go ahead an get
started so we're going to go ahead and
get rid of this and so you've seen for
now import statistics and so the idea
here is we import statistics and then we
can use this module now module is just
an Athan script for the most part some
modules are a little more in-depth but
this is a Python script and so I can
even show you guys this we can go to
your computer see python 3 for lib and
within lib is where you're going to find
all of your kind of like vanilla modules
the ones that come with python and then
all your third-party modules genuine
generally are going to be installed
under site packages so these are all
your third-party modules now statistics
comes with it so we can actually just
find stats statistics whoops
statistics and we can find say for
example the mean module we can search I
bring it down here search for like
define mean like that and here is our
mean function so this is the block of
code that is run when we reference mean
okay so that's all it is it's just a
Python script okay so we'll get out of
here minimize this and now we can go
over something so statistics while not
super long it's kind of a long name we
might maybe we don't want to type out
statistics every single time it's kind
of a tedious thing to type out so when
you do this you can say import
statistics as s and now every time you
want to reference statistics you just
have to type s so instead of statistics
dot variance you could do s variance we
could run that we didn't have it
printing out so let's go ahead and prove
X and now you get your variance of four
point eight five okay so we're able to
reference it just with a simple s now
the other thing that you can do as well
is say you don't even want to type s you
just want to say variance well you can
do that as well
and that's going to be from statistics
is why we want to do it as s it's a pain
to type so from statistics import
variance and now you don't even need an
S dot now you could reference it
straight as variance like that okay so
you can do that so now the next thing
that we can do of course though is from
statistics import variance if you don't
want to type variance you could say
import variance as V right so now
instead of variance we can just say x
equals V example list run that and again
that still works now the next thing that
we want to do like let's say we want to
import a few things from statistics so
variance and we want mean so x equals
variance example list y equals mean
example list and then we'll have it
print y and so here under this we can
see that we were able to use these
commas right so when we go and run it
we've we were successful in pulling out
the two functions from this module and
leaving the rest and then we're also
referencing them as you know the
function name because we can just import
statistics and the new statistics dot
and we when we import statistics we've
imported everything anyways so but we
still what if we don't want to type
variance mean well we can do still like
this import variance SV mean as M so we
can change this to be change this to M
and everything works as we hope so
we're able to do that now the last thing
I want to cover is what if you know we
want to import everything from
statistics but we don't want to have to
put statistics that well we can do
something else we can say from
statistics import
asterisk and what the asterisk means is
everything it's for regular expression
that just means everything
so basically we're importing everything
as if we typed everything out so now we
can say variants mean like this we never
actually imported them but we we said
import everything and then in this
scenario we don't actually have to type
statistics either so we can do this
and that works as as expected so that's
it
obviously we can't really necessarily
get away with import everything as
because everything can't have the same
name but we can't import everything just
in case you wanted to do that so there's
a few of the examples of how we can do
the import importing of modules and the
functions within them depending on what
exactly you're trying to do with that
module if you want everything in that
module or maybe you want one thing in
that module or maybe you want to import
that module as if you had written that
code you know in the functions within
your single scripts but you want to have
it in its own separate script whatever
you can do all that so if you guys have
any questions or comments feel free
