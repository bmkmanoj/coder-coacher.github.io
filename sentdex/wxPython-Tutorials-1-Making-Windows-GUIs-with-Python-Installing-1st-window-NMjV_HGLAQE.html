awesome tutorial series this series is
going to be covering in WX Python so
what is WX python WX Python is a
cross-platform toolkit used for making
gooeys or graphical user interfaces this
is done so the end-user doesn't actually
have to communicate with the Python
interpreter window writes it so nobody
wants to like develop programs and have
to deal with like this or like a DOS you
know prompt it's just a plain more
user-friendly way to make programs and
have users use those programs WX python
itself is actually just kind of like a
wrapper around the language C++ now what
that means is WX python itself is not
actually coded directly in Python and so
it's more of like a Python interpreter
kind of like you have a Python
interpreter that you installed on your
system because your computer didn't
naturally understand Python so the main
purpose with WX python is of course to
create windows looking windows or as
they're called in WX python in
programming frames so with WX python you
can make all kinds of things like
regular windows toolbars scroll bars
dialogs pop-ups buttons etc and then
also all these things like you can use
what are called event handlers so like
if the user clicks a button it does this
or clicks the window it does this so he
can do all kinds of really cool things
with these windows so to get w.x Python
and start coding you're going to have to
visit WX Python org which I've pulled up
here and you'll want to scroll down to
download let's see if I can find it
myself download and you want stable
version not the development version so
we'll click that and here we go and this
is going to be the one that I want here
which is Python 2.8 I want the 32-bit
version to match my Python you should
pick whatever version of python you have
however so I'll just click that will
download the installer here and here it
comes now we'll just I'll pause the
video while we wait for this to come on
once it's done obviously it's a
loads or you just click it to open that
up and you're just go ahead and run
there and here we go with the Installer
next I'll accept this just says where
it's going to install it and that this
is just to make the its will just go
next and so that's going to install WX
python on my machine and your machine do
that in these alright and it's over here
just fixing up some of the files for us
and now to make sure let's test the
installation so we'll restart our Python
interpreter bring it over here and say
import WX and as long as it doesn't yell
at us looks like we did it right alright
so now we're back to the typical Python
Idol and so that concludes pretty much
the installation but again just like my
n ltk tutorial feel bad making the first
video being only the installation so
let's make our first window at WX Python
so of course to use WX Python you'll
need to import W X subsequently now
we're going to start defining things
that we want our window to do alright
then I just and what we want to do is
define app and every W X Python must
have this so that's just going to be W X
dot app the next thing that we're going
to do is we actually have to make the
window or as I refer to it earlier the
frame so we're just going to call it
Frank
equals W X dot frame and then within the
parameters you have a few different
things to call now we're just going to
say the parameters within here we're
just going to say none negative wine and
then we'll put the title of this frame
kind of like this has a title which is
basically the name of the script and
then the location of the script you can
put this anything you want so we're
going to say this is the window title
we'll just put that in there you can
call it whatever the heck you want to
call it though and basically what we're
saying within these parameters here we
can go into detail them later but
basically the frame is a widget and what
we're saying here is this is the parent
widget for any other widgets so
basically when we when you say none
there it just means that like it's a
parent widget itself so kind of like the
graphing tutorials a lot of God if
you've been watching those once you
actually like define something all we've
done is defined it we haven't actually
called it up so next thing you want to
do is call it to show and that's just
frame dot show and then finally we'll
just make this line here a app dot main
loop and all this does is kind of
interesting to like a main loop so
everything that happens during the event
of like this window is going to be
captured but again we'll go more into
that later so we'll just save this and
we'll run it and up pops our a little
window here and as you can see we've got
window title and but that's it there's
nothing in here eventually we're going
to have you know menu items maybe
something in here and we'll do some
cooler stuff but for now this is what we
have just a window title but already
this is pretty darn impressive because
there's all kinds of things to it you've
got this year you know even just the
title you got the little image here you
can move it around on your screen you
can resize it you know all these things
that even though like this is such a
stupid little window that doesn't
actually give us any utility it's
actually a lot of coding behind even
just this window so pretty cool that
we've already coded this window so
that's going to conclude this tutorial
stay tuned for more tutorials on WX
python there's a lot of cool things that
you can do with in here and it's kind of
enjoyable because there's a lot of
customization that you can do along the
way so stay tuned and thanks for
