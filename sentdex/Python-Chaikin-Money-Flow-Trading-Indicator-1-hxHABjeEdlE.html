Python mathematics and stock indicators
tutorial video this video we're going to
be talking about the shake and money
flow the shake and money flows intention
is to measure money flow into and out of
a stock it's created by mr. mark jaqen
and it acts as an oscillator and
oscillates above and below a zero line
the calculation of the shake and money
flow is in three steps basically it's
going to be closed minus the low minus
the high minus to close divided by the
high minus low then the next step is
going to be to take step 1 otherwise
known as the money flow multiplier and
multiply that by the time frames period
total volume so the time frame periods
total volume sorry I couldn't get that
quite out step three would be to take
that time frame sum of step two which is
known as the money flow volume and
divide that by that time frames periods
total volume so let's look at a couple
examples here I'll bring up the charting
application that we'll be working on and
let's look at Apple so here is Apple the
shaking money flow is the bottom
indicator there and as you can see it
oscillates here's the zero line it's
oscillating up and down bolt one of the
more useful things that you can do is is
actually make it make the zero line and
then fill above and below that line with
a colored fill so let me show you an
example of with a colored fill so let's
look at Apple again and this time we can
obviously see Apple with a nice colored
fill so the idea is to show you when
money is either entering the stock or
when money has been leaving the stock so
even here you can see that it's really
strong it's pretty strong but it's
weakening it's continues to weaken and
it gets pretty weak here though it
continues obviously holding up some sort
of money except continues going up but
then you can see as it crashes down here
we can see really that money is leaving
this stock pretty solidly so we can look
at another one
we can check out maybe Amazon so here's
a good one where it continues rising and
you can just see it where you know that
especially here - and then here where a
lot of money is that we've shown to
possibly enter the stock and then all
through here I mean this would be a
really really strong shaking indicator
here showing this pure growth pretty
interesting so that's some examples of
the shake and money flow oscillator here
now in the next video we're actually
gonna be working out how to calculate
this within Python and in the subsequent
video after that will actually chart it
up just like this will chart it on this
chart so anyway stay tuned for those
videos as always thanks for watching
thanks for the support and subscriptions
and until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
