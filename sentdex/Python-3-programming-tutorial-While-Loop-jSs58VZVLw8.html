Python 3 on the while loop the while
loop is used to perform an operation
while a condition is whatever you set
right so the while loop is very much
like the next loop the for loop and
they're interchangeable so it really
just comes down to personal preference
so let's go ahead and show an example so
now what I want to say is let's just say
to make things you know super simple
we'll say condition y equals 1 so
whereas condition is a variable and
we're assigning the value of 1 to the
condition ah the next thing we're going
to say is Wow condition is less than 10
so we're actually using something called
an assignment operator we will talk a
little bit more on those uh in probably
a couple videos but for now this should
make total sense to you you should be
able to read this and be like ok that
makes sense so while the condition is
less than 10 what do we want to do well
for now let's just print whatever the
condition is and now we're now we're
going to use another thing that I was
trying to show you guys earlier but for
whatever reason it yelled at me and
we're going to do condition plus equals
1 and what plus equals does is it takes
that variable and adds one to it so plus
equals you might be thinking why didn't
you just do condition plus one why not
that well the reason why you don't do
that is condition plus one will just
yield a value but it won't actually
assign that value to anything so
condition plus equals one is really the
only thing that's equal to can do the
same operation as plus equals will be
condition equals condition plus one now
as you can see uh this is a much shorter
way to do that but that this is what
it's doing it's just taking the previous
value and adding one to it so we'll do
that
while it's less than 10 it's going to
add one to it and then obviously
eventually it's going to get to the
point where it's no longer less than 10
and this while loop will stop or break
so let's save and run that one and as we
can see we ran all the way through 1 2 3
4 5 6 7 8 9 and stop so as you can see
when it did become 10 it didn't run
because 10 is not less than 10 so um so
that's one of the neat things you can do
now the other thing probably the most
common use for me uh with the while loop
is the following so I actually prefer
the next loop that I'll be showing you
guys more but while does have a nice
little thing for it and that is called
the Wow true loop and what's nice about
this is it makes what's known as an
infinite loop now sometimes the infinite
loop is something that you don't want
but other times the infinite loop is
something you do want so in order to
make your own little infinite loop you
can do while true and true basically I
means this will always run because while
true is true it runs and it's just like
this like so when you look at wow it's
almost like an if statement is being
thrown in here and I'll teach you guys
about if statements soon but condition
less than 10 basically it's asking is
that true or false is that true or false
every time through and when as soon as
it's false it stops running so that's
why when you just throw true in here
true is like a abilene so to speak in
programming terms and it's like you know
0 or 1 and so you can use true and it'll
do stuff now I haven't showed you guys
the time module yet so this is really
going to go quite crazy it's going to
print doing stuff as fast as it can so I
will warn you guys beforehand I'm sure
some of you guys have already run the
script out of it just cheer excitement
and now you're probably like oh my gosh
what do I do
well what you need to do at this point
is to break this infinite loop or any
running script you can do control hold
ctrl and press C and that will break the
script so let's go ahead and and run
this bad boy so run it save it run it
and it's just like going crazy printing
stuff right it's just wrong
so to break it control see and it might
take a second because I let it go for a
while so it probably has quite the queue
yes it is going for a while I shouldn't
have talked so much
there it goes finally man anyway so if
it doesn't happen initially for you it's
just because it had so many you know
that it got behind because the this
little console here is pretty slow if
you did the same thing like in an actual
you know you executed the script control
see usually is instantaneous pretty much
so anyways that's the while loop
hopefully you guys understand the idea
here um and in the next tutorial what
we're going to cover is the for loop
typically the wow loop is most used as a
form of counter right so it's just it's
there to count something that's where I
honestly see it use the most but
actually the for loop and the while loop
can be completely interchangeable so the
while loop can do what a for loop does
and a for loop can do what a while loop
does it just comes down to preference I
tend to like the for loop better but it
really doesn't matter so anyway that's
what we're gonna be doing in the next
video is the for loop hopefully you guys
learn something new hopefully you guys
are enjoying the tutorials as always
