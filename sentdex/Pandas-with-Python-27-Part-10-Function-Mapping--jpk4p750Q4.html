another Python and pandas tutorial video
in this video we're going to be talking
about is function mapping so the idea
this is you know with pandas get a lot
of really great built-in operations that
we can do I'm but we might come to a
point where we find that there's not
either either either isn't a built-in
operation or we don't know it with pins
and so this is where function mapping
comes into play and function mapping
still works pretty well with pandas so
that's what I'm gonna be showing you
guys today so the first thing I want to
do is go ahead and just delete
everything after the definition of DF
I'm just really no point to have the
rest of this stuff here so we'll delete
that I'll make some more space and now
write in code so now it's defined just a
simple function this is going to be a
stupid simple function just to show you
guys that first of all it will be Rho by
Rho it will still iterate through the
row a row by row rather and trying to
figure out how to how to say this it
basically will work as if like you would
basically just build the function as if
you were building it or as if it was a
function built into pandas so let me
just show you guys an example let's say
define function and then this function
is obviously gonna have some data that's
passed through it so now we're going to
say x equals and we got import random
let's just import random here import
random so x is equal gonna equal random
dot R and range and it's gonna be a
random range 0 to 5 and then we're going
to just say return return data times X
Wow there we go day 2 times X and so
what we're going to do is we're going to
pass a single column through here and
the data parameter is going to be that
whole column we're just going to use it
we're going to pass through that pandas
calm and then x is equal a random 0 to 5
and what you'll find is that it for
every row it's a random 025 multiple
okay so this is how we know it's
iterating through all the rows and
instead of data we could pass through
all of the columns or three columns you
can you could put data data to day 3 and
or column one column to come through
whatever you want to call the parameters
and you can perform functions on those
parameters so for now we'll just do one
column one parameter and it's just going
to be a random range just kind of prove
to you that it's really is iterating and
doing random things per row and so
anyway we'll see that in a second so now
we're gonna say DF and then we're gonna
say multiple because it's a multiple do
you have got multiple equals and then we
say map and then this parts a little
tricky but it's not too fancy now we're
going to say that the function that we
want to map and that's going to be um
shin and then instead of putting in you
know more parentheses here for the
parameters instead what we do is we say
function comma and then we put the
parameters in and this one only has one
parameter so we're just going to put
that one parameter but that parameter is
DF close now what we do is print d f dot
head save and run it and now we can see
here's our multiple column right here
and you can see here that we you know
one of them looks like it x 2 next one
was 0 next one's probably three or four
and then in the next one the same thing
again and then it's 0 so as you can see
already just with these few we
definitely had different ones so it's
definitely contingent by row and then it
does the entire function itself by row
so really quite simple to make your own
function so obviously you could do all
kinds of things yourself now with this
and you can also pass through things
like you could say
you can reference previous data points
and all that with with going through
function mapping so there's this pretty
much opens the door for anything that is
not included in pandas yet you want to
kind of use the efficiency of pandas
because this is going to iterate through
kind of like in generator form instead
of a typical for loop that you might
write so it's still going to be pretty
efficient it may not be the most
efficient code since you know what
you're writing in here might not be a
very efficient but you'll still be able
to utilize pandas and then once you're
done it's still in the pandas dataframe
you can still do everything else that
you've always done in panda so that's
just like a quick example of what you
need to do to map a function so you can
kind of keep working with pandas it just
in case panda just have an operation
that you really need you can write it
and then map it so anyways that's it
with this video if you guys have any
questions you're coming soon below as
always thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
