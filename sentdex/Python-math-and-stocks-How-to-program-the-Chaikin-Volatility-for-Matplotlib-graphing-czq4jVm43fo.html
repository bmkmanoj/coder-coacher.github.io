hello and welcome to another stock
indicators of mathematics tutorial video
in this video we're going to be talking
about how we actually finally graph our
shake and volatility indicator so if you
didn't already do it you have to get the
sample code from my website and this
would be the sample code link will be in
the description go ahead and just
highlight all of that copy that paste
that so now that's going to plot up a
chart with an empty bottom indicator now
the next thing that we want to do is
actually take our old calculation hear
everything we just did we don't need
this top stuff we don't need EMA we
already do that but we are in need %
change and shake and volatility all the
way down to the actual column of that so
copy that come over here and just paste
that in and we bring this over now and
then when you're done highlight it a
home and then hit tab tab and get to go
to where we want it finally we want to
say since this returns to variable data
sets basically we can say CBD shake and
volatility date cv4 shaking volatility
equals that and now let's actually plot
those so it's going to ax 2 dot line and
we want to plot cvd minus SP colon um
that's just like our starting point if
you want to know more about why we're
doing that it's just so the data lines
up and if you want to know even more
about that watch my charting stocks in
Python in that pilot tutorial series
minus SP comb and then we want to make
this line a white line then we're also
going to do plot dot y label and that
will be shaking ball 10 10 and then the
color for this will be white that's
really it so let's go ahead and run that
so press f5 get that to run and let's
look at 80
so here is our shake and volatility for
18 p shaking ball 1010 let's fit it to
screen here got the wrong area so here
we have shaking volatility as its
crashing it's going up and it continues
going up and again hearing a volatile is
going up also is going on so anyway that
would be our shaking volatility let's
look at another one real quick and we
can probably stop printing out shaking
volatility so can rerun that again let's
look at Apple so here is our apple graph
again the volatility really Rockets up
here except you look you might not be
able to see it in my video but if you're
looking at it yourself you can see we're
kind of a price did kind of crash a
little bit there now as it flat lines
here you can see how volatility really
came down to the zero mark and so on so
anyway that's going to conclude the
shaking volatility calculation tutorial
video hopefully you guys enjoyed
hopefully learn something new as always
thanks for watching thanks for all the
