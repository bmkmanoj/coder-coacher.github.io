welcome to another Python 3 basics
tutorial video in this video what we're
going to be talking about is Python
lists versus tuples so they can be kind
of confusing at times and you might
consider a tuple a list and you might
not understand why you're unable to do
things with it so the grand if both of
them are lists right you know by the
definition of a list you know and in the
world both of them are lists but a tuple
is immutable and a list is mutable and
what that means is a tuple we can't
change it okay so once you define that
tuple you can't be modifying that tuple
a Python list on the other hand we can
modify we can add values remove values
change values um sort the you know order
and all kinds of stuff so that's the
difference how do we define them well
the definition of a tuple is basically
anything where L is we could say x
equals 5 6 2 &amp;amp; 6 okay that's a tuple
because we don't have anything around it
so it's a tuple the other way that you
can define a tuple would be x equals and
then using these round brackets 5 6 2 6
these are both tuples okay and then you
got a Python list so we can say Phi or Y
Z equals and then we can divide 6 to 6
that's a Python list and the only reason
or the only way that we know that's a
list is with the square brackets and
Python just recognizes this as the case
so what's the point of this so a lot of
times like in my programming I rarely
use tuples for anything other than
sequence unpacking which will show in a
moment and that's really it so but there
might be other times where you want to
maybe pass some information through also
if you have a list not a Python list but
let's say a list of data that you know
you don't want to change or you want to
make sure it doesn't change then you
would use a tuple because it's tuple is
going to generate faster and it's going
to be iterated through faster than a
Python list that's about it so anyway a
popular example of when people use
tuples would be something like this so
say you have an example function
and this example function after a bunch
of code blah blah blah it returns a 15
and a 6 so returns to values what you
want to do sometimes is you want to say
XY equals example and what that's going
to do is it's going to sign the return
values of this example function to X
into y and it's very important that it
stays in that order okay so this is why
a a tuple is important in some scenarios
now this isn't the only scenario that
someone will use a tuple again if you
wanted to iterate through a huge list in
quotes like not a Python list but a huge
group even groups not a good word that's
very hard to find a word that isn't like
something that's defined in Python but
anyway a huge assortment of data you're
going to want to use a tuple if you
don't want it to change or you don't
need it to change ever and so on but if
you want it to change and be mutable
you're going to want to use a list so um
that's about it
at least with a tuple for example let's
say let's just delete all of this here
and we'll leave this okay with a tuple
let's say you want to reference data
within this group of assortment of data
I'm having such a hard time picking up
arrays so we can do X 1 like this and
what this means so you've got the print
X as in exhale and then we've got square
brackets and then one what this is
saying is we want to know the one I
guess is the better way to say it the
one element because basically when you
have a list or a tuple or whatever a
group of data the values when they are
exploded let's say into all their little
indexes so each one of these numbers
here has its own index and the index is
start at a value of zero not one zero so
this is the zero with element this is
the first element second element in the
third element okay so they start at zero
it's kind of hard to get used to it
first but you'll get used to it so now
with that tuple we can still kind of we
can
so um ask questions against the tuple so
the first element was a6 sure enough no
problem we can also do basically the
exact same thing so we'll just
copy-paste
we'll say Y the first is actually say
the second element so we should get it
to 6 minute - sure enough so that's how
we can reference data the other thing
that we could do obviously would be you
know you can print you know want and
then and so what just Y - we can say y2
and y3 that we want to print out like
that and that's really it so um those
just this is a very basic notion of
accessing data that's within a tuple or
a list the next video is going to be
much more in depth as far as list
manipulation accessing all this
searching and all this fun stuff like I
said generally you're going to use a
tuple I guess I can't really speak for
everybody at least for myself I rarely
use tuples except for sequence unpacking
that's really about it otherwise I just
use a list now if you're looking for
efficiency or you have a huge list it
might make sense to use a tuple but
again if you use like a generator which
will probably cover later on the
difference I don't really think is that
big so anyway you'll probably find
yourself using lists more they're much
more programming friendly and oftentimes
you are going to want to modify a list
so anyway now fond that we will cover
that in the next video if you guys have
any questions or comment about this
