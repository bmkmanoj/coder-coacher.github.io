tutorial where we left off we were doing
the while and for loops i thought i
might do the for each loop but i think
we'll hold off on that till we have
discussed a raised real quicks that's
really what four th is mostly for us
running through like an array or a list
so with that let's pop into the switch
statement so with that let's just define
a variable to say example bar is the
variable and we'll say example bar
equals two so to set up a switch if you
haven't guessed it will be switch
parameter and then what to do as always
and so what we can do with this is will
say the parameter is example bar and
then down here we specify what to happen
in various cases so the purpose of
switch is almost like if you found
yourself wanting to do a bunch of if
statements so if you were thinking okay
I want if if example bar is one do this
if example bar is to do this if example
of our is three do this up the best
scenario for you would be the switch
statement so the next thing you'll do
once you'll once you have it is you'll
say case one you'll will just say if its
case one we're going to echo I guess we
should is echo case one then what you'll
do is come over here and you'll just
call for a break then immediately you'll
specify case two and then we'll go ahead
and echo case to open up a break break
case three echo
three oops space here and then of course
great and a good thing to do just like
if you had like if if if in a switch
state like if you just had a bunch of
ifs it wouldn't be a big deal if you
didn't have anything in the switch
statement it's not really the hugest
deal it just won't spit anything out but
you can also specify a default so it'd
be like if if if if if if else but you
so the default same thing will just echo
of people that make sense break and then
we close the switch statement already so
what we'll go ahead and do is save this
and put it up and will refresh parse
error I left a colon out somewhere in
our variable and forgot my gray let's
try again we'll get there we'll get
there there we go k stew because the
variable was indeed to so what happens
if we put a string variable in here in
fact what happens if we turn to itself
into a string and just so you know that
we have appended or change this will
just add ! there refresh of 0 to 0 root
save I guess I forgot to save it or
something yes
fresh there it is case two actually its
case too anyway so yeah you can put it
in string as well and so it's basically
doing if you recall equals equals not
equals equals equals so by the same
token you could say Johnny is our
example bar we'll save that pop over
here refresh and you can see up we got
the default but we can also throw Jonny
into a case course in case Johnny pops
up little echo there's Johnny and will
of course escape this quote come down
and we'll break as well and make this
pretty just save that fresh and sure
enough there's Johnny so anyway that's
pretty much the switch statement so
congratulations now you know the switch
statement as always thank you for
watching thanks for your support your
subscriptions and until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
