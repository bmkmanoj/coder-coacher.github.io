another Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies
video in this video we're going to be
discussing an extension of what we were
beginning to talk about in the previous
video and that's merchants and sales
people with Bitcoin one of the biggest
problems with bitcoin is just pure
misinformation I keep reading the same
simply incorrect information over and
over and if you want to read you know
the New York Times for your information
on Bitcoin yeah that's totally fine sort
of but if you don't research some of
this stuff you're gonna be in trouble
see bitcoins new it's a hot topic hot
button issue journalists right now are
being pushed and persuaded to write
articles on Bitcoin why because it sells
is a lot of traffic and interest it's
generating money the problem is bitcoin
is a massive field it's constantly
growing changing its highly technical if
you're going to start talking about it
and many journalists simply are
practicing bad journalism so first off
um the biggest con to Bitcoin that I
keep seeing thrown around by people is
that you know people wouldn't be able to
accept this as a current Sarah this
currency as a form of payment because
it's so widely volatile it just would be
risky well it's not much to say about
that except for that's just kind of like
ignorance right it may not be malicious
but but it that's just not the case so
you enter you know coinbase which we've
kind of brought up in the previous video
so what is coinbase if you're just now
tuning in coinbase is an established san
francisco-based company that basically
acts as an international bank for
bitcoin if you want to think of it that
way so at the time I mean making this
video there are one and a half years old
which in terms of bitcoins world
presence is fairly timely they have over
600,000 wallets which is since we're
using the bank account example it's the
equivalent a wallet is the equivalent of
having a bank account so you can have
multiple bank accounts you can also have
multiple wallets
also they their host to over 16,000
merchants so obviously there must be
doing something that merchants are okay
with right and they work seamlessly with
the US banking system which if you
aren't new to Bitcoin this is obviously
a very big deal to you now they have
raised over 30 million dollars for their
business which is pretty nice with a
very recent 25 million investment from
andreessen horowitz sorry if I
mispronounced his name it's that
Anderson Horowitz VC firm Anderson is
the Netscape guy so you know this isn't
some sketchy foreign no name or poor
grammar website this is a real business
real ties and real growth so back to
merchants not accepting Bitcoin because
of volatility well first why would you
know why would merchants actually like
Bitcoin because of based on the Bitcoin
model like let's just toss out coinbase
for now but why would merchants want
that model let's see you can't charge it
back which all merchants know getting a
chargeback is pretty much a loss
sometimes you can provide shipping
information or some other stuff and you
might win the chargeback most charge
backs are lost so because bitcoin can't
be charged back that's a bonus for
merchants now they're inherently with
Bitcoin no fees associated and then if
you want the transaction to go really
fast you can you can add a fee in there
and because of no flat fees it also
makes micro payments easy so merchants
can truly sell cheap goods or cheap
services which is previously really
impossible to do so for example like me
with Senator centex I have an API where
we you can you can run through sample
are some text to the API and then it
returns to you a sentiment value well
right now because of you know flat fees
I have to charge a you know like a
monthly service for this well because
like for example with paypal there's a
30-cent minimum charge on every
transaction so every transaction would
have to be thirty cents and so either I
could charge them thirty cents
/ x calls but that wouldn't work because
i wouldn't make any money or i charge
like a monthly fiance will get here's
your limit here's how many you can call
every month and that's that but with
micro payments instead what you could do
is you could literally charge a half a
penny worth of bitcoin / api call so
this is just phenomenal and if if this
continues its growth I think that we'll
see a lot of micro payments taking the
place of advertisements because also
advertisements as sort of a form of
micro payments so you visited a website
in your page view on that website it's
really worth probably a quarter of a
penny or a half a penny at best ah so
maybe not at best I mean if you click
the add that's always nice but but for
the most part that's how much your visit
is worth and so a lot of people would
argue like with with youtube for a good
example they'd rather pay a half a penny
or even less because it just depends on
what your view is worth but even
sometimes it's even less than that or a
tenth of a penny to view without ads so
so this kind of enters a whole new
market of micro payments and a way for
high quality content to access the
internet and that high quality content
not be degraded by ads so that's it's
pretty interesting stuff now that's just
a few things off the top um and I
realized the ads and micro payment isn't
necessarily exactly what everyone's
worried was but it is a bonus to any
merchant now now coinbase comes in and
offers merchants the ability to accept
Bitcoin but the real bonus the real
reason why this is important is that
you're paid in US dollars immediately
it's not like you get the Bitcoin then
you need to immediately transfer it to
US dollars yourself no coin basis
literally pays you in dollars and but
accepts the Bitcoin for you so they take
the Bitcoin but they pay you in there in
u.s. dollars so if you're selling
something for twenty dollars when that
person sends you twenty dollars of
Bitcoin coinbase takes the Bitcoin and
gives you twenty dollars so even if even
if the rare chance that as soon as they
sent you ordering while they were
sending you Bitcoin crashed fifty
percent it would
matter you would still be paid your
twenty dollars there's absolutely no
risk at all now what does coinbase take
obviously they want something for this
welcome on base is going to take one
percent now not only is this justice
safe to accept as dollars as far as you
know what's the risk of accepting you
know dollars versus accepting bitcoins
the fee is a third of credit cards and
PayPal so if you're running an online
business you're accepting credit cards
and PayPal you're probably not taking
checks so and credit cards and PayPal
both charged three percent usually and
then also maybe even more it's like an
average of three percent from credit
cards but I will mention that a little
bit and also i'll have a link in the
description for all of the various fees
that get accrued with with credit cards
they're horrible and then like paypal
charges two-point-nine percent plus a
flat rate of thirty cents so that 30
cent is what kind of eradicating actions
and um and so so coinbase will do this
for one percent so a third and coinbase
will let you do a million dollars worth
of business before taking their one
percent fee so million dollars worth of
sales before even adding that one
percent fee so you've really got nothing
to lose by at least attempting it if
anything just just by purely attempting
to accept Bitcoin you are saving
yourself three percent ah that's that's
that's huge so so merchants won't accept
it I mean come on so let's see you can't
charge it back so there's no risk for
the merchant there you're paid in
dollars immediately so no risk there
your bank accounts tied so no problem
there it's a legit US company that's
undergoing serious growth has serious
investors that we actually know I I
would say that's the merchant argument
and really the crux of the entire
volatility argument just shot down real
quick since really the reason for
volatility even mattering is people say
that you can't or or stores and online
merchants couldn't accept our won't
accept it due to volatility so finally
to the sense it kind of ties in let's
just touch on real quick why coinbase
can charge one percent and why paypal
can't right so what's stopping paypal
from being like oh man coinbase is
totally cutting our margin
man we're going to charge now point
eight percent what they literally can't
see like credit card companies in places
like PayPal they pay an average
themselves of 2.5% on transaction costs
because moving tracking in security
they're securing money and making sure
that transaction is a legitimate
transaction is a very costly matter I
mean just you can probably imagine how
hard that would be to constantly work
with that networking required to make
sure there's no glitches and scams and
hacks and all this stuff so they
literally cannot yet cheaper than 2.5%
and 2.5% would be breaking even so they
must always charge more than 2.5%
Bitcoin transaction costs are covered by
the Bitcoin network okay so it's
basically crowd funded by the
participants themselves who are paid for
their work simply put bitcoin is just
more efficient it's better and this is
called a free market so even if you
don't care about merchants accepting
Bitcoin both this um like if you don't
even care like if you're not a merchant
whatever you hopefully can at least
right people when they mention this kind
of stuff this is kind of silly there
there's no nothing against it really so
it is just one more argument favor of
Bitcoin purely for the purpose of also
eliminating waste in society so it
really truly is just pure waste you know
but I will just add him though bitcoin
isn't necessarily not wasteful there is
another crypto coin called I think it's
peercoin so Bitcoin right the
transaction the reason why it's cheap is
because everyone else is doing its the
Bitcoin network that everyone's
connected to so you've got these Bitcoin
miners that are using a ton of
electricity so they're not necessarily
environmentally friendly by any means
but peercoin is so anyway we might we'll
probably touch on peercoin in some
future videos especially as we're
comparing bitcoin to the other
cryptocurrencies but i will just throw
that out there as far as monetary loss
bitcoin is the victor as far as monetary
transactions are currently concerned
between bitcoin and a
the US dollar so and then also by the
way you know if you if you've ever been
angry at your local business for not
accepting credit cards do take a gander
at the link in the description or even
do a google search for merchant credit
card fees see how quickly you'd get on
board with that so that the link in the
description that just breaks down all
the possible credit card fees I mean
it's absurd and it's somewhat
unpredictable as to which fees you might
pay per person yeah she's pretty crazy
so what have we learned so far about
cryptocurrencies versus like the real
dollars right are the real dollars
that's kind of funny so let's see it'll
the fiat money in the world that we live
on basically is fraud in any company
committing this fraud would be thrown in
jail normally except for the banks of
course because that's what's going on
monetary transaction of dollars is very
costly an inefficient pic coins highly
efficient done it a third of the cost
for anybody that takes part and even
even less if you if you don't use
coinbase right so you don't have to use
coinbase either and you could just
accept the volatility or if you buy into
the Bitcoin idea and market then then
you wouldn't have to even consider it so
anyway that's that if you see someone
using the volatility argument or that no
merchant is going to accept it argument
link them here so we can spread the
education hopefully stop seeing as many
journalists getting away with downright
misinformation there's also links in the
description for the coin based merchant
information that I've told you guys
about paypal fees credit card fees and
there's also a link for Bitcoin donation
if you want otherwise thanks for
watching thanks for all the support and
subscriptions and until the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
