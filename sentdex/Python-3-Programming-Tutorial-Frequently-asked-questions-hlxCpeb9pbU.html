Python basics tutorial video in this
video I'm actually just going to answer
a couple of questions that I see people
ask quite often and the first one is
going to be the shebang line that's this
line you'll see pound sign exclamation
mark us R and then something like bin
Python hmm now if you're on Windows this
is really useless but you'll still see
it on people's modules sometimes or
maybe on some example code and you might
not actually know what that means and
this is referred to this as the shebang
line and basically what's going to do is
if you're on Linux it notifies Linux of
the path to Python so you can actually
run this script as an executable but on
windows again it's there's really no use
for it here you could use this on
Windows and still tell Windows sort of
but it doesn't work the same but anyway
that is why you are going to see
something very similar to this quite
often in scripts people just put them up
there now the next thing that you're
going to see quite often in scripts and
especially modules is the following so
on people's modules a lot of times
you're going to see the following so
let's say you've got this module that
you've downloaded and this module is
epic and what epic does is just print
wow this is great right and then in on
the module itself
um maybe or the script that Simon wrote
but it's for the purposes of a module
you'll see something like if name equals
main
print that okay so you see something
like this and so we'll run this script
and you'll see it says such great module
okay and the question that people ask is
what I do people write this wide are
people saying if name equals may well
the reason why people say if name equals
main then run this stuff is so people
can use this code as a module now let me
show you so now in your script for
example my script is called epic thing
dot pi now in that same directory that
you have epic thing dot pi make another
examine other-- script okay so let me
bring my folder over here there's epic
thing not pi let's go ahead and copy and
paste epic thing not pi another script
and we'll just call that another script
we're very fancy in our name calling and
we'll open it with idle and again this
was just a copy of epic thing dot pi so
it's got the same code but let's say
instead you wanted to import epic thing
PI you want to say I import epic thing
like so that's how you can import
another script now epic thing got PI has
a function called epic so what we could
do in our script is we could do epic
oops
epic thing dot epic okay save that and
we can run this and we get wow this is
great
okay so we're treating this like a
module like I had mentioned before that
you can do so enjoy now the reason why
it says if name equals main is the
following if we go to epic thing dot pi
write the module that we're importing
and we get rid of if name equals made
and we bring print over and we set we
run epic thing dot PI and we get the
same outcome that we had before it does
such great module
but what ends up happening is if we come
into our other script that's importing
epic thing and then all we wanted to do
was just do epic thing got epic but
instead what what do we get well we get
such great module and then while this is
great why do we get that well the reason
why we get that is at the instant that
we imported epic thing we run epic thing
kind of like it basically what happens
is when you import the module it's going
to run through that module to load it in
just like it Python would load your
functions and it loads things in order
so in the order that it got it it
imported epic thing it stores the
function and then it's going to go ahead
and print such great module so that's
why we use if name equals main that will
stop that from occurring okay so we do
it again and we don't get that now why
does that stop that from occurring well
if understorms were name equals main
basically what it's asking is is this
the main file that's being run so
basically asks are we actually running
epic thing got PI or are we running some
other file so as long as we're running
some other file it's okay and if we are
running some over the other file this
will return a false and this won't run
and so that's why people use if name
equals MA
hopefully that was informative for some
of you guys if you have any questions or
comments feel free to leave them below
as always thanks for watching thanks for
all this point and subscriptions until
