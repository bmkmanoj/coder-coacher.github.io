is not dad just back to the second part
of the Raspberry Pi tutorial series here
what we're gonna be doing is talking
about how to download an operating
system onto your Raspberry Pi so you can
begin actually using your Raspberry Pi
there are a lot of options for an
operating system but for now we're just
gonna start with the most basic and easy
way to do this so the best thing that
you can do now I'm sure there's somebody
out there that's had a video on this but
if you've visited the Raspberry Pi
website anytime recently you'll see they
actually have this noobs thing which
I've never heard before I think that's
the cutest thing in the world new out of
box software for noobs anyway I think
it's a great name so anyway you can
download this from the Raspberry Pi
slash downloads and what this is gonna
be is it's gonna solve any sort of like
instead of having to like put the image
on the disk all this kind of stuff it's
gonna do that for you so you can just
download this and then on your first
startup you'll be presented with a list
of operating systems for you to choose
from and then it'll install the
operating systems like you know with the
image about itself so it's actually
really cool and the other cool thing you
do is just by holding shift you can
change the operating system that's going
to lead everything on your old operating
system but you can kind of switch
between them and see which one you like
without really doing anything so it's
awesome you you're gonna need you know
to do it this way you'll need at least a
4 gigabyte our larger SD card in this
case I've got an 8 and really that's
about it so go ahead and download this
you can use this stuff honestly I'm just
gonna check this out there someone can
probably really kill me but you can use
this to check some and make sure your
download is like a worthy download but
if it's not and like something has gone
awry you'll find out anyways
so why waste time doing this I don't
know it's pretty quick I mean you put
this on the on the card I mean it
doesn't take very long to transfer it
and if stuff doesn't work then try it
again cuz that's what happens if the
checksum fails you have to redownload it
so I don't know anyway so we visited
here and now the noobs thing is
downloading its 1.1 gigabytes so it's
gonna take a while I have basically no
bandwidth because I've run like two
servers so yeah it's probably take a
while so here let me pause this and
we'll resume once it's done downloading
oh by the way I forgot to mention while
you're why you are downloading it then I
just thing that you want to do is
download where is it I thought they
would write it up on here but I don't
see it we want to download the SD card
formatter
oh here we go here's a link for it so
when you're in the /downloads whe next
thing we want to use format the SD card
so click on that it's gonna take us to
this the downloads for this SD formatter
and I don't know too much about SD cards
but what's gonna do is format it I don't
know the proper format for running an
operating system off of it someone else
can say exactly how this works or why
you have to use this but anyway you do
so you know whatever computer you're on
right now download the proper version
and once you've done that I'll show you
what you'll arrive with ok so when you
run the program this will be what you've
got you'll have you know some
information up here this will be about
your card what drive it's in volume
label the only thing you really need to
do at this point before you hit format
is going to your options and for format
size adjustment go ahead and turn that
on hit OK and hit format and okay of
course we're not going to remove it
while we're formatting it ok so anyway
now that the format is complete give you
some information and we'll go ahead and
exit so now the next thing once you've
downloaded the noobs software and you
are are you've already formatted your
SD card next thing we want to do is
actually go into our SD card and so here
is my SD card you brought it up in
another window and you just want to
click and drag basically this stuff
right on in there and I thought it's
gonna take a little bit because it's 1.1
gigs so let me go ahead and pause while
it's doing that the next I just thought
about a couple things I'll mention once
we get this done I'm actually probably
gonna have to come off the screen
recorder and go back to the handheld
because threats of stuff will be on the
Raspberry Pi as we're installing it so I
guess we'll do the rest by camera but we
just mentioned this is the first time
like I've ever encountered something
like this honestly but the little SD
card has a look like a slider on the
side that locks it from having data like
overwritten and a lot of the inserts at
least on my computer when I was doing
this they kept telling it was locked I
would unlock it slip it in and be like
oh it's walked again and it turned tab
that every time I was pushing it in the
slider on the side was locking right
because I needs to go down to lock and
that's what it was something was rubbing
up against it locking it so that was
really irritating so if you have that
problem what you do is just take a piece
of scotch tape and like unlock it and
just put the tape over the lock so it'll
make the fit a little tighter than
normal
that'll stop it from getting locked just
thought I'd say that I never had the
problem maybe no one else will have this
issue but that was really irritating so
that's that all right guys looks like
this is about to be over so once you're
done with the transfer you'll go ahead
and pull out the SD card and everything
for our film coming up next is gonna
have to be live again because we'll be
dealing with the physical pie so anyway
as always thank you for watching thank
you for your support your subscriptions
and until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
