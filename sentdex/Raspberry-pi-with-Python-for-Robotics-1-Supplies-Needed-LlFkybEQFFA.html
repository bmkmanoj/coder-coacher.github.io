series this series is going to be
dedicated to robotics with Python so one
of the coolest things I think you can do
with programming is bring your
programming to life physically through
robotics so with that we're going to do
use our Raspberry Pi and do some
robotics with it so notably most people
use the Arduino for robotics just really
the Arduino is just older and more
mature than the Raspberry Pi but I think
the Raspberry Pi is definitely a serious
contender for robotics especially
because the Raspberry Pi has more
software ability at least easier than
the Arduino has so the Arduino and the
Raspberry Pi are actually two very
different things right the the Arduino
is just a controller the Raspberry Pi is
a computer so they kind of do two
totally different things just so happens
that the Raspberry Pi has GPI GPIO pins
and we can use them so with that let's
go ahead and get started talking about
the things that we need alright so
obviously you need a Raspberry Pi you're
want raspbian installed if you use noobs
to install raspbian you should already
have RPI GPIO installed I will put a the
command in the description however run
that command make sure you actually do
have GPIO installed so we can control
the GPIO pins via Python so you'll need
that you'll need a battery pack because
the Raspberry Pi supplies a max of 3.3
volts which is a obviously not enough
most motors want at least double that so
you want a battery pack for that and
once you do that you're going to need a
board to control that and our choice of
board is this h-bridge see if we can get
it to focus on it there we go
this board is specifically the l-29 8n
this one is made by saying smart
depending on where you buy it the actual
architecture one of the I guess
architectures bad word but the structure
of it might be slightly different but
you should be able to buy any l-29 a10
and follow along with us again this
one's from saying smart came with a kit
that I bought and I will put the links
and talk more about that kit in a second
also you'll need a motor and wheels the
wheels come with the motor you
surely you can buy these on eBay like
four of these for 10 bucks or something
so pretty cheap my only complaint about
these is a pretty weak but for your
first project there okay the other
things that you're going to need you're
going to have some wiring black and red
helps just keep yourself sane and then
obviously you're gonna want some wire
cutters and wire strippers so you can
strip the end of the wires along with
wires you're going to want both a male
to female and then also you want some
female to female most likely jumper
wires so I suggest you get those and
then from there and just as an aside if
you don't have female to female it's
okay
you can always use two male to females
cut off the male part and splice the two
together so that's that there's also
like female adapters that you can slide
on to the end of a male to female or
even you can just use regular wires and
wrap around do whatever you want for
this in the basics we're not going to do
any soldering eventually you do want to
do some soldering just so your
connections are a lot more secure but
since this is your first little kit that
you're putting together I don't really
suggest you use any soldering just
because you're probably going to take it
apart and do something else with it so I
don't really suggest it so I would just
use regular wires and have some
electrical tape or something to wrap it
up so with that that should be all the
basics that you need obviously you're
going to want like some sort of frame
for your car again I bought a kit you
can buy that Kate on same smart and get
all the parts that you need for like 40
bucks and then buy the bridge for like
nine bucks but you can also go to ebay
by the bridge by the motors by the
battery pack and then go to like Sears
and you can just you can build a frame
yourself you know so you can get the
parts and they have you know holes in
them and you can you could build the
frame if you wanted on your own I just
thought to be easiest to use the frame
plus I didn't have the battery pack the
motors or anything else so I thought
might as well go for it so I will put
links in the description for that stuff
next the only other thing I'll add I
before I conclude this four parts that
you need I would suggest you get one of
these I'll put the link in the
description for this edimax it's a
wireless adapter for your PI you just
want one that doesn't require any driver
installations for the most part this one
plug-and-play so definitely I recommend
it also you want a one of these it's
just a portable power supply for the PI
this is an anchor and about the 3000 but
it supplies 5 volts at 1,000 milliamps
so that's exactly what we wanted and I
have no idea how long it lasts but it
lasts more than an hour so as good as I
have for now for you that's pretty good
so to power your PI for more than an
hour and these I'm not really sure if
you ran the motor
I've definitely logged probably an
hour's worth on the motors though and I
did just check this one has like you
know those little things you can push on
the battery to see how much you juice it
still has and it was still a hundred
percent so apparently this will last a
while too because these motors are sissy
motors so those are the parts that you
need and really that's that's it for now
in the next video what we're going to be
doing is controlling this motor the idea
of this h bridge is that not only can
you control the motor with it using the
battery pack for power but with the H
bridge what you can do is not only make
the motor go but you can reverse the
motor if the motor is capable of reverse
so we can make the motor go forward or
go backward or not go so that's
obviously very helpful so yeah so that's
what we'll be doing the next video will
be actually programming or motor and
then from there we'll program all the
motors together to work you know in
synchronization so they can turn and all
that so we don't have anything that's
going to like pivot the wheel for us so
yeah it'll be a whole lot of fun it'll
be hoot so anyway that's at with this
video that's what you have to look
forward in the next video as always
