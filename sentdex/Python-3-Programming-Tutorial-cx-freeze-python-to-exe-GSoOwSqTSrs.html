Python 3 tutorial video this video is
going to be all about module called CS
freeze and actually this module is not a
part of your standard library this is a
third-party module and the idea of this
module is to convert your Python scripts
into executable scripts so just like
making Windows not everybody cares to do
this but some people want to be able to
distribute their programs to others and
actually distribute them in a compiled
form that makes it a little bit harder
for someone to steal your work maybe but
also it helps because if you say you
want to share your program with somebody
you don't want to be like you know hey
check out this cool graphing program
just download Python matplotlib numpy
6pi parsing date util it must feel like
you don't have to tell them like hey do
all this stuff and then you can use my
little Python script that I made for
myself no I'd be night much nicer to be
able to be like here here's a zip file
unzip it run you know run me DXE or
whatever and there's your you know my
script for you so that's what we're here
to talk about today and a for Python 2.7
there's a module called pi to exe but
from what I found you there's no like
three Python three support there
apparently you can like edit it or
something and then you can use it but CX
freeze does the exact same thing so why
bother so that's what we're gonna be
using today is CX freeze now again it's
a third-party module so we're going to
go find it download it install it and we
can use it now luckily as as makes a
whole lot of sense there is a dot exe
installer for CX freeze so it's very
simple so what you're gonna want you to
get is you're going to head over to your
favorite Google comm and you're going to
want to come down here and go to their
main website just search for CX space
freeze basically the name freeze it's
freezing your program into an executable
so just for some background so click on
freeze and then you'll come down here
and say download and install latest
version was released May 3rd 2014 so as
you can see this is under active
development nice you can use pip install
but we can also install it directly from
pi PI 4
Python package index come over here and
you see there's sorts of things that we
can use this Python wheel I have never
used a python wheel before in fact maybe
someone comment below if you know what
the hell a Python wheel is a dot WHL
anyway someone let me know what python
wheel is or I might Google it or
something but we're gonna use Microsoft
Windows installer for Python 3.4 so
we'll download that still have my pillow
down there install it uh maybe pause the
video while you're installing should be
pretty quick installation by tongue I'm
done saying this sentence you should be
done installing it if you did
immediately run that so once you're done
there
we'll just minimize this what was that
sexy guy and now we're ready to start
programming so the way that this works
is first you're going to create
something that you want to be
distributed now for me I just kind of
want to use a program already written um
so I'm gonna head go back through here
and let's take our URL Lib tutorial so
bring that up and so this was the code
from the URL Lib tutorial video so I'm
going to go ahead and just copy this
code and paste this code into here and
the idea here is this a show that we can
use on you know a module with this and
basically what this is going to do is
it's going to search Google it's going
to get some results it's going to fake
some headers for us and I guess it's
gonna print hmm maybe I don't want to
use this one hmmmm wanted something a
little easier not basic
we got here yeah let's use this code
instead so I want to copy and paste this
code into here if you want this code
I'll put a link to the description for
this exact code I'll put it on my
website so people can use it just in
case you don't know all sample code is
posted on Python programming net so this
code and all like all of the code for my
least recent videos and a lot of the
older videos is up there just in case
you're wanting it so what this code does
is it uses your lib visits Python
programming net and basically just
parses paragraph text from it okay so
using actually so we're using URL Lib
regular expressions so a lot of Python
only stuff regular expressions and all
of that and we're going to convert this
to an executable that anybody can run
without needing Python 3.4 rake or the
re module installed on their computer
URL live all this stuff so cool fancy so
um so we use this code like I said if
you don't have this code or you've got
your own code you use your own code if
you want to convert your own code to exe
or you can use this just for example so
this is our distributed file that we
want to use so I'm gonna come over here
this is where I'm programming in right
now it's disk meat so I'm gonna go ahead
and save that that saved it to disk me
and now what I'm going to do is a close
out of this and now I'm just going to
copy and paste this me and we're going
to call this file setup and it's going
to be set up dot pi open that up and
adjust
okay like that and now we want to do is
I'm going to clear everything okay so so
we're now in setup dot pi okay so we've
got two folders in here we've got dissed
me which is basically distribute me and
then set up the PI this me is containing
the code that I want to distribute and
now set up pi is going to be used to
tell CX Freese how to distribute this
basically so our setup the PI file needs
the following so first of all we want to
do from C X underscore oopsie X
underscore capital F frees from that
import setup and executable okay now
we're going to want to do is we have to
define a bunch of stuff here so
basically we need to define what are we
going to turn into an executable what do
we want to call that executable and you
can give some other information you can
give descriptions you can give a version
number for example
so we'll do those those two things I
suppose so what we're going to do is
we're gonna say setup and then within
setup you put a basically a list of
stuff so we're gonna say name equals or
we'll continue calling it disc me
and this is basically this me is the
name of the exe so you can call it
anything you wanted you could say disc
we could say URL works okay
comma and now let's do version this is
our very first version beta version 0.19
description equals parse stuff for me
but whatever you want in there and then
finally what we wanted to use is these
executables command and so we're going
to basically this is what we convert to
an executable so executables equals and
then square brackets for our list and
then we're going to use executable so
we're referencing this executable and
we're turning into an executable dystiny
pi and that's it so this is our setup PI
file so we can save that and now we can
close that and now we've got our
just me and a sucked up high now what
you can do to make this easy is for
example my file here is located you know
desktop sin tax license Python 3 Python
3 4 4 CX 3 6 tutorial I come back here
this is where I'm coding in so I can
literally write or use the left hold
down shift right click and open the
command window here so that opens up
this pretty thing now what we can do is
run we use Python as our command Python
setup I build and you have to use this
in the in the directory that you this
file is in if it's not you don't have to
say Python self available you could say
pythons you know C colon slash users
desktop you know and let's say it was on
the desktop you know set up high build
you could do that so you don't have to
you know be in the same directory but it
helps it makes it easier to type so set
up dot pi build so we hit enter and we
wait hopefully this runs let's see X Q
ok we type out executable this let's
head over to set up here right-click X
ok executable save it executables
executable ok hopefully this will run
this time come back over here and
literally just hit the up arrow for me
anyway maybe your build work because you
know how to spell uh anyway so that's it
you should get this massive amount of
gobbledygook that comes out so we'll go
ahead and minimize this for now I will
just move it over I guess and now you
should have a folder called build click
on build and then you've got this exe
win + e 64 3.4 and within there you have
dissed me so we can click on disk knee
and basically what we get here is we run
it and it it visits my website found 27
search results basics so searching
basically my what did I guess actually
what it's doing is it searches basics on
my Python programming net and then it
basically what it did is print out all
of our paragraph data from the website
but anyway as you can see those we were
able to run all of this with an exe and
so really you could send this to your
friend right we could send someone if
they've got a 64-bit 3.4 windows machine
they could go your click on disk mean
and they could run this program if
they've never installed Python they
don't have URL live regular expressions
anything they will still be able to run
this and that's because in here is where
they get all of the data that they
really truly need it's all located in
here so that should be it as far as
using any sort of either CS freeze pata
exe is very similar as well but this was
C X freeze and that's it it's pretty
simple for most packages you can get
away with this if the package also has a
GUI with like tkinter and or is very
graphical based you might have some
trouble with it like mat fought live
it's very difficult to get matplotlib to
work with pi to exe or even CX freeze
but as far as your typical program is
concerned you should have no problem
with this it should just take all the
modules and run matplotlib has an issue
with when to run specific things and
that's what what makes it fail but
anyway umm that should be it for this
one if you guys have any questions or
comments something not working out for
you or you couldn't get this far of
please feel free to leave them below if
I forget to link to this in the
description remind me and I'll put a
link to it in the descriptions so you
can use my code but I encourage you use
whatever code you want to convert to a
exe really shouldn't matter maybe you
can find some more code that you're
having trouble with that for whatever
reason isn't converting to a exe so
that's going to conclude this video if
you guys said questions counseling below
as always thanks for watching thanks for
all the support and subscriptions until
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
