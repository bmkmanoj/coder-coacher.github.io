introduction to sakuni so what is securi
and why do you care I plan to do
tutorials on BOSU Cooley and selenium as
they both provide a massive help in a
very similar situation so let's say you
know exactly what you want to do within
your Python program and you know how
you'd like to structure the logic of
that program but there's some more
in-depth things that you can't quite
figure out let's say you don't know how
to log into a website or type things
onto a website interact with like maybe
some sort of JavaScript plug-in on a
website or possibly you want to interact
with programs on your own computer that
you're not quite sure how you can maybe
hit file and do this and whatnot within
that specific program so normally within
you know pure Python programming there's
a lot of coding that you would have to
do in order to do these things and so
what's a Coulee and selenium which I'll
be going into depth later on can do for
you is help you skip some of the harder
stuff and get straight to testing your
logic for the program so personally I
found that I just purely a lot of times
want to see what the end result is going
to look like like if I'm thinking about
developing some sort of program
sometimes I want to spend literally like
probably the hundreds of hours
developing that really in-depth back-end
code and I just want to test the logic
and see if it's worth putting in that
time right and so like the beginning of
like my website sent decks that was
actually researched using both selenium
and Sakuni to decide if it was really
worth me putting in the time and energy
to code it purely within Python because
you really don't selenium is a little
better but sukui the downside to Sakuni
is it's very hard to scale Sakuni
because it's going to it's going to take
control of your mouse basically so you
couldn't have
been doing multi multiple tasks at the
same time I mean you could but it's
still it's still going to be using your
mouse and so the mouse can only be doing
one thing selenium is a little better
and it's going to run within the browser
and you won't be sacrificing your mouse
but we'll get the selenium later so
let's go ahead and get started with
sukui the point of sakuya is basically
you know you can read on their website
it is to automate anything you might see
on your computer and it's going to be
there there's a specific IDE for it but
it's going to be using the same sort of
logic that you would use within Python
so that kind of same structure and
syntax for a little bit but you can see
it's got like to click the mouse it's
literally a click and to type its type
and there's various ways to do key
presses like you can control C control V
that kind of stuff so anyway we'll be
getting into that with a few sakuya
tutorials here but to start let's go
ahead and download so cooley it's been a
while since I've downloaded a new
version of sukui
so I might be a little unfamiliar with
her newest but this is all we want here
let's download this 1.00
see if we can find it I have the windows
and I think what we want is right down
here at the bottom the Sakuni IDE let's
open this up and see I believe this is
what we want so now what we want to do
is download that so it says we should go
here back to there download page so
we'll pop over there download page here
and I want I see there's an API and an
IDE for everything we want the IDE I'm
pretty sure the API I'm kind of
interested in I don't recall ever using
an API I have to look into that but
maybe we can find a way it did not
sacrifice our mouse without it so anyway
let's take the IDE I'm got Windows 600
yeah windows 64-bit so I'm going to
download this but they've got you know
for all the versions that you might have
but I happen to be windows 64-bit make
sure you download the IDE not the API
what we're looking for is this IDE so
I'm go ahead and click this
and download it I'm going to pause
download while waiting all right now
this done downloading I'm just going to
pull it over to my desktop so we can
work with it put it down here so it's
maybe a little easier to see and we'll
go ahead and extract all and there we
have it
let me go close out of this let's drag
it over here let's open up see what
we're dealing with here looks like there
we go
okay so let's download or open up the
IDE here alright this is definitely what
we want looks very familiar so that's
good that's good
make it into a window that everybody can
see now and this should be what you're
looking at if not then something is
wrong so up here is going to be where
we're going to script and then these are
some quick you know typically used
buttons with insecurely and so this is
where you're going to script out if you
had anything printing out this is like
your typical printout where it's going
to pop this down a little bit and now
what we want to do so what I think would
be kind of cool is pretty much everybody
wants to or a lot of people want to use
Schooley to do stuff that they just
don't know how to do on their browser so
why not use coolie too let's say we want
to use sakuni to login to a website for
example so this is actually a pretty
easy task for Saku lee and so let's go
through that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
