what's going on guys welcome to the
third ease of movement tutorial video in
this video what we're gonna be doing is
actually plotting up the ease of
movement indicator if you don't already
have it you're going to need the
starting sample of the code so this is
where it is the link is in the
description just struck top here go down
copy and paste this whole thing into an
empty script sup print line there and
then right up right between these two
comments here is where we're going to
spit some code in here so we're going to
take this right here and just to the
definition of EMV and then calling EMV
that's what we really need so copy that
come over here paste it and fix your
indentation with a couple of tabs there
and now we're ready to define some new
code and fix our screen a little bit and
let's make the text ok so now really
what we need is X EMV y and v equals
this because this returns like two
variables right the date and the actual
value now all we need to do is ax two
dots plot x and v oops XUV why AMV what
color do we want it will plot it as
white just go ahead and run that see
what we got going so far this will plot
up ebay and so here's the first thing
that we get so it looks like it's
working sure not you know like as its
falling okay ease of movement goes down
and stuff looks just like the one I
showed you in the first introductory
video so as I was good now now what we
might want to do is add that horizontal
line if you've been following the
tutorial video you already want to do
this but we'll throw it in just in case
and so it's going to be a x two dot 8x
h-line where's that line want to be at
the zero what color does it want to be I
heard it wants to be white next what do
we want want to add like that label
right so plot dot
I label what do we want that label to
say I say what it is so it's an EMV not
an asterisk it's a 14 and then what
color does it want to be it also wants
to be white so we can actually see it
let's plot again we'll plot ebay again
and here is ebay and now we have that
center line and we have you know label
for it so that's going to conclude the
ease of movement indicator with in
Python and matplotlib hopefully you guys
enjoyed learn something you cared about
as always thanks for watching things for
all the support and subscriptions until
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
