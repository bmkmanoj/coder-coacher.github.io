another Python tutorial video in this
video what we're going to be talking
about is a little bit more of modules
and just some sort of understanding of
modules so in the last video we're
really talking about the syntax that
goes into importing a module and all the
kind of nuances as far as how you can
import a module to do exactly what you
want and so you can kind of be lazy with
your typing now in this video we're
going to be talking a little bit more
about how modules themselves work we're
going to make our own module and we're
going to talk briefly about local versus
kind of like global modules so with that
it's going to get started first thing
that we want to do is we want to go
ahead and make a simple module that we
can use as an example so let's go ahead
and do that so as we've come shown
before and a module is just a Python
script usually so that's it so what
we're going to do is just make a simple
script we're going to say define example
or e^x and X is going to have one
parameter and that's going to be data
now all this function is going to do is
it's going to print data that's it so
now we're going to go file save as and
we're going to save this function in the
same directory as the current script
that we're writing and I'm going to save
it as example mod PI save that and we're
done now we can open up the original
script which should be empty still come
back over here and get proper sound and
now we're ready to maybe use this module
now just real quick we can go start and
what we want to do is we want to open up
a Python 3 for IDL e and real quick
let's just try to import example mod we
get an error and it says there's no
module named example mod basically the
path is going to go through to look for
modules is going to be like local site
packages and Lib right so see Python 3
for Lib C Python 3 for Lib packages
generally again third-party modules will
be inside packages whereas your typical
vanilla installation modules will be
right there
so with that um we can come over here
though
and we can go import example mod and
just real quick let's save and run it
and we see that we don't actually get an
error okay and that's because we do have
it and it's local right so it isn't one
of the checking checked paths so now
what we can do is we could actually say
it from well we have an import example
mod now as we showed in the last video
we still have to do something like this
like example mod dot e X and then here's
where we're going to put our data for us
what's to say a test so it should just
print out tests so we'll save we'll run
that and sure enough the output is test
now we can take this a little step
further and we can go into the directory
that contains our script which is here
so we have example mod now we can do is
go my computer here C 3 for Lib site
packages and now let's go ahead and just
copy this module into site packages so
now we have example mod in there so if
we go again to our Python 3 4 ideally
what we can do now is import example mod
and now we can go example mod e X test
NX as any other module would act so
that's how you can kind of create your
own modules in Econ saidit modules and
if you do create your own modules and it
says it doesn't exist well it needs to
be in one of the paths local Lib sy
packages ok and that's pretty much it
and so what you can do eventually is
download like say you're going to say
you make your own script that you find
extremely useful and you you find
yourself using it every time let's say
you like for me I do sentiment analysis
and a lot of times I use the same parser
for no matter what the website is I use
a parser and then I usually apply some
rules to it and all that I'm going to
put that in my site packages because I
use it all the time so why not just
import that instead of for every kind of
application that I use a parser for why
not use the one that I've trained really
well
so anyway that's just an example you'll
probably have your own but that's so you
can make your own modules also if you
download someone else's module or maybe
you see someone else's code that you
want to make into a module yourself and
they don't necessarily have a set up to
up high or whatever you can just
download the source right of that module
and just put it in your side package and
it's not a big deal so anyway that's
going to conclude conclude this video if
you guys have any questions or comments
feel free to leave those below as always
thanks for watching thanks for all the
support and subscriptions and before I
go I will just say this if you're in
Linux or well any sort of distribution
of Linux your path will be different but
anyway until next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
