quadcopter video in this video I'm just
going to showing you guys the first
attempt at my quadcopter restraint
system that I've got going on here so
actually right behind me you can see my
quadcopter now what I've done is at the
ceiling I've got it connected to the
ceiling there's a stud in the ceiling
and I've got a hook that's on the
ceiling I've got these bungee cords with
the hole what the official thing is like
a grappling hook that people use for
like climbing I've got those and I've
got two 20-pound weights that it's
underneath mostly the reason I'm using
two it's one to kind of act almost like
a pulley system so we can shorten the
length of that of one of them now as
time goes on I might want to let it
actually free fly a little bit right now
I kind of want a lot of restraint on it
just just for safety now I've got 15
zippy ties connecting the hooks I
couldn't really find any better way to
do it so it zippy ties each point of
failure has well on the top we've got
for zippy ties for points of failure so
it would cost take a lot of zip ties to
break before this thing would fall to
the floor and on the bottom we've just
got two zip ties of points of failure
but I'm a little less concerned about
the bottom as I am the top when it falls
it goes to the ceiling I don't really
care if it hits the fan or whatever I'll
just repaint but most I'm concerned
about the things you know left right and
all that and the top will protect that
even from hitting the window from
hitting the tank over there and all of
that so anyway we're going to go ahead
and start this up I've had enough
problems with it already I the first
propeller adapter any these things that
go right on the top here first one of
those was bad it was like not
necessarily I guess it wasn't it was
like threaded to death this was like
over thread that didn't work got another
one and then I was torquing these on and
I ripped the top off as I torqued it so
had to get another one so I've had a
really hard time also didn't notice a
match
in my new place maybe I'll show a
picture of it from the doorway or
something I've got my whole setup here
TV and stereo and stuff over there it's
quite nice to have all this new space
got a new house so yeah maybe I'll do a
series on the house or something or the
room at least the mancave so without
further ado let's go ahead and power
this thing up hopefully to work the last
time I powered it up I couldn't even get
it to arm I had to you know recycle
through all of the processes but
hopefully we'll be all set also I got a
dog in here I'm going to try and
convince him to leave not very safe to
have him in here plus you probably won't
like it so let me go ahead and escort
him on out and we'll go ahead and get
started all right let's do this final
check before we plug it in should we got
some good play here eventually if it
pulls this hard the handle the weight is
kind of curved so it might slip a little
bit that might cause me to piss my pants
but that should be fine so let's go
ahead and get this thing started
switcher one of our switches is probably
there we go okay now we're ready to go
so go that let's plug this thing in
all right that sounds like it's on so
hmm
had some better protection sighs these
glasses don't have any protective
eyewear probably should get some of that
but we're not going to go too crazy
today plus we're not autonomous before
we go autonomous probably should get
some of that and maybe even make a set
up in the garage instead of in my room
I've got a lot of screens there's what
six screens on this wall so anyway so we
got a lot of tilt going on and that's
actually the side we definitely need to
calibrate that a little bit but as far
as the restraint system is concerned
that's quite nice I'm happy with that
all right that is going to get dangerous
fast</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
