the fifth in final basics of tkinter
tutorial for Python 3 so while this is
the end of my basic covering of what
tkinter is you should see it very much
like my basic covering of regular
expressions was or URL Lib was and all
of that because there's a whole lot of
other things that we can do obviously
making Windows is a very vast topic and
you know I might come through and do
more of an intermediate or advanced
tkinter not advanced to Cantor but
expanded tkinter tutorial but really my
IDE my goal here was really just to
teach you guys some of the basics of
tkinter how to add things to tkinter
event handling with you cancer and then
from there hopefully you can look up
various things you know that you might
be wanting to do and then hopefully you
can implement it rather simply so anyway
with that what I want to do here is show
how we can display images in tkinter as
well as text okay so with that let's go
ahead and get started what we're going
to need immediately is to do images
we're going to need the imaging an
imaging library Python 2 people will use
pill Python imaging library but a good
secondhand imaging library is what's
known as pillow and with Python 3 I
highly recommend that's what we use so
to get it you can either go and download
pillow however you like your favorite
way to download things is or you can use
this website here if I remember too I'll
put a link for it in the description
I forget reminding and so we'll just
search for pillow I guess I'll just
click on this ok so here we have pillow
and now we're looking for at least for
me I've got 64 bit and I'm using through
Python 3.4 so you would want to download
that and then when it's done downloading
go ahead and install it and then once
you've got it installed you're ready to
continue so if you're still waiting and
all that go ahead and pause the video
and then restore the video once you
it so once you have it why don't you
have pillow installed what we're going
to do is you're going to come up here
and you're going to say from PIL import
capital image and then we're going to do
image T K so pay attention these are all
caps here capital i capital i capital t
okay now we're going to do is we're
going to come over to our and window
initialization here and we'll leave
everything here and i think what we'll
do is we'll edit this edit menu right
and so right now write it menu doesn't
do anything really let's go ahead and
save this real quick so we have our file
save the save does nothing we can click
in it doesn't do anything and then we
have exit and that exits and then we
have this undo but undo doesn't do
anything either
so um
we'll leave save there but instead of
undo let's say instead we're going to
call this show image and then we're
going to say this is add command right
so add command um self oops I'm sorry
command equals self dot and let me make
some space here so we edit this show
image and then command equals self dot
show capital IMG okay so that's show
image so this is going to this is
referring to a function within our class
okay and then we're always passing
through you know frame through it um
so command equals self that show image
when we do that and then also let's go
ahead and add another command um let me
just we're just going to copy this line
paste this line and instead of image
text and then instead of show IMG txt
okay easy enough and then afterwards we
add that to our menu um and that's it
now we don't want to define self that
show image and self dot show text so
let's go ahead and do that so we'll
define
make sure your inline correctly define
show image again we pass through self
and we're going to say the load so we're
going to load this image or as a load
equals capital image so we're
referencing this image that we loaded up
here from pillow image dot open and now
we want to open an image so actually we
don't have an image in our folder here
so let me go back to where we were this
young man doesn't have any images we can
go to Python programming net and we can
get an image of my beautiful mug right
here so we'll take the image from there
and put that image in your directory so
for me that's actually this directory so
I'll just move that image right in here
and we'll call this pic and it's picked
up PNG for me I'll move this over um
we'll move this down and so we'll open
and then what we want to open is a
whoops pic dot P and G and now we're
going to go ahead we'll say render to
render the image and we're gonna do
image TK so again referencing from
pillow and then photo image this is also
referent it's a function with an image
TK and we want to render load right this
image that we've opened here and then
we're going to use labels to display our
image and what labels are that basically
you can use labels to packing text or
images it doesn't really matter so I say
IMG for image a equals capital label and
ylabel
is a part of tkinter label again self
and then we're gonna say image equals
you know so like what are we using we're
going to use this rendered image and
then we're going to say image image
equals render and then finally we're
going to go image dot place and we're
going to place this at x equals zero and
why equals zero okay and that's it
that's all we have to do the image will
be there next thing we want to do is
we'll do define show texts again cell
and scroll down a little bit and for
this one again we use labels only it's a
lot easier this time it's going to be
text equals label label self again and
then text equals hey there good-looking
like that okay and then we have to pack
it so we do text up pack and that
basically just adds the text okay so
save that and that should be all set so
you do this let me save and run it now
oh we have a know attribute show text
looks like we probably yet okay so I
added that show t ext what we asked for
is just so txt so let's try that one
more time
save and run it there we go and now we
can go edit and then show image and
there we go we get this lovely image of
me and then we could show text and that
pops up hey there good-looking looks
like I mean actually saying it to you so
you can accept that uh so now what we've
done is we've got some menu items here
that will show the images or show the
text but not naturally so it won't be
there normally it's only there if we add
it now just as a quick aside if by
whatever for whatever reason you are
finding that the image in Texas is
already showing up but you just can't
figure it out oh what's happening is
generally if you do like self dot this
will probably do it stuff that's showing
the JMT parameters and then text empty
parameters let me run this real quick
yeah so they're already there so again
I'll just take this moment to explain
how Python works as far as when we're
loading things in this sense we've
actually called the function in the
initialization so so the command here
what's happening it's a little bit of a
hacky way to run a function but it's
being run nonetheless even though we've
not clicked the command we're running
the function because we specify empty
parameters here and so this might be
really confusing to some people as far
as why this this might happen but again
as we read initialization window this
function is not running it's only being
defined but then when we go to display
the window and we load in these rules
for the button though automatically
being run because not only not anymore
are we treating them as a command but
we're treating them as a function and
they run so anyway I just wanted to
cover that real quick same thing if you
accidentally did something like this on
exit we could save and run this real
quick and immediately before you even
see the window pop-up it says you know
are you sure you want to exit right so
the window never runs so just wanted to
talk about that I imagine maybe someone
initially will will do this and one of
the earlier videos but anyway I just
wanted to cover why that happens because
again like I said it seems like it's
come out of nowhere but then what I'm
getting all these questions about
referencing functions before they've
been defined so the rules of this are
definitely confusing I understand
I just want to nail that in so anyway
that's going to conclude the tkinter
basics tutorial here again I realize
there are just like infinite things that
we can do with tkinter probably after we
do a matplotlib
series i've had a lot of requests for me
to do a combination of graphing and
tkinter well just so happens at
matplotlib i actually already uses
tkinter to give you their graph but some
people don't like that they want to
maybe have the GUI where you could let's
say type in a stock name and it will
graph that stock like in a very
good-looking GUI rather than in like a
command window so I had a lot of
requests for that so I probably will
show that down the road after we do a
matplotlib tutorial series for Python 3
anyway and then also
we'll never mind but anyway the de team
the purposes here was just to show all
like some of the basics of event
handling buttons text images and from
here you can really do all kinds of
things you could already make some
pretty great gooeys just with this
information alone but pretty soon you
know people probably want to add like a
text field widget and all of that and
just understand that these are all
basically widgets that we've already
done like a label as a widget okay and
so you can put these kinds of things you
can use text fields like little sliders
checkboxes all kinds of stuff and you
can store the output of like you know
text fields all that so there's like a
lot of things that you can do and maybe
I'll expand this tutorial a little bit
or something if there's a lot of
requests to go further but from here you
should understand the basics of tkinter
and then if you want to do something
specific you can look up the function
for it and then be able to do it so
anyway that's going to conclude this
little mini series on tkinter
on the basics of python if you guys have
any questions or comments feel free to
leave them below as always thanks for
watching thanks for all the support and
subscriptions and it's next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
