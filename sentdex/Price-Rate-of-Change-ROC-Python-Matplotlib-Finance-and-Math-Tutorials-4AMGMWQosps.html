another Python mathematics and finance
indicators tutorial video in this video
we're going to be discussing price rate
of change or sometimes as you see it as
rate of change or ROC this one's basic
enough to where we can condense it all
into one video so we're going to be
covering the intro how to program in
Python and then also how to chart it all
in this one video it should be under ten
minutes we'll see so with that let's go
ahead and look at an example so this
will give us a rate of change and we'll
look up for Starbucks and so here's an
example of Starbucks and a rate of
change of 10 and obviously rate of
changes on the bottom we've got RSI up
here on the top and so this is a every
basically it's like the current closing
price minus the closing price from ten
periods ago divided by the closing price
of ten periods ago so its percent change
minus the x 100
so what we have going on here is you can
kind of see how it the idea of it is is
to predict sort of directionally it's
still an oscillator so it's not totally
trend predicting and you can draw zero
line as you know a clear signal but
generally it's guys you'll actually
notice that it starts going up or starts
going down even prior to price on this
long of a timeframe it's not as useful
to have such a low rate of change so you
would count because it's very busy if
you if you haven't noticed so but what
we can do is like let's zoom in to like
a specific area and so again here this
kind of it still kind of smoothes out
these lines this starts really going up
back here but kind of matches price I'm
trying to find a good scenario like here
or rate of change actually starts going
down before even price starts going down
so that was a good example of that but
now let me compare it to a 30 rate of
change so let's look at Starbucks again
and this time we use a 30 rate of change
and so just so you can see the
difference like this one is a lot less
noisy right so as far as being above the
zero line I mean this one held it for
almost as long as the trend occurred and
the same thing below the zero line again
I'll do that for now like here right
it's flirting with this Earl line all
the way down to the basically the end
and it finally comes up across the zero
line as a buy signal here it really
holds that buy signal all the way until
right here which was here so obviously
pretty accurate in that sense and then
immediately tells you you know week
later probably at this point you know
okay go ahead and come back in and then
again you would have rode it
continuously all the way up with the ROC
of 30 so with that let's look at like
another one let's say I'm also got X on
this is obviously old I'm gonna go ahead
and close this one now since I don't
really like how noisy it is but again so
here's another example and exons like
extremely volatile for this period and
it's obviously a lot of ups and downs
here it seems to be fairly accurate even
on exon but this would be obviously a
pretty hard one but at least where it
was like really noisy here it was pretty
much accurate you know totally pretty
much give you the sell signal here which
is here and it didn't give you the buy
signal pretty much back here so that was
a pretty successful trade here probably
wasn't the best you made a little bit of
money if you traded it and so on look it
let's look at like maybe one more the
eBay eBay and again pretty darn accurate
as far as with artists ROC 30 and one
just to give you an idea we're looking
at 10 years of data and I'm pretty sure
each plot each bar right consists of
three days worth of data so really this
is like an ROC 90 alright so just keep
that in mind like 90 days worth of data
anyway that's that let's go ahead and
get into calculating it luckily it's
pretty easy to calculate since it's so
simple so for this one instead of
calculating it separately let's just
calculate on the actual chart itself so
if you don't already have the chart data
either click the link in the description
or go to sent Dexcom and click on
tutorials and then scroll down to the
programming
stock Forex futures options indicators
and display:none scroll down some more
and we want sample code with empty slot
click on that scroll down and here is
our sample code just copy and paste that
copy copy copy move it over here paste
it then scroll up just a little bit to
where we have this open area and we're
ready to rumble so now what we want to
do is let's go ahead and define roc and
that's going to be the name of our rate
of change and then we're going to have
two parameters one will be the prices
and for this we'll be using closing
prices and the other parameter will be
TF for time frame we will return a list
of roc for now it's empty we will
populate it and X is going to equal time
frame so that we can do the following
and while X is less than the length o CP
do something so we'll run this while
loop and then what we're gonna do is
we're gonna say roc is equals and then
in parentheses again it's new - the old
divided by the old so it would be CP so
where we are at the closing price so the
CP and of X right so the CP is a big
list of prices right so we want the x
number in that list - the CP X minus TF
because there's price rate of change
from X periods ago so in this case it
would be even though it's I guess I
shoulda said X periods ago let's say
time frame periods ago and then it will
be divided by again so it's you know new
the current price minus the old the 1x
timeframes ago divided by CP x minus TF
right you could do times 100 to get the
full you know effective times 100% or
times 100% times 100 to get it like an
actual percentage but it doesn't matter
you're gonna be looking at the same line
so next we would say roc dot append our
OCS and then X plus equals 1 and that
would be it once we exhaust that while
what would we want to do well we want
ROC now we can actually come down here
and we can say we'll say R capital R
lowercase o capital C equals ROC and the
closing prices and then we can say
whatever time frame we want I kind of
liked the 30 with the 10 years worth of
data so we'll do that and then we'll
call the plotting of it so it's going to
be a x2 dot blot and we plot date - SP :
if you want to know why we're doing that
check out the Python turning stocks and
python tutorial series and then so
that's the X variable the Y one will be
our OC - SP stands for starting point
and then we want this line to be white
line so we'll just put it W next so we
can compare easy we're gonna say X -
grid true with a color of white and then
we're gonna add that horizontal line
that we had at the zero mark so it'll be
X 2.8 X H line so it acts as horizontal
line where do we want to draw that line
at the zero and then what color do we
want it we're gonna make it cyan and
don't forget an equal sum so that's all
we really have to do I will example code
that usually I put it up on my website
but just in case you catch it you can
pause the video now it's nice and big I
forgot to make it big before starting
the recording so pause it there if you
got behind now we're ready to chart it
so let's go ahead and actually watch
this oh we need one more plot dot y
label and this one is in arroz OTC ROC
30 and the color is white save that run
that and stocked apply well plot JP
Morgan and it looks like JP Morgan
worked out for us
very few signals but it worked at least
okay so obviously here all the way until
this point so pretty much right at the
crossover
you got the buy signal a little bit
earlier than the actual simple moving
average crossovers but then you got the
sell signal right about the same time it
looks like yeah this was pretty ball as
well so got another one let's say Bank
America Mirko over look at this spike
here that's pretty crazy that was a late
one too very late still it was like
still pretty bearish at this point
because that spike it like distorted the
rest of it let's drop that spike off
anyway
you guys can play with it a little more
you can change up the actual timeframe
that you want to use for it but anyway
that is rate of change in Python and
Matt plot live hopefully you guys
learned something new hopefully you
enjoyed as always thanks for watching
thanks for all the support the
subscriptions until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
