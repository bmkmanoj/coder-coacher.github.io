the twelfth Monte Carlo in Python
tutorial video you don't know it but I
just recorded this entire video without
recording it so I guess I didn't record
it but anyway this will be the second
time I walk through this entire video so
so in the last video we saw at least
with our multiple we saw what kind of we
were with our first example of a Monte
Carlo simulation and actually giving us
a variable and we've got two different
betting strategies we had one where we
just bet the same thing over and over
which obviously resulted in a loss
because there was a one percent house
edge and with roll dice before we end
this series I can't remember if I
already said this or not can't remember
if I said it when I was recording or
when I wasn't recording but we will
change roll dice for peer 5050 odds just
in case you're playing something like
roulette or something like that where
you really do have 50/50 odds just a
rare scenario now one of the more
popular strategies with 5050 odds is
called the I'm gonna butcher the name
probably I'm gonna guess its day to alan
bear just a guess it's spelled day a
party ' alan bert with your english
accent or america accent anyway with
this strategy the way it works is as
follows so say your what you're starting
wager is $100 if you lose you would then
bet $200 lose $300 win $200 win $100
lose $200 and so on so you increment it
that way you're not multiplying it
you're just adding one more increment to
the original wager size so with that
we're or we're gonna program our own day
Alan Bear strategy now again I already
went through this one so I'm a little
ticked off but here we go define D a
MB ERT and of course same parameters as
usual funds initial wager and wager
count : and we're gonna go ahead and
Global variables that don't exist but
we'll make them so da underscore busts
and global da underscore profits so we
can measure this guy value Eagles funds
start wager equals initial underscore
wager we're not gonna be plotting
anything here current wager equals one
of course we start at one previous wager
this is gonna be so we know was it a
winner loss last time for now we're
gonna say it was a win just because you
will increment but really you're not
doing anything you're just you
definitely don't want to increment or D
increment or anything so so that's that
and also when they're my we'll get into
the next implication but anyway previous
wage show equals our win and then
previous wager amount of course we need
to know what we're adding to so initial
wager for now is where it starts and now
we're ready to begin so Wow
current wager is less than or equal to
wager count what do we want to do if the
previous wager previous wager was a win
then what we want to do is D increment
right but that said just because we want
to be increment every time we have a win
let's say that doesn't mean every time
we would want to do that say like if
you've won so much that you're back to
your initial wager amount if you D
increment you'd be you know betting in
our case a zero or actually in
everybody's cases a zero so you want to
have a check so what we're gonna say is
if wager equals initial wager pass else
wager - equals initial wager okay
so that's how we're gonna cover that now
we're gonna roll the dice er
assuming we roll the dice so roll dice
so if roll dice is true so we won
we want to do value plus equals wager
else we lost value minus equals wager
also if we won there's no need to edit
the win but if we lost we do need to
notify the system that previous wager is
loss subsequently if if we've gone bust
we're gonna say if value is less than or
equal to zero as usual what do we do
we're gonna say da bus plus equals one
and we want to break now we come over
underneath this if statement here and
we're gonna run Elif previous wager if
the previous wager was a loss and make
some space if the previous wager was a
loss wager equals previous wager amount
plus initial on her so we're adding one
increment to it if but if our current
value so we need to have a check so we
don't go into the negatives as we've
done with the other one so we're gonna
say if value so if the amount of money
we have minus the wager we're intending
to wage is less than or equal to zero we
can't do that so then we're just going
to say wager equals value so we can't go
into the negatives now when we're all
set there the next thing we're gonna do
is we're gonna roll the dice again so if
we roll the dice and in its true value
coups cash value plus equals wager and
since this was a loss initially we need
to edit that variable so we're gonna say
previous wager equals a win now else
value minus equals wager and we don't
need to notify it that the previous
wager was lost but we do need to notify
what the previous wager
was and that equals wager and actually
we need to do that again here I believe
if the role if we roll dice let's see
previous wager equals when if roll dice
value equals plus you lose wager I think
we need to notify the wager amount on
all of these let's see previous wager
amount equals initial wager if so if we
win ninety plus equals wager I really
think we need to update previous wager
mouth equals wager we need to do this on
all of these really so under the if dice
do that under the else do that under if
that and we already did it onto the else
I think we're all set there so now we've
covered everything except for if we've
gone bust so we'd say if value is less
than or equal to zero
da underscore boss plus equals one break
I need to play anymore
and finally underneath this L if you
alright if L if we want to do current
wager plus equals one finally at the end
of everything we come down here and at
the end of this entire strategy we want
to know if value is greater than funds
da underscore profits plus equals one
and that's basically everything now the
next question we want to know however is
we'd like to call this strategy first of
all so let's go ahead and call this bad
boy
I'm gonna paste up here edit in what we
need so starting funds initial wager is
wager size and wage account here pays
okay copy this or actually cut that and
we'll paste that down here and now just
for debugging purposes I think it would
be wise to have some print statements in
here so so we're sure that this is
working as expected so we'll print
current wager and then wager and then
we'll also pram any funds we have value
value and then in for all dice is the
case print we won
current value value otherwise we lost so
print we lost value value and then
scrolling down further print lost the
last wager current wager and we'll say
wager and then value value and then
again we'll print here print we won
current value value and then here print
we lost current value value cool let's
save that and I think we're prepared to
run so let's run it syntax wrong we mean
syntax
I'm looking at it not seeing it oh here
we go
Oh print there we go let's do it again
all right mm-hmm so this one person
strategy appears to have lost some money
but not everything he's at 8200 right
now after 100 wagers let's scroll up
current wager 100 we won he's still
gonna wager 100 we lost he lost he's
back to 10,000 we lost the last wager
current wager 200 we lost we're down to
9800 then we're gonna wager a 300 we
lose apparently and we're back to him to
9500 lost the last one so we're gonna
wager 400 we won 90 100 we're gonna do
300 I'm looking for a streak of two wins
it looks like we have one down here so
300 we lost 9600 okay we're gonna wager
490 600 we're back to 10,000 we're gonna
wager 310 3 205 110 6 and so on
okay so it looks like our day Alan
bearish strategy is now in full effect
and just for kicks let's go ahead and
comment out some of these prints we
don't need so many prints and eventually
we will actually graph the Dalembert
strategy I suspect it'll look quite a
bit like the doublers strategy over a
long period and then as part of the
point of the day Alan better strategy is
that you want to be a little play for a
while so your odds kind of do go to
50/50 but just for kicks a sample size
wager count will do 10,000 wagers and
let's say here wagering 10 instead so
hopefully this guy doesn't go totally
broke da bus is not oh he went bust a
fan firm blows let's just go ahead and I
guess the fine da underscore bust zero
and really we need to define all these
other variables too
da busts and a profits where are you I'm
so lost right now guys okay we call they
here and then everything else is way
down there so here's what I want to do
time sleep we have time imported okay so
da busts and we'll also call da
underscore profits zero let's run it
again at the end I guess we're not
actually saying anything are we so at
the very end I guess we'd want to say
zero Oh print value zero zero man all
these guys are going broke
it's really something is awry if
everybody is going broke okay I guess
I'll uncomment these out
maybe it's just too many wagers oh you
know what though the problem is they're
not probably the problem is we're not at
fifty-fifty odds I guess we can watch
this guy go broke but that is probably
the issue here is this is a 50-50
betting strategy that is not good if you
have 1% stacked against you I'm gonna go
ahead and guess that's it yeah okay so
maybe in the next video we'll work on is
uh this poor soul what was the most he
ever had he actually went up pretty high
it was at like 15 grand for a little bit
and it went down from there we lost like
some had some serious losing streaks man
you be getting really pissed off at that
point anyway so we'll fix that because
over the long term scale with a lot of
people in the sample the day
better strategy really ought to do
pretty good so anyway we'll hit that in
the next video probably so anyways
hopefully you guys enjoyed
you got your day allen berry strategy
you feel free to play around maybe make
your way to size one if you want you can
probably figure out how to edit rolled
dice to make it 50/50 odds otherwise
wait for the next video as always thanks
