what's going on guys welcome to part
three of machine learning and pattern
recognition for use with stock in forex
trading where we left off we're just
wrapping up our data there's a few ugly
parts the data so we're going to fix
those things and then one more thing I'm
going to show you is just another
representation of that spread because
again I feel guilty because I'm pretty
sure we're going to leave spread out of
this entire series so just want to point
you out or point out spread to you
before we end up going down this really
really long path that probably won't
ever get back to spreads so anyway let's
go ahead and do some stuff with this
plot and then we'll be on our way so the
first thing that we did really only
change we made to just the raw plot
right was I mean we I guess we change
the figure size and then we you know we
did the dates but we haven't really done
anything else so there's a couple other
things that we probably ought to do and
just for displaying this kind of this
tick data the first thing that we're
going to want to do is once we've
arranged this date the next thing that I
think that we ought to do is what we can
we can do is kind of curve or angle the
date so we can go for label and a x1 dot
x axis get underscore tick labels empty
parameters and then just do label dot
sit underscore rotation and we're going
to set that to 45 degrees the next thing
that we really want to do is fix member
on the y axis how it was like I don't
know the numbers right it was doing like
a plus one point whatever we kind of
want that to go away except that just
looks ugly there's no reason for what we
kind of want to see these decimals so
because it does that for us for for a
good reason right so most of the time
you don't really care about like really
long decimals but in this case this is
one of those times where we do care so
what we want to do is do plot GCA
and the dot get underscore y-axes empty
parameters again get underscore major on
our score for matter
empty parameters stunt a dot set
underscore use offset and then we just
want to turn that to false so it doesn't
do that to us so now let's just see
where we are real quick and make sure we
didn't do anything wrong or typos highly
likely that I type Oaks it's hard to
type and talk and sure enough I did I
put a comma right here so if you dot if
you were actually following me make sure
you put that dot there and I get the
stupid error I did that now let's try
again see if we've got any other errors
yeah we didn't okay so here's what we
got right now obviously the dates kind
of and go out there but again this is
really just one day where the data so it
doesn't matter too much plus if you see
down in the bottom right where you cover
you can see the time and the value so
it's not a huge deal but I'll show you
guys how to fix that just in case you
care and so anyway we close out of that
that's looking good for now let me hit
this is going to give me an error there
we go okay so to make space for the
bottom what we can do is use this
subplots adjust so you plot that's uh or
yeah sub plots underscore adjust and one
of my justice the bottom and we want to
add point two three again that's another
thing that's covered pretty well in that
other video so it's pretty much all of
this stuff so if you want to know more
about formatting charts you can check
that out but again that's not really the
focus of this tutorial let's have
already covered it so I don't want to
you know cover the same stuff especially
for the people who have already watched
those other videos now the last thing I
really want to do is show you guys
representation of that spread and so if
you did watch the other video it'll be a
lot like how we did volume right so what
we're going to do is we're gonna say ax
one underscore two so like second
version of a s1 that's just going to be
a x1 got twin X empty parameters and
then all we want to do is do a s1
underscore two dot fill underscore
between and what do I want to fill
between both date first then zero that's
like the minimum that it will fill under
and then
ask - bid so this is basically ask - bid
obviously it's going to be the ask price
- the bid price otherwise known as the
spread so ask - bid and then we'll just
give it a face color of like green and
an alpha of 0.5 and that should be it we
show a pretty decent looking chart at
this point so let's say that we'll run
it and put in girl obviously if you're
not totally new to Python to run the
function you got to type in you know
graph FF to enter and here is our chart
now right so we can actually see
everything it's got that freaking offset
goodness I know it's I know what I did
wrong we need to do is move this plot
GCA offset really want to offset the a
x1 plot stuff so put that here then it
really will offset that so let's run it
one more time alt p and there we go much
more pretty okay so anyways now you can
actually see you know the this this down
here is the spread size basically so you
can see some cool stuff with that spread
size but anyway just something I wanted
to show you guys since we did have bid
bid ask tick data here that you can do
with that data so anyway we're going to
close out of this ones out of this so
anyways that's going to conclude the
third video in the machine learning for
4x and stock trading in the next video
we're going to start building up our
pattern finder so we're going to go
through the text file and start looking
for patterns as always thanks for
watching thanks for your support of
subscriptions and until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
