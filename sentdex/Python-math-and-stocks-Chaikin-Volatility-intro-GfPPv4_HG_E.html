Python mathematics and stock indicators
tutorial video in this video we're going
to be discussing shaken volatility if
you couldn't guess shaking volatility is
a measure of volatility so it's kind of
like average true range and in fact I
would probably prefer average true range
over shaking volatility as far as you
know a measure of volatility is
concerned because basically or even
Bollinger Bands but the good thing about
shaking volatility but also average true
range is going to be the it spits out
just a single line right so you can
throw that number into all sorts of
other formulas so it makes it very
friendly to use elsewhere besides you
know just that indicator the calculation
of shaking volatility is pretty simple
even though I have it broken down into
three steps it's really just one step
it's percent change of X you know from x
periods ago the EMA - high - low but to
break it down first you need to
calculate high minus low then you're
going to calculate the exponential
moving average of that high minus low
and that exponential moving average will
be whatever you choose typically ten and
ten is used so ten EMA and then ten from
X periods ago it's just me like a 10 so
anyway it's up to calculate the EMA of
that high - low done and then step three
is just calculate the percent change of
that you know EMA right and it's kind of
like a moving percent change so it's not
like a real percent change it's more
like a moving percent change from ten
periods ago or however many you want but
usually you're gonna see a tenth time
let's go ahead and look at some examples
real quick so here is our little
charting application if you might know
more about we built this entire charting
application you can watch that charting
stocks ins and python tutorial series
but anyway this is the charting
application here we will be working on
it and the like the actual code I'm just
going to give to you guys and you can
work on adding the formulism here so if
you come with this little thing here
blank so anyways this is the shake and
volatility for a tea or just tea is its
symbol so as you can see you know as
it's getting really volatile well here
it goes up a little bit and then it
continues being very volatile so it
really Rockets up here since I'm a
little lagging but not much then shoot
back up again but that starts kind of
getting stable and sure enough it does
kind of just kind of relax down here at
this line as you can see here it's gonna
sort of oscillate around a zero line but
not by very much but yeah you can get
into the negatives but generally you're
gonna see it a positive movement here so
anyway and again here it's kind of
volatile it comes up but it kind of
relaxes and again you can kind of see
the line just kind of shows out so it's
just mostly I mean obviously shaking
volatility it's purely just a measure of
volatility it's there's no trending or
anything like that in here you can
usually also see that Shake and
volatility is going to somewhat mimic
the volume line so when volume really
spikes you'll probably see Shake and
volatility spike but again I would say
the average true range is probably the
better measurement there anyway so this
is the indicator that we're going to be
covering in the next couple videos so if
that sounds interesting to you guys you
should continue on in the next video in
the next video we'll be calculating it
with in Python and then in the video
after that will actually chart it up on
this exact charting application here so
anyways as always thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
