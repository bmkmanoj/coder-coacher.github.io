another Raspberry Pi tutorial in this
tutorial what we're going to talking
about is accessing your Raspberry Pi
remotely from your local network you can
access your Raspberry Pi from anywhere
in the world you can set that up but
that has a lot less to do with the
Raspberry Pi itself and more to do with
your actual network and that's much more
advanced tutorial we're not going to be
getting into that so there's two major
ways to connect to your Raspberry Pi one
is via some sort of remote desktop and
the other is by adjust SSH which is
secure shell both have their own good
benefits to them so you would do like a
remote desktop if you have any sort of
UI or if you've got video that you want
to show or you just don't you you want
to actually just share the keyboard and
mouse on some computer between the
Raspberry Pi and all that you don't have
to hook it up every time so the first
thing that we need to do to remotely
access the PI is make sure we're
connected in some way to the local
network you come up here to your Wi-Fi
click on that you can't see it actually
because my face is in the way there you
can choose your Wi-Fi make sure you're
connected or you can connect you know
physically with an Ethernet cable or
whatever now once you've got that go
ahead and do your ctrl alt T and T and
that should open up a your terminal now
I want to make it a little larger so
everybody can see and hopefully that's
not too large we'll see what we get love
it so um so now we're going to go ahead
and do is you can do is config and that
will give you a bunch of information if
you are connected physically it would
probably your internet IP address would
be up here but I am not connected
physically I'm actually connected by a
wireless LAN so that's down here and
what you're looking for is your eye net
address my address is one 92161 92162
103 ok so we have that information now
what we want to do is
see if I can get to the bottom of this I
clearly made this too big let's go down
a little bit um once we've done that
once we have that we could in theory
connect to the Raspberry Pi but it's not
going to let us because the SSH server
is disabled by default now on the
Raspberry Pi if you have an older
Raspberry Pi
actually I suppose it would come with
the installation so are they like your
actual operating system so it used to be
the case that SSH was always just
enabled by default but as more and more
people are using raspberry PI's they're
using them in their businesses and all
that it has become a better idea to not
do that because if people got open Wi-Fi
they just need to find the raspberry
PI's IP address they know the default
login and password so that can be
problematic
so generally if you do it the SSH server
enabled and you using the default
username and password is going to keep
warning you by the way you're doing this
and it's stupid anyway we're going to
open up the rest by config so do sudo
maybe and I'm still not on-screen I
don't think let's see if I can do this I
think we're just typing off-screen yeah
so what you want to do is sudo rasp I -
config hit enter and this is the
configuration for your Raspberry Pi due
to a whole bunch of stuff you can change
the password you can change your
hostname you can do glue to options or
interested in interfacing options let's
go ahead and enter there and we want to
enable SSH so go ahead and enter here
and would you like the ssh server to be
enabled yes boom done okay so now ssh is
enabled and we can connect so at this
point we actually can connect via ssh
now if you aren't familiar with SSH
I will hit finish basically on Windows
you're going to need something like
putty so PU TTY you can go to putty org
download that and you can connect that
way or if you're on Macintosh or Linux
it's as simple as opening up your
terminal and doing SSH username which
would be PI at whatever your IP address
is in my case is 192 168 0 103 so you
could do that and can
now if you're on Windows it's a little
more challenging
oops I've already got this one's already
up but basically is do new session you
come over here and you type in the IP
address so 192 168 0 103 hit enter this
will pop up asks you to login I'll login
is hi password is raspberry by default
connected and boom and as you can see
ssh is enabled and the default password
for pi is not a change Beauvoir and the
next time we login to the actual GUI
desktop we'll also have another warning
there telling us that we're probably
making a big mistake
so okay so that's how you can SSH into
the Raspberry Pi once you do that it's
basically the command line as you can
see and so now we can do all kinds of
stuff here once you've done that like I
was saying before if there are any times
where you want a GUI desktop for
whatever reason so you can also do a
remote desktop now for this on Windows
and Mac you probably the easiest is just
to download remote desktop by Microsoft
I think Mac also has a remote desktop
software I'm not sure
and then on Linux its gr desktop so GUI
remote desktop GRS up so that would be
gr test time like so otherwise if you're
on Mac or Windows it's virtual I'm sorry
it's remote desktop by Microsoft
Microsoft ok general in DOS you should
already have it now in order to get
there what we need to do is install some
sort of remote desktop client on the
Raspberry Pi
I choose xrdp if you have already tried
to assault Lex RDP and it failed for
whatever reason in the past it was
easier now it's harder for some reason
because you already have a VNC server
you might need to run sudo apt-get
remove xrdp
VNC for server and tight VNC server if
you've already tried to install you
might need to run that command just to
remove everything and start clean
otherwise if you are clean you should be
able to just do sudo apt-get
install tight VNC server service now I
already have it so this should be done
and then you can do sudo apt-get install
xrdp if for whatever reason something
gets when we when you go to connect and
it doesn't work for whatever reason it
hangs or whatever go ahead and run that
thing to just clear everything and try
again
so once you've got xrdp installed you're
good to go you you could restart the
service xrdp but it should be enabled by
default once you install now on Windows
what you can do is open remote desktop
and in here you can type the IP address
I'm actually one of three it connects
yes and then here's your like your login
screen now you can type PI raspberry hit
enter and if you hang here that's
probably when you'll want to do your you
know remove everything and try again
otherwise here we are in the remote
desktop now because I already have a
remote desktop it's just showing me like
a copy of this other one because this is
also a remote desktop connection but
normally you won't share it like so this
is not on the screen on the actual
Raspberry Pi and I can even turn it on
and show you that that is not showing
you know this stuff here and if you are
on a remote desktop and you're trying to
show something from the ranch by camera
by default it's actually going to show
on that screen I'm not positive if you
unplug the HDMI if it would work but
anyway no big deal but just know
sometimes it can be kind of screwed
anyway that's it for the remote desktop
and remote connection and SSH all that
fun stuff if you're having a problem you
got questions whatever feel free to
leave them below otherwise I'll see you
in the next tutorial where we're going
to be talking about actual terminal
navigation and commands and all that
kind of stuff so I will see you in the
next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
