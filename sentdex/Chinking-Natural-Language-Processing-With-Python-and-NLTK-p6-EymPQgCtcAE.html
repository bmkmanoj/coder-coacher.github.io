our natural language toolkit with Python
for natural language processing tutorial
video series in this video we're going
to be talking about chinking so in the
last video we talked about chunking now
what is chinking it's not really
separate from a chunk it is part of the
same thing actually they're not
different so you change something from a
chunk okay so what is chinking it's the
removal of something so so sometimes
you're going to find that as you're
building these chunks you're going to be
like I want this and this and this this
is this and this and then before you
know it you've basically chunked
everything except for like one thing so
so you can go the other way and you can
actually say you want to chunk
everything except for something okay so
let's see how that might work so we've
got chunks here let us to make things
really simple we're going to change this
chunk and this this new chunk will
basically be a period asterisk and that
should be enough actually so anything
and then 0 more repetition so this
basically means we want to chunk and
then oh yeah we'll do that so one or
more of just anything okay so this will
chunk everything then we do a chink that
we want to do so we'll hit enter space
based researchers and then you begin the
cheek and the way we kind of denote that
is like opposite signs like you've got
like open and closed curly braces the we
define like a chink is going to be a
closed-open okay so now what do we want
to keep out of our chunk well we could
start by keeping out any um verb okay
at any verb or a preposition or whoops
or those uh was that I forget my stuff
forget determiner there we go
or um that's good enough we'll do that
for now and then I basically one or more
any more of these so this is just any of
this get rid of so let's try that chunk
or well chunk with the chain yeah so
these are CR basically worthless so
let's get all the way to applause okay
so as you can see our chunk we actually
haven't said anything about nouns okay
so but it just new to chunk these
together right so that's good we did
chunk this too we don't really want that
and that there so even probably it with
that this other stuff I'm not really
sure it's the best organization here uh
but it worked
regardless actually pretty happy with
this a little chink here for getting
some good noun phrases in for us
actually but you know then you might add
some stuff like to or something like
that to it but for the most part
chicking is pretty simple once you get
chunking it's not really too much to add
to it let's just do that let's see if
that gets us anything better and let's
do five : I think that we'll start a
software we want to be almost right
invited to there we go a return I'm not
sure I'm is being called a PRP which is
not prepositions that personal pronoun I
think I wonder I guess that separates
that actually because I and then am
humbled okay so that's why they're good
anyways um let's chinking this not
really too much more to say about it
really again it's just it can be kind of
confusing with the regular expressions
if you're not familiar with them but if
you get comfort with those they're
regular expressions are useful for a lot
more than just NLT case it's definitely
worth it's never worth learning
them if you uh if you have the time to
sit down so anyways that's trying
kinking the next tutorial video is going
to be talking about named entity
recognition so you can chunk to find
noun phrases or just nouns even and
think oh this is talking about that or
whatever but you're going to find that
you're gonna have some problems with
that when it comes to as we've actually
already seen let's say United States of
America president george w bush it's not
actually keeping them together like
george bush it's not keeping those two
names together as treating them as two
different ones it's correctly
classifying as nouns but it's not
keeping them together so you use chunks
to keep them together but you can also
use named entity recognition to keep
them together sometimes this is pretty
useful for men ltk but also this is one
of the weaker kind of tools that n ltk
offers and my pain as far as you know
power and actual functionality of it it
could be really powerful but it's
obviously a huge challenge but it's
still pretty cool especially because it
can recognize the difference between
things like uh numbers like amounts of
dollars a location name stuff like that
it's pretty cool but it misses a lot of
times especially with names and stuff
like that but anyway that's what you
guys have to look forward to if you have
any questions or comments please feel
free to leave them below otherwise as
