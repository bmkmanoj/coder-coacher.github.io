fundamental investing with use of
programming where we left off we had
just added in this second screen of
screening for not only the price to book
ratio but the p/e eg is well originally
really we had a quite a few that met the
price to book ratio but didn't meet the
PE G of a minus 1 but above zero and I
definitely don't want to change PE G to
accept anything above one but I thought
it might be interesting to look at
anything that was about our below one so
anything below one PBR anything below
one PE g 5 years and sure enough we got
a few more we got AIG with a point seven
for price to book ratio and then at
point nine five PG and we got Bank of
America Citigroup anybody noticing a
trend anyway then we got etrade just
barely meeting price to book ratio but
quite a low PE G then we got Lake Mason
I think with those numbers not too
attractive in my opinion the NASDAQ OMX
same thing that super attractive RSH for
RadioShack which we found before
obviously there Sony a decent price to
book not the best looking PE G ever and
then also excel for excel group not a
bad looking one I guess anyway so
basically all I was trying to do is just
give us a little bit more options so we
can actually continue through this
tutorial series eventually we could run
the screen here against like I was
saying before maybe the Russell 3000
something like that and get even more
stocks and stocks that match better
numbers that we would be more likely to
want to value invest into coz yeah a lot
of times value investing is going to be
in stocks that aren't in the sp500
mainly because the stocks in the S&amp;amp;P 500
aren't gonna show promising growth
prospects you know they're just more of
like a safe haven for money or something
but so you can find options for value
investing in the SP so anyway I'm gonna
close this out now and the other thing I
think we should do now is now that we
get those two numbers maybe we won't put
a limit on it but the next thing we want
to look for is the PE ratio forward p/e
ratio so generally what you want to look
for something with a decently low p/e
ratio Bank of America actually with ten
point six I think normally the number
you're looking for is about 15 something
that's trading at 15 times their
earnings because basically this is this
is price to earnings right so what are
their earnings and then or I'm sorry
we're looking at the wrong number this
was the for AP where we're trying to
look for a trailing p/e right now which
the trailing p/e like currently where
are we at it's trading at 31 times
earnings but you could look at the
forward p/e which obviously it looks
like we're expecting some growth it's
only trading at ten times the forward
earnings that we're expecting for you
know basically December 31st but as far
as the trailing p/e is concerned which I
believe is 12 months it's trading at 31
times so so I guess you know the numbers
that we you really you know this is
expected you know forward p/e same thing
with like PG five-year expected these
are expected numbers so they're not
really set in stone yet like a lot could
change so you know expected earnings are
oftentimes wrong almost every time the
rocks so anyway especially like five
years out you know PG is definitely kind
of risky when you're out it's not so bad
but anyway enough on that I think the
first thing we want to look for is the
trailing p/e ratio what is it trading at
right now and for Bank of America that's
31 times earnings that's quite high
pretty it kind of scares me away so I
wouldn't necessarily go for Bank of
America immediately but anyway what
we're going to be looking for is all the
ratios or at least trailing p/e ratio
for any company that meets the other
requirements so the same thing that
we've been doing before open up the
source code find looking for just kind
of highlight all the way to that figure
and then we'll come over to our script
here and we've not even begun but we'll
define CP eg5 was the price earnings to
growth for five years we're gonna call
this next one PE 12 for price to
earnings for the 12 months and I almost
kind of want to say like PE T for Trent
maybes P 12 T 4 so we can remember that
it's the trailing version equals and
again this will be source code that
split and we've been through this a
million times so I'm not going to
continue explaining and again the other
side of it was just closing table data
tags and the zero at heart after we
split like that and that's P 12 T the
other thing I would like to say is okay
so we got print stock meets requirements
and then just since we're throwing in
more data here let's go ahead and just
so we can see it on the screen when it
prints it out so I'll say price-to-book
colon comma PBR and it's going to print
out PG forward 5 years and then after
that we want to print a trailing
trailing p/e 12 months and then we're
going to print out PE 12 t so now any
stock that is under one price to book
ratio and and under 1p eg for 5 years
we're going to print all that out and
then also will print the trailing p/e we
could also specify that only if you know
the trailing p/e is under a specific
number well let's just look at what we
get by this so I'm going to save this
and run it and then so I'm going to
pause it while this is running
and then I'll resume once it runs
through all of these all right it's all
done so after running it we can see that
obviously we got the same companies that
we had before just in case you are
you're running this you're yourself and
you're seeing that it says like not
available or something like that usually
I want to say not available I mean it
could mean something else but usually
not available means the number is
negative as in they reported negative
earnings so it's not not available I'm
not sure why they do that but because
some companies really will give you a
negative and then but most of the time
it says it's not available so just keep
that in mind like eat there's no reason
to like look into it very deeply because
it is it's a negative number so looking
through the list you know Bank of
America and not to to appealing
Citigroup not really to appealing with
16 and then we've got etrade not too
appealing that's probably negative that
same thing with like Mason Nasdaq not
too appealing with a 17 RadioShack not
too appealing with a not available
probably negative sony not too appealing
and Excel well Excel is the only one
that actually would meet the
requirements of under at least 15 surely
would have to be under 15 so so there
you go we really only have one more left
in this before we might have to think
about it either expanding what we're
willing to allow or expanding the pool
of stocks to something more like the
Russell 3000 or I guess the Russell 2000
maybe it would be the next step or the
S&amp;amp;P 1500 anyway so I'm gonna close out
of this the only thing I've changed now
is I'm just gonna make a shorter array
for SP 500 known and these are just the
ones that we know meet our requirements
that way we're not looking through the
entire S&amp;amp;P 500 every time sucking up our
bandwidth and sucking up Yahoo's
bandwidth so I'm just going to save that
there so now the next thing that we are
going to be curious about is a debt to
equity ratio we're going to want that to
be really we don't want any more debt
than equity if we're a value investing
so we're looking for a debt to equity
ratio that's gonna be less than one so
let's look at for example since we have
Bank of America open and close this pull
up Bank of America scroll down Lord
equity
total debt to equity it's a negative
possibly because again all right it's
not available possibly because it's a
negative total debt yeah so here we go
you've got total cash total cash per
share and then your total debt so yeah
they're probably running a negative that
the equity so they're throwing it not
available let's look at another one
Citigroup and just see and then we'll
look at Excel real quick just to spark
some curiosity so again here I'd be kind
of curious why it's throwing this a not
available here as well let's see if if
we even have a number for Excel because
all these guys are throwing it okay
that's equity here fourteen point eight
eight so there you go
they've got quite a bit about fourteen
times the debt that they have equity so
or almost fifteen so that's gonna blow
Excel right out of the water for books
and make it a non good investment but
anyway in the next video I'll show you
guys at least how to add that layer in
we can also look at current assets we
want that to be twice as much as current
liabilities and then you could look at
the dividend yield if they're given a
dividend you want that to be basically
sixty percent or 66 percent of the
triple a bond yield and let's see what
else would we care about I guess we kind
of care what we want to know about
earnings growth and you want that to be
I don't know at least above five percent
over the last ten years so you could
look at some of those other figures as
well for the value of investing but
pretty quickly we're seeing that we're
running out of stocks just looking for
them within the sp500 but again that was
kind of expected when it comes to value
investing
you're usually not looking for stocks in
the SP or went for value investing
obviously we can find quite a few good
ones for fundamental investing so anyway
hopefully you guys have been enjoying
the series hopefully I've been able to
help some of you guys out as always
