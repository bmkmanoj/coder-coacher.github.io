tutorial in this tutorial we're going to
be building off of the last WX Python
tutorial and this is what we had last
time we'll just run a real quick and we
got this little window to pop up for us
and we just kind of change the title of
the window but we didn't really specify
anything else for this window so I'm
going to show you there's a bunch of
different specifications so to speak
that you can give your windows so some
of the things that we can do you can
apply basically some stylistic things to
these windows so to do that we'll just
add to it you just add another comma
then you just say style equals and here
you just specify everything if you don't
specify everything with this frame now
keep in mind this is a frame now within
the frame you're going to have different
things but as far as the frame or the
window is concerned basically this part
the thing that goes around the window
like a frame goes to a picture if you
just leave this empty it'll be empty
otherwise you can start specifying
things that you want like we want a
maximize box and that's going to be to
maximize the window we want WX system
menu and let's just come down here we
also want WX want a resize button
actually let's not do a resize button
we'll just do this and then we'll say WX
close box oops and then we also want um
WX caption okay so we're going to say we
want all these things so obviously we
didn't we said we didn't want a over
sizable border to this window so we'll
save this will run anything
okay yeah so here we go and sure enough
like there's no no way for me to resize
this window okay so now the other things
that we can do we also didn't have a
minimize so there's no way for me to
like minimize this window I could like
move it somewhere but I can't ah windows
shake hate windows shake anyway I just I
can move it somewhere but I can't at
least push the minimize button same
thing if you go down to your properties
like let me just let me scroll this down
here to these properties and so here you
can see this is the Python window here
and if we come over to here and we
right-click I can't even minimize it
even from that point and so now let me
show you something a little demonic so I
know what you guys are thinking the bad
ones amongst you what if we get rid of
this your the closed box that sounds
pretty nasty so we'll save that run it
and here comes our window and oh my
goodness we can't close it we can we can
make it as big as we want we can make it
small we also can't resize it but we
can't close it now what if we come back
down here to that window and we bring
this up and we right-click it we still
have no close option but what you can do
is just click your clothes app and I
think with probably this then probably
XP and Windows 7 you can just hit that X
for anyone else I'm really sorry for
what I just did to you now continuing
right along you'll have to access your
control-alt-delete if you can't get rid
of it but anyway just kind of comical so
yeah that's how you do kind of the
buttons on the window naturally I really
wouldn't change any of those the only
thing you might want to do away with is
the resizable function but you'll see in
a minute that you can spawn that window
to be any size so with that eventually
you're going to want to put something
within this frame so what you really
need to do is it'll find a
um is a class for the frame so that's
what we're going to go ahead and do and
we're going to set this up and then this
will kind of be the template that you'll
use for making windows in the future so
but we're going to start with now is
we're going to define a class and we're
just going to say class and this will be
window class and in here you just put WX
frame for the parameter and then here
what you do is you define hit it and
that's underscore underscore I and I T
underscore underscore and basically what
this does is make sure that this
it's short for it initializes so you
don't actually have to call it it so as
soon as like the program begins it's
going to do this so with that let me
just put in these parameters here self
parent and then title whatever the you
want that title to be and I'll show you
it's just like any other function really
you give these definitions so next we'll
say it's super and we're just going to
call window class here so and then died
in it and then we're just going to say
it's parent and the title is going to
equal title I'll show you
go Lily shall follow in a second and
then you can also follow with a size
parameter so like if instead of so if
you wanted to take away the ability to
resize you could and then you can
specify like or you can just specify a
specific size like size equals 800 comma
600 okay for example and so like this
we'll make it 800 wide by 600 tall and
then you're obviously going to want to
do self dot show so the window actually
shows and then down here we'll just do
the iconic actually yeah we'll just do a
B equals WX done app as you can eat that
then we'll do window class and we'll say
none we want it to be the
main window here so it has no parent and
then we'll call the title epic window
and then finally we'll call that a
little main loop there and we'll save it
we'll run it and sure enough here's our
epic window it's too big to even fit in
my little recording but this is the epic
window let's make it a little smaller
we'll make it a 200 by 300 so 200 wide
300 tall here it is epic window and then
we can resize it so we can actually read
the title so that's our new epic window
those are how you can kind of change the
sizes that's probably the size changing
is probably like the number one thing
besides the title of the window you'll
want to be able to change easily
so the next thing you'll see is like on
this screen for example when I hit run
to run this I'm having to drag the
window over it's coming from a different
part on my screen so what if you know
this is where we want the window to
pop-up right you can do a a move command
so what we'll do with this is we'll say
so move and let's move it 800 and down
to 50 so it's going to move it over 800
and down to 50 it's just like HTML where
it starts at the top left basically and
it's going to move that around so we're
going to say we want to move it 800 um
over to the right and 250 pixels down
from where it's been spawning let's see
if it spawns on top of where we are now
almost it's just barely above so now we
could drop it down I don't know we'll
try like 350 we'll run that and there it
is so now it's actually showing up at
least within this window area we can
move it even over a little bit further
so we could say we want it 1000 pixels
and now it's popping up here so anyway
as you can see you can use that to
dictate exactly where a window might pop
up on screen now finally there's also a
command or you can just say like if you
want that window to appear at the center
of the screen you can use self-thought
only it's sent tree-like Center I don't
even know if it's like British spelling
or what however I can't really show you
this it's it won't Center on my screens
I think it's probably because I've got a
bunch of monitors so it just doesn't
want it I don't think it knows where to
go so I don't really know but it doesn't
work for me so I can't really show it to
you but you can try that out since of
like moving the mundo you can say Center
it and maybe once we've initialized we
put a window within a window and start
utilizing window ception
we'll be able to Center a window within
that window I believe so anyway we'll
get we'll get to that point but just for
now I'm just going to tell you that
there's also this command I just can't
use it myself so anyways that's going to
conclude this tutorial um the next one
will be talking about doing like menu
bars and stuffs right now our window is
pretty boring we've got a title and we
learned how to resize it and stuff but
you can't really do anything like we
can't do literally anything so it'd be
nice to have like a menu bar that we can
maybe choose some stuff and yeah so in
the next tutorial I'm going to show you
guys how to do a menu bar</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
