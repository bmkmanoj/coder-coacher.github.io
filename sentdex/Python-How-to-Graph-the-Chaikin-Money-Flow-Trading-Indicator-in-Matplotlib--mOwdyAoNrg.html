what's going on guys welcome to the
third part of the shaking money flow
tutorial video miniseries where we left
off we should calculated the shocking
mindflow now we actually want to chart
it up so if you don't have the sample
data code the link is in the description
for that code and down here is the
actual code so just do a nice highlight
and then copy it and paste it into an
empty script so we'll just do that so
once you've pasted the code in there
scroll up to that empty slot there and
now go over to what we've been coding
and you want to just highlight and copy
and paste the entire basic all the way
down the whole function and the actual
calling of the function and paste that
between here then you'll have to fix the
indentation with two tabs over and now
that we've got this what we need to do
is actually give it some variables since
it returns to bits of data so we'll just
say cmf date and cmf why this is the
y-axis their equals that and then we
want to just do the most basic version
of this will be ax to top slot and then
cmf date- starting point colon and then
cmf y- starting point corn if you don't
know what the- SP colon is you'll have
to watch the charting tutorial series
there and then we'll just color it white
so we'll save that and we'll run that
and just get the basic line oh we're
still plot printing all that I'll cancel
that in a second so there's your basic
jiken money flow here now what we want
to do is get that oscillator line in
there so we can draw that so that's the
next thing we want to do so the next
thing we want to do is actually maybe
fill in that data
the other thing I noticed was that was
the B also there was a little bit large
and we have to fix right here in the
part where it says well why is less than
the length of NF es we accidentally for
the volume range this time we use the X
variable so it was always stuck on this
last x thing there so this the ex is
here need to be changed to wise and that
will fix that issue now to add the
filler what we want to use is a fill
between within matplotlib so what I'm
gonna go ahead and do now is sort of
plot use still underscore between we can
leave these the same and then after that
we'll remove w for now and we'll say 0
that's the oscillating wine and then
we're equals and then we have to compare
it to an umpire right so we would say
numpy beret and then token birth to an
array and we want to use this right here
someone x just copy and paste cmf date
like this so we're cmf date or actually
we won't seem FY we're cmf y and then SP
colon wherever that is less than or
equal to 0 we want that to bill between
and then face color we're gonna say that
equals or greater than or equal to 0 I
think I said less than G sorry there's
like a dog like barking in the
background I don't know if you can hear
it and it's driving me nuts or stopping
me from thinking and alpha equals 0.5 so
that should be it let's check this make
sure everything gets closed off so that
where clause let's see where
let's see I think the where clause and
make it closed off and yeah now let's
check it again ok cool so now we want to
highlight this copy that and paste
another one this time it's going to be
where it is less than 0 less than 0 and
we're going to want to make it red ok so
we'll save that will run it and let's
plot a papal again oh I forgot to get
rid of that stuff again anyway so here's
our oscillator now with with apple and
the correct oscillations there and so
that is our psyche and money flow as you
can see as the money goes entering into
it it goes up and as money leaves down
here it goes down and and so on so
that's how to do that that's how to plot
it up hopefully you guys enjoyed
hopefully learn something new as always
thanks for watching thanks for the
support of the subscriptions and until
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
