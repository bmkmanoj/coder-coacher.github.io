Bitcoin protocol tutorial video in this
video we're going to be discussing the
privacy section of the protocol paper so
a little more exciting than the previous
three sections Bitcoin and Bitcoin
protocol privacy is kind of a hot topic
issue because there are also a lot of
misconceptions surrounding it and
there's a lot of opinions in some ways
bitcoin is more anonymous than your
typical online money methods but in
other ways it's actually more public in
the end it really comes down a lot to
user choice and they can decide kind of
where along the spectrum they wish to be
now the government is going to tell you
that this is a matter of national
security and terrorism and people can't
be private about their finances but in
reality though your privacy is your
freedom and yeah criminals also are
going to see privacy but legit people do
too and really it's your human right so
how does privacy in Bitcoin work and is
that even an issue so from the paper
their traditional banking model achieves
a level of privacy by limiting access to
information to the parties involved and
the trusted third party the necessity to
announce all transactions publicly
precludes this method but privacy can
still be maintained by breaking the flow
of information in another place by
keeping public keys anonymous the public
can see that someone is sending an
amount to someone else but without
information linking the transactions to
anyone this is similar to the level of
information released by stock exchanges
where the time and size of individual
trades the tape so to speak is made
public but without telling who the
parties are so here you can see the
typical model is that identities are
tied to transactions which go through
the trusted third party and then end up
at the counterparty and the public is
basically not informed or better thought
of as separate from all of this in the
Bitcoin protocol network model Bitcoin
protocol model identities are the
separate part and the transactions
basically go through the public in the
form
Pledger so back to the paper as an
additional firewall a new key pair
should be used for each transaction to
keep them from being linked to a common
owner some linking is still unavoidable
with multi-input transactions so kind of
what we were just discussing a moment
ago which necessary which necessarily
reveal that their inputs were owned by
the same owner the risk is that if the
owner of a key is revealed linking could
reveal other transactions that belonged
to the same owner now here's the
important part where the user gets the
right to choose their anonymity level in
the case of a charity for example they
would likely if they were legit opted to
possibly use the same public key for all
donations and expenditures anyways this
is so people could actually see where
the donation money was going this is a
business or an organization that should
be very transparent and this is a very
easy way for people to do it a
corporation with a lot of competition
let's say instead would probably choose
to go the secret route an anonymous
route changing their public key very
often so that it would be harder to
track where money is being spent now
obviously they would still be required
to report earnings you know the
government for taxation purposes and all
of that so that doesn't go away now this
optionality for anonymity is where the
debate is though I think it yields the
best of both worlds businesses and
organizations that should be transparent
now have an extremely simplistic way of
doing it business people in businesses
that have a level of security invested
in being private also have a simple way
of doing so also these options can even
be married for a perfect balance that
you can choose or your business can
choose so you can have your public funds
in one location the stuff you don't
really mind if people see and then you
can have some private finances that you
don't want the public to be aware of how
much you have or what you spend your
money on now all of that said when
concerning you know this kind of matters
of national security and terrorism kind
of stuff look tracking Bitcoin payments
is easier than tracking most online
payments and it's definitely easier than
tracking cash payments if one really
tries really hard
they would relatively easily be able to
filter through all the payments and
eventually start linking accounts you
can make a tree and if you have you know
at least a few accounts in mind you can
kind of start using process of
elimination and get rid of accounts and
you can start finding out who exactly
owns what true anonymity is actually
pretty hard to get away with on this
public ledger so far some of the most
anonymous minded people in Bitcoin
trying to evade law enforcement still
have failed I don't think there's any
problem with this added degree of
privacy it's simply just a new model
that it's not necessarily more private
than the last and if anything I would
argue that this new model is actually
more public than the past now I went
ahead in this section and gave my
opinion so the floor is open of course
to anybody who wishes to disagree with
me and tell me I'm stupid or whatever if
you have any questions or comments as
