optimization or SEO tutorial series
where I plan to show you the legitimate
ways of going about SEO with your
website in the past the skill of SEO has
really been a matter of figuring out
what Google wants to see and giving it
to Google obviously that's no good
because it results in people making
websites for Google and not actual
people so Google is constantly trying to
fix this or at least make it to the
point where what Google wants is what
people want and really every year they
make pretty big changes to their
algorithms and all that stuff that
actually ranks a page and serves as a
result in someone's search obviously if
you think about it they must do this
because if you look at for example at
the early days the best way to get a
good page rank was to have a lot of
specific keywords and like some of the
top ranked niche sites for example
really just had bodies of text that made
like no logical sense but contain a
bunch of content specific keywords and
strings and stuff like this just to get
ranked since then really Google is made
of a ton of changes for how they
actually rank sites and find sites
because they have to if they're
returning basically spam sites then
they're not really doing their job very
well and people aren't getting the
results that they're looking for and in
the end
Google's losing credibility the customer
is losing it's just it's not a good
situation and Google knows that so
Google really is constantly evolving and
is getting to the point where you know
what Google wants to see is what Google
believes people want to see as well or
at least experience on your website so
that's really a case where SEO is more
of a function of just understanding your
customer and the customer experience or
the user experience on your website so I
mean of course there's still some basic
things that you can do to what I would
call accommodate Google but most of SEO
is really understanding the target
audience and taking into account a bunch
of customer experience factors like you
know the different browsers loading time
obviously your content
and a whole bunch other stuff that will
actually start getting into and that's
really the way it ought to be right you
really ought to be making your website
for your user and Google should really
work around that so it's really good
that this is the way that SEO is going
so in the subsequent videos in this
series I'm going to be covering what I
would say with scare quotes current SEO
practices it is late September 2013 so
these these things might change but I
really doubt it because the road that
Google is on right now for and then as
far as like what you need to do right
now for SEO is pretty pretty good
direction so I'm not really sure too
much of this stuff a little change I
also I urge you to ignore anyone selling
any sort of SEO tricks or gimmicks or
whatever and don't buy things like
backlinks and all that stuff just don't
do it instead what you really want to do
is learn how to get your target audience
and and how to make their experience on
your website the best as possible while
also being clear to Google about what
your website's actually about in the end
there really is going to be no trick or
gimmick but the process of search engine
optimization is actually going to help
you improve your website there's still
will be obviously people who are going
to try to cheat and even people who are
successful in cheating in the short term
but we have to understand is Google's
main focus with their search engine is
to eliminate cheating and serve truly
good results and I assure you
Google's putting in way more effort here
than you could ever put into your
website and cheating so it really is
going to be a losing game if you do try
to cheat so let's make our websites
better improve traffic and do it legit
so if that sounds interesting to you
please continue on to the next video in
this series as always thanks for
