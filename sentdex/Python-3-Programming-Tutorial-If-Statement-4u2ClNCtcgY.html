tutorial on the if statement as well as
assignment operators I've decided to
just combine the two since they're used
very often together anyway in
programming can be useful very quickly
to begin adding some degrees of logic to
your program and one of the most basic
forms of logic that you can use is just
the if statement so the if statement is
used to check to see if something is the
case if it is the case do something
otherwise continue along and you know
don't do anything under the if statement
so one of the most common things that
you're going to use with your if
statement is going to be some sort of
assignment operator so these things are
like greater than less than greater than
or equal to less than or equal to or
just straight-up equal to so let's go
ahead and cover a few of those so to
start let's say x equals 5 and we'll say
y equals 8 and so a basic if statement
would go something like this like if X
is greater than y : enter and it'll just
go down here for you print well if
that's the case X is greater than 1 so
we can save and run that and we would
see here if X was greater than Y it
would have done something but that's not
the case so it did nothing but if we
change this if X is less than Y and we
run it this time we'll we got X is
greater than Y but that wasn't the truth
there we go
so anyways it runs the code so the next
thing that we can do though is we can
add another variable so I'm just going
to leave this and when we're going to
add a Z whereas a Z equals 5 and now
what we can do though is we could say if
Z is less than Y which is greater than X
what do we want to do well we can print
Y is greater than Z and greater than X
save that run it and sure enough that is
the case because Z and X are equal to 5
and Y is equal to 8 but you're able to
do this kind of stuff and what if we did
a equals
three and then we did something like
this a save and run that and yet again
we get Y is greater than Z and greater
than X we didn't say anything about a
but you can see that it was indeed the
case here so as you can see this could
get really hairy really quick and all
we're using is these greater than or
less than signs but it turns out that
you can also use there's a couple other
things that we can do so let's go ahead
and cover some of those so at the same
time we could say if Z is less than or
equal to X what you know do something so
we'll say print um Z is less than or
equal to X we'll save and run that and
sure enough that is the case because Z
is actually equal to X they're both 5 so
we know that's the case and so we can
see here that the less than or equal to
sign did its part there's another thing
that we could do though let me do this Z
is equal to X and you can say if Z is
equal to X but you can't do this you
can't say if Z equals x because it's
almost asking like is that the variable
definition or what not so what you have
to do is a double equal sign and that
means if it equals x so there are some
languages where you would you could say
like if something equals something and
then like the double equals means like
is it fully equal so like if one and
then string one those would equal each
other but then they wouldn't you know
double equal each other but in this
sense in Python the way that you would
do it is if Z equals using double equal
signs then we would say Z is equal to X
save and run it sure enough that is the
case the other thing that you can say is
does not equal and the way that you do
that is with an exclamation mark equal
son so if Z does not equal um x then we
would run this but it does equal x so it
will run but if Z does not equal let's
say Y we can save and run that and sure
enough it
because it is is indeed not equal so
those are the basics to the if statement
as you can see it's very simple
statement but then you can start adding
other things to it and the next video
we're going to add to it
is the else so stay tuned for the else
statement very exciting a change to the
if statement so stay tuned for that
hopefully you guys enjoyed hopefully you
learned something new as always thanks
for watching thanks for all the support
the subscriptions and until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
