what's going on everybody welcome to the
beginning of my series dedicated to
Bitcoin trading so if you didn't already
know
bitcoins non-centralized and
non-regulated cryptocurrency non-general
you're going to hear people say it's
like decentralized or deregulated but it
was either it was never either of those
so the whole d thing doesn't quite make
sense so the money is just controlled by
a peer-to-peer network secured by this
encryption so it makes it pretty much
impossible to crack and even if you
couldn't if you could crack it it would
just make more sense to dedicate that
computing power towards being a part of
the system rather than cheating it so
that's pretty much all I'm going to
really mention on that if if you want to
know more about the intricacies of like
what exactly bitcoin is and how it kind
of like works fundamentally then I
definitely suggest you check out there's
a tutorial video put up by Khan Academy
and they cover it very well as far as
like the fundamentals of how Bitcoin
actually works and all that also if
you're looking for Bitcoin mining you're
not going to really find that here in my
opinion Bitcoin mining is just like a
massive rat race and in the long term
pretty much everybody has to lose that
race or at least most people have to
lose that race it's a great model for
efficiency but it's going to require you
to make you know constantly forward even
just to keep up and so if you're for
example a lot of people buy Bitcoin
mining stuff like you know gear that's
specifically made to mine Bitcoin
doesn't really make any sense because if
you're going to be if it's going to be
lucrative for you you're gonna have to
be ahead of the crowd but if you're
buying something you're just met you're
like making yourself part of the crowd
so don't really see the point in that
so now you know what Bitcoin represents
is you know a plausible seismic shift in
the entire way the world works power
allocation and all that right I mean
from the ground up Bitcoin is all about
just freedom right and the system itself
is nothing short of beautifully
brilliant right when it comes to
comparing Bitcoin to really any other
currency that we have today
you know all these currencies are fiat
currencies anyways any hard press to
logically prove with reasoning why
bitcoin is inferior to any other
currency yet you can find a lot of
reasons why you might consider it
superior to those other currencies so so
with that let's let's go go ahead and
get on to what I intend to really cover
in this series and that's going to be a
hard look in trading Bitcoin okay so as
always um when it comes to this kind of
stuff my videos covering this sort of
activity are purely educational only I'm
not here to suggest to you guys that you
buy into Bitcoin or sell Bitcoin or do
any sort of financial transaction at all
you're all big people you're responsible
for your actions and so yeah so for
legal reasons I also probably ought to
add if you're not a big person as in
you're not considered an adult in your
country then for legal reasons I must
say that you are not permitted by me to
watch this video
so with that along those lines the
interesting thing about Bitcoin and
source form you know future controversy
no doubt is that it's you know there are
no government control you no regulation
laws whatever anything that dictates
Bitcoin and who can take part in this
system right it's just free-for-all
so like recently China did just ban
their banks from dealing with Bitcoin
but actually banning anybody from using
it is near and Piatt
I guess banning people from using it
isn't impossible but actually stopping
people from using it it's like the war
on drugs right and it's a it's a good
analogy to use because like people say
Bitcoin is anonymous but you could still
be made illegal and just because it's
anonymous doesn't mean it can't be made
illegal and you can't get in trouble for
it if there's like no you know ledger
out there that says who you sold your
pot to or what not but you still can get
in trouble so so yes it is it can be
anonymous if you take the proper steps
but again there is actually a huge
ledger for all your Bitcoin transactions
that's completely public which is great
and if you want to stay anonymous
there's a lot of things you still need
to kind of do about it
about that but anyway back to what I was
talking about like a lot of well at
least along the lines of that you know
like you're protected by the 256 AES
encryption but a lot of exchanges are
going to require that you provide a
personal ID or I don't know this kind of
stuff so yeah but you obviously don't
have to use an exchange at all to buy
and sell Bitcoin you can do this
peer-to-peer purely it's just it's nice
when you use an exchange so anyway
children can indeed get into trading
Bitcoin unlike trading stocks or Forex
where you must be an adult you know
simply just because of the laws of the
land right now this kind of hits close
to home for me because I actually made a
living as a kid and then even through
university in the engaging of exchanging
of virtual currency for real-life US
dollars that wasn't in Bitcoin but it
was in another virtual currency and so
on you know I don't know how I've
totally feel about it you know playing
in the market is a bit of gambling and
so it's tough I understand the laws why
why countries and so our governments
want to protect their children from
losing all of their value in in
something like this but anyway this non
you know regulation makes margins pretty
nice anybody can take part profitability
is fairly easy but so is loss so you
know like with Bitcoin pretty much
anybody can trade on their own anybody
can open up their own exchange or Jenny
fees and whatever so this obviously
brings a lot of competition but it also
brings high risks since it isn't
regulated it takes nothing really I mean
you do you have to jump through some
hoops just as you know get on board with
various financial institutions to be
able to do stuff like this but for the
most part there's no you know license
exams or anything like this or
background checks for you and all this
kind of stuff officially so this means
all as well that Bitcoin it has no value
at the moment in the eyes of the law
really it's not regulated so if someone
steals all of your Bitcoin there's
short of street justice there's nothing
you can do and chances are street
justice is illegal in your country so
you're just screwed and this sort of
thing has happened and I've not heard of
any retribution to the folks who have
ran off with people's money so yeah so
keep in mind that just because you found
a website that promises X or or tells
you that you can gain one percent
Interest a day just by storing your
bitcoins with them it doesn't mean that
your precious coins are going to be
there tomorrow morning when you wake up
or the website for that matter right so
in every sense you know it's the Wild
West uh the only reason people have to
not steal your money is either you know
they have morals which is quite rare
these days or the reputation is worth
more than that or the profit they're
making from their business so and it
seems like Mount GOx for example who's
you know the number one exchange charges
0.6%
mostly because of their reputation where
an exchange like btc-e
is going to charge 0.2% but as you'll
find out later on we'll probably in the
next video discuss what exchange you
ought to consider and why and all this
um it might not stick might still be
best not to go with Mount GOx anyway so
if all you do is watch this video and
think you're going to go to Mount GOx
and trade listen to what I have to say
in the next video so you know but the
idea of it is you know like well mount
GOx currently is attempting to to you
know hold their reputation as well and
lately they've been having some trouble
and so has Bitcoin especially with the
most more recent banning in China and
even someone like mount GOx right let's
consider Mount cogs and where Mount GOx
came from if nobody knows let us visit
webbed archive duh
there we go let me bring this window
down here now Mount GOx let's see how
mount GOx got it start
GOx calm so mount gooks actually
originated as a website all about
trading cards for Magic the Gathering it
literally stands for MTG Oh X's Magic
the Gathering online exchange so so
here's an old thing back in one was this
2007 this was mount GOx and then they
tried to be like some sort of video game
or something I think in 2011 that didn't
work out and then finally they actually
did get purchased I forget who actually
forget the guys name but I don't think
it's the same dude that's actually
running it now that said the domain name
was purchased by somebody apparently
anyway so this is you know very early on
here's Bitcoin at a $3 Wow very nice
graph they have going on here anyway um
those Mountain GOx and again this is
2011
I'm filming this on December 7th 2013 so
these people have been around for two
and a half years at least so we so we
see so let's look here real quick and
see where they're doing on this date
back in oh nine pretty sure this is
where they were doing their video game
stuff yeah you're a warlord in the
outskirts of the known world struggling
blah blah blah okay so you get the point
this website's pretty young and
considering the amount of effort
required to build this website in the
amount of time and the amount of money
that they could make if they just ran
off right now it's pretty scary so so
even though mount GOx is in theory
number one but quite possibly losing it
stay tuned for the next video you still
have to keep in mind that the crazy
amount of risk involved in this system
right so anyways that's my that's my
introduction here if you guys were
paying any attention I've got the the
prices of Bitcoin in the background here
just a few ideas right off as far as you
know how you can trade this is uh right
now this orange line is Mount GOx the
white line or white ish line is the
btc-e both of these are the the Bitcoin
a USD ratio and as you can see the gap
is actually quite large
for the most part and then it did come
come in a little bit there so this graph
is about the last hour of prices so but
normally you're going to see this
massive gap it's actually very rare that
the gap is this small for this long
probably um either Bitcoin or BTC dash
is going to just plummet down even
further or we'll see Mount GOx shoot up
to a pretty significant degree usually
the gap is you know about $25 or so but
as we can see here I mean they're very
close about within $4 and so a lot of
people do ask about arbitrage and all
this stuff and so yeah we will be
actually talking all about quite a bit
of different trading methods that you
might want to consider and all that but
first it's good to introduce everybody
that the main issue is there's plenty of
information about what bitcoin is
there's a lot of information about
mining Bitcoin the information however
to actually trade Bitcoin is very very
sparse and it's littered with scams and
viruses so there's always that so anyway
hopefully I'll be able to help you guys
out at least educate you on what's
what's out here what what this is all
about and either convince you that you
might want to do it or even not convince
you or talk you out of dealing with it
at all
so anyway as always thanks for watching
thanks for all the support in the
subscriptions and until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
