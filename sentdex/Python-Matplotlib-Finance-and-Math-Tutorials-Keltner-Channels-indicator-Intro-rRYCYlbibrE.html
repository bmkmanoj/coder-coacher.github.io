Python mathematics and finance
indicators tutorial video in this video
in the next few videos we're gonna be
talking about these Keltner channels so
what are the Keltner channels obviously
are often times you're going to see them
denoted as K TLT they're very similar to
Bollinger Bands in their appearance and
they're also just like Bollinger Bands
volatility based bands that are going to
kind of operate above and below an
exponential moving average line so
there's going to be three lines to them
so if you've ever seen a picture of them
you would probably ask well what's the
difference between these Keltner
channels and Bollinger Bands so
Bollinger Bands if you recall we did
already have a tutorial on how to do
those Bollinger Bands are using standard
deviation to give the width basically
whereas these Keltner channels they're
using ATR Average True Range and if you
don't recall that we also had a tutorial
on those and that is calculated like
standard DVD measure of variance but
standard deviation is a little bit
different or a lot a bit different than
Average True Range and if you don't
recall Average True Range which is
basically the largest price difference
between bars so usually the high minus
low but could also be like the high
minus the previous close price and so on
anyway the Keltner channels also make
use of EMA so an exponential moving
average rather than a simple moving
average which the Bollinger Bands use
that said you can of course instead of
using an SMA in your calculation of
Bollinger Bands use an EMA that's not
like the end of the world that you made
that simple change plenty of people do
it but anyway those are the differences
and generally because of the standard
deviation here you'll find one that if
the stock has made massive changes over
a period of time standard deviation
won't really keep up whereas average
true range will actually keep up a
little bit better yet at the same time
standard deviations a lot a little bit
more volatile in its movements then
you'll find ATR is so with that how do
we actually calculate
these bad boys well as I said it comes
in three lines the top line is gonna be
your time frame EMA so whatever time
frame you choose there forget which one
what we're using at I want to say we're
doing a 20 period EMA and then it's
gonna be plus two times the ATR Average
True Range and then you're using a
secondary time frame there and I believe
we're going to use a 10 again it's up to
your discretion however you want to do
you can do 20 20 or 10 10 or 15 50 or
whatever that you want to do middle line
is just as simple it's a simple
exponential moving average it's just an
exponential moving average for whatever
that time frame is and then the bottom
line is going to be that time frame
minus 2 times the ATR of TF 2
so our ATR of using the TF 2 so that's
the calculation now let's actually look
at a couple examples and I'm also going
to compare them with you guys to
Bollinger Bands so the first one this is
the Keltner channels and we're gonna
plot up let's do Starbucks that's a good
one to start with since that's what we
usually use so this is our Starbucks
Keltner channels so as you can see they
do look very similar to our Bollinger
Bands so similar in fact that let's go
ahead and plot the Bollinger Bands so
I've got a Bollinger Band plotting here
so we'll plot up Starbucks move it over
here so I don't get lost so here's our
Bollinger Band so the way you'll tell
them at least for now is these ones are
white these ones are
cyan so one you know you can't change up
like your width that you want to try to
think about what stock looks good with
our current settings under Bollinger
Bands let's probably yeah eBay was one
that we use so let's plot up eBay and
compare the two of them so that's eBay
on that wine the Bollinger Bands and
then I don't know what I did with here
we go put this up here
Animal Park eBay now to get the Keltner
channel so here is eBay's Keltner
channel and then here is the Bollinger
Bands so as you can see fairly similar
at least with eBay if anything maybe the
Bollinger Bands are doing a slightly
better job even with eBay but then
another one and this is what I mean with
why I don't like Bollinger Bands so much
is you saw how could it work with eBay
then say we want to do another company
like maybe Apple Bollinger Bands I'll
move this over and you can see that the
Bollinger Bands we almost don't even see
them right they are there though like
you know if we zoom in here here they
are and then we'll go to Apple on actual
Keltner Channel you know see the Apple
actually lines up quite right and I
think this really brings home the point
and why Bollinger Bands are not
necessarily the best idea because
they're gonna be different with every
starts almost like they're not
normalized you know so so your settings
would have to in theory change depending
on what stock you're doing unless of
course we did something horribly wrong
in our calculation of Bollinger Bands
which is totally possible if anybody you
know see is what we maybe did wrong or
why this would even occur feel free to
let me know so anyway so that's a little
bit of a comparison of eight or eight
Bollinger Bands in the Keltner channels
and some of their differences overall I
mean they're fair at least when
Bollinger Bands are working it's very
similar but anyway actually like Keltner
channels better and I think at least
with the calculation of them it makes a
lot more sense to me in my mind why that
why they're even a used indicator but
notably Bollinger Bands are far more
popular so interestingly enough now so
that's kind of like your introduction to
these Keltner channels what they do how
they're used generally with bands like
this you'll see like with Apple here
like we're now looking at Keltner
channels and this is a great example of
what I mean though see like Apple went
from you know just this tiny price of
you know around 60 bucks or so and now
it's like way higher so it's standard
isn't necessarily the best use even
though I think I believe that we were it
was like a moving standard deviation but
maybe it wasn't so it never actually got
any thicker its I was always using like
the same kind of deviation with so maybe
that was our problem in our calculation
of it or something anyway so like when
you get you know like a breakout like
what happened here where price you know
broke out here so that's kind of a very
bullish signal and again it broke out
really strong here very bullish signal
broken Taney break account and then it
went ahead and broke out all the way
down here very bearish signal and
continued on so that's kind of a signal
way that you can use them as like a
signal for what's to come same thing
there was a breakout down here as well
where I went below the bands and then I
break out again above the bands up there
so anyway that's some of the signals so
in the next video what we're going to be
talking about is how to calculate this
with in Python and then how to actually
plot it up on the chart just like this
you just won't have the MACD indicator
down here so that sounds interesting to
you guys stay tuned the next video as
always thanks for watching thanks for
