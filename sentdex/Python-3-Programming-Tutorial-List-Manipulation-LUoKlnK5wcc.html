another Python 3 basics video in this
video what we're talking about is list
manipulation within Python so the last
video we talked about tuples versus
lists and we said that lists are mutable
which means we can manipulate them
change them and all sorts of fun stuff
and there's a lot of built-in things
that we can do with lists so we don't
have to program our own ways around it
so with that let's go ahead and get
started
first we're going to need an example
list so let's just make an example list
you do not have to copy my exam exact
list feel free to make your own I'm just
making numbers up right now
there's my list so now the next thing
that we want to do is like let's say
you've got this list and you want to add
something to it you see we only have one
two three four twos we want one more too
so let's say we want to add another two
well that's going to be append right so
it's just like writing files write
append you're just adding something to
the end so we can do the following
X dot append - and what this is going to
do is it's going to modify this X
variable okay so it's just going to
automatically add this so it's changing
the variable of X so now we'll print X
we can run this and we see that we
started with seven - now it's 7 - 2 okay
so that's how we can add add information
so a list can really contain anything so
I was going to say add a number but
actually you can add numbers you can
really add any any sort of Python data
type you can boom shove it in there so
the Python list doesn't have to be just
numbers or strings and so you can do a
lot of really fun stuff with this
especially later on we'll talk about
dictionaries which you can do even more
fun stuff with but anyway more on that
later now what if you want to insert a
number or add a number and you don't
want it to go to the end while you use
insert which is what I was thinking
that's why I said it but anyway use
insert so instead of a pen - let's say
we want to insert a two
and what we can do the first might have
these flips the first one is where you
want to insert it so the element ID that
you want it where you want to insert it
and then the second one is what is the
value that you want to insert so let's
say we want to insert into index of two
and we want to insert 99 so we actually
are positive that we inserted it
correctly so let's do that
so let's save and run that alright so in
the second second index spot so again
it's zero with first second we didn't
enter a 99 so that's how you can insert
data exactly where you want it so
sometimes append isn't exactly what you
want now what if you actually want to
remove data so we've talked about how we
add how do we get rid of data well
simple as remove X dot remove and this
is going to remove the first example so
here we have a lot of two's let's say we
want to get real one of the two's um
we'll just do two we'll print X so this
this list will do five six one basically
because we remove the first two from
this list
simple enough giving that we could do is
you can remove say you wanted to remove
you know the third element or or let's
just get this two removed again but
let's say we want to remove it a little
differently so we can remove like this
we can say remove the X 2 right so we do
something like that and we've still
removed that too so we're saying here we
want to remove the third element in the
list but the index value of two right so
it is the third element but anyway so
that's how you do that um so that's how
you can remove not only the specific
number or you can even reference the
number that you want to remove using the
list that you're trying to remove from
uh the next thing that we want to do is
we already know that we can reference
that with this so again we showed it in
the last video but just in case you
forgot you can reference data so X the
item in X the list of X right with an
index value of five so that should be
zero one
one two three four five that should be a
seven
save and run that sure enough it's a
seven that's how we can reference that
data another thing we do is what's
called slicing so we can get a slice of
this data so say we want to get a X from
the Y element ID of our index of five to
the index of seven we can get that slice
so it prints seven two and it stops goes
from the first element right and then it
goes up to the ending element so as you
can see we didn't get three we got two
elements so it printed the index of five
the end of six and then it stops because
it had reached seven so again here we go
there's a few more elements for you so
we'll close out of this so that's how
you can access a slice also if you want
to access
you know maybe let's say you want to
access the last element of the list you
would use negative one so that will give
us 8 - yeah you can do the same thing
you could say negative two that will
give us a seven okay so that's how you
can kind of go to the end of a list as
well so now one of the other things I
want to do is we can say print let's say
X say we want to print say you want to
know what like say you want to get rid
of the six let's say let's see if we
haven't okay one one is only occurs once
let's say you want to get rid of the
number one in this list but you don't
know it's a number one or you want to
know the element idea of number one
let's just say for whatever reason you
want to know the earth rather the index
value of the number one in this list
what you would do is at X dot index one
so this is just going to tell us what is
the index value of one right now this
doesn't make sense but I'll show you in
a moment why this will be useful to get
the index value right now it might not
matter to you but when it what happens
is when you have two lists that are in
relation to each other and you can get
the element or the index value of one
item in its list you can immediately
find the corresponding value in the
other list why you would do that over a
dictionary I'm not positive but you
might find yourself needing this so
anyway it will show it anyways so print
X
and x1 the index value of one is three
showing up zero one two three we're
right okay the other thing that we can
do is say we are curious how many of a
certain variable is in there certain
data is in there what we can do is X dot
count um and we can do count and let's
say we want it on my six as there are so
print X dot count and we have three
there is literally a dog underneath
snoring I'm so sorry if you guys are
hearing anyway I think I woke them up
anyway uh-huh so let's count we can
count how many values of this art in
there the next thing that we can do with
lists is we can sort a list and
generally a list is actually very old
Python is going to sort it intuitively
so with numbers it will sort it
numerically and if you have text or
string data in here it's going to sort
it alphabetically so let's just show an
example so print X dot sort whoops
actually what we want to do is this
sorry we don't want to print so we'll do
XOR and then we'll print X okay so the
route the route what I did there is you
can't really print X dot sort sort is a
function that is being run on X so when
you do X or again lists are mutable so
this is actually changing the X a list
right now so that's why I couldn't get
away with printing it but anyway so exit
sort then we print X and we see that it
was sorted numerically for us
nice the other thing that we could do is
let's say we have another list y equals
and we have some names in here we have a
Janet we've got Jesse I like those J's
man we've got Kelly
we've got Alice we've got a Jo and we've
got a Bob
okay we can do Y dot sort train clips
bring why save and run that and we can
see that this was sorted alphabetically
for us so we don't actually have to say
hey sort this alphabetically or so this
sort this by number it just kind of does
it but if you want to sort a list that's
how you can do it
and so this I think that'll be it at
least for list manipulation will be
covering some more in the next video as
far as like showing two different lists
the next video I think we're going to
cover probably doing a CSV file and then
then I'll show you how you can why that
find functionality was was useful so
anyways anybody has any questions or
comments I kind of ran through a lot of
the things that we can do with lists
hopefully I did a decent job of just
covering the tip of the iceberg here
when it comes to list manipulation if
you guys have any questions or comments
leave them below as always thanks for
watching thanks for all the support in
the subscriptions and until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
