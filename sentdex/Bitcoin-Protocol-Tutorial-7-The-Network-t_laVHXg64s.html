Bitcoin protocol paper explained
tutorial video in this video we're gonna
be discussing the Bitcoin network setup
despite the scary and ominous sounding
name this is actually a piece of cake
compared to the previous proof of work
section so you guys can all breathe easy
so with that let's go ahead and get
started so this section starts with the
steps to run the network are as follows
1 new transactions are broadcast to all
nodes to each node collects new
transactions into a block 3 each node
works on finding a difficult proof of
work for its block 4 when a node finds a
proof of work it broadcasts the block to
all nodes 5 nodes except the block only
if all transactions in it are valid and
not spent already 6 nodes express their
acceptance of the block by working on
creating the next block in the chain
using the hash of the accepted block as
the previous hash ok simple enough so
it's step 1 every transaction that's
done is just broadcast and this again is
on a best effort basis and more on that
at the end here number 2 each node
collects new transactions into a block
sure that's just you know we're logging
all the transactions that have occurred
into the newest block number 3 whilst
doing number 2 each node is working on
finding that proof of work for that
block so that's what we talked about in
the previous two videos is the whole
proof of work stuff number 4 when a node
finds the proof of work successfully
it's gonna broadcast it's just gonna
yell it out to everybody hey I got it
just one big announcement and again this
announcement is on a best effort basis
and again more on that shortly though we
did cover at least what that means in
the abstract number five nodes will
accept that new block only if all the
transactions within it are valid and not
pre spent transactions number six
acceptance of a block is expressed by
these nodes when the nodes begin working
on a new block and
basically they show their acceptance of
exactly what block they accept because
they're including the hash of that
previous block in the new block so if
you recall that big timestamp server
from like I think three videos ago the
timestamps are hashed and each new block
contains the previous blocks hash
timestamp which basically is including
every other previous blocks timestamp
because if you recall the order if you
you know hashed the same input in the
same order you would end up with the
same exact hash so that's that's
basically how that how that works and
why that works so you still only have
one hash but it in theory contains every
other hash within it because it it's
based on that order of input all right
so easy enough just as simple rules to
the network and how it works and really
that is you know there are only six
rules so anyway back to the paper nodes
always consider the longest chain to be
the correct one and we'll continue
working on extending that chain if two
nodes broadcast different versions of
the next block simultaneously some nodes
may receive one and/or the other first
in that case they work on the first one
that they received but save the other
branch in case it becomes longer the tie
will be broken when the next
proof-of-work is found and one branch
becomes longer the nodes that we're
working on the other branch will then
just simply switch to the longer one now
here is the first example of another
reason why best effort is the chosen
system as a rule nodes choose to accept
the longest chain because this is the
chain that clearly is the most supported
by the most CPU power in the network
since to be the longest it simply means
that it has the most you know quote
unquote CPU votes so to speak so in the
case of two nodes yelling out a new
block at the exact same time some nodes
will get one version other nodes would
get another and they will both work on
achieving the next block not whoever
reaches the next block first would be
the victor and the nodes working on the
other one would simply shift over
because again at the
broadcasting of a new block the nodes
would realize they were working on a
shorter invalid chain and they would
just hop over to that new one so back to
the paper again new transaction
broadcasts do not necessarily need to
reach all nodes as long as they reach
many nodes they will get into the block
before long block broadcasts are on are
also tolerant of dropped messages so if
a node does not receive a block it will
request it when it receives the next
block and realizes hey I missed one now
again best-effort is further utilized
here this also kind of builds on the
last paragraph where simultaneously two
blocks for broadcast and the winner is
the one where the proof of work is
solved first so if a block is just
missed right if they just somehow didn't
get that message then that nodes gonna
keep working on the previous block and
then once another block has received
that node that is behind is gonna
realize whoops and it's gonna catch up
because it's it's working on the wrong
chain now so now I want to go ahead and
further break down why best effort is
used here and and now again best effort
means in case you skip the abstract it's
an attempt the best effort basically
means there's an attempt to do something
but if that something doesn't occur
there it's done wrong or whatever
there's no reattempt there's no error
reporting any of that and everything
just keeps kind of trucking along so the
main benefit to a best-effort system is
a lot like the main benefit to the
Bitcoin network itself and also a lot of
our it's a lot like a type of machine
learning called an artificial neural
network so an artificial neural network
is neat because it contains a principle
known as graceful degradation so
artificial neural network obviously is
also a network any attend and the
attempt of this is to mimic the human
brain so say you have a task where
you're giving this artificial neural
network and you show it like a picture
of a small couch let's say now some of
the nodes in the network might call it
like a futon or something like that if
you might call it a bed and many are
gonna call it a chair but most hopefully
say this is a couch so if the
artificial neural network is working
correctly couch will have the most votes
though still many of the nodes will be
incorrect
possibly even corrupt so this is why
graceful degradation is nice and why
neural networks within logic of programs
is really helpful orders parallel
programming because normally when you
have what's called linear programming
where it's strictly like step by step
it's literally linear it's just a line
if any of the steps along the way get
messed up somehow basically everything
fails
all right you either succeed or you fail
and any degree of failure results in
like catastrophic failure but with
graceful degradation and networking and
also what's called parallel programming
what's used here is if you're using like
a neural network you might have multiple
tasks happening at the same time
multiple calculations and all this some
can fail some can be wrong some kind of
bugs but as long as the majority are
correct you'll find yourself having
success now a good analogy here is like
a rope versus a chain so in a chain if
one of the links are broken the whole
chain is is rendered useless
catastrophic failure but with best
effort or normal networks or parallel
programming you've got something more
like a rope where the fibers of the Rope
individually can break yet the Rope
itself is still successful so back to
Bitcoin with voting processing working
on new blocks it's all parallel
programming on a best effort basis so
even when some nodes either get corrupt
like either mistakenly or purposefully
send wrong data get wrong data get no
data it really doesn't matter the
network itself is based on graceful
degradation and it's still going to
operate correctly and securely and this
is why best effort is used and it's
there's really a whole slew of reasons
why it's used so that's going to
conclude the network section of the
paper the next section we're going to
cover is incentives so stay tuned for
that if you guys are confused or you've
got any questions or comments or
whatever feel free to leave those below
as always thanks for watching things for
