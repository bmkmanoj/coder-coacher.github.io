what's up guys welcome to another stock
indicators and mathematics with in
python tutorial video last video we were
calculating the center of gravity now
it's actually plotted up on that chart
if you don't have the data for the chart
the link is in the description that will
take you to this page here if you scroll
down this is where the code is so
literally just highlight it all come all
the way down the bottom do a nice copy
and paste it right in now I did make a
little spot for us to put all the code
which will be right here so all you have
to really do at this point is go back to
where we were coding the script just now
and go ahead and comment out or
delete that one right there and then all
you want to do is just highlight
definition of congo all the way down at
the bottom even where it calls to cog to
run take that go over to the new script
paste it in and then fix the indentation
so we'll go back up and it should be
indent indent which is just hitting the
tab key in case you now um so now we've
done that we call cog here and all we
really need to do to put it into the
graph is the following so we're just
going to go ahead and say cog dates and
then we'll just say cogs equals that
then all we really need to do from here
is x two dot plot and we plot cog dates
and then minus SP that's just the
starting point if you want to know more
about that watch the actual charting
tutorial series you can find that in my
channel cogs minus SP colon and then
finally we're going to make that line
white so that should be it we should be
able to run that now and get the center
of gravity so let's plot ebay and just
see that we got it okay so sure enough
here's ebay with the center gravity i'm
trying to think of another stock that we
could do i just love how like well it
called it there i mean there was not too
much here it's been high i suppose now
it's slumping down
but I think about Goodwin to run here
straight forward we haven't actually
looked at Ford in any of the videos for
did pretty good too in the center here
as far as predicting that uptrend pretty
nose anyway so that's going to conclude
the center of gravity tutorial series
hopefully you guys enjoyed hopefully you
learn something as always thanks for
watching thanks for the support and
subscriptions and until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
