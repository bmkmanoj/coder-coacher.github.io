sequel and Python tutorial video where
we left off we actually made the
database now let's go ahead and make a
table give the parameters of that table
and then even maybe insert some data
into that table so first thing that we
want to go ahead and do is let's let's
let's do show databases to get a good
idea where we are again so as you can
see we've got that default and then
we've got tutorial we want to go into
tutorials so we're going to say you use
and then whatever your username is
mine's beginner account dolla sign and
then the table name mine was tutorial so
now it's going to say database change so
now you're in that database now you
could use describe and see what it is
but it's going to be empty for now so
now what we want to do is create a table
in that database so to create a table
you're going to go create table then
give the table name - we need a towel
look and cookies for whoever figures it
out now the next thing is you want to
give the names of the columns and then
the data types of those columns so we're
going to say the first column is going
to be time so we're going to come
through a unix time in here now a lot of
people what they're going to do is make
the first column and auto incrementing
or self incrementing key and that's
going to be their primary key for me
look I mean I use time series data for
everything so I just use the time in
UNIX form as the first column and that's
my own little auto incrementing key if
you want to be official and you know use
everyone's protip you can't make an auto
incrementing key if you want i'm just
notifying you that that's i'm making the
conscious decision not to so time time
is going to be an int and then we're
going to allow it to be 13 long just
simply because it normally it's like I
think 11 something characters but we're
going to throw it like some random
numbers in there so the next thing that
we're going to do is once we have to
find a time we're going to go ahead and
say the next column is a username column
in the username column we're going to
make
a bar car and that's just going to be a
variable character so if you just made
it like car it would require that the
data in that column would always be
twenty long whereas if you make it far
card doesn't have to be twenty long it
can be five long and it won't like force
it to still be twenty so we'll use bar
car there and then the next column we're
going to make it a tweet and then we're
going to do the same thing bar car and
with a max of course 140 so that's how
you create the table so let's go ahead
and throw it a little semicolon here all
you poor Python programmers man you have
a hard time with sequel anyway query
okay zeros affected of course new rows
were actually affected so now we're done
so now just as an aside other data types
you can have a date text blob set enum
and also float and they're pretty much
all the same as far as their datatype
floats the only funky one where the
first digit or the first number
represents like how many digits there
are and the second one represents how
many decimal points but anyway
maybe we'll talk about that later but
for now I'll keep it basic so now we can
do once we've done that is well we've
got the table made so the first thing
you can do is a command called show
tables so we can see table is indeed
there and then we can also describe
table and figure out like what this
table is all about so there's this
little description of the table all the
fields the type null if their primary
key or not default extra if they have
auto incrementing etc so that's that now
our goal is eventually to do all of
these SQL queries within Python all that
but there's going to be some times where
one you want to know how to do it by
hand also every query that you write
within Python is going to be an SQL
query so it's going to be the same stuff
for right now or right now the only
difference is if you want to say you
want to write a variable there will be a
little subtle change but nothing nothing
too difficult to make the shift for Plus
whenever you do especially like deletes
sometimes I prefer to do a delete by
hand especially if it's like a tricky
one so it's you just want to know this
stuff so anyway
not wasting your time insert into and
that's going to put data and do a table
and now you need to say what table so
when I say tell look from my table
whatever you called yours you can call
it whatever values and then in here
we're going to insert the values in the
order of column now again later this
will change whenever we insert instead
of you know hard-coded values variables
but for now we'll just write it out so
we're going to put data in here like
this now in here this is an int so there
are going to be no quotations around
what we say so we're going to say 1 3 8
5 4 1 9 9 6 9 as a unix time stand
that's that next is our username and our
username here is just going to be sent
dex and then we're going to say a tweet
and this will be welcome to my tutorial
and as always don't forget your
semicolon because you will query ok one
row affected whole set so now what we
can do is it let's insert a couple more
things so i'm just going to to make it
easy
hit this will change it will say this
occurs one second later so the end will
be 70 will still use the name Centex and
the tweet will change up the tweet this
tweet will be a these are all real
tweets by the way wow thanks at Obama
you are right these tutorials Rock his
words not mine so that's another one and
then finally let's do one more tweet
just to give us some data to work with
so one more second later I got this
tweet from another guy you guys might
know one and this one is at Bill Gates
thanks Bill
I know him on a first name basis I
respect in this all capitalized name
thanks Bill for the job offer as VP
but I wanna keep ops open so that's my
sweet back to him he offered me a vice
president job anyway done query done so
now we're done so now if we want to see
our data we can run a select command
here we'll just say select asterisk /
select all from and then we want to
select that from table and now we can
see that the contents of our database so
the first one was welcome next one was
me chit-chatting with Obama and just
saying he's right in his thoughts and
the next final line was me turned down
Bill Gates job offer so um those are
just the basics of creating the database
or creating the table rather and then
inserting some data into that table now
in the next video I'm going to be
talking about how to make some updates
to this table and not any more inserting
but updating the leading and retrieving
data so anyway stay tuned for that video
as always thanks for watching thanks for
the support and subscriptions and until
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
