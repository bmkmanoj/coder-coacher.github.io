yet another Python 3 basics tutorial
video in this video what we're talking
about is how to get data from CSV so how
do we read data from a CSV in Python so
let's go ahead and get started so a CSV
files usually it's kind of a popular
file type to be dealing with any sort of
data analysis and stuff as you get into
bigger data data sets generally it's
going to be more of maybe a database
format but cns peas are very popular and
it's a pretty common question how do we
work with CSV files so let's go ahead
get started so first of all there is a
CSV module built into Python so we just
want to import that so import CSV
lowercase and just for the record CSV
stands for comma separated variables
that's it and actually even though it
says CSV and that means comma separator
bills we can actually use anything we
can have a delay in the comma is what's
known as a delimiter and we can have
anything as a delimiter we could have
triple spaces tabs newline the letter X
anything can be a delimiter basically so
moving right along let us I have an
example file here let me move this over
so this is the directory that we're
coding in right now this is the script
that I'm editing and here is an example
CSV file so let me edit that with
notepad cancel and here we have some
sample data right so we have some dates
here a couple numbers that just mean
nothing and then some colors okay
so we got that in this file and what we
want to do is we want to load that data
into our Python script so the way that
we're going to do that is we're going to
use with open we haven't really talked
much about this with statement but we
will get there for now we'll just just
coat it with me and whenever you're
opening files like this you can do this
to kind of iterate through a file anyway
with open
and then we're going to example that CSV
as CSV file what do we want to do well
we're going to say wreath will cost read
CSV equals CS VDOT reader CSV file and
then we're going to specify the
delimiter I wasn't supposed to run as
just commas okay so basically what this
is going to do is it reads all this CSV
data in so me just let's let's print out
where we are at the moment so Rees USB
we'll save and run that come over here
well actually that's not going to work
here's what we'll do instead so for row
and read CSV let's just print row see
that instead there we go I may not need
to be printing this anymore I'm just
going to delete this anyway and your
output looks like this okay so so that
is the data from our sample CSV file
first bit of data was the date then a
number then another number than a color
generally when you're reading in data
it's going to read everything in as a
string so if you ever want it so keep
that in mind if you're going to be doing
math operations or something like that
on this data that you will want to
convert it to float into whatever so
let's close out of this and so for row
and read CSV print row now maybe what we
want to do is maybe access some of that
specific data so we can say print you
know row 0 that would be your date we
could also print and spell row write
print row 0 row one stuff like that
save and run it and you see that we
print you know just the date this date
and the first element and so on well the
index of one
now Oh generally what you don't want to
do when you read this yes be in the
memory you might be wanting to do
something with that CSV and you might
even want to store each column let's say
in something so instead let us do the
following up here say we just were
carrying mostly about dates and colours
for now let's just say dates equals an
empty Python lists and colors equals an
empty Python list and then for row and
read CSV we're going to do something
we're going to say the color equals row
and that was the fourth element so index
would that be three and then date is the
first element
so what index value would that be zero
now so we got date and color now we want
to do dates of pens so we're going to
add to this list date and then colors
dot append this color dog under means
going crazy so now that we don't that
after we iterate through all of this we
can do the following and print dates
print colors
save and run it and we come over here
and now we have two separate lists one
list is all the dates one lists all the
colors and each index corresponds to
that you know the corresponding lists
values right so this is kind of why I
was saying well dictionaries can be more
useful because you could store the date
as the key of the dictionary and then
these values as the value of the
dictionary but we'll get there in a
little bit and you can do all that with
reading files I just don't want to jump
into dictionaries and reading CSV is all
at once but we'll we'll talk about that
later so now that you've done that let's
say we're not using a dictionary and we
want to know maybe one might ask a
question so let's let's do this let's
say what color and what color is going
to be equal to input and then what color
do
you wish to know the date of okay so
this is going to ask our user using raw
input that we kind of believe talked
about raw input on one of the earlier
videos it's going to ask our user what
color do we want to know the date of and
then we're going to say hold X for color
index just a meshing of words hold X C
equals colors dot index what color so
the user is going to type in a color and
then we're going to say called X is the
list colors dot index of that color
whatever color we've typed in and that's
in this list that we've populated now
with called X that gives us the index
number of that color and then what we
can do is we can say the date of that
color equals dates hold X and that will
return to the date what date that index
of that color whatever we typed in is
okay now we can print the day of what
color is the date okay so we can run
this even though we're going to know the
answer so greens are correspond to 1 3
2014 so we could type green whoops let's
try that one last time and we're going
to talk about what just happened in a
second but green and it says the date of
green is 1 3 2014 now just as an aside
whatever you have input like this or
maybe you're trying I'm trying to think
of some other circumstances beside you
know input or say you're like parsing
data or something like again with
sentiment analysis no great whether it's
at the beginning of a sentence or in the
middle of a sentence still kind of
carries the same I guess greats a bad
one because great could be a pronoun but
anyway moving on uh I think of a better
word but a descriptive word let's say
you know at the beginning of a sentence
whether it's capitalized
doesn't really necessarily matter unless
it's all caps or something but say like
with green green is green is green okay
it's whether the first letter is
capitalized or not it does not matter so
what you could do is what color equals
you know this week as a cold X what
color and then dot lower what this is
going to do is just going to make sure
every letter is lowercase so we can run
this one more time and we can do green
and it still works okay the date of
grain is 1 3 4 ok or 2014 so that's how
we can do handle something like that but
we'll get to that that problem what we
can do to handle these sort of errors I
think in the next video so anyway I
think that's going to conclude this
video as far as reading CSVs because now
we're going to jump into error handling
in the next video so if you guys have
any questions or comments on reading
from a CSV storing it into some lists
feel free to leave those questions or
comments below as always thanks for
watching thanks for all the support
subscriptions and until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
