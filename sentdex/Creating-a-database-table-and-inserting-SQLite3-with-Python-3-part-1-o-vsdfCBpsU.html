another Python 3 basics tutorial as well
as the beginning of a miniseries for
SQLite SQLite is part of your standard
library with Python 3 so if you have
Python 3 you already have it so what is
SQLite SQLite is a lite version of SQL a
full version of SQL would be something
like MySQL or my sequel so SQLite as the
name suggests it's a lighter version so
unlike a full version like my sequel
SQLite you basically you can create and
use a server or a database rather
without a server so like a full version
of like my sequel for example is going
to require you to set up a my sequel
server the client you're going to have
to set up users and passwords and
permissions and all of these things
whereas with SQLite there are no users
there's no permissions there's no actual
even server or anything like that it
actually ends up going into a basic file
a single file so the next question
people ask is well why do we use SQLite
over a flat file for example it's
difference well SQL or an SQLite is
going to file that you're going to
create first of all it's not like a
flick to load in a flat file let's say
if you want to start referencing data
points and a typical file you have to
load that entire file into memory
you could buffer through the file but if
you want to be able to query against
like say you want to find all data
points with a value of X you're still
gonna have to look through the entire
file so you're going to pull all that
file into memory whereas if you use
something like SQLite you won't have to
do that you're going to pull into memory
the bits that you need so it's it's
going to be useful that way also
SQLite your entire database will be a
single file and a lot of people at least
initially are a little confused about
what a database actually is a database
contains tables tables contain the data
most people think of a database as what
actually a table is so a database
contains a bunch of tables your tables
containing the data so with SQLite you
have an entire database that's contained
within a single file whereas if you were
just using flat files you would really
probably be you would have a file per
table basically so anyways
some of the other things SQLite is
better at is input-output for the same
reasons that it's better for like
efficiency when you're inputting and
outputting like for example to input
some data to a file you would have to
rewrite that entire file that's a long
operation also it's a little more taxing
on your actual hard drive itself whereas
with SQLite you just you're importing
that little file part instead of the
entire file all over again so it just
makes sense anyways there you go so if
anybody argues with you why SQLite is
the same as a flat file you now know
what to say so with that let's go ahead
and get started first of all to use
SQLite you're going to import SQLite
three that's just the current version we
are using right now
then what you'll do and this is true
with basically all forms of SQL is going
to you're going to define your
connection and your cursor all
throughout this tutorial and as we
continue you'll see that the cursor is
very much like the cursor you're
like--you're your computer cursor the
cursor does things okay now so what
we're going to do is we're going to find
the connection so co NN is going to be
equal to SQLite three connects and then
we're going to connect to some sort of
database we're going to connect a
tutorial DB this doesn't exist right now
and that's fine if SQLite attempts a
connection to a database that doesn't
exist it creates the database so simple
enough then we're going to define C that
is your cursor and that's just con dot
cursor so now that you have those we're
ready we can connect to a database but
we don't have a table so a database
again just contains a bunch of tables so
first we need to create a table and when
we do that you're going to see your
first SQL query basically so we're going
to say define create table and in here
we're going to see dot execute so that's
C for the cursor the cursor does all the
executions of things and we're going to
say C dot execute and what we're going
to execute is the following statement
it's going to be create
great create table if not exists and
then you're going to give the table and
name so it's basically whatever you want
to call it so you can call it what I
call it or you can call it whatever you
want so I'm going to call it stuff to
plot because eventually what have I done
eventually we're going to plot so so
stuff to plot and then in here you put
in your columns and the datatypes of
those columns so for example this first
column we're gonna call unix this will
be a UNIX timestamp and that's a real
number so a real is like a Python float
so that's a real they're gonna have
another column that's gonna be a date
stamp
that's text that's the datatype then
we're going to have a keyword and that
will also be a text and then finally
we're gonna have a value
that'll be a real number so that is our
entire SQL statement that just creates
the table for us if you'll notice that
there are some upper cases from some
upper case words and then there are some
like lower case stuff generally
standards wise what you do is use all
caps for things that are pure SQL and
then you use regular casing for things
that are not SQL commands and stuff like
that so this is part of the SQL it's a
SQL command create table if not exists
you could you would be able to do this
without capitalizing everything you
simply capitalize it to make it easier
for you to read later on so because you
don't have to capitalize it what should
that tell you that should tell you that
SQL is completely blind to casing so if
casing is important in your database you
have to handle that with whatever
programming logic you're using because
SQL is not going to care about casing so
later on I'll show you guys how you can
input some logic into the stuff that you
pull from your database and you'll see
that you know with casing that's not
really gonna you're not gonna be able to
use that there you're going to define
that that logic outside of the SQL
anyway moving on that creates the table
now we'll run that at the very end we're
now going to cover how you can actually
input data into a database
so we're going to define data entry and
here it's going to be C dot execute and
again all caps here insert into and then
stuff to plot is the name of our table
and then these are values and then in
the parentheses is where you input the
values and you would just input the
values in the exact order that you have
of columns right
so the unix time the date stamp the
keyword and the value so in our case
what we're going to do is you can pretty
much make up whatever you want
I don't depend what time it is right now
but for example you could put in we'll
just say for a timestamp 1 4 or 5 it
doesn't matter you can put whatever you
want here it's actually not that
important so in fact we'll just do this
I'll just make it up and then you'll put
a date like you would put you would put
a date stamp and in fact what we need to
do it let's put a double quote around
this if you need to you could put a
triple quote as well if you wanted to
have something that included quotes
anyway so that's your real number and
then you would have a date stamp will
just say 2016 a 1 a 1 and then we had a
keyword we'll just call it Python and
then we had a value and we'll call that
a 5 then so that's inserting stuff in a
stuff to plot now again it's just easy
if you kind of think of this as like a
mouse cursor and then you're like
writing some stuff when you write to a
file what do you have to do like if like
say you type some stuff into a text like
a notepad or something like that what do
you have to do you have to save it and
then you can close out so to say if you
do conduct commit so anytime you modify
anything in your database you need to
run a con document that's true with
SQLite that's true with my sequel and so
on when you're completely done you run a
C dot close that close the cursor and it
conduct close now that's not essential
to change your database it's just
essential to close that connection stop
memory from being used and all that
so now we'll come on down here and
finally we can run
create underscore table and then we'll
run data entry and we'll run that okay
so it's already run it should be pretty
quick operation and then what I'll do is
we can pull over we're working here and
you see now we've got tutorial DB now
you may not have icon like that and you
probably can't even open it if you did
it would look like a bunch of goop but
you can go to this link there will be a
link to this specific tutorial in the
description go to there and you can find
github otherwise you can just Google for
SQLite browser and then you can scroll
on down to here and download the
appropriate version for your operating
system and then you should be able to
open this file you may have to associate
the program with that file but you can
open that file now we can come over
here's database structure and stuff like
that we can just go to browse data and
sure enough this is our table we can see
these are the columns and we even have a
data entry here so then what we could do
is we could we could say now - let's
just change this and change the value to
an eight and we can rerun this create
table statement because we're using
Create table if not exists if you just
have a create table statement you would
not want to rerun create table that's
going to air for you but because it's
there it doesn't really matter we can
rerun it it should be fine so we'll
rerun it real quick and that's totally
fine but normally you would just want to
run that once otherwise you're just
wasting your time anyways and then once
you're done there looks like I've lost
the there we go
open this up oh it's down here noob
anyway there's our new new data points
okay so that's just a really basic intro
to SQLite in the next tutorial we're
going to be doing is talking about how
you can input variables because so far
we've input like we've just written into
the string manually well if you're going
to be immediately entering stuff what's
the point of a database in programming
in general so in the next tutorial we'll
be talking about is how to dynamically
start inserting things like variables
and all that so if you have any
questions or comments feel free to leave
them below otherwise state
you the nice tutorial thanks for
