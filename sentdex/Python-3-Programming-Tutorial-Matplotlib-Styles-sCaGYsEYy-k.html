Matt plot live in Python 3 video and our
little miniseries here this video what I
want to be talking about is styles and
matplotlib so matplotlib has this
functionality for styles and I was under
the impression that it was contained in
one of the newer downloads of matplotlib
however I could not find it the last
time I downloaded Matt plot live but I
was able to find a third-party example
and so I use I've been using that and so
I thought when I did these videos hey I
get to use a new version of Matt plot
libs and some on a new version of Python
and I thought I could just download the
three you know version and find Styles
but I could not find it there so someone
happens to know where they're hiding
styles in the original matplotlib
download let me know but anyway moving
on I'm going to show you guys my version
of styles and so let's get started so
we've got matplotlib here we're plotting
this chart and just for example got this
epic chart you know it looks cool we've
charted stuff but it's pretty born chart
so we can close out of that and the next
thing we want to do is we want to add
styles and if you're familiar with like
CSS like HTML and CSS you know you have
things called style sheets now what
these do is you can specify a bunch of
parameters to your style sheet and then
when you add new pages like new content
and stuff they just you don't have to
code in how you want it to look it just
automatically does it because you've
made this style sheet and that's
basically how matplotlib Styles work
I'm guessing they got their name from it
and so it's the same thing and then what
you can do even further though is you
can specify mini style sheets so you can
say that this is the styles that I want
to use for line charts this is a style I
want to use for pie charts this is a
style for histograms and bar charts all
this stuff so anyway let's go ahead and
get started so come over here and we're
going to have to first grab styles and
so I've uploaded my version of styles to
Python programming at net and then you
want to go
downloads and then slash Styles dot zip
or so I thought oh sorry it's actually
style dot zip your stop is it there we
go
and we get our style dot zip download
once you have that you're gonna want to
go back go to your downloads so here
downloads and where did I stick stuff
there it is and then we'll go ahead and
extract all the style here and then we
get this and if you click on style you
come right into here ok so just and then
you come style live and then here are
styles but no need to worry about that
well we're curious about its style right
here the style folder so then what you
want to do go to my computer computer or
whatever C Python 34 or whatever python
version you happen to be using Lib site
packages matplotlib and here's where you
want to stuff the style folder so let's
move this over here this one and then we
take style from here just click and drag
it into here and now we have style
mm-hmm so let's minimize this minimize
and we'll come over here and now the
only thing that we need to do from this
point is first we have to import style
so from net plot live import style and
just for the record um importing style
is importing literally what we just
moved in so matplotlib styles I mean you
know from metal olefin ports style if
you remember the tutorial on what
imports are and all that
that's literally importing this this
file right here and then it takes all of
this and then initiation or the
initialize basically is what we're about
to do from core import use contacts
below you'll see that we're about to use
that right now so from a pot lid import
style then here we go style dot use and
then we specify the style that we want
to use so if we come back over to our
distribution here of style click on
style lib we've got GG block plot
grayscale and dark
background all of these I did not create
these are pre created by somebody else
ggplot is one that I've just kind of
edited a little bit I didn't really like
the original one so I kind of edited it
and got what I wanted but to use it all
you skip MPL style and you just say we
want to use ggplot okay so now we can
save and run this and now we get a chart
that's kind of changed right so the
background isn't this ugly gray
nastiness we've got nice grid lines but
they're not like in-your-face black grid
lines a red line but you can see here
that actually we let's let's do let's
just copy this right here and paste and
then let's change up our Y a little bit
six to six and we'll call this x2 y2 and
then we'll plot some more soap alt dot
plot x2 y2
we'll save and run that and we see that
there's another color and these colors
are just more I don't know good looking
and the the natural colors that we get
so for example we can go back to what we
were using when is comment out style
that use save and run that and here we
are back to the original so it's just
got it just doesn't look that good and
so anyway we can start solids ggplot but
then there's also these other ones like
dark underscore background so we can go
dark background and you can see how easy
it is to customize your plots very
quickly so this is a dark background so
changes all the data to like lighter
colors and the background to black so we
can change get out of that and then
finally we have grayscale and this
basically it just plots in you know
grayscale it's very true to its name
grayscale right so we can save and run
that and we get this chart that's just
pure grayscale it actually looks pretty
good if you have a pretty complex chart
the grayscale charts can look pretty
decent right now it's pretty boring but
anyway so that's that with styles now I
do just want to show a couple of things
for example like if we let's say we
comment out style dot use
initially I'll probably uploading this
code so on and take out great greyscale
it's ugly
Oh so look easy pot anyway I'll comment
this out and I'm going to show you guys
how you would actually color this stuff
on your own so here we've got X so let's
run it real quick just to see where we
are so we have this now so the default
plot close this close this and we don't
even printing length anymore so now plot
X Y X to it y2 now when you plot stuff
here's how you can change the color
yourself you can actually go we could
say the first line we want this line to
be blue actually I think the default is
blue so we'll call it green oh thank you
dog for barking anyway we'll call that
green then we're going to say line width
equals 5 and this is going to change how
thick the line is so we can save and run
that and as you can see we've made the
first line this green color the second
one came out blue because we didn't
specify it so that's like the first
default color that's going to come out
but what we've done here is we've got
green and as you can see a significantly
thicker than the other line and then we
can come down here and when you do
something special for this one too so
well instead of blue we'll call it C for
cyan and then we'll say line width
equals 10 this will be fun you can run
it and then here we get epic info and we
get you know these lines here um so
that's just some quick simple things as
far as you know changing some stuff now
again there are just an incredible
amount of changes that you can make and
in fact let's pull up ggplot real quick
and see all of the changes that ggplot
makes for us whoops that was it right
here as we come over here and
immediately okay line width changed for
us a face color which is the background
of background of things basically face
color edge colors changed I don't even
know what oh it's anti-aliasing I don't
know
is anyway fontsize I actually change
that the default one has a really small
font the default like whoever made
ggplot face colors are changed all of
your plots are changed just for the
record I did this I added this list it's
basically the same list copy and pasted
over and over and over it says access
color cycle in Python 27 it does not
cycle through the colors once it gets at
the end of the list it just keeps
repeating itself the last color and that
was very irritating to me because I had
a plot that contained a lot of lines and
so that was very problematic so I
changed that I assume in Python 3 that's
fixed but anyway that's why there's so
many there and then down here it just is
just commented out saying what all these
colors are X takes our change Y tics are
changed grids are changed line styles
are changed face color this is the face
colored little figures to the background
there and then the edge color is you
know point 50 I don't know what that is
if that's a alpha or what anyway um so
as you can see there's a lot of
customization here and each of the ones
like dark scales same thing it's going
to have a lot of specific customization
to it
normally these are all things you'd have
to type out to get that to change but as
you can see there's a lot of things that
you can change about your graphs but
again not going to get too deep into
that normal mining it too deep into
fancy charting or anything like that if
you want to see that you can check out
the other series I have on matplotlib so
that's going to conclude this video lot
of stuff that we kind of threw at you
but really just keep in mind styles and
then you can change line with
congratulations so anyways if anybody
says any questions or comments on this
video feel free to leave them below as
