another Python 3 basics tutorial video
in this video we're going to be talking
about is multi-dimensional lists so all
the lists that we've covered so far have
been a singular dimension right there's
this for each bit of data in the list
it's only one bit of data but actually
you can have lists within lists within
lists within lists if you want you can
go as deep as you want you can get very
convoluted fast so anyway what we're
going to be showing today is a
two-dimensional list and then you could
take it from there if you so chose so
with that let's go ahead and get started
so let's say we have a list and right
now like a typical list don't figure
square brackets let's just say we have a
that can't get away from these massive
numbers this is our list for now ok and
in fact let's make that short otherwise
I'm gonna cry so we have this list right
now so we've got a 5 a 6 a 6 and a 2
let's just make this a 7 so what we can
do now this is a 1 dimensional list well
what we can do is we can make it a 2
dimensional list so each element in this
list is just actually another list so 5
and 6 and then we have a 6 and seven and
then a seven and two and then a 2 and a
5 anybody see what I did there
right on anyway continuing on so now we
have a two dimensional list so for one
we can just print X save and run that
apparently this is a really challenging
there we go okay so here's our list now
let's say we want to print the first of
element here it's a 6 and a 7 now what
if we wanted to go even deeper well we
can go deeper using the same sort of
syntax so we can say we want the first
element or the 0 with element which will
be hopefully a 6 right we have 6 7 the
first of that is a 6
save and run it and we get a 6 so that's
how we can reference that now we could
go even further right so this is a 2
dimensional list we could take this even
further and say like these numbers here
this could be a list as well and then we
could have
another list here then another list
let me show I've done this right this
kid's messy very fast and which is what
I'm about to talk about here six six and
then seven a believe it like that for
now we don't actually have to go further
let me make sure that's a valid list
okay so um so let's print it now you can
see this is you know two elements so
let's say you know you want to go even
further well obviously we still can go
further so the 0th zeroeth again a six
now as you can see in just typing this
out was a kind of a pain also just
visually looking at it it's kind of a
pain to look at this so what you can do
when you make big lists like this is see
like with python we don't have to have
very nice standards necessarily all the
time it kind of python like forces us
into having standards so as a programmer
you maybe forget the fact that you might
need to program your own standards again
what I mean by standards is the
organization of all the text here so but
what you can do with lists tuples oh
really a whole bunch of stuff but mostly
you're going to do with lists is you can
do the following you hit enter and now
this is the you know pointing to the
screen you can see that so like this is
our opening bracket and then we might as
well put our closing bracket right down
there as well and then this is our
second bracket here and if you ever want
to know um you know what each bracket
corresponds to you can kind of even do
this oops you can delete and add it and
you can see how it highlights everything
that's kind of how you know like what
that bracket corresponds to so if you're
used to like I say code in like notepad
plus plus sometimes it does it
automatically for you if you like
highlight the little bracket especially
at curly braces so you're programming on
PHP or something you highlight I mean it
kind of corresponds so if you ever want
to know like what bracket that is or if
you've actually closed everything you
could just do that so anyway then we can
see you know these are their own little
pair and this is a group here and then
you can either put the commas at the
bottom or
I like to leave them at the end like
this I'm pointing the screen again
Yuki's like this at the end here because
you can go like this and then everything
is nice and organized and do it one more
time this didn't have any list within
the list so it's not as pretty and
organized but you get the idea so we can
still run this though and Python you
know still deals with it and handles it
just like you would hope and then here
let me show you that run it same thing
so you can add spaces and it's okay so
if you you know if you're kind of OCD
about making everything look pretty you
can get away with it so anyway that's
just some example of multi-dimensional
lists again you can go as deep into this
as you want and it just helps to
organize kind just keep pointing at the
screen need to like a camera behind me
so you guys can see what I'm pointing it
you can organize it like this and
obviously as you get more and more
dimensions it's going to get almost
impossible right because your screen is
still only two dimensions so as soon as
you get past a two dimensional list
you're kind of screwed again but anyway
it does help to kind of organize it a
little bit so that's going to conclude
