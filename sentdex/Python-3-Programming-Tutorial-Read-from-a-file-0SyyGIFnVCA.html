another Python 3 basics tutorial video
in this video we're going to be
discussing how to read from a file so
this syntax is pretty simple again we
have readme and we're going to open what
are we going to open well let's go ahead
and open our example file texts what how
why do we what do we want to do with it
what are our intentions and that's going
to be our for read and then we can go
ahead and actually do dot read and that
will actually read the file into that
variable and then we can do print read
me so we can save and run that and you
can see that our output is indeed that
information now a lot of times people
want to read into memory maybe an excel
sheet something with line by line so
there's another way that you can do this
and that's going to be dot instead of
read you can do dot read lines so
instead what's going to happen is
instead of writing all that as one bit
of information to a variable it's
actually going to save this into a
Python list stored under readme so now
when we print readme we can see that
actually now we have a sample text to
save with new line new line new line and
then new a bit of information and that's
the end of it ok so now you can see that
it was it's created a Python list so
those are some of the basics to reading
a file if you are reading an excel sheet
there are better ways to do it you can
do read lines there's a few other things
that you can do especially if you want
to get rid of the newline but for now
these are just the absolute basics so
hopefully that was helpful for you some
of you guys if you do have any questions
feel free to leave them below as always
thanks for watching thanks for all the
support and subscriptions until next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
