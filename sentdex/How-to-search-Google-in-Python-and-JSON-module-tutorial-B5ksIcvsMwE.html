Python tutorial this tutorial is going
to be a twofer so you're going to get
not only how to search Google the
quote-unquote easy way but also coverage
of the JSON functionality within Python
so we've really only dealt with JSON
data structure one other time and that
was with the Twitter feed and we just
use simple splitting functions to do it
but there is this fancy dancy json
modules that we can use so we're going
to do that in this video as well so to
start will just show you guys an example
here of the the API that Google offers
for searching so head over to your
favorite internet browser which I assume
is Chrome otherwise I don't know what
you're doing in my channel and cop well
I'll put the link in there this link in
the description so copy and paste that
in there and you can put literally
anything you want you can put Python
tutorials and it's going to return you a
JSON output of data for the for python
tutorials as the search query now your
browser does this encoding automatically
for you it depends really on whose api
you're using sometimes it it doesn't
work and then other times you can just
put anything in there and it just
automatically encodes it I'm going to
show you guys how to encode that data
but with this you don't have to I have
no idea I would think that that is
something like I'm not sure how as a web
developer you could not have to have the
people using URL encoding so I don't
know I don't know enough about that
stuff but anyways what I do know is the
safest bet is to always use URL encoding
then you won't have to worry about it so
with that to do URL encoding you're
gonna need import URL Lib not URL Lib to
URL Lib along that note if anybody knows
how to do URL encoding with URL Lib to
let me know I have no
I've tried to look for it and they're
like just seems to be no way to do it so
I always if I use them both I import URL
Lib and URL Lib too so if anybody knows
if any a fine gentleman or lady happens
to know please leave a comment below and
let me know I am genuinely curious next
we need the JSON module as well so we're
an import JSON and now let's go ahead
and get started so with this we can do
example search so we're going to search
for something I'm going to say
geographic Semyon analysis and then I'm
going to say encoded equals URL Lib
quote example search so if you don't
know what that's gonna do basically adds
% 24 every space and then if you have
like special characters it will also
change them so let's just print encode
it just so you guys can see when I'm
give the app in a boot so that's the URL
or at least that part encoded right just
added this percent 20s but at the same
time if you did something like like this
right and we print out the URL encoding
it fixes it right so in as you can see
even in this URL right the URL has a
question mark and an ampersand to denote
variables right and it's going to get
those variables and use them so if you
have those things in your URL um you you
obviously need to encode them first
before you do it so just keep that in
mind so while I said that actually at
least with this API you don't have to
encode you could just slap this right in
there but if this was like you know how
do I do this or something like that and
you didn't use URL encoding you're gonna
find yourself in trouble so anyways
that's my my teaching for today video
over No
so now what we want to do is we don't
need to print encode it anymore now
we're going to say raw data so let's be
like that
output is going to equal URL URL live
dot URL open and we want to open up this
link here so I'm going to copy and paste
it and it's going to say query equals
I'm not sure why this equal sign is
there so I'm going to delete that query
is going to equal encode it right so
we'll come over here query equals and
then we do a plus and encoded and then
at the end of this we want to do a read
so I'd actually read so the raw data is
straight up just like the nasty text
that you'll get from there so now we
want to use the JSON functionality so
now we're going to say JSON data equals
JSON des lowes and we're gonna do raw
data so we're loading the raw data now
the way the JSON module is going to work
is like an array or a list rather I
shouldn't say it right I always call
them arrays I'm sorry guys now so this
is a list and it's a it's a
multi-dimensional list at the first
dimension you have basically like this
this right here but it's actually this
whole thing and then you would say
within there the response data dimension
contains all of whose basically all of
I'm trying to find where the end of it
would be like right here I small here
so that's response data then inside that
you've got another list that's more
easily recognizable with this bracket
and you've got another dimension so it's
a multi-dimensional list right so you
treat it just like that even though it
doesn't look like it to your eyeballs
that's what the JSON module is doing for
you so for example we would say the
actual results so let's say search
results equals JSON data and put and
what element in JSON data are we looking
for well we're looking for the element
that calls itself response data so
literally the camel cased response data
so I just copied that right
and I want taste so that is that first
element and now of that element what
element of response data are the search
results within well they're within
results right so now we take just like
you would with an array you add some
more brackets or a list sorry any add
results in there so now you have of the
response data list we want the results
information basically so now you can see
in here you've got all kinds of data
here as far as you know you've got you
on escaped URL then you've got the
straight up like URL and then you have
well I can't find it but okay title and
then what the title is in this case here
right and so really most of what we're
going to be looking for we're not going
to pull out like if you wanted to get
like the Meta Description right that's
usually what's underneath the link if
you wanted to pull that you could but
for now we just maybe want to pull the
actual title and then let's actually
pull the URL that we would visit if we
wanted to visit it so to do that once
we've pulled so those are the search
results right then what we would say is
for each result let's say er in search
results what do we want to do well the
title is er and then for that you know
so it's like each little result in our
search results of results right so each
little block of results right that's
within there what do we want and that's
going to be so each block what do we
care about in that block so of that list
that's that block of results we want a
title
and that will give us the title and then
link is going to be ER and it was URL so
obviously title and then I just sufferer
gonna see it'll just type in URL wow
there's a lot of URL but anyway there's
URL and so on so so that's that so now
we've got title in link so now let's
just go ahead and print title print link
and then we'll just do some pre one two
three three lines one two three and
we're all set
so what it's going to do is it's going
to visit and search for graphical
sentiment analysis it's going to use the
JSON - or the JSON functionality to read
the JSON go into that response data list
go into the results list and then inside
that results list pronounce all the
titles and URLs in order so now let's
save that and let's run that see if we
had any typos and we didn't so as you
can see geographical sentiment analysis
by Centex who'd a thunk that was coming
anyway so you can see the results now
here's the downside it only returns to
you for results and that is why my
friends we have a search in Google the
easy way and we have a search in Google
the hard way because for some people for
results is not enough so stay tuned for
a search in Google the hard way tutorial
otherwise if this fills all of your
needs then congratulations so hopefully
you guys enjoyed hopefully you guys
learn something new and taught you a
couple new things hopefully here besides
possibly the JSON module I suppose and
again if anybody happens to know how to
encode URLs with URL Lib to do be kind
enough to let me know as always thanks
for watching thanks for all the support
and subscriptions and until the next
