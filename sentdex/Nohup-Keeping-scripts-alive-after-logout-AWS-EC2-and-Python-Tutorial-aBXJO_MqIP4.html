orgeous VPS tutorial video series where
we left off I've shown you guys how you
can run programs or multiple programs in
your your either your AWS through VPS
server but I ended with the caveat that
if you log out of your user account or
you close out of your terminal or you
lose an internet connection or something
what's going to happen is going to hang
up that script and everything is going
to you know stop so the next thing that
you need you can do to conquer that is
use the command know hook which
literally stands for no hang up so the
way that you can do something like that
is you could say for example NoHo Python
running one dot pi and then you can put
you know the ampersand on there and now
what that's going to do is it's going to
run you're running one Pi in the
background and as it does it it's going
to put the output any output that it has
it'll put yeah it says right here no
hope ignoring all the input and
appending output to no hope that out so
it's also going to ignore any input I
give here so now
well that's running in the background I
can do anything else I wanna go into
Python print I just can't do that but I
can do this right and so now I can do
other things while this is running in
the background now if we LS here
oops sorry we got to get out of a thon
so it's controlled the LS here we and
see now we have got this file no hooked
out we can Nano into no hook dot out and
obviously there's nothing there right
now Nano running one pi I can't remember
which one we're in let's see
let's try no to pie let's say no hook
tight running Twp I do that and
hopefully that will put my output you
know I already forgot what it is it's
man now no hook out yeah so it runs test
too and then we keyboard interrupted it
so now the problem here with that is
that obviously to do anything else we've
interrupted the script and it's unable
to run so what if you have maybe two
three four scripts that you want to run
how do you how would you actually do
that well the next thing that you would
do to still utilize no hope and all this
stuff would be to do something like this
so you make a new file and we're going
to call this file command out SH and in
here we're going to we're going to
specify a bunch of stuff that we want it
to do so we'll do Python running one dot
pi we'll run it in the background and
then in actually here's what we'll do
that and then python running two dot pi
we're on that one in the background
wait yes sorry about that that was
something else not this let me turn off
my speakers and so now command SH we'll
run that so the next thing that we could
do is we could then say no ho name bash
command SH and now that's going to run
using bash which is like our console
basically it's going to use our console
to run command SH which contains those
files that we've already seen and it's
going to do that all in the background
here and with the idea of no hub so if
we leave this window and actually log
out it won't it won't matter so anyway
those are just some more basics to using
no hub
and then also obviously command SH with
Bosch to control it you don't have to
call it command out SH you call whatever
and yeah so that should pretty much
cover all of the basics of at least
using the Amazon Web Services to run
scripts
that's probably all I'm going to do for
a little bit now with Amazon Web
Services probably the next thing I'll
show you guys is this Python anywhere a
real interesting service and it gives
you pretty much everything that you
could have here with AWS plus it's a
little bit easier it gives you a nice
GUI that you can use and it still gives
you you know your bash console and it
comes with Python installed and like
he's got Python to six to seven three
three pre-installed and it's got all
like I don't know probably like 200
modules pre-installed so it's got all
kinds of stuff again I'm not like an
affiliate of them I'm just going to show
you at least what I think about their
website and stuff like that and what
they've got so pretty cool stuff coming
up and hopefully you guys have enjoyed
and maybe learn something with AWS or
just even a VPS you do all the stuff
that we did here with any VPS the only
difference would be obviously that VPS
doesn't come with Python pre-installed
you would need to install Python but
that's a really easy procedure so anyway
that's going to include this video in me
series at least for a little bit I might
show some other odd stuff with AWS but
pretty much you know the reason why
you're going to use ec2 is really going
to be to do processing of some kind so
maybe I'll show you guys with like a
database or something like that and you
can like you can host like static
websites and stuff on ec2 but it's not
really the go-to place if you want to
host Nashua like website you'd want to
use another VPS or something like that
but anyways hopefully it was useful for
you some of you guys
AWS totally free for a year anyway so
might as well play around with it and
get used to the console you can't really
do anything too bad anyway if you do you
just restart and play again so pretty
cool stuff it's good learning experience
so anyways hopefully you guys enjoy it
as always thanks for watching thanks for
the support in the subscriptions and
until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
