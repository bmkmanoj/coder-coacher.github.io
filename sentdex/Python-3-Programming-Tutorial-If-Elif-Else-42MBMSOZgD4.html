my if/elif/else tutorial video for
Python 3 the idea this is to add yet
another layer of logic to our
pre-existing if and now else statement
see with our typical if-else statement
the if will be checked for sure
and the else will only run if the if
fails but what if you wanted to check
multiple if statements well you could
write them all in so you could have if
blah blah if blah blah blah if blah blah
blah though this is really somewhat
improper if you actually desire every
single if statement to be checked and
you actually want it to be all in like
one big grouping because without it if
you have multiple just multiple ifs the
else is only going to apply to the last
if statement so um so there's nothing
wrong with writing multiple ifs if
they're necessary and you want them all
to run and you don't want them to be
like tied together in one big loop
otherwise you should use the L if
statement so in the LF is again short
for else if basically so let's go ahead
and start so we're going to say x equals
5 y equals 10 oops and Z equals 22 so
what we're going to do is we're going to
grate err than one print X is greater
than Y so we know that's going to fail
but we'll throw that there anyways l if
X is less than Z print X is less than Z
so we're pretty confident that's gonna
work out for us
else we'll just say print if and L if
maybe multiple elif's never ran save run
and it turns out one of our statements
what did indeed run and that is the X is
less than Z but we can come down here
and we could a even add even more
statements like we could say L if
five is greater than let's say let's let
me think here let's see X is less than Z
so look what if we did something like
it's 5i greater than 2 :
print 5 is greater than 2 so in the
old-fashioned way of doing are like
multiple if statements this statement
would would rain true and trigger the
print egde of 5 is greater than 2 but
here let's see what happens we'll save
and run it and again we only got X is
less than Z now the reason this happened
is this is all one big loop so basically
it's asking if this is the case to do it
I'll live do this LIF do this but what
happened was this was triggered as true
and then the rest of this block that's
all tied together was broken and it and
it just left right and that's the idea
of the Elif is as soon as it finds
something that's true it's not going to
continue searching to see if it's true
so by the same token though we could do
something like this
l if equal equal equal equal and then we
could run this and then it but and in
this case it finally got to this elf's
statement and nothing ever ran so indeed
it printed out if and elif's never ran
for us so as you can see the Elif
statement kind of does indeed it just
adds one more layer of logic to your
script or your program but at least in
this case it's just a simple script but
it adds one more bit of logic to it
where you can kind of start tying these
things in into each other and using
their properties to actually start
building some pretty interesting logic
so anyways that's going to conclude the
if/elif/else I don't know I would say
pairing but it's not pairing anyways the
putting together and so hopefully you
guys learned something new hopefully you
guys are enjoying the learning Python
and all that if you have any questions
feel free to post them below otherwise
as always thanks for watching thanks for
all your support your subscriptions and
until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
