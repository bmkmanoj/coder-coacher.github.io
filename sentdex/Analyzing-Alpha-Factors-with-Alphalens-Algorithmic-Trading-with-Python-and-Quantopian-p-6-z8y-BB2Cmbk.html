part 6 of the quanto pain tutorials in
the previous tutorial we covered how to
build our pipeline data and basically
that's going to be the pipeline that
we're going to use in our trading
strategy which I mean the pipeline is
basically the crux of at least a simple
strategy where you can hopefully
calculate everything you need to or at
least as much as possible
within the pipeline and then and then
you can make trades based on that so in
our case we've computed what all the
things that we need actually because
we've got Long's and shorts and every
day we would just ask okay what are the
companies are along whatever in our
shorts make sure our portfolio consists
of that done now what we can do those
with this pipeline we can return the
data which will just be the sentiment
data and analyse alpha lens to analyze
the alpha factor which is sentiment
factor or at least what we hope to be an
alpha factor so up to this point I
really haven't talked too much about
alpha and beta at the simplest level
alpha is the is a measure of your
returns that are is basically
irrespective of the market gains so you
want alpha to be high because basically
we have to compare trading strategies to
what about just buying and holding the
like the sp500 index fund so I'm holding
the S&amp;amp;P 500 index fund has no almost no
risk
I've got market risk but but it's got
not much risk so any time you decide to
do trading you're introducing risk also
buying and holding the S&amp;amp;P 500 index
fund is also going to give you dividends
for example which training you're not
going to get those so we make the
decision to trade it's really important
that we're doing it for the right reason
so sometimes it might be to actually
hedge the market so maybe maybe your
objective isn't actually to beat the
market it's just a hedge it or decrease
volatility or something like that a lot
of reasons people actually get into the
market so anyway
alpha is something we want to be very
high we'd like it to be as high as
possible
and then beta is basically you know a
measure of your returns that are
basically attributed to the market so
you'd like beta to be neutral
you don't want negative because you're
basically doing the opposite of the of
the market and you don't want it highly
positive because then it's like your
returns are just basically a multiple to
some degree of the market returns
already so we don't want that we want
neutral beta it as close to zero as
possible
quanto peon likes to see anything
between negative point three and
positive point three alpha you just want
to be positive as positive as possible
so anyway
alpha lens is going to analyze the alpha
ness of something before we get too far
I'll just bring up I'm not sure these
are the actual latest alpha lens docs
but you can also check out I just
actually pulled up something here but
whoops I didn't want to go that far back
I just want to go to alpha lens you can
also come to the github and kind of look
through alpha lens at least at the
moment isn't actually too complex so I'm
not really certain that a lot of
documentation is even required at this
stage but you can kind of poke through
and that's kind of what I was doing I
was looking at the tearsheet which I'll
talk about momentarily so so yeah let's
let's go ahead and jump into working
with alpha lens just so we can see the
output so first of all in your when you
run a backtest what's going to happen is
you're going to take your pipeline data
which contains a bunch of tickers and
then basically if you want to make a
trade
all the back tester really has to do is
be like okay you just like to make a buy
what's the price check the price cool
we'll save that until you want to make a
sell email you make a sounds like what's
the price right now it sells whereas
with alpha lens the objective is to
compare your sentiment factor or your
factors does it had to be a sentiment
factor your factor over time over the
entire trading period compare your
factor - mark - the market returns of
all the assets you might be interested
in and it's just going to generate alpha
there so what you want to do is you want
to you want to abstract away as much as
possible the pull away your strategy you
don't really want to check alpha for
your strategy so much as you do for
signal because if the city either the
signal has alpha it doesn't but just
because you run a backtest and you make
money doesn't really mean that the
signal you were trading on actually had
any alpha you might have just got lucky
so it takes a few back tests to find out
also if you run a backtest you didn't
make money that also doesn't mean your
signal didn't have alpha it just meant
your strategy was bad so instead what
you can do is you can just test the
alpha so that's what we do with alpha
one so first what we need to do isn't
like I said in the back test it just
checks prices when you make the trade
but what we want to do is is check
prices throughout the entire period
basically of this signal which is
basically from you know the month to the
year of 2015 so what we're going to do
first is we need to know what assets we
need prices on because I don't want to
track prices on all eight thousand
companies so I say assets equals result
dot index levels one dot unique so what
the hell does that mean so result is our
pandas dataframe index is the index
which happens to be it's a dual index
right the indexes you know this this
index is the date this index is the
ticker
so we want the first if this index and
we want to know all the unique tickers
for that entire data frame and then
let's go ahead and just Len assets just
so we can see so we're dealing with five
hundred and twenty two companies that we
want to get pricing on so now we're
gonna say pricing equals get pricing red
flags bells should go off you never
imported get pricing well guess what
it's they're just some more quanto peon
magic for you assets basically what
prices on what are we interested in
we're interested in prices for all of
the assets and then we got to start date
and end date so let's just pick this
copy paste and then I'm going to say
fields equals open price all right so
here what we have is basically the exact
same dates but I'm actually going knock
down a month and I'm going to knock this
one up a month and the reason we're
doing that is so we have a little bit of
data prior to our signal and a little
bit of data after because alpha lens is
going to look a little bit prior and a
little bit after like after to continue
computing market returns and a little
bit prior because we can actually look
at what was pricing doing before the
like clinical event of our signal so we
want a little bit of data on both sides
there all right let's run that should
have been running that lot of talking it
can take a few seconds but shouldn't be
too bad so just as a quick note take
note of how long it takes for this to
run because we're getting minute pricing
data for all these companies at least I
think it's minute maybe it maybe it
might be daily I don't know anyway it's
a lot of pricing down it's going to
happen very fast so now I'm going to go
ahead and import alpha lines and then
coming down we're going to do alpha lens
dot tears not that way
tears dot create factor tear sheet now
this pricing already finished crazy okay
what is the factor that we want to like
look into that we're hoping as an alpha
factor a factor equals results and we
just want the sentiment column of
results so when as a result sentiment
and then we're going to say okay what do
we compare this to so we're comparing it
to prices obviously and prices will be
pricing then we're going to say
quantiles and we're going to quantile is
equal to two
I'll explain quantiles here in a minute
because I'm going to go on a rampage
here periods equals 1 5 and 10 ok so
periods is just what periods do we want
to kind of think about in our tear
sheets so this is one period forward 5
and 10 so that's like 1 day 5 days 10
days so maybe this data is I don't know
try to think you could get price index
and derive like the second 0th index to
find out if this is daily or minute
anyway that's okay I'm still on that you
guys are probably moved away
that by now anyway so but this is days
so at least I think so cool so coming
here to quantile so as quantiles
basically what is going to do is take
our sentiment data separate into two
groups these groups before separation
are meant to come from a signal that or
I guess a factor that is going to range
from low to high
it must right now range from low to high
so if you have something such as
price-to-book ratio where it's not
that's not a factor that ranges from low
to high to low over price-to-book we
start to wonder what is so wrong with
this company that it's worth less than
it's tangible assets and a really high
price to book ratio is also not good
unless you're a technology company or
something like that you know then you
can start to justify higher but anyway
the higher it gets the worse it is but
also the lower it gets the worse it is
so if that's yours it doesn't mean you
can't use it what you probably need to
do is do some sort of calculation of the
deviation and then and have it ordered
that way
also with quantiles
the one of the major problems with like
for example sentiment in theory wouldn't
it be nice because the signal is
negative 3 to positive 6 in theory
there's 10 buckets because you have a
zero as well wouldn't it be nice if we
could say we want 10 quantiles and
quantile you know one would be the
negative 3 and then quantile 10 would be
a positive 6 that would be nice
but what happens let's run it did I do
it right yeah ok it's processing well
hopefully we're going to get an area I
want to eat mine yeah so get this huge
error but basically it boils down to
down here bin edges must be unique so we
can see as it tried to evenly distribute
by sample number into these bins it
failed because we had too many negative
threes
way too many negative ones too many ones
just the right number of two's though
the right number of fours and too many
sixes okay so it wants to vary it wants
to evenly distribute into these
bins or quantiles when really it would
be nice to be able to just say just
evenly distribute by the scale that we
have or something that would be nice now
in the documentation the reason I was
here is I was looking and like you can
see quantiles equals five years probably
single that's huge
okay good so quantized equals five but
we can come down here to get this
beautiful docstring by the way I love it
quantiles it can be int or it could be a
sequence of floats eg here that's wise
on quanta or the github but on actual
quanto pian there using an older version
it just hasn't been updated yet update
it okay so it's just probably not it's
just not that important compared to
probably other things anyways so we're
going to go with two because two works
and that's okay because again as long as
you can do two which you should always
be able to do two on range the lowers
should be bad the upper should be good
so we're going to go with two let's just
know like if you're watching this like a
month from now from the release date of
this video or or more or whatever just
know that you can probably get away with
defining your buckets now right you
could define as however you like but
right now you can't so if you're
watching this right when I release it
yeah tough look okay running hopefully
no errors usually it spits out the first
table pretty quick there it is okay so
it's not everything is going to generate
it just a ton of graphs for us but we'll
start anyway so I'm just going to run
over the the main things that I think
you want to pay attention to I'm going
to skip over a lot of this you can
either learn more here let me see if
they have I'm not sure they define much
on else yeah whoo that's loud
okay man alright but you can learn more
about alpha lines both in the github and
then over here you have learn a little
bit more if you'd like but I'll do my
best to explain what we're looking at so
anyways this is your annual alpha talk
to greatest
the beta though is
tastic it's almost neutral again you
want it to be anywhere between negative
point three positive point three we're
very close to zero awesome
down here the information coefficient
basically what you're what you're hoping
for here is to have a value that is you
know 0.1 is fantastic point oh one is
pretty good anything less than that you
know the further you deviate from there
the worse it gets but basically what
it's asking is what's the rank
correlation between your factor values
and the returns but just look for 0.01
or 0.1 ideally now obviously we've got
the standard deviation which you know
compared to our actual values here
that's you know pretty significant
anyway going down here we've got
turnover which is important but I think
there's other graphs that are more
valuable than the table so the main like
the first after you look at your alpha
your beta I would come down here this is
really useful because what you can see
here is this is you know the moon return
by factor quantile over time so periods
like so after one day five days ten days
one day five day ten day so quantile
this is quantile one quantile too so
quantile one sure enough after we get
the signal one day later the mean drop
five days later mean drop ten days later
even further okay and quantile two same
thing only vice versa so that's good
we're very happy they're scrolling on
down
oh we're not we're kind of a like our
parade has been rained on because this
is a nice violin chart that's kind of
showing us that yeah the mean is what we
wanted but the deviation from that mean
the volatility that we have here and the
spread is huge that's going to be the
main problem with with this factor so
and as we can see you know the positive
is much more valuable to us than the
shorts are because we're making a lot of
mistakes here okay now the next kind of
I think six charts are just like this
you've got the long short and then the
comparison by quantile so here
factor waited long short portfolio
cumulative return over time so this is
assuming basically if you shorted your
quantile one longed quantile to all the
companies that go in there and remember
this is relative so like during this
time we did very badly but it's totally
possible that most companies during this
time actually had positive sentiment
so yeah it's falling because we're
investing into comfort or shorting
companies that actually have positive
sentiment but they just so happen to be
the worst positive sentiment so again
that's probably why I'd want a hard cook
be able to hard-code your bin edges and
quantiles back to our or graph here
let's get back to where we were okay
long short over one period and then this
one just split them up so you can kind
of see and in this case well you know
it's just the inverse and that's mostly
probably happening because we literally
have two two groups so that kind of
makes sense they would be relatively
flipped coming on down here same graphs
just over five periods same graphs over
ten periods so yeah cool coming down
here top minus bottom mean return this
just shows us holy-moly all the noise
that we have the mean is good and what
that kind of signals to me at least is
like right here like these charts are
like you literally are longing and
shorting and as we get to the bottom two
with the whole turnover we have very low
turnover so it's totally possible that
we're holding these companies that have
like let's say negative sentiment that
we're trying to short where we're
shorting that company until the
sentiment changes we have no stop-loss
correct stop-loss probably help us out
here so anyway yet more turnover
basically you just have a ton of noise
or not turnover rather the mean return
but all this noise okay then here you've
got a vilage average cumulative returns
by quantile and take note the order has
been swapped on you so up to this point
quantile one has been green Kalan tile
two is red but they flipped them on us
so now quantile two is red so this line
here is like where you where the
signal happened so what happened after
the signal happened for quantile to the
good quantile well it went up great on
quantile one the pad quantile what
happened after the signal it went down
but we can also see leading up to that
signal what happened basically the same
thing we just watched so basically what
we know to be the case at this point is
that in general sentiment seems to be
trailing what otherwise is returns we
still had alpha it's still good and
predictive but it's trailing so that's
something you want to think about now
coming on down here kind of the same
chart as above you got the nice event
horizon here but you've we've got the
spread so the mean is down but you also
can see the spread of you know basically
how wrong are you and it's important to
notice too like here yeah the mean and
it spreads all the way up you know past
80 basically and this one only goes down
to about you know minus 40 coming over
here you've got this spread basically
all the way down to about minus 40 and
up here up to about 20 you've got a
massive spread you're more likely to be
wrong when you're wrong on the shorts it
looks like and also you can just tell by
the mean line itself it's just not as
negative as the positive is positive so
it could also just be the case that you
know with the sentiment signal only buy
into positive sentiment don't let
negative sentiment dictate a buyer so
coming on down here this is just
information coefficient over time
nothing really too much to see there and
then also you can see you know basically
over the years your monthly five period
I see so just very specifically you know
these are your months these are your
ears quantile turn over rank
autocorrelation and we are done
okay so I just quickly ran through the
charts basically I think you can get
pretty much the main bulk of information
you need from you know alpha beta come
down cool come down here and these these
are like the first charts you should
look at and immediately when we see this
huge spread we already kind of know the
rest of what
we're about to see in the rest of this
at least for this signal but these are
so pretty pretty useful to see like what
happening over time for the signal okay
so at this point given the workflow that
we've talked about you would almost
certainly go back and okay sentiment hat
is okay alpha factor but you know and in
the strategy we'd probably want to stop
loss but we're going to move some more
alpha factors we want to combine alpha
factors so we would okay with that
sentiment cool write that down let's
find another alpha factor and find a few
alpha factors and then you combine those
alpha factors before you would do a back
test most likely now what I'm going to
do now though is you know basically the
research of alpha factors and combining
rules that's like the challenge of quant
opium and making a good strategy I'm
going to leave that challenge to you now
going to since we have some alpha here
let's take it to a back like an actual
back test so we're going to back test in
the next tutorial and basically that
back test is you know pretty much this
pipeline right here and then we'll back
test it and then we'll come back here
and feed the back test through pi Folio
and see what more we can learn so
anyways that's it for this in the kind
of intro to alpha lines if you have any
questions comments concerns whatever
feel free to leave them below otherwise
I'll see you in the next tutorial and
we'll back test this bad boy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
