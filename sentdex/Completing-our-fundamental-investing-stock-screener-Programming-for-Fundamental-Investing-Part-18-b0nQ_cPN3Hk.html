investing through the use of Python
programming in this tutorial we're going
to be putting everything together now
and finally incorporating where we just
were with quando and stock price with
our screener now so the first thing that
we are what we're gonna do basically
before we do it instead of asking us
like right now we've got wild true rhyme
put what stock do we want to apply and
then whatever we typed in that's what
was shown now what we want to do is
actually make it so whatever the
screener picks it will show and only if
that's what we want it because sometimes
you know you might want to run the
screener without and just to generate a
new array or list and you actually don't
want to start everything so that's okay
so we're gonna go ahead and work that in
there as well so what we want to do is
come to our screener the screening
program that we made that all it did
with screen stocks and the first thing
that I'm going to do is at least take
just even better we'll just take this
one array you can take all the arrays
that you want but I'm just gonna take
that array copy and I'm just gonna
replace this first of all each stocker
right so that's the first thing that we
want to do and now because so what this
what we'll do is we'll loop through this
looking through the Yahoo key stats and
find any that are exceptional companies
now the next thing that we want to do is
really I would say that's about that's
about all we need to do what we're gonna
want to do now is scroll down slightly
into the actual screening element and
we'll take this and we'll actually put
this down below but first we'll take
this define Yahoo key stats and we
really need to take this all the way
really to this point here so I would
copy that
and come over here and below all of our
other functions come down
and we're going to paste this function
and it looks like we have a try so we
better close this with an exception
filled in the screen area I guess and
instead of this being yelling these
stats let's actually just call this
screener stock and then what we're gonna
do is basically if yes then what do we
want to do well if the answer to that
question is yes then we would like to
graph data so we'll come down here and
we'll just take this right here cut that
if show charts equals yes I would say
try and accept here as well a print
filled to graph screen P and then we'll
come here and we'll try to do graph data
stock now we need to throw in this
functionality there and so if we go back
to our screener that we may we did make
that functionality right at the top here
so if show or show charts equals raw
input level blah blah so copy that and
we'll come down here and before we do
anything else we'll ask that question
and now instead we should say we'll just
delete this and the loop that we're
gonna run run now is for each stock in
even better and that even better array
will run screener and then each stock
and I believe that should be everything
there might be something we're missing
here let's go look at that screener one
last time if if if it meets all those
requirements if
okay so that should me do everything
that we needed to do let's go ahead and
run it first question would you like to
show the financial data
quanto charts why of course run it a fam
wants to pull up a fam sure enough pulls
up a fam for the first stock that met
there are prerequisites so here is that
stock and you can see the price
obviously the banya ours I the net
income the revenue and if I move this
over turn on capital cool so we'll close
that one didn't like it wasn't perfect
for our tastes then we got this a cost
here and this one quite the nasty drop
there from 45 all the way down to really
under five that's quite quite nasty
quite the rough drop there for them and
we can see their financials here at
least all the data that we have on them
and this brings up the point where I'm
not positive that I would really want to
cut this data awake sometimes it's good
to see like where you came from some
more data the merrier anyways and if you
wanted to you know look at purely your
data you could always zoom it in so yeah
clear that out it's going to continue
looking through stocks waiting now we've
got Anna Lee or nly here and we've got
some more data on it and really of all
the ones so far it looks like more like
and I'll why is that it's the best buy
so far that's not financial advice by
the way don't invest because I said that
anyway so anyways you get the point
it is screening the stocks and when it
finds a stock that we're interested in
it will chart it for us don't mind all
that red I just cancelled it it was
starting to give me a 404 because I'm
not using my my auth token so anyway so
that's that's that so you can run this
against even the Russell 3000 and you
can get new new companies that meet the
requirements you graph it up the price
all that stuff so a pretty powerful app
they
now at this point if you made it all the
way through you've made it completely
yourself so it's completely customizable
by you and so I I think it's a pretty
useful app to run through to decide on
companies that you want to go long in so
hopefully you guys have enjoyed I might
throw in another video to show you guys
how to trim that dataxe it's not as easy
as it was to trim the data for the other
variables I'm just not sure how many
people are even going to want to trim X
I don't think you'd want to trim that
data you kind of want that historical
data but anyway if enough people beg me
I'll probably upload that video too so
anyways hopefully the series has been
helpful or helpful to you guys as always
thanks for watching thank you for your
