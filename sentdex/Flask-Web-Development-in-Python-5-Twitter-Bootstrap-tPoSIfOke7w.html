their flask with Python tutorial video
in this video we're going to be talking
about how to make our website a little
more pretty and we're going to do so
with Twitter's bootstrap and to get
bootstrap what you're going to want to
do is head over to get bootstrap calm so
I'll bring that down for you guys and
you're gonna want to download bootstrap
now there's a there's a few other ways
like you could download on your remote
server I forget all the things yet you
know you have to get like github I think
and a few other things just as easy to
go ahead and just download bootstrap uh
soak over here and we can original
source file I think we could just use
the regular bootstrap I'll know as soon
as I see it so download bootstrap and
then this will be the bootstrap folder
here we'll open that up and this is your
distribution and this is yes so this is
zipped up so we're going to extract all
will just extract it here so that's this
and here remember CSA okay so we have
our CSS and all that that we need so
what we're going to do is wherever
you've just downloaded this basically
what you need to do is you need to move
this stuff into your static directory so
this is our scripts where's SCP at here
we go
so in static so our HTML files are
located in templates and then in static
is where we're going to put our CSS
files and all of that so first of all we
want bootstrap and this we want all
these so we're going to copy and well
click and drag those in there so we'll
copy those
and fonts um I guess we'll take the
fonts too just just to have them on
server we don't really need those I
don't think I'm going to use them but
anyway fonts and then also je s for your
JavaScript and I think if I want yeah
we'll just leave these too so we'll move
just click and drag your bootstrap
JavaScript right in here sometimes you
might want to make another J's folder
but I think this will be fun so now
we've got bootstrap on our server now we
need a reference bootstrap so we're
going to come over to here our
index.html we'll take that and me pull
this one over here okay so within our
header basically what we want to do is
we need to reference our style sheet and
with flash there's a couple of ways that
we can reference things one you can
reference it the old way and in the old
way what we can do is you just you
basically you're going to write your say
link href and you're going to pass in
the reference so in our case it would be
under static slash bootstrap dot min dot
CSS um relation is going to be a style
sheet style sheet and media equals
screen shows me a on screen so we can do
that and we can pass the link through
that away and so we can save that
hopefully that that should work since
we're not going to too far in depth here
now oops that's the wrong thing let's
check to just confirm that we did get
bootstrap mndot CSS okay we did so
bootstrap Minn dot CSS so we can save
that and let's go restart our server a
quick make sure this went well as
expected here refresh okay
so we're definitely on uh-huh we're
using something has changed right
because we notice that the text has
changed and so here we're using a
different font now oh I want to say that
that is not uh I don't think we're using
those fonts like those those other fonts
I think are just those glyph icon
symbols um I'm kind of curious so I'm
like I think I'm just going to delete
these really quick and see if that still
works the symbols are kind of nice just
in case you need like small symbols and
you'll want to pay a bunch of money to
some someone for the symbols that's real
fresh yeah so those those fonts were
just symbols just in case any was
curious anyway
mmm so we've got H kenzi.com and then we
can also go slash about should still
work but here's where this goes wrong so
we can go open up our init dot pi and
check out what happens here so I'm just
going to go copy-paste and just for the
record when you do this keep in mind
that even though the name of this
function for the most part does not
matter it does matter if you've got two
of the exact same function names okay so
it would matter in your python script
it's going to matter here you have to
change this so let's just we're going to
make C about let's say on your about
page you i've got a contact link okay
and then it goes to a contact you know
thing so you go slash about slash
contact and we change this to contact
okay
and we save that and we refresh our
server and we come back over to our
website and we go about slash contact I
can't believe that just worked refused
to blue that's odd
um I can't imagine what I did i refresh
it something's gotta be going wrong uh
it's supposed to not work anyway
now I'm angry um sure why that's work
because it what happened what happens
sometimes apparently I can't replicate
it is it's going to try and reference
static but it's going to try and
reference static from slash about slash
contact basically because the the root
directory of this contact is in theory
about so it would be like looking for
about slash static bootstrap I am really
confused about how it's finding it I
don't think it's normally that this
won't work but anyway for whatever
reason it's working but I'm going to
show you a better way to do it so
there's a couple of ways that people
would work around this kind of problem
and one of the more popular ways would
be to do something like this HTTP colon
slash slash Harrison kinsley Khan slash
static and that would be a good idea to
talk about how the static dur works so
generally nothing goes by the
directories but if you go to Harrison
Kingsley calm and then you go slash
static like this you will find all of
the static files now you won't find
though if you go Harrison Kinsley Khan
slash let's say templates templates
you're not gonna find the templates
there even though they exist you're not
gonna find it so just keep that in mind
that anything is static is going to be
completely publicly viewable by people
so just think about that now um what
else I was gonna say Oh obviously you
would never want to make your website
you don't want to ever make
page that is slash static okay you can
have problems so anyway with that in
mind moving right along
that again that wasn't supposed to work
anyways people will sometimes do like a
full URL basically like the direct path
but there's another thing that you can
do and I'm not sure we'll get away with
it without making one more import but
I'm going to go ahead and try it anyway
so what you can say is link relation and
we'll call it a stylesheet media equals
screen but then we'll say href equals
and then quotes and then in here we go
this is all a variable right so just
those two spaces will do and basically
what we do is we go URL underscore four
and URL 4 is basically something that
will grab the URL for a specific
function in your script which it but you
have to import it which is one I'm not
confident that this is going to work
without URL for being a part of our an
import so we'll probably have to make
that import but this is the best way to
do it so URL four and then in
parentheses here so in your parameter
for this you're looking for static so
that's like the function right and then
the file name within that static
directory is going to be what was it
bootstrap min dot CSS now I forgot what
it was
let's go back
to here bootstrap mint CSS so watch copy
that copy or paste Duchamp in CSS and
now that should work as well so let me
go ahead and save that and let's just go
tubes let's go here first course we need
to let's refresh like pretty certain
this shouldn't work but last time I was
certain it wasn't gonna work
I was wrong apparently I just can't
believe that it's pulling that without
URL for um I'm gonna go ahead and just
import it just just to be safe for now
but so important from flask import flask
render template and then URL underscore
for route cetera we're going to use it
later on anyway so it's good idea to
have it but apparently that's going to
go ahead and work because I see it's
pulling from it and we did refresh maybe
this is just a worgen something the sky
is falling or something because all
these things that normally don't work
are working now but anyway so that's how
we can reference that stylesheet so now
we've got those styles I like what can
we do with them style so what did I do
with get bootstrap calm did we get rid
their we go okay so we can go to get
bootstrap calm and I encourage you to
just kind of look around if you go to
components apparently doesn't work let's
try again there we go um you can get
pretty much everything here I'm like
99.9% certain that get bootstrap comm is
used on is made with Twitter bootstrap
but anyway these are those icons I was
talking about those fonts but if we come
down we can you know here's some
dropdowns let's do a search for nav bar
here we go nav bars and then you have
some nav bars here so this is just kind
of like a typical nav bar here and this
is all the code for a nav bar and the
way html5 works again is you've got each
body has its own header footer nav and
like other stuff that you can put within
it so you can put nav bar anywhere but
if you put it in the main body that will
act as what you
leave to be a navbar most likely so this
is an example of a navbar there's some
other nav bars and we can edit this
navbar as well but just to keep things
simple let's go ahead and copy and paste
this navbar real quick so we copy this
copy and we'll come over to where is
this and so here we've got in the body
let's make some space here and trying to
think where I want it I can put it
probably and then I guess we'll put in
the main body so I'll put it here and
we'll just literally paste that navbar
in and we should get away with this um
probably won't this never works but I've
been getting really lucky apparently so
let's try that
um and then we'll come over to our main
file here fresh wow word okay see what I
mean I'm just getting lucky today so now
we've got this navbar and its really
nice navbar now the only thing that prot
there we go finally something that
didn't work okay so that's good I would
have been really scared if that worked
but so we got a lot of CSS here but what
we're missing is um we're missing
JavaScript to load this drop-down so
when you click on this drop-down what
should happen is it literally will drop
down with more options but we're not
seeing that right now and that's because
we're missing one of our JavaScript
imports so we'll come back over to our
index.html page here and let's scroll
down to the very bottom basically um
right outside of body before we close
our HTML tags is where we call our
JavaScript imports so to speak if you're
coming from Python this is a really
foreign thing like to like when you have
like JavaScript stuff you put like this
the actual script that you're loading
JavaScript from at the bottom I don't
know it drives me nuts but that's just
the way it is so just so I can make some
space here now what we're going to do is
basically we're going to call the script
so we're going to say script and here we
need a couple of things when you need J
query and then we also need a bootstrap
now we can either reference the
bootstrap like we did up here like this
with the URL for or we can even like
reference the other way and I think they
probably even host this remotely but we
do have it because we've got a this the
bootstrap here anyway so script tag and
I think what I'll do is it'll take this
here copy this paste so this is jQuery
jQuery Dom India's so we're just loading
it from the Google API and then we're
going to reference one more scripts this
one I guess I'll just write out real
quick script type equals text slash
JavaScript and this one will say source
oops source equals and for now let's
just we'll try the way I know it'll work
and then we'll try the UL URL for next
we want this bootstrap Minjae s so boot
whoops
static slash bootstrap dot min dot j s
we'll save that let's refresh our server
or patching rather I just want to say
server and we'll come back over here
let's refresh click on our drop down
still not working drop down why you know
work
so let me let's see what page were on
real quick okay we are on the home page
there's music calm we did let me check
to make sure we actually have some
dropdowns we should from that date of
the drop down yeah it's got to drop down
menu so we definitely have drop downs
but for whatever reason I'm not picking
them picking them up static slash I mean
we can try let's try this let's make
sure that even exists real quick let's
just make sure it's on the server so I
ocean Kingsley calm slash booster so it
it's there
let's just let's copy and paste it maybe
that'll help us I'm pretty sure that's
what we're missing
the jQuery we might have to use a
different jQuery version as well that
might be also throwing us off
stress again
mmm where is bootstrap okay oh my
goodness um yeah all right so great
great fun when you have these sorts of
errors but anyway we just never actually
closed off our script tag here idiot so
we'll come over here now that closed
that off restart Apache and come over
here and now we're refresh and that's
what did it so you just needed to close
those script tags anyway a little bit
longer than I meant to on that chop out
my hunt and find of that one but anyway
that's how you can do it add like really
quick in easy CSS and just general nice
automation to your website user
friendliness without actually needing to
know JavaScript and really much of CSS
at all their CSS file is pretty good
I've used it and not had to make any
edit to it ever so it's pretty nice a
nice CSS sheet to just use and forget
about anyway I would highly recommend we
might use a few more things here
especially like buttons we'll use that
button groups the pagination is really
nice
so check out pagination sizing button
bars this kind of stuff just just look
through the components page and kind of
get a feel for what's basically an
option for you it's a really really
useful thing so anyway check that out if
you guys have any questions or comments
based on what I've just shown you here
feel free to leave them below that's
pretty much all I mean work will keep
referencing from the bootstrap but
that's the only make major thing I just
wanted to show you guys you know getting
bootstrap putting it on there other than
bootstrap I'm not going to cover like I
guess we'll use highcharts to do
graphing but really not going to do any
JavaScript tutorial here HTML tutorial
or CSS if you want to learn more about
that stuff I highly suggest you at least
learn some of the basics of those three
things just so you can kind of
and what's going on but for the most
part you won't ever have to touch CSS
because you just put this on there and
you won't need to know anything more
about it and then as far as the HTML
stuff is concerned you can pretty much
use their examples and kind of
manipulate them to how you want so
anyways that's it questions comments
below as always thanks for watching
things for all the support subscriptions
in it till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
