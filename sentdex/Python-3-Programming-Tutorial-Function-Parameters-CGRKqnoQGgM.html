Python 3 basics video in this video
we're going to carry on with functions
in the last video you're shown just a
very basic function and we didn't use
any parameters in this video we're
actually going to include parameters and
give this function more functionality so
let's define a function and we're just
going to call this function simple
underscore addition and we're gonna have
num1 and num2 and basically when you
write this stuff out it you just making
it up like a variable name you can pick
anything you want just write it in it's
going to act like a variable within your
function so as usual : enter and now we
will write out this function now what we
want this function to do is just some
simple addition for us so first a answer
equals num1 plus num2 so that's going to
give us our answer variable and just for
the sake of printing out something else
let's also go ahead and print num1 is
connect so we don't leave this here num1
is NN number 1 now what we want to do is
actually print our answer to so let's go
ahead and print the answer so print
answer and now to print out our answer
so num1 is going to be whatever we
specify is in the num1 parameter and the
answer is going to be whatever num1 plus
num2 is obviously if you put letters or
string or whatever in here it's not
going to work
so anyway enter enter and we'll run
simple underscore addition 5 3 so we'll
save that we'll run it and we get num 1
is 5 and then the answer 5 plus 3 equals
8 cool easy enough and there are no
limit to the amount of variables that
you can have or the amount of parameters
that you can have in your function the
only thing you really want to look out
for at this point is the order of the
variables as well as the quantity of
variables now the order
is as follows so if you really wanted
num1 to be five but instead you did
three five obviously num1 is going to be
three not five now there's a couple of
things that you can do here you can one
protect yourself somewhat by doing
something like this so you could say num
1 equals 5 and then num 2 equals 3 like
so and you can hit you can run that and
it's going to work just like it always
has but you're not going to really see
people do this too often but what you
could do is you could say num - num 1
and so even though they're in a
different order than we specified that
we'd receive them because we're saying
it explicitly here we're allowed to do
that so num 1 is 3 and sure enough that
did work so that's going to work for us
now quantity is also going to be an
issue so let's just refer back to what
we were doing before 3/5 we run that
that works out for us but if we have
only one variable called we get an error
simple addition missing one required
precision positional argument by the
same token if we have 3/5 three or four
let's do that and we run it we're going
to get another error it takes two but
three were given so that's why you know
quantity is a big deal now that's going
to be it for this specific video in the
next video I'm going to be covering the
default variable assignments because
default variables can also kind of
change up quantity so soon we'll be
throwing away out all the knowledge you
just learned on quantity oh my goodness
anyway hopefully you guys enjoyed if you
have any questions leave them below as
always thanks for watching thanks for
all the support the subscriptions and
until the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
