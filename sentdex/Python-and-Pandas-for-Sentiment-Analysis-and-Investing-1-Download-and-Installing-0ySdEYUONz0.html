Python tutorial series this series is
going to be dedicated to the use of
Python with sentiment analysis for the
use of you know finance so trading
investing so kind of a shift that we've
been seeing over the years has been
institutions becoming more and more
interested in the use of sentiment
analysis or even just macro data
analytics for the use of investing and
trading this is kind of a it's a not
only a new field but it's very hard
field and difficult field for anybody to
get into for a few reasons one it's just
kind of a deep and convoluted field but
also it's very expensive to get into so
just buying the data from a source like
Twitter or something like stock twitch
which is like you know Twitter just for
stocks that's going to cost you
something like five to fifteen thousand
dollars a month just to get data from
these companies and then you've still
got a performance sentiment analysis on
that and that's going to be another
probably five to ten thousand dollars a
month if not more so it's very costly to
get into this luckily I happen to know a
guy right so I have a website and that
website is sent Dexcom and we track send
an analysis for companies so I've got a
massive database so we have we track
over the entire Russell 3000 we track
the TSX 250 so Canada stocks the ASX 300
Aussie stocks and the FTSE 100 so GP
stocks so we have all that we've got a
massive database but I don't want to
dump the entire database but I will dump
just the S&amp;amp;P 500 stocks and so I was
going to give that as just a simple
download on send XCOM so anybody can
just combine download this data set so
it's about I'll put it as a tarball so
tar.gz
and so it's about maybe 80 megabytes to
download it will extract to about 400
megabytes and it's about 4.5 million
rows of data on all these companies so
it's a good a decent sized data set
covers the about 1.5 years
some of them go up to about two years
like Apple was the first company that we
quickly added Google and Microsoft and
then over time more and more came really
about one point five years is the size
of the bulk of the data this is good and
this is bad I mean one point five years
is a good time frame but in the grand
scheme of things it's not especially
when we consider what has been going on
in the stock market for the last 1.5
years the most part we've had a ton of
QE and so the stock market's really not
even gone through a cycle I mean it's
just just gone up so it's not the like I
would like to test this data more on
like 10 years of data and you know a
huge cycle so that would be good in a
few more years maybe we'll reload anyway
so that's the data set we're going to
work with I'll go more into depth on
that data set it's also this SP 500 ish
and I say that because it's actually got
about 600 companies in it and it also
includes Bitcoin as well as gold oil
silver and copper and we're actually
gonna be filtering those out of the data
set especially Bitcoin because that's
completely unrelated but it is there if
anybody wants to play with it and the
data itself comes from does not come
from Twitter or stock to it so we do do
analysis on Twitter and stock Swiss but
we don't actually publicize any of that
data and so this is just our information
from companies like you know like you
Forbes New York Times Barron's this kind
of these news hubs that release data we
go through their spider pull that data
and analyze for sentiment there so we
get that from about 20 major new sources
and then we've also got another probably
about 20 smaller new sources that just
don't put out as much data just kind of
what the data set looks like we'll pull
that apart a little bit more later on
and explain what everything means in the
data set that's just some of the basics
of what we've got so some of the
problems that we have with this kind of
analysis is that the data the two data
sets you know basically stock prices and
sentiment analysis are not married okay
so what this means is yeah sometimes
they're correlated in the sense that if
stock price just jumps a whole bunch
suddenly sound it a lot of times we'll
jump based on the fact that a
stock price went up and we're all
excited you know that kind of stuff or
um if stock price goes up it's highly
likely that some journalist somewhere is
going to write an article on it and it's
probably going to be a positive article
you know because the stock price went up
so there's obviously a reason so
sometimes a Cantrell price okay and
sometimes it beats price but what we
need to do is we have to understand that
because it trails price we don't want to
find ourselves in a situation where we
have a trading strategy based on
sentiment yet we find ourselves buying
after price has already gone up so
buying at the high and then doing the
same thing and selling at the low that's
what we want to avoid so we want to be
able to so if we have to marry the data
back together again and we have to
reference both bits so probably the
first round of this video and the series
is going to be we're going to try to
keep things as simple as possible this
whole topic it's very in-depth very fast
so we want to keep things simple enough
to start but anybody who's brave enough
to continue on will dig a little deeper
and will start marrying the two bits
together but first we're going to going
to try and trade completely blind of
what the price is at the time and just
see do we even make any money at all
trading just blindly on sentiment so
we'll find out how that works so that's
the idea that's what we're going to do
in this video we're going to go ahead
and download pandas download all the
dependencies and download the data set
that we'll dump from centex and then
from there we'll just test the
installation real quick and then we'll
carry on in the next video and there
we're going to be just doing like a real
quick run-through of pandas some of the
basics of pandas how to work with it
manipulate data and then we're going to
go ahead and hop into our data set and
start you know really working with
pandas so and the data so anyways let's
go ahead and get the data set get pandas
and all that alright so now we're ready
to download first I guess we'll get the
data set so to get the data set you're
going to head to send text home slash
downloads
slash stocks underscore I think it
stocks index dot CSV dot GZ so it's not
hard out GZ a lot just as gzip of the
CSV hit enter good and that will
download your stock saw syntax so this
is the database done okay so while
that's downloading we can also
head over we need to get pandas we also
need matplotlib and we want numpy if
you're on Windows the easiest thing to
do is to head over to this website here
it's basically this I'll put the link in
the description if I forget to put links
in the description like I do a lot
please do just leave a comment I'll put
them in there but anyway as we head over
here and we can type in pandas click on
this and it takes us to the pandas here
and this actually tells us a lot of the
requirements so this is going to require
a numpy to apply TZ and very quickly
we're going to require matplotlib
because we're going to want to plot up
stuff pi tables all kinds of other stuff
that gets used very frequently so so
what I suggest that we do is we download
all of the things that we need now I'm
assuming everybody has Python installed
if you don't go to Python org and here
we'll head over to downloads and you can
either download Python 3 4 or 2 7 for
this series I'm assuming everyone is
using Python 2.7 it would have been
really nice to use Python 3 but
everything is not yet supported for
Python 3 so it can be very tedious if
you're trying to use Python 3 so I
suggest Python 2 7 now I have the 64-bit
version so I would download all 64 bit
version things if you're using a 32-bit
version of Python get all the 32 bit
downloads if you are on Windows this is
very easy you will download everything
so you click on pandas and that would
start your pandas download for you and
then you would want to go ahead and just
I hold ctrl on the keyboard and hit
numpy date until PI TZ and all of these
saipan metal apply tables blah blah blah
and now I've just created a whole bunch
of windows here right and so now you can
download numpy you can download date
util all these things get them
downloaded ok this one's still loading
but if you're not on Windows obviously
you still need to download all these
things I would at least start by
downloading pandas numpy date util
matplotlib and probably bottleneck but
maybe not
if you're not on Windows just keep that
in mind and otherwise if you're not on
Windows you need to go to numpad org get
numpy you could also get the SyFy stack
if you wanted also you'll need
matplotlib so go to matplotlib org to
download that and then pandas you can
come here and download pandas as well I
think that they give you the source of
yeah on the pi PI page so if you're not
on Windows that's how you need to get
these so once you have all these
downloaded install them and now what
you're going to want to do is actually
check the installation so go ahead and
pause the video while you're downloading
everything and whenever you're done
downloading and installing everything
will continue on so once you've got
everything downloaded you're going to
want to test your installation make sure
you can import and use this stuff so the
most important thing is we want to
import pandas so you want to make sure
that you can type import pandas in your
ID le so I just opened up Idol and we're
just typing this in we can import pandas
that's great
next thing you want to be able to import
numpy because we're gonna use numpy a
lot so you want to make sure that works
and then also you want to make sure we
can import matplotlib
as long as you can import these three
things we're ready to proceed in the
next video we will start using some
other dependencies as well let me go
back over I would at least make sure
that you have numpy date util and PI TZ
downloaded okay this other stuff and
except for matplotlib Lib I suppose you
make sure you download mat plot lips
we're gonna use that really quickly this
other stuff you could hold off if you're
not on Windows because it's kind of
tedious to download install this stuff
so anyways that's that make sure you can
do all this import pandas numpy
matplotlib if you're getting any errors
or you can't figure out how to install
something feel free to leave a comment
in the comment section below and I'll
help you guys out with your installation
and all that as long as everything is
all set though you're ready to continue
onto the next video and that next video
is going to cover just some of the quick
basics we're just going to run through
some of the basics of pandas we're going
to grab some data plot some data play
with some of the data and all that so
stay tuned to the next video as always
thanks for watching thanks for all the
support subscriptions and until next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
