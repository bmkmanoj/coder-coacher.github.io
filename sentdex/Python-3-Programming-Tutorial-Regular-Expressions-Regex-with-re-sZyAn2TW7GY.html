Python 3 tutorial video in this video
we're talking about is reor regular
expressions so the idea of regular
expressions is regular expressions it's
it's own little programming language of
its own kind of like SQL or sequel or
whatever and the idea of of regular
expressions is to pass a string of
arguments that will apply to a string of
text basically so you're let's say you
have a body of text and you're trying to
figure out you're trying to pull some
data from it let's say you're trying to
pull like an R case what we're going to
do is say we're going to it's a
paragraph and we want to pull names and
ages from the paragraph and we're just
going to go ahead and assume that names
and ages are the only like names or be
the only capitalized things and ages
will be the only numbers so the idea is
you pass data through or you pass like a
some arguments basically through using
regular expressions saying I'm only
looking for let's say numbers too you
know we're looking for a two to three
digit numbers I guess with ages would be
one two three digit numbers and then
names we're looking for any string where
the first letter is capitalized and then
all the way to the end and then if
there's a space then that's the end of
it in whatever so the idea of regular
expressions is that another thing that
we're going to use regular expressions
for very quickly is to parse paragraph
data away from HTML data in on websites
and stuff so if you recall the last bit
last video we visited some web sites and
we were able to get through their little
filters for robots but very quickly
we're seeing another problem is that we
can't figure out you know we're trying
all we really interested in is paragraph
text
Early's you know in theory that's all
we're interested in but we're having a
hard time separating all of that by the
program we could go through ourselves
but it would take a long time so anyways
now the idea of in use of regular
expressions is they're extremely useful
it's definitely a good idea to learn
them
they're kind of intimidating at first
but they do get easier I promise so with
that let's go ahead and get started the
first thing is going to be I'm just
going to throw out some identifiers for
you guys and these are all things that
you don't have to memorize these from
now I will put first of all up mmm
probably copy and paste this in the
description but also the whole sample
code I've been putting on my sample code
on Python programming net so you can
also get all of the sample code there as
well so don't worry about typing this
out with me just kind of if you want to
type it out if you feel like that helps
you better then go ahead and do it
otherwise just kind of listen and follow
along it's not necessary that you type
this so backslash will if you remember
it's an escaped character and when it
comes to regular expressions the
backslash is actually more of a
notification that hey this is a
character pay attention sonya a little
bit different than normal but anyway so
with regular expressions a backslash
lowercase D is going to be any numbers
so this is how you begin to notify that
hey we're looking for a number and then
you'll start putting in a description
but more on that in a little bit the
next thing we're going to have is a
backslash capital D this is going to be
anything but a number then you would
specify some more parameters but we'll
get there backslash s is going to be a
space backslash capital S anything but a
space okay then you're going to have
backslash W this is any character
backslash capital W anything you guessed
it put a character then we're going to
have a period now period you know how to
do a backslash or anything for it so
just keep in mind that because of the
period if you if you want to designate
like with regular expressions you can
all not only can you search for things
like this like any number and character
or space
you can search for specific letters and
the way you would search for a specific
letter or a specific character which is
just to type that letter right so with a
period you can search as well for us
period or say you're looking for decimal
points you can do that but you actually
have to use backslash period so a little
funky there I think it's kind of silly
they did it but whatever so anyway a
period is any character except for a new
line so anything except a new long next
we have /b and the idea of /b is to kind
of make things easy for you we weren't
using an equal sign so just do this
/b is the white space around words okay
so there's a lot of regular expression
that might go into coding you know
you're looking for white space or round
words so that luckily they've done it
for you um and then finally just as we
said backslash period okay a period okay
so so I really don't understand I think
that these two should be flipped but
they are not so just keep that in mind
next up so those are identifiers then we
have what are known as modifiers and our
modifiers are basically like our
identifiers say hey we're looking for
any number then we have modifiers that
say hey we're looking for this amount of
numbers or this type or you'll get it in
a moment
but basically we're modifying any number
and then we give a description that's
like our modifiers is our description so
we'll come down here and for modifiers
for example you might have up some
brackets 1 and 3 so remember before we
were saying if we're looking for age
we're looking for an age with a digit
you know maybe one digit two three
digits so in this case this is you would
say this is a description four digits
let's say and we would say we're
expecting one two three of them okay so
for example this would be /d
one two three okay that would be we're
looking for digits one two three in
length well we get there next up we're
going to say plus plus is means match
one or more so if you put a plus by
something it will only match if there's
one or more of them you put a question
mark it's gonna match zero or more now
why might you care about this this will
result and well nevermind well maybe
we'll explain that later
um asterisk is just going to match oh
I'm sorry I did this wrong let's see one
or more match zero or one then match
zero or more so there's a slight
difference between this and this and
then also this this or this
right why might you only want to match
one you might only want to be finding
one instance you might not want a whole
list but anyway with more on that a
little bit now the dollar sign that's
going to match the end of a string then
there's a caret sign this is matching
the beginning of a string so say you
were looking for pronouns you might not
want to look for anything at the
beginning of a string because everything
at the beginning like say your
definition of a program is a capital
letter then if you're looking at the
beginning of the string you would get a
lot of false positives because
everything at the beginning of a
sentence is going to be capitalized so
then we have the bars right so you've
got this little bar here and that
matches either/or so you could say I'm
looking for a digit one two three in
length oops
right and then you could have something
like this or I'm looking for a character
five to six in length or something like
that so that's where that bar might come
into play so it's either/or
then we have square brackets and these
just correspond to a range or variance
then we have these well you've already
seen the curly braces but you can also
have just a single number so you can
take five we're expecting five of these
bits of data so for now X expecting X
whoops X amount then we can have what we
did up here that's X to Y so right
expecting one two three so to speak the
next one that we're going to do is
they're called white let's make some
more space white space characters these
are characters that you might may not
necessarily see at least in code but
they exist so you've got new n for new
line we've already covered that
backslash s for space backslash t for
tab backslash e for escape you'll
probably very rarely ever see that
backslash F you'll rarely see this to
form feed and backslash R this is return
a carriage return you're probably not
going to see that either these three are
the really the only ones you're ever
going to really deal with but just so
you know the others do exist and maybe
some of you actually do need them hmm
now this will be a don't forget these
are the following characters so if you
recall there's a lot of symbols here and
another kind of confusing thing here
there's a lot of special things that we
have to remember so we're just going to
list them out so a period plus sign
asterisk question mark brackets a dollar
sign caret symbol or round braces curly
braces
a bar and a backslash basically if you
really want to use these you have to
escape them so just keep that in mind
okay
now uh the last thing I really want to
cover I suppose are I don't think yeah
we did range in variance but I guess I
should cover an example of range so
generally when you're going to see
square brackets the what you're going to
see is the following so it's gonna look
hello what is happening what's happening
to be okay so a range you're going to
see the following so if you've ever
looked into regular expressions you
probably recognize what I'm about to do
so a range might be A to Z okay so
you're looking here for capital A to Z
and then what you might see is like a to
Z like that and then you might also see
AZ like that as a first letter and then
a to Z has a second letter like that the
other thing too you could see is
something like these are kind of
confusing let's say we do you're looking
for a number one to five with the
lowercase anything a 2q followed by an
uppercase anything a 2z okay it's got a
little little confusing it's possible to
do that now
personally I rarely use code like that
to find what I'm looking for
just like with anything programming
there's many ways to satisfy the goal
whatever that goal happens to be but I
just want to make obvious what that kind
of means sometimes you're going to see
regular expressions and you're gonna be
like I don't even understand what he's
saying and I took that tutorial so
anyway moving right along do we ever
close off this massive common we sure
did so let's come back up here mm-hmm
we'll do that again don't have to worry
about copying this I just kind of wanted
to run through everything give you guys
kind of a get your feet wet and now
let's actually try what we've learned so
now you can start coding along with me
so to use regular expressions you have
to import the module as part of your
standard library and to import it you
just do import or e now let's make an
example string so we're gonna say
example string equals and then we're
going to make it a multi-line string and
we're going to say the following Jessica
is 15 years old and Dan Daniel is 27
years old okay then
Edward is 97 and his grandfather
Oscar is 102 okay so we have this
example string now what we want to do
with this sample string is we want to
pull all the names and we'll pull all
the ages from the string luckily in
English at least we would not say 15s
Jessica you would always say Jessica is
15 right and then you might have a
question like who is 15 Jessica in that
sense fitzy would come first but at
least here for a basic example age is
always following the name so we can
always assume that name age and those
are the corresponding values so anyway
we're trying to pull names ages also we
don't have any capitalized letter or any
capitalized words that aren't names so
yay for us anyway so now what we want to
do is we'll come down here and now we're
going to specify the regular expressions
that will correspond to names and the
regular expressions that will correspond
to age so first we have ages equals of
redefines all and to notify Python too
that this is going to be a regular
expression string use our then and
opening quotation and we'll go ahead and
close it all already and now we're going
to say for ages
we know that following ages we've got a
two digits two digits three digits but
it's conceivable there might be a one
digit age somewhere in there so we know
that we want to search for
backslash d so we're one search for
digits and now we want to say we want to
find any digits that are 1 2 3
right so we use these curly braces and
we'll use one comma three done now
that's the first parameter you specify
the regular expression that you're in
search for now comma where do we want to
search for this string well we want to
search for it an example string okay
next what we want to do is names and
names is going to equal read up find all
again and we're going to say it's a
regular expression close that off
already and names are going to be the
following now remember before I did this
this is basically searching for any of
those characters a one two five and
eight EQ or a capital A to Z and you can
do that
and there's also there's a couple other
things that you can do I think probably
when I worded this I probably worded it
poorly it's not one two five then at a
TQ then eight is capital A to Z it's any
of the following
but anyway so we're looking for any
capital letter first so we're going to
say anything capital A to Z we're
looking for first and then we're going
to look for anything capital A to Z
lowercase and then asterisk okay and
that asterisk is basically saying we're
looking for just one of these but as
many of these zero more repetitions of
those but that's just a to Z so as soon
as we had a whitespace a period comma
anything it's going to stop parsing that
so that's all we have to do and again on
example string is where we want to apply
this so now what we can do is we can go
print mmm ages and print names and let's
save and run that and see what we get
okay so we get Jessica 15 Daniel 27
Edward 97 Oscar 102 so we get lists of
this data we could also end up putting
stuffing these into a dictionary so for
each let's say if you wanted to get
fancy Dancy about it to Torres already
pretty long anyway so whatever well we
could say for each let's say
nano slopes each name in names let's
specify age dict up here equals empty
for now for each name in names age dicks
each name hmm
each dick each name equals I guess
there's a couple of ways that we can do
this I think the easy first of all we
could do index and get the index number
and then go so we could do that or the
easier play that we can do this is we
could say x equals zero for each name in
names H dick each name equals ages X x
plus equals one that's it now we can
let's see if we print H dicks and if
that works out for us yeah there we go
okay so then we get our dictionary and
so that's our output and we can check it
over here to Edward not Jessica's 15
Daniel's 27 Oscar or Edwards 97 Oscars
one or two okay so now we've populated a
dictionary with this with this data
right or you could have stuffed it into
a database or whatever
probably the superior way to do this was
what would have been actually to check
the index but when I did it was finding
it shorter so anyways um that's going to
include just an introduction to regular
expressions in the end we covered a lot
of the regular expression characters but
we didn't cover a lot of what the RT
module can actually do so the only thing
that we actually use with our each
module is redefined all there are other
things that we can do with regular
expressions so we will be covering more
on regular expressions personally I use
some of the other ones but redefined all
is pretty much the only one ever used so
that's why I covered it I figured that
maybe that's what most people want but
there are other regular expression
functions and so we definitely want to
cover
the other ones but now I can conclude
this video in the next video we're going
to be combining URL Lib and regular
expressions to parse paragraph data from
a website so anyway stay tuned for that
