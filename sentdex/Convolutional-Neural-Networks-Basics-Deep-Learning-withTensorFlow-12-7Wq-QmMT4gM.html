to part 12 of our deep learning with
neural networks tensorflow and python
tutorial series in this tutorial what
we're going to be talking about is the
convolutional neural network or CNN or
cond net if you're a cool kid so the
convolutional neural network is
basically state of the art for
recognizing what an image is what's in
images or even playing roles in doing
things like assigning captions for
images so the convolutional neural
network breaks down into basically the
following structure you have some input
data and with that input data you're
going to do some convolutions or some
convolving and that generally is just
creating feature Maps and we'll talk a
little bit more about that in a little
bit but for now we'll just stick with
convolve and then you're going to do
some pooling usually max pooling again
we're going to talk a little bit more
about that later on and each one of
these you do is going to be a layer or a
hidden layer better put actually so each
one of those is your hidden layer and
then generally you will add one fully
connected layer
which would also be a hidden layer as
well and then finally you will output
whatever your output ought to be so
that's kind of the idea so again you
take your input data you can volve it
you pool it you usually will convolve
and pull again just because you're going
to have two likely hidden layers at
least to start real basic two hidden
layers then you'll have a fully
connected layer a fully connected layer
is identical to the hidden layers of our
typical just simple neural network that
multi-layer perceptron model and then
finally the output again same as the
output from a multi-layer perceptron
model so now let's talk about what
convolve is and what pool is so when you
do a convolution this is generally just
any form of mapping or creating a
feature map from an original data set so
generally what this is going to involve
is it's just going to be this moving
region this moving window over your
image that is looking for something or
in some way is going to create a feature
out of a window of pixels and some sort
of n-by-n of pixels it's going to look
for something or do something basically
to take that that region of pixels and
classify it or call it something so
sometimes you might have this searching
through an image looking for horizontal
lines or vertical lines or edges and so
on so you might use something like
OpenCV for example so to visualize this
let's take an image and this will be a
photorealistic image of a cat okay and
the image in general you're going to
break it down by pixel but I can't break
this image down by pixel so let's just
pretend we're breaking this one down by
pixel
good enough so each of these little
squares is a pixel let's pretend so in
the convolution step let's say you're
going to take a 3x3 convolution so you
might start with a window that is like
this and that window is going to only is
going to basically pertain to Anu we'll
call it SEL and it'll be that and then
we're going to shift that window and we
could shift it to spots over so we could
make that window here we can make that
next window right here right so there's
a little bit of overlap there so we'll
make that there just for kicks for now
and that would be here and now we've
reached the edge and we're all set so
then we would move the window down into
that left where now though 3x3 is here
and that would correspond to this window
I didn't draw the line of the blue one
but I'm sure you get it and then finally
our last 3x3 shifted over it would be
like this okay and that would correspond
to this one okay so we just keep doing
that just to the point where we're not
actually shifting any pixels or rather
not shifting to the point we're not
skipping any pixels so if this is your
convolution what is pooling so let's say
you've done some convolution and
convolution has just produced values for
us
so again when we convolve if you
remember from a few seconds ago if you
can remember that far long ago we
created new boxes in each of these new
boxes or in each of these new kind of
regions of the image they might actually
have values in them like 2 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 4 &amp;amp; 3
something like that so let's imagine
this is a new basically a feature map
and we'll just add some values here ok
so let's say this is that new feature
map now what we're going to do is we're
going to move we're going to do pooling
and we'll do a we'll do a 3 by 3 pooling
that'll extremely simplify this and make
this quick so the pooling that we're
going to do is a 3 by 3 and when we pool
it's a little different
from when we created the feature map yes
when we created the feature map we did
what pooling is actually going to do for
us but we also kind of extracted value
whereas pooling is simply simplifying so
let's take it three by three pool and
this is going to be a max pool so we're
looking for the max value that max value
is a four so in this case it would be a
four we'll just make a box around it I
guess and then we could shift it over to
and then we've got this box the max
value is a three and then we come down
and here the max value is a four and
then again here the max value is a three
so it's extremely simplified version of
what pooling is but and we never had a
value here this is the great unknown
value anyway that's an extremely
simplified version of what pooling does
but that is what pooling does and
together convolution plus the pool
equals a hidden layer okay and then you
we had that fully connected term at the
end and that just means a fully
connected is just you've got neurons and
they're just fully connected to each
other we've kind of already spoken on
that so hopefully you understood that
already and then you finally have your
output which we've also already covered
and this is exactly the same as before
let's say the first ones cat dog then
horse so these might all connect to each
other again so you've got cat dog horse
maybe this outputs a five this is a two
and this is a one so then of course the
winner is cat and and our hypothetical
convolutional neural network we are
successful okay so again we start with
input data we do our convolutions and
pooling and together with convolution
pooling you've got a hidden layer you'll
probably have two hidden layers at least
in our basic example that we are
actually going to do in tensorflow
you'll have two hidden layers
it's a convolution pooling
then you'll have a fully connected layer
and it's arguable whether or not this is
actually of use but people do it anyway
so we're going to continue doing it and
then you have the output which again is
just the same as before so basically
from fully connected to output it's the
same as any other neural network so
doing this in tensor flow is actually
really simple we can MOT slightly modify
our initial code to work with this it's
actually pretty impressive how easy it
is given how different the model itself
is actually especially when you have
something like sparsely connected layers
and then and then just pooling which is
not quite something we've done before so
anyways we're going to do that in tensor
flow and see how just how simple that is
and we're going to do it against the
eminence dataset and using that script
that we've been basically using all the
way up to this point those same one that
we did with the simple multi-layer
perceptron model the same one we did
with the recurrent Network recurrent
neural network that is and then here
with the convict on the net so anyways
