another YouTube video in this video what
we're gonna be talking about is the
brand new jetson Tegra k1 dev kit on
board is the Tegra k1 system on a chip
that is new from Nvidia now I have a
special treat for you guys today I
actually have one I got it in the mail
and I have not even opened it yet still
got the seal on it and everything I
thought we could open it together so
what is this chip or actually the entire
board what do we do with it and just you
know some information on it
brand new chip from Nvidia and the main
focus on this chip so far has been
mobile so the idea is that you can put
one of these into a cell phone tablet
whatever and you can get xbox 360 ps3
type graphics so for gaming on phones
and all of that huge increase now one
thing to keep in mind is that when
gaming increases Co up for performance
so does everything else on your phone so
the performance your phone should become
just drastically better we're talking
about the stats that this thing has is
really the stats of your average
computer maybe not necessarily today
certainly in storage not today but as
far as performance is concerned maybe
the average computer of two years ago or
so so probably whatever computer your
family is running today this is just as
powerful and so that's actually really
impressive but these are just of course
the claims of Nvidia I have not really
tested it and really the only tests that
I've seen so far have been put out from
Nvidia one thing to just note is there's
two difference here right there's the
Jetson Tegra k1 dev kit which is a
development kit focused around the Tegra
k1 chip okay
and so the DEF K is a little bigger I
haven't actually seen it but according
to the measurements it should be about
twice the size of your your typical
Raspberry Pi okay
and the next question would be how
powerful is it you know let's say in
terms of the Raspberry Pi instead of ps3
or xbox 360 where I scrape I poles about
24 G flops whereas the Taylor k1 again
the claimed member is 326 G flaw so
significantly more now how about the
price well the Raspberry Pi is about $40
people like to quote this like 20 to $30
range for Raspberry Pi let me know if
you see a Raspberry Pi on sale a new one
for 20 to 30 dollars I would like to buy
them so anyway the Raspberry Pi more
often than not is more like $30 unless
you buy in bulk or arming $40 unless you
buy in bullet or you get it with you
know something together like I just
found like a Raspberry Pi and the camera
module I think for 50 dollars so that
was actually a really good deal but
anyway that aside so about $40 I would
say for your typical Raspberry Pi the
Tegra k1 dev kit 190 299 I believe let
me look on Newegg real quick
yeah 190 299 as a sort of salute to the
amount of cores it's got a Kepler GPU
with 192 CUDA enabled course so what
does this mean well basically the if you
look at like the Raspberry Pi especially
when you consider something like Python
or something like that where when Python
doesn't really utilize your entire GPU
because it's Python binding its nature
is a single threaded application and so
what you have to do if you want to get
the full processing power out of your
CPU with Python is you have to either do
threading in a somewhat pseudo way or
you can do something like pi CUDA or use
like anaconda something like that that
uses a CUDA enabled GPU to do GPU
processing now that's what makes this so
special is because obviously we have no
problem maxing out our
Raspberry Pi really one Python script
who will get that thing cooking but with
this one Python script probably would
not max out this GPU and so you would
start having a thread or run multiple
scripts to get that processing up
whereas here we can actually use CUDA
and if you do it right you actually make
it a much more efficient program and all
of that so this can get very powerful
very fast at least according to
specifications I like to test them so
also if you caught up with my last video
my intentions with this are a little bit
different than you know gaming or mobile
gaming or mobile anything
I guess mobile actually is a pretty good
word but not in the sense of cell phones
and stuff I'd like to put this on a
quadcopter and I do actually have my
quadcopter
I built this just a few days ago and I
finished it yesterday one of the pieces
was bad so anyway I will probably be
putting this dev kit right on top here
replace this KK board with that and I'd
like to make this an autonomous
quadcopter that was my promise to Nvidia
anyways so I have to at least try that
and that's really what I have more
interesting I have a computer already
now I am kind of curious the Raspberry
Pi is a full computer I'm curious to
find out if this Jetson Tegra k1 can
actually be a full usable computer does
the Raspberry Pi is totally usable but
it takes like three seconds to open up
an internet browser and then actually
browse the internet it it's just very
slow it's very tedious now for you know
$40.00 that's still very good so I'm
curious about the Jetson take Tegra k1 a
couple of things it's got two gigs of
ram 16 gigs of storage but there's SATA
and SD so you can plug more stuff in
there if you didn't want to have a hard
drive you could use an SD card not
recommended at least from what I found
with the Raspberry Pi the SD card is not
a good storage system even though it
works great for you know
pictures or whatever and it seems to
work okay on my cell phone if you're
doing something with a lot of input and
output you're highly likely to burn that
SD card now
I'm gonna say there is a type of SD card
that does it better but the name evades
me so anyway without further ado let's
go ahead and open up this box see what
we got cuz I have not opened it and I
really want to open it so make some
space here mmm coffee
okay so break this seal I should keep it
boxed up and sell it in a few years
anyway if anyone is curious you can't
get them apparently of course when I
looked at it on new egg it says not
available I'm not really sure who else
sells this right now I don't have you
can just search it on any video not an
affiliate or anything like that I don't
pay me to say this I think you can
actually I don't know if you can buy it
on Nvidia's website or not but anyway to
the chip so here's the board I don't
know how well you guys can see it it's
basically taking up this entire box and
too bad we can't really see the chip you
can look at pictures of it online to get
picture to the chip but over the chip is
a fan to cool it and so makes a lot of
sense cuz I bet this chip it's pretty
worn --is-- especially if you're using
all 192 cores now the next thing let's
see what else we got in here so here's
the chip now we have a what looks to be
recycled materials introduction
basically to the board no problem no
problem
it's like power possibly this is a
serious power this is your power
no more mini USB apparently
I want to say you could power this by
mini-usb I swear I read that but look at
it in a minute and then we got what
looks to be our USB used with something
looks like a controller I don't really
know for sure it's a mini USB 'two
yes mean USB plug it looks like you're
supposed to use it with the controller
but I don't really I can't tell very
much
this is a Lego piece it looks to be a
Lego piece and then the plug for our
power and that would be everything so
literally the only instructions that
come with this are here now I have kind
of read up online there is a ton of
information on Nvidia's website about
the Tegra k1 setting it up they have a
bunch of software there for you so easy
enough and so really sure this is
probably has no use it's probably just a
little gift to people or something I
have no idea it honestly looks like Lego
it's something correct me is this button
okay it looks like a little Lego piece
anyway enough of that then we have this
USB cord I'm not really sure what its
purpose is very specific and what it's
supposed to be used with it looks like a
controller to me but it's a USB to
mini-usb so whatever you wanted to use
that for I'm pretty sure in here we have
our massive supply box here that's huge
that's bigger than like my laptop's okay
anyway there's that
and finally the entire dev kit itself
now let's see yeah for here before you
start playing with this you would want
to make sure you ground yourself you
don't touch something metal I'm not sure
if this is plastic but you'd want to
touch something mid metal make sure you
don't have a charge because you can ruin
the entire kit
static I'm in Texas now careful easy and
here we have our Tegra k1 deaf kid so
here we got a power some IO VGA
audio Ethernet USB I'm pretty sure that
blue is stands for three-point now DC
power looks like right here
interesting interesting
HDMI say duh honestly not even sure what
jaeyi not sure what this plug is here
just let me know I have to look at a
picture and figure out without it
anyway so yeah cool so this is all of
our stuff here we've got a whole bunch
of things to play with for sure
definitely gonna be a lot of fun so
anyway that is your tanker k1 Devki
quite the size at first I thought it was
too right about the size of two
raspberry PI's but this is really the
size of probably one two three raspberry
PI's if we were being honest so quite a
bit larger and I'm curious how well it
will fit on my quadcopter it actually
looks like it should fit so yeah it'll
fit not really sure how well you guys
can see that but it'll fit just barely
it's like the perfect size try my best
not to bang something anyway y'all take
my word for it it fits so that's cool
the other thing I was gonna do if that
didn't fit was just a KRAS berry pies on
x1 raspberry pi just won't cut it what
if we did some just networking between
the pods that could all work together so
that was the backup but this will fit
it's a good thing I was starting to
worry if I needed it never realize that
quad was gonna be that big I don't read
specifications usually so it's pretty
interested in the price of that quad
than anything else and so anyway we're
lucky I didn't get any smaller quad I
would've had to buy another one so
anyways so that's it with the Tegra k1
I'm gonna play with it a little bit I
have never played with it so I can't
really do too much else with it until I
set this up there's a whole bunch of
like I said documents online about what
you didn't you need to do to get this
thing running they have a you know Linux
that you can install here I'm very
curious to put a game on it and see how
well it plays I'll plug it into one of
these monitors probably show you guys
how that how that works anyway I
wouldn't mind testing that stuff but
then after that my biggest interest is
in the input/output and and then CUDA
right
so the idea of CUDA is really nice
because the board comes from Nvidia so
this means we can do use all of the
development up to this point and all of
the you know support for CUDA
programming up to this point because
this is a CUDA enabled GPU so that's
very exciting so even if you didn't have
a taker k1 you could probably follow
along with some of the videos just based
on programming with the CUDA enable GPU
that said I do actually have two CUDA in
the able GPUs in my main computer as
well so I could have done those anyway
but it'll be fun to play with this
little board so that's it if you guys
have any questions or comments feel free
to leave them below one last look at the
Tegra k1 dev kit I'm having such a hard
time there we go
so that's it excited to play with the
board hopefully you guys enjoyed
questions or comments below as always
thanks for watching thanks for all the
support subscriptions and until next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
