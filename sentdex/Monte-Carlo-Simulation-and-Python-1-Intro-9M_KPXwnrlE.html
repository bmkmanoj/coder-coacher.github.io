simulation experiment with Python poor
begin we should establish what a Monte
Carlo simulation is the idea of a Monte
Carlo simulation is to test various
outcome possibilities so in reality only
one of the outcome possibilities will
actually play out but in terms of risk
assessment any of the possibilities
could have occurred and therefore should
should be weighed in to whether or not a
decision was a good one
so Monte Carlo simulators are often used
to assess risk of a given say trading
strategy with options or stocks Monte
Carlo simulators can help drive the
point home that success is success is
not the only measure of whether a choice
was good or not
choices should not be assessed after
their outcome instead the risks and
benefits should only be considered at
the time the decision was made so the
whole hindsight bias uh you know we have
a humans just in general are very good
at fitting you know reasoning to why
something might have occurred after the
fact but we're pretty bad at it before
the before the fact so a Monte Carlo
simulator can help help someone
visualize most or all in some scenarios
of the potential outcomes to have a much
better idea regarding the risk of a
decision so with that let's consider in
this video in the next few videos a
really basic example so here we're going
to consider a gambling scenario where a
user can role quote unquote a
metaphorical dice for an outcome of
something like 1 to 100 if the user
roles anything from a 1 to a 50 the
quote unquote house wins if the user
roles anything from a 50 1 to a 99 the
quote unquote user wins if the user
rolls a 100 they lose so with this the
house maintains a mere 1% edge which is
markedly lower than the
in most situations where you have
speculation or gambling taking place so
for example consider if you're trading
with say Scottrade where the
metaphorical house is taking seven
dollars a trade if you invest a thousand
dollars per stock this means you have to
pay seven dollars in entry and seven
dollars and exit for a total of fourteen
dollars so this puts your your the
metaphorical house edge 21.4%
notably though Scottrade is not the
actual house right so when you lose you
don't pay Scottrade right you just pay
them the fee so the house is basically
everyone except for you so this means
that on the long-term scale your bets or
your your your speculation in stocks
need to do better than 1.4 percent
profit um need to be better one point
four percent profit on average than your
losses right otherwise you will be
losing money so despite the fact that
that's a very small number
the odds are already against you and as
you'll see very quickly even with such a
small percentage odds against you like
in our case we're going to use one
percent the more wagers or the more
stocks you purchase in this example the
less likely your life are the less
likely you are to have a long life
expectancy here I expect a lot of people
would make arguments regarding my house
odds assessment with Scottrade in stocks
and all that so let's go ahead and just
stick with dice with a hundred sides for
now very simple so a Monte Carlo
generator can also help illustrate the
flaws of the gamblers fallacy so many
gamblers even and sometimes especially
gamblers who understand statistics fall
prey to the gamblers fallacy
so the fallacy asserts that taking
something like flipping like the
flipping of a coin for heads or tails
you have a known 50/50 odds that said if
you just flipped heads five times in a
row somehow you're more likely to flip
tails next no matter how many times
heads have proceeded
your odds each time you flip the coin or
always 50/50 so it's easy to fall into
the trap of thinking that on the
long-term scale odds will kind of be
drawn to this 50/50 therefore if odds
are currently imbalanced then the next
flips odds are also not 50/50 because
they must you know seek this 50/50
equilibrium that's not true it's every
flip seeks this 50/50 equilibrium and as
well as we'll find with the scenario
that we're going to do now it is simply
not the case that just because you know
something occurs you know a bunch of
times even with 50/50 odds it does not
mean that the next thing will be the
opposite so again with our example in
mind just remember of the reducer rolls
one to a fifty the house wins 50 1 to 99
the user wins and a perfect 100 means
the house wins so let's go ahead and
begin so first we have to generate our
actual dies and for this we're going to
first can employ the pseudo-random
number generator within Python so let's
go ahead and get started so how we're
going to import
oops I'm gonna put my that's odd there
we go import random and now we're going
to define roll dice no parameters for
this and we're just going to say role
equals random dot R and int so this is
just a random integer between 1 and 100
and that's it so then at the end of this
we'll return the roll um that's it for
now so now let's go ahead and just
quickly test our dice make sure it's
giving us what we want so we're just
going to say x equals 0 while X is less
than 100 results equals roll dice print
results and then X plus equals 1 sounds
good we'll save and run this and sure
enough here is our output here
so here's obviously a 1 and then a bunch
of numbers I don't see 100 but it was
possible we
didn't get one so now that we have a
dice um die what we want now is we need
a better so we need to make um just a
simple better in our program so that's
what we're going to be doing in the next
video is creating our better is going to
bet on this dice roll
so anyway stay tuned to the next video
as always thanks for watching thanks for
