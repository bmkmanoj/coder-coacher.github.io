basics video in this video we're going
to be discussing some of the basics to
debugging in my videos I get a lot of
questions for help where people have
errors and they're not really sure where
the problem is but if they use some
basic and simple debugging they realize
how obvious the answer really is so most
of the time the problem is a typo
followed very closely to a
misunderstanding of indentation and
standards but usually it's a typo and I
guess they just don't understand what
the error is saying but every time you
see this error it's like you should just
automatically be like oh I must have
typed out somewhere so if you don't know
what standards are standards are
basically how we organize our code so
with Python unlike most languages you
defined blocks of code like functions
with indentation so define function and
here is your functions code everything
goes in here and then whatever the
function is done it's just literally you
just onion den and you start a new stuff
so this is the function block and this
is not the function block and when
people start getting into trouble they
do something this and that gives them
problems with syntax now there's
obviously a lot of income in in-depth
common issues that you might find from
time to time and you can find some more
debugging videos by searching for
debugging in my channel for now managers
can keep these examples pretty basic the
first error that we're going to discuss
is name error is not defined so example
of this one is going to be variable
equals 55 print they're unable so we've
obviously type out variable we go to run
and we get you know name error variables
not defined and this sometimes drives
people crazy especially if maybe this is
variable and this is the type owed
variable and they say they see a named
arrow variable is not defined but they
know they just defined it like they just
defined it so this are freaking out but
almost always this is the case it's
they've just simply type owed variable
now we can talk about indentation issues
here's an example of something I've seen
a few times
tasks and then they come down here test2
and then they start typing whatever and
you get expected and indented block and
this just means that it expected some
sort of indentation here another time
you'll see something similar when it's
expecting another indentation yet
slightly different is say you've got
print or better yet a variable versus x
equals actually person will show up
print print and people maybe print hello
there then they come down here and
immediately you should recognize that Oh
something is wrong because python has
indented me and I don't know why and
it's for the reason before where you
could put something like this and then
more stuff but then some people continue
on and you'll have print F let's say and
you run is just as invalid syntax well
it's not very helpful to some people
especially he's not going to highlight
where your invalid syntax is but again
generally it's because you didn't close
something off now another common one
that people are going to get is going to
be the following it's going to be e o L
while scanning string literal this
happens a lot if say you've got a
variable and the variable is a string of
text and like this string off school and
then the print hmm X and we'll run you
get yo L while scanning string literal
and the reason why you get this is this
string never finished yet we started a
new line and he's very frustrated so
you'd have to close this off now those
are just some of the common things I
realized maybe that was just really
painfully slow for some of you guys but
this actually catches a lot of people
I'd say at least 90% of the problems
that people have they you know if they
leave a comment in there having a
debugging problem they've got something
wrong with their script they can't
figure it out honestly 90% of the time
it's one of these things and of that 90%
probably ninety
time it's just a simple typo so anyway
thought it'd be good idea to go ahead
and cover that as far as you know name
or variable not defined almost always a
typo so sometimes people just don't
understand what the area is even saying
to them so they don't even know what to
think so anyway that's going to conclude
this video hopefully that was helpful
for some of you guys as always thanks
