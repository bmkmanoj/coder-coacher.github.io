let's just build one so what are we
going to need well first you're going to
need two linux capable systems I highly
suggest you just buy the two raspberry
PI's to follow along identically with us
so there's no issues with setup and
software and all this kind of stuff
because what we're going to doubt will
at least for sure the MPI that we're
downloading is like super portable and
I'm not really sure how well it's going
to work on just anything so anyway
there's there's that for sure but anyway
depending on what you have on hand
if you want to go the Raspberry Pi route
it'll probably only cost you like eighty
bucks so it's a real cheap way to have a
have one so so two raspberry PI's
they're going to cost you $35 to $40
each you'll need power supplies for each
pie the pie if you buy it does not come
with anything but the board so the power
supply for the Raspberry Pi is a cell
phone charger I'm guessing you already
have one usually when you buy a cell
phone you get the charger with it I
don't know if they're stopping doing
that these days last cell phone I bought
was like two years ago so actually was
like three years ago mess old cell phone
anyway so a cell phone charger basically
it needs to have 5 volts in 750 million
at least personally I bought a bunch of
these 5 volts 15 hundred milli amp
chargers since I have a bunch of PI's
and if say you're using a 750 million
and you plug in a USB keyboard a USB
mouse and or or usually what does it for
me is I plug in a I have this big 32
gigabytes thumb drive and I plug that
into them and they just die so so I need
that one 1500 and I'm pretty sure my old
charger was like a thousand milliamps
and it would still die when I would plug
that thing in
but anyway so there's that you'll need
two of those they're pretty cheap you
can find them on ebay too for that
specific size or specifications rather
stinkin size because the next thing
you're going to need is 2 SD cards
greater than 2 gigabytes each in size
again I just had these laying around I'm
guessing you guys do too but you're
going to need them next you're going to
need two x cat5 cables 2
to your router or modem I had these
laying around to for initial setup
you're going to want an HDMI enabled
television and that cable an HDMI cable
and a USB keyboard you don't absolutely
need this stuff you can set up your pie
without any of this but it becomes a big
challenge and I'm not going to cover
that in this video well actually it's
not even mean this nun that's going to
be in this video but the series I won't
be covering that so that's really it
hopefully most of you guys just need to
buy the two BOTS two pies and you've got
the rest of the stuff if you're new to
raspberry pies you can do a lot of
really really neat things with them like
robotics or you can just use them as a
computer or the whole slew of other
things even if you don't keep them as a
super computer forever you can use them
for all sorts of fun activities a lot of
people also use them for media centers
it's a really cheap media center and
it's also very easy to repurpose them
the operating system and pretty much
everything that defines what that pie
does for you is on an SD card so you can
have your supercomputer SD card media
center SD card robotics SD card etc you
just plug it in and you're ready to go
with that version so for now I'll just
show my setup for anybody that is
curious I have quite a few computers so
I wind up needing switches so it's just
like an Ethernet switch I bought this
little switch for $40 comes with five
ports one for the main connection to the
router or modem or whatever or another
switch that goes to the router or modem
and it's got four slots for four more
devices
it's pretty nice for $40.00 small in the
casing is all metal definitely a good
buy not an affiliate or anything just
happy with it next up is this case I
really like this case I used to all the
PI's I would buy before would come with
like this plastic case and I really like
the case but it doesn't stack so this
case is pretty much built perfectly like
the PI fits in there perfectly like you
can turn it on its side and stuff and
want like fall out like there's little
notches in the bars and you like slip
the corner of the pine of those notches
so it holds it in place real well so
it's never resting on its bottom or
anything like that yet it's open air so
it's really nice you can plug all your
peripheral
referrals into it and all of that and
you can keep stacking pies up you can
buy another you know two of these things
and stack them on top of each other so
real nice I will put links to this stuff
in the description just in case people
want it again not an affiliate just a
happy customer finally well a few things
one I would like to point out this is
purely for learning purposes for two
reasons one I'm not responsible for
anything you do to your pie if you mess
it up this is in the exploration of
education also your s berry pie does not
make a very good supercomputer node for
most tasks that supercomputers are used
for instead it just represents one of
the cheapest yet easiest ways to build a
supercomputer for extremely cheap you're
better off buying a nice motherboard
with like a 3-way SLI and stacking of
some epic GPUs getting like fifteen to
twenty teraflops for a total set-up cost
of like four thousand five thousand
dollars just for kicks to get twenty
teraflops you're gonna need to buy sixty
four thousand raspberry pies so there's
that lastly while the pie is I keep
saying lastly and finally guys I got
like a million of these anyways well the
pie is not the best option based on like
flops it should be noted that flops are
not really the sole determinant of a
computer's performance nor its value or
purpose right so there's a reason why a
cpu pushing 150g flops cost as much as a
GPU pushing three to four teraflops
there are different types of jobs in
questions so you can find new purposes
and purposes for the pie and also of
course a super computer pie so one
example would indeed actually be
robotics where you have a PI controlling
various parts of a robot which at its
core is a supercomputer responding to
environment variables so each PI allows
for eight default GPIO connections so
you can get pretty intense pretty quick
with a large amount of motors working
together as one giant system of
raspberry PI's this is really one
application of the Raspberry Pi
supercomputer that you really can't find
anywhere else you can't find like good
um ways to do this I mean the Arduino
maybe in the BeagleBone would probably
be a good one to but I mean these are
all like the same kind of like credit
card sized computers that have GPIO pins
right or just IO pins so I would say the
PI is likely one of the cheapest options
so far probably the BeagleBone is a
superior supercomputer but for robotics
I might even choose the PI more I don't
know I've never used the BeagleBone I
just know it specifications um so anyway
probably any combination of using
peripherals like so if you need
something that has USB it's powered by
USB or GPIO or any of that stuff this is
when the supercomputer made out of
raspberry PI's is going to be epic now
more on that later because we're
probably going to use our pies for
robotics after the super computer setup
and that's kind of why I wanted to do
supercomputers first because you can
have these PI's working together as one
robot yet um you can have like multiple
PI's right so you have to use the
supercomputing message passing interface
to do this so anyways one that later
just as a heads up that's my goal but
who knows I don't know if I'll figure
that out or not so hopefully this topic
is of interest to you all it allows me
to really bring a lot of the concepts of
my channel together at once plus it's
just really cool what you can do with
these technologies together and you can
build the cheapest supercomputer you'll
probably ever touch in your life or if
you've ever even seen a supercomputer
I've never even seen a supercomputer
until I built this one so anyway at
least not in person so that's why he
have looked forward to in the coming
videos as always thanks for watching
thanks for all the support the
subscriptions and until next time
my route my gosh you like
so it's a real cheap way to have a
mountain so so - raspberry PI's spirit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
