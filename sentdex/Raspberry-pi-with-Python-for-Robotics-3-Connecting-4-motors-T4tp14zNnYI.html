another Python robotics video hopefully
by now you guys have wired up all of
your motors if you haven't tix again
pause it wire them all up basically
you're wiring them up identically to how
you had wired up your first one where
since the wheel goes on this side black
on top right on bottom like that
so my wheels are still plugged in this
is the original one here and now we want
to just go ahead and plug in one more
wheel but I think at this point it would
be wise to go ahead and just plug
everything in and set it up on the frame
before we start doing much programming
that way we can kind of we can set up
the car on like a piece of either you
can use a book or cardboard box or
something and it just makes makes your
life a lot easier so that's what we're
going to do first so with my frame this
is my frame in this edge of the frame
basically looks like this and again this
was built for this specific purpose so
when you stick the car or you know the
motor through like this it's the wheels
or the axle it's going to fit through
the hole like this and it will hold in
place then you put two screws here in
here and that will actually hold the
motor in place depending on what you did
for your frame you might have to you
know I don't know use some glue or some
tape or something but for anybody who
bought the frame that's all you have to
do and then you stick the wheel on this
side so I can already do that and now my
wheel is in and now what you actually
have to do is we got to put screws
through it so actually we don't we're
going to take out the wheel so now what
we want to do is screw the motors in
place and actually this one already has
the wheel on it so I'm going to have to
take off that wheel and this motor is
already kind of plugged in but now what
we want to do is actually screw the
motors in so I'm going to do that and
then it will restart now for anybody
who's actually using the same frame as
me you're going to want to use these
longer screws or screws right here and
then you've got these little bolts and
you just stick the screw through here
and there's little holes on the motor so
you can actually do this
and that's where how you're going to
keep this motor in place again if you
had some other frame obviously you're
not doing this exact thing but that's
what you do if you bought this exact
frame so once you have your motors screw
it into your frame we still have this
one already you know plugged into our
h-bridge
and again just like like I was
mentioning before they're on the same
side
so you're going to plug them into the
same slots and you wouldn't stagger them
either because one wheel wants to turn
forwards and one wheel wants to turn
backwards so you're actually going to
plug them into the exact same slots
because you know intuition would tell
you if the motor was facing because I
guess you can't really see but here like
the motors are facing each other so if
they were pointing in the same direction
then you would stagger in the actual
h-bridge where they're plugged in right
we've got the positive lead and out to
the negative lead in that one but if you
put if you did the same if you did if
you thought you might flip that with
this one you'd be flipping it twice and
so these two motors will work against
each other so actually what we want to
do is we're going to plug the same like
the black this black lead of where the
other black lead went in this red lead
where the other red lead went because
we've already flipped everything over
and we flip the motor over so anyway
just pointing that out for you guys so
the next thing that we want to go ahead
and do is we wanna start screwing our
frame or the rest of our frame together
so for me
this frame came with a nice lovely
bottom piece that will screw right into
this one and screwing this one and then
we can kind of at least have our car
sitting up a little bit so that's what
I'm going to do and if you have the same
frame do that or if you have a real
frame fit your bottom to it now once you
finish putting the bottom on your frame
the next thing that we're going to want
to go ahead and do is wire in all of the
motors into the H bridge so to do that
you this is the side that's already kind
of wired in for us we've got one of our
motors that is already connected and
that would be this one so then this one
we need to connect so again you're going
to put the black into the same one so
like your black line should go in out
one and your red line should go into out
two now on this side we do need to
stagger the motor so on this side if
it's facing me right well we at least
will out one is right on the other side
of out four right so I'll one we've got
the black line but out four will
actually want to put the red lines so
they're kind of flip-flopped that way
forward is forward for everybody in more
verses reverse for everybody so now what
I'm going to go ahead and do is hook all
of these up and then I'll continue on
and I'll show you guys what we've got
once that's all complete now we'll just
mention since both leads are going into
the same spot it can be beneficial to
just take the two leads stick them
together and twist them together that
way they don't get like one isn't as
likely to come out when they're both
together they're just a little bit
bigger so that clamp holds them a little
bit better when they're twisted together
alright now once you've got everything
in be sure to give everything a good
good tug make sure you've got everything
in there good you don't want to rip it
out but give it a good tug to make sure
it's pretty secure in there now that we
have everything hooked up we don't
actually have our wheels in and you can
either make the decision to put the
wheels in now and then put this on like
a book or a box something that keeps the
wheels off the ground so it doesn't go
running off on you and ripping cords out
of the wall or something or you just you
can also just not put the wheels in
right because all we have right now are
sticking out is just the actual
basically
but to me it's a little harder to see
which way the axle is spinning as
opposed to if you've got wheels on there
you can tell with your eye much easier
when you put in some code hit enter and
you can see which way the wheel is
spinning now obviously if you just keep
the wheel spinning you know for a long
period of time you can see which way
they're spinning a lot easier but
generally if you're writing code and
you're trying to debug something you
don't want to have to wait 15 seconds
per wheel spin that you've test you just
want to kind of make it spin for a
second and then be done so that's that's
kind of how I see it but depending on
which way you feel obviously you can
just leave the wheels off but if you
happen to have just a box or something
just stick it on the box so everything
is wired up now so what now now what we
want to do is you can kind of just put
things back in here or you can continue
building your frames so if you have the
same frame I have you've got the edge
pieces that look like this so you can
put your edge pieces on there and just
kind of pile everything in there put the
walls on and put the wheels on and all
that you can leave the top off for now
so that's what I'm gonna do I'm going to
put the front and back on here screw
those in and then we'll can put the up
and put it on a box and then we'll start
hitting the code so we'll plug it at
plug everything in and go so let me go
ahead and get that done so I've got
everything together except for the top
on the frame that's okay I've got all my
wheels on good to roll back and forth so
that's good now we're going to need to
start working on the code we're going to
plug this thing in chances are unless
you've got the whole edimax thing an
external power supply you're going to
have to plug your layout your user net
into here and also a power supply in
there so you'll want to go ahead and do
that at towards the end is when I'll
cover the edimax
Wi-Fi stuff and you know how to get
Wi-Fi on the PI it's very simple though
if you don't want to follow along with
that you just stick it in and there's
like Wi-Fi support right on your desktop
just start X do Wi-Fi it's real simple
so anyways
now we want to do is go ahead and plug
in the pi not really going to show
myself doing that I'm going to give it
power give it Ethernet and then from
there everything will be or at least the
next step will be actually writing code
and then we'll test it so anyways I'm
going to cut off the video here and
continue on in the next video with that
as always thanks for watching thanks for
all the spoiler subscriptions and until
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
