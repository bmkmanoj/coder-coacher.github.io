part my Python 3 basics series in the
previous video I was showing you guys
how to install set up and begin to use
your Python installation in this video
what we're going to be talking about is
the print function so the print function
for the most part is kind of like either
it's mostly used just for debugging at
least the way I use it most of the time
I'm using it for debugging purposes to
kind of tell me where I am in the script
and then if you're maybe editing
variables or making changes along the
way you can print out the changes that
are made just so you you can you know
what's like happening under the hood so
it's definitely one of the most common
operations and most common functions
that you use within Python and it's
what's called a built-in function so you
actually you don't actually have to
import anything so there are some
functions that come with your
quote-unquote vanilla installation of
Python but some of them need to be
imported like time or math and all this
kind of stuff but print is used so
frequently that you actually never have
to import the print function at all in
Python 2 7 the print function was a
little bit different it didn't operate
like a function or at least the syntax
wasn't like a function but in 3 3 it's a
lot more like a function so let's go
ahead and get to it so an example of a
print function um or any function really
is you call the function name and then
in parentheses you put the functions
parameters well with print the what you
what print does is just outputs to
console whatever you put in there and so
you usually are going to print a string
but you don't have to print a string but
anyways um so let's just say this is an
example of print function okay so we can
save that and um typically in my
tutorials I do ctrl s to save and I hit
f5 to run you can also obviously go file
save as or run and run module or file
save really
um but anyway that's that so when like
stuff starts popping up when I say okay
I'm going to save and run it and you
didn't see my mouse do anything that's
why anyway so I'm gonna hit f5 it pops
up and you can see that it outputs this
is an example of print function so
pretty basic stuff really
so now let's pop back here and let's
talk about a couple of things real quick
because this is not only going to be the
print function but also just some string
rules and all that so when you put
something in between quotes its known
it's known where it's called but it's
known as a string having a very hard
time saying that and you can either use
single quotes or you can use double
quotes now there are advantages and
disadvantages to each but for the most
part you'll see me use single quotes but
if you use single quotes and you try to
do something like this and say let's say
we are going to the store that doesn't
work and if you actually try to run this
you would say you would see this invalid
syntax there are a couple ways around
this one you could encase everything in
double quotes then the singular quote
within that double quote will be fine so
if we save it this way we are going to
the store no problem um so the next
thing that I'll show you though is if
you really insisted on doing this what
if you did this even though this is a
bad example because it's not really what
we want but like he's like let's say
let's say instead you were saying this
is my OCD coming out Oh anyway hi oh my
goodness anyway save run it and if we
pull this up that worked right you saw
how that worked so it's like a different
even that's Oh like some people kind of
think like double quotes just are more
powerful so they can in case single
quotes but single quotes can in case
double quotes it really doesn't matter
but let's say you want to use single
quotes but then you also want to say we
are going to the store how would you do
that well you use what's called an
escape character which is the back slash
not to be confused with the forward
/ it's the backslash so typically it's
going to be right above your Enter key
or your return if you're using like a
super old computer that's not so so you
can do that and what it does is it's
called an escape character because
what's going to do is it's going to
escape any sort of functionality of that
character and just leave it as um it's
hard to say I'd have to revisit uh the
rules here but at least in Python in
Python 2 on my beginning I'm confused
but you've got like in Python 2 you have
um in Python 2 you have what's known as
Unicode and you've got like 8-bit
whereas in Python 3 you've got text and
just like data right and so they're like
the rules are kind of different but
basically you're just escaping the
functionality here of this so when we
run this you won't see that nasty little
backslash so let's just go ahead and run
it real quick um and you'll see that
yeah ok so we're going to the store and
we were able to get away with it with
single quotes so that's just a couple of
quick quick things so you can do that
but another thing that you can do is
what's called concatenation so what
that's going to mean is we're going to
put two strings together so we'll say hi
space there so when you use the plus
sign in concatenation it's going to put
them directly together so if you did
just hainan space you would see hi there
like jams together so you would add a
space and obviously that's going to fix
it let me pull this up a little bit um
the other thing the other way that you
can concatenate things is with a comma
and I'll and when you do that with a
comma it's going to add a space so we'll
run it again hi there now the next thing
that you can do is like I said in
originally is you don't have to have
strings you can have a number in there
or an integer so we'll run that and this
time Python gave us a high-five so you
can see that we're able to do that but
what if what if what if we had a plus
there are we gonna be able to do that
and is it going to take away our space I
don't know
oh so we actually have a problem it says
that we can't convert an INT object to a
string object because what it's trying
to do is um it's taking the string and
attempting when you use the plus to add
it to the five so conversely what if we
did five plus hi run that and now we can
see unsupported operand for the integer
because you can't add a string to an
integer so you'll see that I'm getting
all over the place um you'll see that
there are actually different errors that
are reported but it's pretty much for
the same reason you're trying to put two
things together that just don't mesh so
there's a couple of things that you can
do obviously you can use the comma or
you can use another built-in function
which would be something like this so if
you wanted to still you still want to
get your high five you want to add that
space but you really want a plus five
there you can use what's called a string
conversion here and that's another thing
that's built into Python you won't
actually have to import anything to do
that you can save it you can run it and
here we have high five by that same
token if this is say eight and you try
to do plus five it's still a string
right string eight but you can convert
that to say an int save run and now you
can see it actually printed out the
mathematical operation of eight plus
five now what if we did this eight point
five plus five and we run that you can
see that it gets angry at us because the
int eight point five is not an integer
so the other conversion since I'm
showing you guys conversions would be
float save that run that and that is
okay everything is hunky-dory Python is
not angry so um that should cover just
kind of like the basics of strings and
concatenation and combining it with
integers and floats and the conversions
when you need to do the conversion and
all that so another time when you might
need to use a conversion like this is if
you're reading from a data file
sometimes you might be reading that
stuff in as a string format same thing
if you read from like a website or
something like that a lot of times it's
going to come in natively as a string
and you'll you'll need to convert it out
of a string to an int or a float if it's
a number so anyway
that should do for kind of like an
introduction to this kind of stuff and
really the print function since that was
the main goal but really print and
strings and conversions and more on intz
and actually mathematical you know
actual mathematical operations because
like stuff like the plus sign is a
little bit has a quite a few uses same
thing with the minus sign so anyways
that's going to conclude this video as
