another Python 3 tutorial video if you
haven't noticed I am and any place just
got a new house but maybe more on that
later for now let's be talking about
Python 3 so um in this video we're going
to talk about input so if you're
familiar with Python 2 7 this is the
kind of counterpart to raw input and the
idea here is it in kind of simple GUI
programs text-based GUI your graphical
user interface programs sometimes you're
going to want to have some sort of input
from a user so this is going to allow us
to have the user be able to enter some
text based input and we can save it to a
variable so let's go ahead and show an
example of that so we're going to say X
equals input and then here you don't
have to but you can put some text to
kind of notify the user what you're
expecting here so for example let's say
what is your name
we'll make a space here otherwise what's
going to do is going to ask the question
and then the user can type right then in
there and so if you don't add a space at
the end or put the type you know right
next to that X square the question mark
look kind of weird so a lot of space
then after that we can do print and then
something like this hello comma X and
what this will do is print out hello
and then the name the user input so for
example we can go like this run this it
says what is your name my name is
Harrison pleased to meet you Harrison
and it says hello Harrison done simple
as that so real easy tutorial but a
pretty useful thing especially just to
get user input so if you have any
questions or comments I don't imagine
many of you would if you have any
questions or comments leave them below
as always thanks for watching thanks for
all the support and subscriptions and
until next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
