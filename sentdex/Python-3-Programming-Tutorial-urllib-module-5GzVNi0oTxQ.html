Python 3 tutorial video in this video
we're gonna be talking about is another
one of our standard library modules and
that's going to be URL Lib the idea of
URL live is it allows you to buy a
Python access the Internet so just like
the Internet it allows you to do all
sorts of amazing things URL Lib is going
to let you do all sorts of the same
amazing things only using Python in your
programming language so with that let's
go ahead and get started so there's only
a few I guess a few core things that you
need to do in order to connect and get
data from the internet but then there's
a slightly more advanced topics that we
do need to cover with URL Lib but we'll
get there it's luckily still fairly
simple modules so with that let's go
ahead and get started the first thing
that you're gonna have to do is you're
going to need to import URL Lib now if
you're coming from pythons u-7 you're
used to just needing to do import URL
Lib or import URL Lib - and that's it
whereas with Python 3 and onward you
actually have to do you're going to be
more so doing at least import URL Lib
dot request and when you do like URL
open for example you'll have to do URL
Lib die request dot URL open and so on
but anyway more on that and a little bit
so an example of visiting a web site
will be as follows so you let's say what
the final variable is X we'll say x
equals URL live dot request URL open and
then in these parameters is where we
specify the address that we want to
visit you always have to lead this with
HTTP or HTTPS so for example HTTP colon
slash slash and let's go to wwg I'll
calm okay and then so that what that's
going to do is going to make a request
to that URL okay and this is by default
it will be a get request so it's going
to get some data and that's it now what
we can do is we can say error let's do
print X dot reads so we're reading the
request so we can now
save and run this and this is our output
just a whole bunch of you know gobbly
gook text but this is basically the
source code of google comm so for
example we could open up a browser and
we could go you know to the top
google.com hit you and control you
rather and this is the source code right
so again it is just a bunch of junk here
right you get the idea that this is what
we've done is we've used Python to reach
this page okay so we can minimize that
let's go ahead and close out of that too
and naturally as time goes on we're
going to cover that very soon but when
you visit a URL you're going to need to
parse that page a little bit so you're
not as interested in the HTML as you are
in this like paragraph text for example
you're probably gonna only care about
paragraph text so we're gonna have to
show how to how to handle that and
actually how to handle that we'll be
using another standard library so have
no fear we'll be covering that very
shortly so the next thing I want to talk
about is post so for example if we were
to go to let's say we go back to where
we were and we do the following let's
say we want to go to Python programming
net and that's where we can get all of
our sample code if you're not familiar
but if we scroll down to the bottom
there's actually a search bar here we
could search and let's say we search for
basic ok and you get a bunch of search
results for the keyword basic but if you
look at our URL you see that we have
some extra stuff added to the end of our
Python programming net so what do we
have well we've got a question mark then
we've got a character s then we've got
the equal sign basic and then and we and
then an and sign and then submit an
equal sign and search so with a little
bit of deduction and reasoning we could
assume that submit is a variable and s
is a variable and they've been defined
as s equals base
sic and submit eagles search and that is
true so if you look at variables or at
least links that have variables in it
the first variable will have a question
mark and then the variable name equals
and then all subsequent variables are
going to have this little + sign in the
variable equals and it continues on like
that so that's this is an example of a
get request we're getting data based on
these well actually it's a post right
we're getting data based on these posted
variables so let's say we want to make a
post request now first of all you could
just get do a get to this URL right you
can just use a request and put in this
URL but the other thing that we can do
and the more you know pythonic thing
that we're supposed to do is go to
python program net add in these values
and do a post to Python programming net
so let's go ahead and show how that's
supposed to be done so here I'm just
going to comment this out because we
don't need to be printing that out every
time just wanted to show an example I'm
also going to comment this out because
otherwise it's just going to be visiting
every time and we don't need to do that
now we're going to import another thing
and that's going to be import URL Lib
dot parse and this is going to help us
parse values to our post requests so a
little bit different this one's going to
be a little bit longer to get data but
just bear with me so first we're going
to say URL and this is just going to be
what URL what's like the base URL that
we want to visit and the base URL again
always lead in with HTTP colon slash
slash we're Python programming dotnet
that's it then we're going to have a
dictionary and we're going to say this
dictionary is called values and then
empty parameters for now but very
quickly we're going to say s and that s
corresponds to basic and then comma and
then our next value is if you recall
submit and that submit was called search
so don't know if a closure not know we
didn't okay so our first thing so it's
basically keyword key and value like a
dictionary our keyword is the variable
and then this is the variables
definition basically so that's values
now what we do is we come down and we're
going to say data so this is going to be
data from the website equals URL Lib dot
parse dot URL and code and we want to
encode values so first we're just
encoding simply values and what URL
encode is going to do is this going to
encode it as it should be in the URL so
for example if we go back to where we've
been working and we go to like
google.com and we did a search for um
hey check that out okay you see that
it's hey plus check plus that plus out
you could also do the query is this hey
check that out at least usually it's not
fit there it goes okay and you can see
that it has changed now - hey percent
twenty check percent twenty that percent
- what was that
let's URL encoding percent twenty is a
the encode of space okay and then
obviously you would need to have URL
encoding for like a question mark and so
on so anyway back to what we were doing
and that's kind of why you want to do it
the official way rather than hard coding
because as soon as you introduce ant
signs or question marks python is not
going to necessarily know which you
meant so that's why you want to do it
the official way that we're doing right
now so first we encode values okay so
we've encoded values as the data that we
want to post in then what we want to do
is we're going to say now data equals
data encode and we want to encode this
as utf-8 this is just a type of encoding
okay so it basically puts your data in
bytes now the next thing we're going to
do is we're going to say rec for request
equals URL Lib dot request dot capital
regret request little bit talk what do
we want to request the URL and then data
so first the URL then any of the data
that we want to pass through and we've
encoded that data and we've encoded it
under utf-8 okay so we're going to
request now from this URL python program
at
going to pass the following variables s
equals basic submit equals search and
then after rec we're going to say
recessed for response equals URL Lib dot
request dot URL open rec ok so now we're
actually URL oppressed out URL open
we're actually visiting the URL now like
we did right up here so the syntax is
identical and really we just see that we
had to do all of this first so anyway
we've done that then we're going to say
RESP data equals RESP dot read and then
let's go ahead and print RESP data so
we're going to visit Python program net
we're going to pass through those
variables and then we're going to read
the results and again the results are
going to be like the source code of the
results so it's going to be a little
messy but hopefully we'll be able to
read a little bit here so we'll save and
run it apparently sometimes it takes a
second to like run there we go so it
visits it and then here is the messy
junk that we get pretty big mess I'm
hoping we can find something that's
actual tech yeah so here's some text
here you know a paragraph Python 3
basics tutorial if something do
something this tutorial is a part of the
Python 3 tutorial series for beginners
and so on so there is you know there's
some content there we're not quite sure
yet how to pull that content out but
nonetheless we did visit the website we
downloaded all the data so what your
browser does for you in what HTML does
is HTML basically tells your browser how
it should display data but that's really
it so your browser handles the HTML and
makes it pretty for you and it separates
tags from text and and organizes things
whereas with python python is just going
to look at the source you have no
organization here right so now um what
I'd like to have us do is change one
more thing and so here we're making a
request right so we've done a request so
we've done a get really this was a get
very simple just because it's
that's the default so we didn't have to
change anything and then we've made a
post and we've you know made that post
based on data that we've decided to set
but now we come to a problem that is
something that will you'll meet fairly
soon come across and that is whenever
you want to visit a website using Python
or any programming language sometimes
the website owners don't like that they
don't want you on their website with a
robot or a program or whatever they only
want real users on their website so they
will block you if they sense that you're
not a real user now likely for us this
is actually somewhat easy to fool basic
systems anyways there are some more
complex ones Google just recently made
another update and has made it slightly
more difficult to cheat their system but
still you can overcome these things
usually fairly easily it's almost like I
don't know some sort of filter right if
you're not good enough you can't use it
but if you're good enough I guess you
can you can use their services still
with your program um that said usually
websites that block your access they do
it because they offer an API and they
want you to use their API Google offers
an API so try to use Google's API before
you cheat Google try to use Wikipedia's
API before you start cheating Wikipedia
and just you know programming way around
it because the API is going to make it
easier on Wikipedia and it's going to
make it easier on you too because they
don't need to send all of the HTML data
they don't need to send serve
advertisements right because your
program isn't going to read it that kind
of stuff so you do have to kind of pay a
little bit of attention there as far as
if they have an API or not now moving
along now we're going to need to I guess
we'll show an example so for now I'm
just going to comment this stuff out so
we're not doing that over and over and
now I'm going to come down here and
first let's go and make a try and except
here we're going to say try x equals URL
Lib request URL open and URL we're going
to tent to open is HTTP colon slash
slash WWE google.com slash search
and then question marks so we're
defining a variable here we're going to
say Q equals test so Q stands for query
for Google so we're going to attempt to
visit this URL so this is a search
request for the string text so this is
as if you would went to Google you typed
in tests in the search bar you hit enter
so we're going to attempt to do that so
now that we've done that we'll come down
here and we'll say save file equals open
actually you know I don't want to do
this I am positive this will fail so now
instead what we'll do is we'll just do a
print X dot read that should be enough
and then we're going to come down here
and we're going to say accept exception
as E and then we're going to print
string e so what we're going to do here
again attempt to visit Google do a
search query then we're going to read
the results the source code of the
results and we're going to try to do
that otherwise we're going to throw the
exception as E and then we'll print the
string version of that exception so
let's go ahead and run that and just see
what happens to us so we run that and we
get HTTP error 403 forbidden
we're forbidden because Google says hey
you're a program and we're going to go
ahead and say no okay so if you happen
to find yourself in this situation
here's how you get around it
so we try to accept that we fail now
what can we do so let's make some more
space and now let's switch this up a
little bit we're going to do try and I
guess what
we use some of the same code up here but
we'll retype it so we're going to try
URL equals and we'll use the exact same
URL so I'm just going to say URL equals
this
so copy paste the URL now we're going to
go ahead and say headers equals an empty
dictionary and what headers our headers
are white basically what the data you
send in you send in a header every time
you visit a website and it contains
information on you who you are your IP
your browser your like operating system
all kinds of stuff sends it a bunch of
information on you and so within your
headers there is a data piece of data
that is called user agent so now that
we've got headers defined let's make
some more space and we'll say headers
and then square brackets to define a
piece of data in this dictionary and
we're in a college piece of data user
- agent so user agent is the type of
browser basically that you are using so
in our case what a Python does is it
says Python - URL Lib slash and then
your Python version so for me it would
be three point four so within almost an
instant when you visit a web site with
python using the methods that we've
shown so far that website knows exactly
where you are
they know you're a program so it's very
easy for them to shut you down because
you send in you basically say hello
knock knock my name is Python right and
and they and then their servers say hell
no and they shut you out so now what we
want to do is we're going to say user
agent and the user agent that we're
going to use is a little long I don't
want to have to type it out so I'm going
to go ahead and just copy and paste it
like this and I'll just put a link to it
in the description if I happen to forget
someone remind me but hopefully I want
so paste and we get this long user agent
here you can't even really see it all in
my window but this is it
okay so super long user agent basically
this tells well this acts like we're
using mozilla and then it gives all this
other information and all this
compatibility stuff
and so basically just say it just
changes that we're no longer are we
announcing ourselves as pipe
that I have no idea where I left off
I'll just kind of start at this point
here turns out my dog knows how to open
a sliding glass door so he was running
around in here when he shouldn't have
been that was very surprising anyway
yeah okay so here we're just we're
replacing our user agent and so in an
attempt to fool Google so we'll see if
we can so there's our user agent now
we're going to do basically the same
thing we did before and we're going to
say ret equals URL live dot request dot
capital request and then we're going to
make the request to the URL and then
we're going to go ahead and remember
before always at data well we're not
going to pass through any data here
because we're like hard coding it in
right under normal circumstances you
would maybe say like if we're making a
post request we could do that and then
we would add in the whole search data or
the values and make the post button so
we're just going to hard code this for
now feel free to mix them on your own
time homework assignment URL and then
we're going to say headers equals
headers okay so we're telling a Python
now to visit this URL and instead of
setting our normal headers the default
parameter headers we're going to change
these up and call the headers this now
in my opinion it just kind of makes a
little bit of sense to eventually go
into URL Lib dot request dot request
that's a function and in that function
has function parameters and they define
a default value for headers why not just
go in there edit the URL Lib function
there and make this your default header
just a thought for some of you guys
anyway moving right along so now we've
defined what the request is now we're
gonna say response equals URL Lib dot
request URL open and you are we want to
open basically is request with the
following thing as our headers
so that's our response now we're going
to say RESP data equals rescue need and
now the amount of data here is actually
kind of big right because it's a whole
search result page and all the HTML that
goes with it it's very big and bulky and
so if we run this right now and we were
just to print it out to console it would
lag the console fairly well so we don't
want to do that so instead what we'll do
is we're going to call we're going to
say save file equals open and we're
going to call this file with headers dot
text we're going to open it with the
intention to write we want to say save
file dot write and then we're going to
write we have to write the string
version of rest data because right now
the response data isn't in string format
so that's also kind of new ish if you're
coming from Python to seven and then of
course we need to do save file dot close
now the other thing we have not done is
we did a try and we have no accept yet
so we're going to say accept exception
as E and then we're going to go ahead
and print string e just in case we throw
an exception hopefully we don't if
unless I've screwed up or something
we shouldn't then we're going to come
over here this is where that file will
go is it'll just go right over here and
we should be ready to run this so let's
go ahead and save and run that and the
first one will throw I can't remember
okay so the first one throws the
forbidden yeah so we're still trying
this but the second one worked because
we didn't see a four-bit end we come
over here here it is with headers we can
open it with notepad plus plus and
here's all of our data so obviously it's
a bunch of junk you know but this is all
search results there were some images
there eventually we could maybe get to
some some sort of text or something but
anyway it's it this is a huge mess
Google results are pretty messy but
anyway we were able to get by Google's a
little filter for for just anybody right
so but if you if anybody had just read
the documents you'd find out how easy it
is to change your headers but a lot of
people don't read documents so I guess
that's that's why so
that's going to conclude the basics of
URL Lib now again the data where we're
fed back is just this huge mess of data
like what do we even do with all this
data so then you have to kind of parse
through the data so the next thing we're
going to need to learn is regular
expressions to actually parse through
this data and our regular expressions
are kind of scary to people sometimes
mostly because it's its own programming
language entirely so everything you know
about Python up till now doesn't mean
anything for when it comes to regular
expressions but luckily regular
expressions being their own programming
language basically are transferable
pretty much anywhere you go the rules of
regular expressions will remain so once
you understand the logic of regular
expressions you can take it to any
language it's a lot like SQL right if
you learn SQL or as the cool kids say
it's sequel it's it's its own
programming language and you can take it
anywhere to any other programming
language and work with sequel or SQL
whatever you want to call it so anyway
getting a little ahead of ourselves but
you must want to say that we're going to
be covering regular expressions very
soon and then after we cover it will
mesh regular expressions with URL Lib so
a lot like your basic programs are just
a combination of very complex programs
rather are just a combination of very
basic tools even some of these really
complex tasks are a lot of times just
the combination or really basic modules
and tools that you already have maybe
not if statements and all that but you
know you are lid plus regular
expressions equals a pretty darn good
website parser already you could also
use something like beautiful soup but if
you look into beautiful soup most of
what beautiful soup is is URL Lib and
regular expressions so anyway that's
going to conclude this video if you guys
have any questions or comments about you
are a lip please feel free to leave them
below if you guys have any requests
about more information on URL live or
some of the other built inside packages
or even third-party modules that you
want me to cover film in the series
right now so if you happen to do it you
know fairly recently to when this video
is posted I'll probably able to include
it in this series so anyway that's it as
always thanks for watching thanks for
all the support and subscriptions and
until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
