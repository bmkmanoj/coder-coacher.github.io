mathematics in stock indicators tutorial
video this video we're going to be
discussing center of gravity but
actually the indicator center of gravity
now if you look up the formula for this
you're gonna get something pretty
similar to this although this one's
actually incorrect because it doesn't
have the negative sign in front of it
you are supposed to get a negative sign
there so you reverse or you kind of flip
the chart itself and I'll show you what
I mean by that in a minute so the center
of gravity indicator originates from
this article by John F Ehlers and the
idea of it is to exhibit really no lag
at all and that's kind of what it's
known for is it's an indicator that
really has no lag now this is the
calculation it's hopefully a little bit
easier to understand but then if you
still don't get it when we go to program
it I think it'll be really quite simple
so the calculation is you know the idea
of it is really I would ignore this part
and just like it's N times price or n
times price n right and so generally you
might have 10 days or something like
that is usually what you're going to use
so if it's 10 days and n is 10 then it's
10 times price number 10 right and 10
being 10 days ago not you know yesterday
or whatever so then with that you would
do 1 through 10 just like that and then
you divide it by the price in that again
so and then don't forget the the
negation of the entire thing so it
actually works out the way that we want
it to so with that let's go ahead and
see some examples of what happens when
you chart this so let me go ahead and
pull it the first one we can look at
we'll look at eBay and so here's an
example of center of gravity for eBay
it's on the bottom indicator there right
here and so as you can see there's very
little to no lag at all and if anything
it's actually a leading indicator in
many instances here so
good example of when it's actually a
leading indicator would be right here
where I mean it hits the absolute bottom
possibly here you would think but
actually the real absolute bottom is
here but it's already begun moving up as
far as the center of gravity was
concerned and sure enough it is and then
you can see just every time it comes
down I mean this has it just boom like
right right on so it's actually pretty
cool I mean obviously there's gonna be
times where it's not as that perfect
amount of time where there's a lot of
fluctuations that I can show that like
here for it would be an example where
it's like this is it saying the peak is
here and then it starts going down but
that's missing it so it went up but for
any of these like long rides you know
this one was a really good one this one
here was also where it said the peak or
the bottom was here you know and it goes
up so kind of an interesting indicator
it's a lot like you'll see that it
follows the RSI pretty well but where
the RSI says hey this is like where the
RSI says hey if it gets below 30 that's
oversold the center of gravity is
telling you know that's like we're the
where it wants to be right now and then
when it starts coming up then then
you're interested you know so they knew
tete there they are different for sure
but you'll see that they follow very
similar paths quite often so it would be
a good it's kind of a good combination
to use with RSI in my opinion because
when they are following the same path
you could ignore it and then when
they're not then you might want to
listen to the RSI at least so with that
that's the center of gravity indicator a
lot of times you'll see it with the
bands and we might end up doing one with
the bands on the price eventually but
for now like this is the official one
you there's also like you know center
gravity bands that you can put but
really that's mostly kind of like a
combination of the center of gravity
plus Bollinger Bands like the same kind
of theory going into those so we can
eventually do that we have done
Bollinger Bands and you could do you
just apply Bollinger Bands to this and
then you normalize it by putting it on
here usually like a percent change
do it and there's also a couple other
ways that you can do it like with
logarithm and stuff but anyway we might
get to that eventually but this is just
the simple center of gravity so with
that in the next video what we're going
to be talking about is actually how to
program that within Python and then in
the next video we'll actually chart it
up just like this and you guys can play
with it yourself so as always thanks for
watching thanks for the support in
subscriptions and until the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
