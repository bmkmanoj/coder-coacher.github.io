3 basics video in this video we're going
to be covering the basics of writing to
a file it should be noted that there are
two methods for saving data to a file
and those are writing and appending
writing to a file will write that bit of
data whatever it is solely to that file
so that means if there was anything
there before it's going to be gone if
you use write if you use a pend
then you will basically add to whatever
is previously there so I'm going to be
showing both methods but first in this
video we're going to be covering the
right so first we need something that
we're actually going to write and so for
that we're going to say text and text is
going to equal to sample text to save
and then we're going to have backslash n
for a new line and then after that we're
going to have a new one good enough now
what we want to do is specify the save
file and when you do that you specify
basically what you're doing is your save
file equals open so you're actually
opening the file and in here and open
open is a function and we have
parameters to fill and the first
parameter is what are we opening so
we're actually opening example file dot
txt if it doesn't exist already it will
be created and then the next parameter
is our intention why do we want to open
it to read write or append in our case
we want to write and that's denoted with
a W and that's all that we need so what
we're doing here is we're basically
notifying Python of our intentions we're
going to open this file and our
intention is to write to it so as soon
as this is called that file is opened
and if anything was there before it's
not there anymore it's basically opened
and cleared with write anyways now we
want to do is actually write to the file
so that's going to be save file dot
write and what do we want to write to
this file well we want to write text
after that the next thing that we want
to do is save file dot close it's really
important to remember to close it
otherwise it will hang open for a while
and it could cause problems with your
script but otherwise it's just going to
be a big nuisance because you won't be
able to really further save any data
basically so either you or your script
is going to start having some trouble so
yeah so you always want to close so how
we can do is we can save and run that
and when it's all done we can open up
where we've been coding here and if we
open that file here here's our file
sample.txt to save new line there's our
file so everything is done it'll be the
file will be in the same directory as
your script since we didn't specify any
sort of file path to it you can also
specify a file path and you can do
things like this
and that'll go like to directories in
front of your scripts file path or you
can specify the entire file path like C
colon slash and do it that way so
anyways that's going to include writing
to a file in the next video what we're
going to be doing is appending to a file
so stay tuned for that as always thanks
for watching things for all the support
subscriptions and until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
