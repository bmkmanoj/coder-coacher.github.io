mathematics and stock indicators
tutorial in this video we're gonna be
talking about Bollinger Bands what are
they how to calculate and by hand
the next video will be talking about how
to program them into Python and the
video after that we'll be graphing them
using that plot live in our previous
charting application that we built
so Bollinger Bands what are they they're
created by John Bollinger and there are
registered trademark to him so anytime
you you know say Bollinger Bands or
really right Bollinger Bands
you've got to like give him his walk so
there's that volatility measurements
basically what Bollinger Bands are just
it's a simple moving average and on
either side you've got volatility
measurements so on the top side you've
got a volatility and on the bottom side
you've got a volatility so because of
their simplicity they can really be used
with stocks Forex options futures
whatever and actually Bollinger Bands
can be used with any datum line right so
any data line that you're gonna put a
simple moving average on till I smooth
it out and you want to know like how
volatile is it you know kind of what the
purpose of standard deviation even if
you want to know that then you can use
Bollinger Bands so it doesn't even have
to be stock anything it doesn't have to
even have a price but notably pretty
much everybody uses Bollinger Bands with
stocks so the calculation of Bollinger
Bands pretty simple there's three bands
total to calculate here in our equations
we use one variable of TF that's just
time frame and the other one is X and X
is just you just make it up so the
middle band is just a simple moving
average of price with whatever time
frame you've chosen the top band is that
simple moving average plus the standard
deviation of price for that time period
multiplied by X again X is just whatever
you choose usually it's going to be a 2
we'll get back to that and the bottom
band is again that simple moving average
minus the standard deviation of price in
that time period again multiplied by X
now typically timeframe is going to vary
a lot more generally it's somewhere
around 20x I've never seen it be
anything but - but you could do you know
a higher number especially for some
stocks that are
not there maybe volatile but they're
volatile in one direction right so
they're either going constantly like
going up or they're constantly going
down you're gonna find that your
Bollinger Bands are kind of not working
out for you so you might want to use a
higher number but generally 20 into
John's go ahead and show some examples
real quick of these Bollinger Bands let
me bring up the application here so
we'll show what the EBA so here's an
example of eBay and their Bollinger
Bands the Bollinger Bands are what we're
seeing right here right these three
lines around price typically they're
gonna be plotted right on there so you
can visually see the volatility there so
as you can see for the most part price I
mean eBay is a fairly volatile one
especially that coming up here but this
year you can even see how well it's
actually encapsulated the volatility
there so so you can see you know the
volatility like every pretty much all
the time you know price is contained
within these you know the Bollinger
Bands right so let's look at another one
real quick try to think of another good
one to do let's do we're gonna do
Starbucks yeah so Starbucks as you know
or may not know but Starbucks has been
kind of rising in price for a while now
on a pretty consistent scale so so you
can see how much thinner the Bollinger
Bands are for for Starbucks right and so
also it's the price is and pretty much
every time it's rising or falling well
at least here it was it was contained
pretty well but especially like right
here I mean we've been outside that that
range for a while now another good one
that shows you even more pronounced will
be like Apple because again we're on it
a 10-year time scale here so let's bring
up Apple and you can see that pans are
so close that it pretty much just looks
like a 20 simple moving average that's
pretty much what it is but if we did
zoom in enough you would see that it's
actually three bars or three lines
rather so yeah anyway so those are
Bollinger Bands and again
like Apple if you wanted to fix that you
would change your multiplier most likely
and that would do it for you so many
ways that's Bollinger Bands that's how
to calculate them by hand and in the
next video what we're gonna be doing is
actually programming it into Python and
then we'll actually plot it up so you
guys can plot up what we were just
looking at so as always thanks for
watching thanks for the support and
subscriptions and until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
