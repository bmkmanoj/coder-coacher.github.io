thought it was gonna take like an hour
no that took like seven hours or take a
really long time cursed the
single-threaded
nature of python coming over here just
in case at least so I forgot already
anyways so for everybody watching this
video it was probably back-to-back so I
guess you guys are not forgetting but
starting funds we said was a hundred
thousand wager size is a hundred so
we're trading with basically yeah a one
thousandth of our total purse size so
that's pretty small but again like I
said I believe the the best amount to
trade with would be like one over like
1.6 me like 11.6 million so you'd want
to like show up to the conceit Oh Casino
with 1.6 million and be prepared to play
I don't know like a million million
waiters so this certainly is not a
get-rich-quick scheme by any by any
means but it is profitable and at least
you can kind of have fun gambling with
fairly good chances or fairly good odds
if you're wagering a small enough
portion of your entire fund so anyways
we had a hundred thousand wager sighs
mmm of 100 and the thing that took the
absolute longest is we allowed for up to
a hundred thousand wagers so before we
were allowing for a hundred wagers or a
thousand wagers and the problem here is
as you make more money it becomes harder
and harder to go broke so long as you're
making more money and you've won enough
in a row to where your bet is at least
somewhat low so you know you might make
a lot of money but your current waiter
size might be you know you started at a
hundred but your wager size is five
thousand okay
but once you work your way back down to
a you know a wager size of somewhere in
the hundreds again you've kind of all
locked in your profits so to speak after
you
made so many wins in a row that you got
back down to a waiter size in the
hundreds so it would be wise to continue
playing but we needed to set some limit
on wager count otherwise over a long
period of time and we wouldn't either go
broke or it would never stop let's go we
had to put a limit on wager count but I
wanted it to be large enough to run
through a lot of options so we said a
hundred thousand scrolling down trying
to see how many did we set right so we
let 1 million people sample this so we
tried this across a sample size of a
million different betters with different
odds and all of that and anyway at the
end of the day we see they ignore this
if you were from the last video I
believe this was just something we ran
in the last video so that's just here I
was expecting to take a lot less time
than it did otherwise I would have
gotten rid of that too but anyway this
is our actual result from those settings
so from allowing up to 100,000 wagers to
take place a million different betters
and one one thousandth of a bet size we
can see that even though that's the case
our bust rate is still pretty high
that's ninety seven point five eight
percent people go bust and only two
point four percent of the people make a
profit all those people that make a
profit this is how much profit we made
but as you can see it's actually not
that great of a of a profit so like this
is gosh I don't even know what this
number is but the difference is 8 6 5
see if I can break this down right the
difference here is 865,000 and so this
is 865,000 this is I'm sorry this is
this is 865 million and this is soo good
so this is 100 billion and this is 865
million so we're approaching almost a 1
percent profit now again though this
just kind of brings home the point that
okay we approached a literally a 1%
profit that's definitely not exciting at
all most of the time people go to gamble
for you know some excitement so yeah so
anyway I just wanted to show you guys
these odds when we wrap up I'll kind of
talk a little bit more about my thoughts
on all these gambling strategies and
stuff but it's moving back towards you
toriel here even though we found you
know these numbers here we did this
strategy and at the end of the day we
still we just kind of arbitrarily picked
the wager size starting funds and wager
count right we just kind of randomly
picked that stuff and as I said in the
beginning the wager size and starting
funds are going to be tied to each other
because really what this boils down to
is a percentage of your purse so there's
no reason to very like to make both of
these a random variable at least I don't
I don't foresee any reason if you happen
to think of why that would matter feel
free to comment below but as far as my
logic and reasoning goes there's no
point because we're really looking for a
percentage size of your full trade
amount plus the wager count that you
would maybe want to go through with so
it might be wise to only play this
strategy over a hundred wagers and then
restart again stuff like that so what I
want to do now is allow for some of
these things to actually change and we
want to make these kind of variable so
what we're gonna do is we're gonna
utilize the Monte Carlo simulator to
simulate the outcome of just changing up
these variables randomly kind of like we
did with the random multiplier and so
we're gonna do that and see if we can
come up with any other variables that
are superior to the ones that we've been
trading and this will be kind of even
though we did it once with a Monte Carlo
generator we actually I mean like we got
our results and it was like 1.7 I think
was the best multiple but that was only
one variable and so that's not as
impressive as coming up with say two
variables or three variables so what I
want to do is just kind of show you guys
how you might at least do multiple
variables and then we'll even do maybe a
third variable and then finally at the
end of the day all this is nice when you
print out numbers but everybody wants to
look at a pretty chart and so I'm going
to show you guys at least with two
variables and we'll probably do a
three-dimensional charting as well of
what our Monte Carlo simulator shows us
and gives us out of our data so that'll
be lots of fun so anyways this video no
new coding just the results here and
what we plan to do in the next video so
anyways as always thanks for watching
thanks for all the support in the
subscriptions and until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
