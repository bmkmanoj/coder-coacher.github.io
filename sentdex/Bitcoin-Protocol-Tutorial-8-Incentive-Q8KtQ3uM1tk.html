protocol explained tutorial video this
video is going to be covering incentive
so what is the incentive to support and
work with the network as well as what's
the incentive say you have a lot of
computing power to overpower the network
what's the incentive of either working
with the network or overpowering the
network so let's go ahead and get
started with the paper by convention the
first transaction in a block is a
special transaction that starts a new
coin owned by the creator of that block
this adds an incentive for notes to
support the network and provides a way
to initially distribute coins into
circulation since there is no central
authority to issue them the steady
addition of a constant amount of new
coins is analogous to gold miners
expending resources to add gold into
circulation in our case it's CPU time
and electricity that is expended so here
initially it's explained that the
incentive to be a part of the network is
to acquire coins as a reward so this is
also the chosen method for coin
distribution in the network and is
compared to people you know using
resources - like mine something like
gold the main cost obviously here is
going to be CPU time and electricity so
how much electricity have to pay for so
then the question is well what happens
in the year 2140 so in 21:40 all of the
coins will be mined for Bitcoin and so
no coins will be awarded at this point
for actually supporting the network what
if we don't even reach 21:40 before the
amount of miners you know in the network
slows down well continuing on in the
paper the incentive can also be funded
with transaction fees if the output
value of a transaction is less than its
input value the difference is a
transaction fee that is added to the
incentive value of the block containing
the transaction once a predetermined
number of coins have entered circulation
the incentive can transition entirely to
transaction fees and be completely
inflation free so the idea here is to
move to eventually move to a peer
transactional cost system despite this
sending a lot like you know like the
current system were in where we've got
you know two people that want to
transfer money we've got a middleman
that we've got
hey it isn't quite the same this is
still very much peer-to-peer and the
transactional cost would really be a
flat fee so first of all your money
isn't necessarily it's not gonna filter
through a third party so to speak it's
still going peer-to-peer but you still
need that middleman that kind of like be
like almost a notary to say hey yeah
these are the two real people this is a
real transaction taking place also the
transactional cost would most likely be
a flat fee you wouldn't pay like a
percentage on the you know transaction
amount it would be a flat fee so really
you know with Bitcoin we're talking
probably one to three dollars to make a
transfer at most so right now
competition for mining and all this is
extremely high for people to acquire
coins but when coins are no longer being
distributed or if they begin to lose
value the actual hash you know
difficulty is gonna drop and so it would
simply just become easier so whether or
not you have five hundred thousand
miners or fifty thousand miners you're
gonna notice relatively similar results
when it comes to transaction speed and
all of that the only threat here is that
if the number of miners was to actually
drop someone could more easily come in
and execute a 51% attack at which point
the question is would it still not be
worth attacking the network and we will
hit this question again in the moment
but for now let's go ahead and return to
the paper the incentive may help
encourage nodes to stay honest if a
greedy attacker is able to assemble more
CPU power than all the honest knowns he
would have to choose between using it to
defraud people by stealing back his
payments or using it to generate new
coins he ought to find it more
profitable to play by the rules such
rules that favor him with more new coins
than everyone else combined than to
undermine the system and validity of his
own wealth
so here's Express why 51% attack even if
someone had the resources doesn't really
make that much sense there's more
incentive financially to actually work
with the network and if the incentive
was just like playing malicious to like
kill the network or something then this
would prove to be pretty costly endeavor
so neither of those options are really
good options now again this is where the
question is asked whether or not the
network will still be as secure it as it
is today by 21:40 and secure as in a
relative to you know the days of mining
power see here I think if there's a
little less certainty about security as
mining will be more about transaction
fees rather than actually acquiring
coins now keep in mind that every 10
minutes 25 Bitcoin is released right now
that's worth $20,000 right every 10
minutes so to match today's level of
security or better put to to match
today's challenge and reward in relation
to CPU power of the day you'd need
$20,000 every 10 minutes worth of
transaction rewards or transaction fees
so 120,000 dollars an hour 2.9 million
dollars a day or just over 1 billion
dollars a year in transactional cost you
know fees basically now obviously this
is measured of course in today's terms
as well since inflation will probably
make these numbers way bigger and to be
at the same level of security so you
know as the average computer gets faster
I mean this is all relative since
breaching or working for the network
it's all going to be in relation to that
day's current CPU standard you know now
that said really by 21:40 so we're
talking over you know its century okay
it's highly likely first of all that
there will one be a quantum computer
it's really really unlikely that Bitcoin
as we know it today will still be
trucking along by then we're talking
over a century from the point of its
development so first off who even knows
like we it's also highly likely we'll
have like killed each other by then but
also I don't know any technology that
hasn't you know had to be evolved within
a centuries time I mean if you just look
at you know sha-1 vs shot 256 we already
know that there are there's security
differences between the two of them and
that's just based on the cpu growth over
time now I do think that all that said
it's something to consider at least
though you know that you know consider
by 21:40 the question of secure
but I honestly think at least my
argument is that there's no point in
thinking that far out - 2140 as by them
the game is going to have changed
significantly and we'll all be trading
like quantum acquaintance or something
like that so also I will just there'll
be another video pretty much dedicated
towards this specific thing as far as
how Bitcoin will evolve or can Bitcoin
evolve over time I'll give you guys a
hint yes and and actually it can evolve
within the system of Bitcoin itself
because Bitcoin is really one big voting
scheme it's really one big CP one CPU
one vote structure and so really
anything can occur within the realm of
one CPU one vote here so Bitcoin can't
evolve and I pretty much guarantee it
that it will evolve by 21:40 I'll bet my
whole bank account because by then I'll
be dead anyways and so will everyone
watching this but anyway that's going to
conclude the incentive tutorial video
basically the takeaway here is that
there's at least right now a large
incentive to mine as we already know the
difficulty of mining is systemic and it
changes based on the amount of miners
mining so it's always going to be the
case at least until 21:40 that it's
gonna make fiscal sense more fiscal
sense to mine for the network than to
attack the network especially because if
you attack the network you're gonna like
first of all it's gonna be very costly
and versus if you work for the network
we're talking you know if you let's say
you had over 50% of the network well
that means every ten minutes you're
going to get a 50/50 chance of getting
those coins so we're talking every ten
minutes well every hour you would make
60,000 dollars every hour you know with
50/50 odds so I would think that it
would be in your favor to go ahead and
work for the network so so that's it if
you have any questions or comments feel
free to leave them below as always
