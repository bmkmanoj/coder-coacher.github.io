tutorial video this video is going to be
covering tkinter and actually it's going
to be the first part of a five-part
miniseries around tkinter what Sikh
hinter is is it's part of your standard
library and Python and it's going to
work with TK which is going to
subsequently work with TCL TCL is what
we use to make windows and we have a
little bit of a wrapper so basically
what we have here is we've got tkinter
which is a wrapper around TK which is
kind of like a wrapper around TCL for
making windows and what's going to allow
us to do is kind of it's almost like a
high-level a wrapper so to speak so
within about 10 or so lines we can
create a window it's a very basic window
but we can create a window and this
window can be resized it can be
minimized maximized and it most
importantly it can be closed and this
actually involves a lot of code and a
lot of logic that we won't have to worry
about actually coding ourselves
thankfully it's with that let's go ahead
and get started now so um with what
you'll find is most people I think um at
least myself are gonna go from tkinter
import asterisk so this means import
everything from seek enters so aside
from like super basic Windows or
something your typical you know fully
functional GUI or graphical user
interface when I say GUI it stands for
GUI graphical user interface case you
know um your typical windows going to
use a lot of different functions from
seek enter and so it just makes a whole
lot of sense just import everything to
me anyway if you want you can import
individual things do what you want
anyway
Sintra so now we want to do is we want
to make our window class now I know
classes confuse a lot of people you've
got self parent master all this stuff I
understand that and that gets confusing
but just bear with me now so self
usually just something so if just
corresponds to really you're basically
um when you pass an object through
whatever you know your class you call
it's you say self and then you say you
know the parameters and all that you
don't really have to call it self self
either you can call it anything you
wanted you could call it
but Jumba and this would be totally fine
it would be really confusing to people
but that would be totally fine it's just
kind of like a expected that you use the
word self but you don't have to so
anyway I'm moving along so we're going
to say class capital window and then
through window we're gonna pass through
frame now frame is not something I've
just made up we're actually passing
through the frame within tkinter so I
figure I guess I might as well show you
guys so if we go to computer C 34 Lib
and we come down to tkinter and we're
going to open up our initialization
script here so edit that and we will do
a control F so we're going to find and
then just type frame the hit and then
we'll go find net 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
11 12 13 14 there we go
I guess after 14 we finally found what
we're looking for so looking for this
the class frame and then widget and so
this is what we're referring to when you
type frame in there so I'm going to move
this out so this is basically saying
we're gonna we're creating our window
and with that window we're making a
frame and so the frame is really what
you think of as a window you have a
frame and then you have got you've got
like contents within it but programming
ly we call that a frame not really a
window so anyway now what we're going to
do is we're going to define our
initialization so define underscore
underscore init underscore underscore
and then through the parameters again
we're going to use self I know it's
crazy but we're going to use self and
basically were going to say for now
master equals none so there now uhm
basically what we want to do is what
parameters we want to pass through a
frame class and what we've basically set
here is this is our parent widget so
this is our main window and then we will
put more stuff within that window so now
we're going to say is we're going to say
frame dot underscore underscore knit
underscore underscore and then self
again khabib ajooba
master so again we're just referencing
this initialization here okay and
already I suppose actually didn't even
have to do master equals non sets by
default so in theory we actually could
probably get away with yourself just in
itself anyway so that's our default
which makes sense but anyway moving
alone
so after we've did we've done our
defined initialization then frame and
then we're actually going to say self
dot master equals master so this is our
main a window so this is just basically
we're calling this the master widget
okay and that's going to be our main
frame okay main frame
I correct myself okay so then what we
want to do is you know we can do all
kinds of other things but well I think
I'd like to do now is what we're going
to do is we're going to say root equals
TK actually TK like that when this one
we actually do capitalize the T and
that's actually something that we're
we're importing basically from tkinter
just like we imported frame from tkinter
so this is what it's doing is if we're
calling this a root window and again we
could open up where I was I here
I don't think it want to be in it hold
on let's see if we can find it in here
define okay
okay well you'll have to take my word
for it it's in here anyway so that's a
root window basically and then what
we're going to say is our app for
application equals window referencing
our window class and then within that
our frame is going to be our root and
then finally we're going to say root dot
main loop and this basically initializes
and generates our window for us so let's
go ahead and save and run that and boom
we have ourselves a nice little TK
window so as I said we can resize the
window we can minimize the window we can
bring it back we can maximize the window
and it just and we can move it around
all that and we can close the window so
we can do all these things with very few
lines of code I said 10 initially we got
one two three four five six seven eight
lines that we were able to basically
create this window within eight lines
now naturally that's not really the case
because we used quite a few lines from
tkinter but that's the whole idea of
using tkinter is that it saves you from
writing you know hundreds of lines just
for that basic window just pop-up uh-huh
and really I suppose you could break it
down it's probably more like thousands
of lines but anyway if we go right down
to machine code um anyway so that's just
a basic window novice there's a lot of
things we can do with windows we need
you know buttons we can do text you know
right so if I scroll this thing down you
know we've got title of the window we've
got some menu options buttons all this
kind of stuff so that obviously a lot of
things we might want to add to this so
anyway so this is just a basic window in
the next video what we're doing is kind
of adding on to this window a little bit
so stay tuned for that if you guys have
any questions or comments up to this
point feel free to leave them below as
always thanks for watching thanks for
all this for the subscriptions and until
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
