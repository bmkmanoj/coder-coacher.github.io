new section on the machine learning with
Python tutorial series this section
we're going to be talking about
classification and a handful of methods
for a classification so as we dive in
the first classification algorithm that
we're going to be covering is K nearest
neighbors and but really all
classification algorithms boil down to
the same thing so if you recall with
linear regression the objective was to
create a model that best fits our data
and with classification the general
purpose is to create a model that best
divides or separates our data so let's
go ahead and show a quick example so
let's say you've got a graph and then on
that graph you've got some data points
like these and the objective is to
figure out how to separate these into
obvious groups and even just looking at
this intuitively you could see that
there are two groups here one group is
this group and one group is this group
right you just know that's the case so
what we just did just now is actually a
clustering right like with our mind
there when we were just looking at this
and we decided that these were two
groups we actually did clustering
classification is actually even more
simple than what we just did here so
what what classification is going to do
is the following
so with classification you're going to
have a data set that looks more like
this where you've got a group that you
know are pluses and a group that you
know are minuses and the objective is to
create some sort of model that fits both
of these groups right that that properly
divides them so almost like some sort of
model that defines the pluses and some
sort of model that defines the minuses
so what if you had an unknown
dot somewhere right like what if you
have a data point that's like here
looking at that just visually which
group would you assign that to would you
put it with the - the blue minuses or
the green pluses most likely you would
put it with the Green Green pluses and
then I ask you why why would you have
done that right like what what made you
think that that was the case so think
about that and then what if we had a
point over here where would you assign
that point well in this case most likely
the blue minuses and again think about
why might you choose that and then
finally what if we had a point maybe
right here in the middle almost now how
would you classify that and it turns out
the way that you would classify that
might actually vary depending on the
algorithm that you're using but in most
cases I think that if you have a dot
like like this one you're going to
classify that based on proximity to the
other points I think most people in
looking at a graph like this would go
based on proximity than anything else
so you're thinking to yourself well this
this point is closest to this point for
sure this point in this point and what
you're doing when you think of that
because those three points are much
closer than the closest blue - which is
all the way here right that's pretty far
so what are you doing when you do that
well turns out you've just done is
nearest neighbors
so with nearest neighbors you are just
checking to see basically who are the
closest points to this new new point on
the data in this case we've got two
dimensional data but you can have three
dimensional ten dimensional and so on
so obviously visually for you looking at
this is super simple but what if you had
yeah like ten dimensions or a thousand
dimensions suddenly you can't do this by
eye anymore and that's where the machine
begins to shine so that's nearest
neighbors but this is actually most
people use
k-nearest neighbors so what the heck is
k-nearest neighbors well it turns out
that if you just try to start thinking
about okay how does this process
actually going to work do you actually
need to compare it to every single point
in a data set to get your answer and
most likely you don't need to do that
but so with K nearest neighbors we'll
just add a ki suppose here but that's
all together right K nearest neighbors
you decide what the number of K is going
to be so let's say K was equal to 2 what
you would do is you would find the two
closest neighbors to K and I'm going to
say visually that is this one and
honestly I'm not really sure which one
is closer of these two I would probably
guess maybe this one my orange line is
definitely shorter but but it doesn't
quite go the whole distance but let's
just say it was closest to that second
one there so with k2 you've got two
points that are the closest so we've got
basically two points are saying yep this
is a plus but what if you had a point
that was maybe here you might have a
case where what are the two closest
points by k2 well you would have
probably this point here and this point
here right those are the two closest
points and when K you know within when
the nearest neighbors go to basically
place a vote on the what the identity of
this point is we have a split vote okay
so in general when you do K deers
neighbors you're probably not going to
want to have K equals 2 or any other
even number you're going to want k equal
to some odd number when in this case
we'll do 3 so what if we did 3 what if
we said ok we need one more point what
we would say okay it's this one so then
basically the vote would be negative
negative and positive that's a two out
of three so we would say it's the class
is actually a negative class that's what
we would end up going with here and so
that's basically how cake
neighbors works it's it's a super simple
algorithm and the other thing you have
to think about too is in this case we
had only two groups but what if you had
three groups is k3 going to be a good
idea
turns out no because you could have a
total split amongst all the groups what
about four no because you could have a
totally even vote so if you had three
groups you need at least five total you
know K equals five to avoid any sort of
split vote you can also code something
into just randomly pick if there is a
division what's neat about K nearest
neighbors though is not only can you get
an actual classification for the data
point that you pick you can get what we
were talking about before both accuracy
in the model so that you can train and
test the model for the models overall
accuracy but each point can also have a
degree of confidence so for example what
if you get you you're using K equals
three and you get a vote that is like a
negative negative and a positive well
that's a two out of three right so
that's a you know sixty six percent
confidence in the score or in the in the
classification of that data but not only
is it sixty six percent at is the
confidence sixty six percent but you can
also have the entire K nearest neighbors
model that you've trained you can have
that accuracy so this would actually be
more like confidence and that's why I
wanted to change when we were doing
linear regression why I didn't want to
call it confidence I wanted to call it
accuracy because confidence with K
nearest neighbors is something you can
actually value and it can indeed be very
different from the entire models actual
accuracy so so it's kind of cool with
with K nearest neighbors now what are
some downfalls of K nearest neighbors
well as we're going to see in order to
find out who are the closest neighbors
what we're using to measure that
distance is just simple Euclidean
distance is what we're going to be
using here and two to do that to find
the Euclidean distance the most simple
method is actually to measure the
distance between any given point and all
of the other points and then you just
say okay what are the closest three or
whatever K is and as you might guess on
a huge data set that's a very very long
and tedious operation there are a few
things that you can do to kind of speed
it up but no matter what you do to speed
this up you're going to find that the
larger the data set the worse this
algorithm runs because it's just not not
as efficient as other algorithms and
then and so once we cover this and then
we get into maybe like the support
vector machine you'll see that the
support vector machine is much more
efficient when it comes to actual
classification also with K nearest
neighbors you're basically there's never
really a point where you're totally
training anything like the training and
testing is basically the same the same
spot are the same basically the same
thing because when you go to actually
test you're comparing it to all the
points there's really no good way to
train a simple K nearest neighbors
algorithm there are also some things
that we can do down the line but we'll
probably won't be getting into that
ourselves but anyway just keep in mind
that the scaling is not so good and will
point out exactly why and then when we
get into support vector machines you'll
see why support vector machines scale so
much better than K nearest neighbors
that said I don't mean to brag on K
nearest neighbors too much it's actually
a more than fine algorithm for many
classification tasks so if you're even
if you're working up to maybe a gigabyte
worth of data K nearest neighbors can
still be calculated quite fast and it
can also be easily calculated in
parallel since any any point you're
trying to predict can be calculated
regardless of the other points that
you're trying to calculate so it's
actually you can you can thread it and
still scale relatively well but if
you're working with you know billions of
data points it's not going to do very
well so anyways that is the theory and
intuition behind K nearest neighbors and
now we're going to actually be diving in
to a real world example of k-nearest
neighbors then after that we'll actually
write our own k-nearest neighbors
algorithm so stay tuned for that if you
have any questions or comments leave
them below otherwise as always thanks
for watching thanks for all the support
and subscriptions and until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
