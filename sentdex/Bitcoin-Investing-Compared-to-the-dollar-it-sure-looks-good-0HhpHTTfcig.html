what is going on guys and girls welcome
to another bitcoin video in this video
I'm going to start talking about some of
the explicit and implicit long-term
prospects for Bitcoin so it is a
currency or at least somewhat argue that
it's a commodity either way it's got a
lot of variables to it and many of these
variables can change will change and
we'll probably even see new ones over
time also it's / traded for other
currencies and those have variables that
can change as well obviously now the
dynamic of bitcoin is really something
completely new and a lot of you know the
future plays that can happen here
haven't even been thought of or
considered so at best we can only sit
here and pontificate what the future can
bring but that's the fun of investing so
first off we have to decide if bitcoin
is even a valid monetary system or it
can be or at least we need to compare it
to what is considered valid money today
so let's compare it to the US dollar the
benefits of the u.s. dollars that is
declared legally as legal tender
creditors are forced by law to accept
the US dollar as payment interestingly
enough businesses I can't actually
decline your cash money but they still
must in the end except dollar so they
can they can turn down your your actual
physical cash but they have to accept
dollars as payment so and they have done
something like this in the past good
examples like airlines who don't accept
cash but again even though they can
decline the cash the dollars legally are
enforce Phylly are made as legal tender
for debts goods whatever right so
basically because the US government says
a dollar is a dollar and it's worth you
know 100 pennies which are worth one
cent which is the value of something
that we don't even know boom it has
value right because there isn't anything
backing the US dollar anymore besides
the fact that we're really what backs
the dollar is our our our government's
power and our military power like the
country's power that's that's what does
it right so what we say goes alright
is this is a dollar anyway so so US
dollars at least in the investing
standpoint the US dollars are nice
because they're like just declared
valuable right so they must be accepted
by law where no one actually has to
accept Bitcoin and it's pretty unlikely
in the future that some government is
going to declare by law that you must
accept Bitcoin so a lot of people
rejoice in the whole unregulated
currency idea reminds me a lot of like
people that just love the idea of
anarchy and people love the idea of no
government but if you have no central
authority then you have no authority
right and we kind of begin to encroach
on dj's warnings about uni ilysm fray
that's some sort of central guide things
can go quickly awry and now while a lot
of people immediately just get offended
at that kind of thought is you know
quite often seen and is definitely
occurring in culture especially in our
culture that appears to be definitely
undergoing significant moral decay and
if if you don't agree that you see it in
yourself look at your government that
you're bashing so either way it's there
so anyway back on track though without
the government backing like I say in a
lot of these these Bitcoin videos it's
the Wild West right with without central
authority if your money stolen nobody
can help you right if someone who only
works with Bitcoin owes you money tough
luck you can't siphon that paycheck
right accounts can't be frozen etc so
even though government's made out to be
the bad guy really often and I can agree
that there are a lot of problems no one
actually knows whether or not the whole
this Bitcoin thing if it pans out is a
good idea at all to take that kind of
power away from some sort of central
authority so keep in mind too that the
powerful people in the world are still
going to be powerful like powerful
people will be the rich and the
connected no matter what this is still a
monetary system so that's I'm going to
change with Bitcoin if anything the
people who got a head start in Bitcoin
right now definitely not the guys you
want ruling the world we got a lot of
criminals that started with bitcoins
well cash rules everything now that said
you know what does the
and do with our dollars these days well
the issue a lot of bonds right too so
they kind of issue an IOU with money
that they say that they'll have in the
future but they actually don't we can
see this with our rising debt and you
know what I get it that's annoying right
but you know moving to unsent relies and
unregulated currency may not necessarily
be the best answer right it could be but
how do we know really for sure so the
other issue with dollars is that were
incentivized to store these dollars with
our banks so either we earn some petty
interest sometimes but mostly the money
is thought to be secure quote unquote in
the bank so what exactly does the bank
do with your money all right well well
they are required by law to keep some of
it and this is called the fractional
reserve banking system more on what
happens with that but basically they're
only required to keep ten percent ish of
your money in reserves and this can be
even a lower number depending for the
rest of that money they can lend it to
other people lend it to businesses or
even invest it in the stock market we
all know the you know adage about
gambling with money that isn't yours the
same is true here right so no one really
pays attention to what the bank's
actually do with their money since
they're all put like on the same playing
field right with FDIC insurance so every
bank is basically as safe as the other
bank because of FDIC insurance so due to
this all banks are made to look equal
and no one really notices or thinks
about what's what the banks are really
doing with their money malicious or not
this means that good banks that are
conservative with your money and safe
are not rewarded with more deposits
let's say and bad banks that abuse or
take large risks with your money and
this country's money are not punished
this in turn incentivizes the short term
high yield high risk plays by the banks
you wind up paying for it just like you
did starting at the end of two thousand
seven to two thousand eight you're
probably still paying for it and just
like the entire world did and we're
still trying to catch up so like earlier
I was talking about
you know how you know government support
of the fiat currency that we have can
help you maybe get your money but it can
also hurt you since they ensure the big
banks all equally and they don't
scrutinize for bad practice but that
said besides bad practice and say like
you know phony investments in the stock
market or risky investments I guess you
can't really make phony investments
let's return back to the fractional
reserve banking system that I was just
talking about so I always thought this
was one of the more interesting concepts
that maybe I'm wrong maybe a lot of
people have do know about this but I
learned I first learned about it my
senior year at University and the only
reason I learned about it was because I
just wanted to take an economics course
so I took a few economics courses and
this came up and but it was just like
you know real real short you know maybe
15 minute discussion and it was about
the fractional reserve banking system
and what happens and it's called the
money multiplier so what it does is just
what it sounds like and with the
fractional reserve banking system when
they only have to keep ninety percent of
it yeah they could immediately just turn
and invest that money in the stock
market and make a lot of money boy what
else happens is they can lend it out to
other people and so what winds up
happening is look let's just say you
start with a thousand dollars and you
invest or not FS you deposit a thousand
dollars into the bank the bank is
required to keep 100 of that so ten
percent of that on reserve the rest they
can do whatever they want so they could
lend it to someone else another business
or another person who then either uses
it or a lot of times when you get a loan
you kind of you put it in the bank maybe
for a little bit or maybe you're you're
loaning or this guy's depositing a
thousand bucks Alone's 900 to this other
guy and then he you know pays somebody
for his car work the other guy deposits
that then they get loan anyway this this
happens more um it becomes like a big a
big scheme that looks like a pyramid
kind of so so so it's not just one guy
that you know one thing that happens
right so let's say you in deposit a
thousand dollars are required to keep a
hunter
they've got it they can use 902 that so
they can lend it to some people they can
invest some of it if they want but let's
say they just lent it to other people
right what would happen to that one
thousand dollars well one thousand
dollars in the end gives the impression
of almost ten thousand dollars right and
literally just barely under nine
thousand dollars is actually floating
around in circulation so where's the
other thousand dollars well it's kept on
reserve but the other stuff is actually
kind of you know being used it's a part
of the system even though we started
with a thousand dollars now keep in mind
though that each of these people like
that that money just gets multiplied
like that and continues getting used and
this is really where inflation comes
from right because you're just adding
more money to the system so naturally
prices rise over time and so really uh
that it's just you know I don't know
anybody you can show this to and they
just think well yeah well that's just
the way it is yeah well that's pretty
messed up and if you were say you were
investing in a business or something and
you were looking at their accounting
books and you saw their accounting
practices as being like this are you
kidding I'm pretty sure you would like
sue these guy you know and so yeah it's
it's definitely quite the mess so we
didn't get very far in this video and
I'm sorry uh but I did want to bring
that up so because a lot of people you
know want to say that all you know
bitcoins a bubble or whatnot and that's
you know Bitcoin aside what I hope I've
established in this video is that the
monetary system that we're currently
living under and that we you know we
accept this stuff right you work your
butt off at some job and you get paid in
this stuff so it should be really
important to you what is happening with
the value of the stuff that you're
sweating over right and so even if you
don't want to you know think about
Bitcoin or you're not sure about Bitcoin
still that's totally fine but at least
you should be somewhat skeptical about
the actual current monetary system that
we have because it is it that's sketchy
you know like I just don't understand
how that can possibly you know be
allowed so hopefully I've taught you
guys something new if you want you can
probably find other videos talking about
it or you can find more information on
the money multiplier and fractional
reserve banking and what happens there's
even like calculators that you can find
singing be like you know if I deposit a
hundred thousand dollars and we're
working with a ten percent you know
fractional reserve what what does that
become you know and you can see it you
know that's this is this is what's
happening but the sad part is a lot of
people have no idea never even heard
about fractional reserve banking or the
money multiplier right so people aren't
even kind of like aware that this kind
of thing is happening so anyways
hopefully you guys learned something new
hopefully you enjoyed the videos in the
next video we'll be getting more into
depth about Bitcoin I just first kind of
wanted to talk about at least a little
bit the US dollar and this isn't just
with the US dollar this is with anyone
that has basically a central banking
system there you go I mean this is going
on so so keep that in mind so anyway I
just wanted to touch on the US dollar
its value its true value and the system
that we're actually built on top of and
actually if you if you read into the
system it's a system that requires there
to always be more debt than we can pay
off so that's actually a pretty
interesting system as well I can't
explain that one to good so I'm not even
going to try there is an actual there's
a pretty good video that actually I just
I saw pretty recently maybe i'll link it
in the description I thought I was a
pretty darn good video and it talks
about this exact thing so yeah anyway
that's going to conclude this video stay
tuned for the next video we're actually
talking more a little bit more about
Bitcoin or at least cryptocurrency so
the next video maybe not exactly Bitcoin
but then we'll start moving into crypto
currencies what they bring to the table
and then soon we'll actually get into
Bitcoin specifically because then we
need to pin bit coin to decide if we
actually think bitcoin is it to the
other currencies that are out there so
there's a lot of crypto currencies so
you have a lot of choices so anyways
hopefully you guys are interested in
that hopefully you've learned something
new in this video as always thanks for
watching thanks for all the support in
the subscriptions and until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
