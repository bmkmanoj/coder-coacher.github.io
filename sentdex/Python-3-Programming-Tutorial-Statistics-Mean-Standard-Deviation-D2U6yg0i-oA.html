another Python 3 tutorial video in this
video what we're talking about is some
of the basic math functions that we can
do with the module statistics that is
that comes with Python 3 so the
statistics module basically gives us a
well statistic type stuff so we get mean
or average write median mode standard
deviation variance and that's pretty
much it anyway but those kinds of things
so it's actually very useful module
because in Python 2/7 you have to kind
of code these things yourself unless you
have a another module that you download
like a third-party module so anyway
let's go ahead and get started there so
let's go ahead and do import statistics
and now let's see what we can do here so
we're going to need an example list so
I'm just going to make an example list
we haven't really talked much about
lists we will get there but for now just
put a bunch of numbers in the square
brackets and that's Python list so just
kind of you don't have to copy my same
numbers just put some numbers in here
and that will do so we have an example
list now and now we can use statistics
to use this list with the statistics
module to kind of get some information
out of it so what we can do is like x
equals statistics statistics mean and
then we can find the mean of the example
list like that okay so this is going to
return to the X variable what the mean
of this example list is so we can print
that out so we can say print X run that
and this is the mean nine point six six
six six six so there's a few other
things that we can do so I'm just going
to edit this dot mean make it quicker we
can obviously do median like this we can
run that we get the median is six we
could do mode don't really need to show
it the other thing that we can do is
standard deviation which is really nice
so your standard deviation run it and it
turns out that we have a standard
deviation that's quite high and the
reason for that is in my list I had a 78
but we could delete the 7 there make it
just an 8
run this again and now we have a much
more realistic standard deviation to
point to another thing we can do is
variance
certainly that and we get married so
just a quick you know built-in module
that comes with Python 3 that does some
of the more basic things that you're
going to find yourself needing pretty
early on since really pythons a pretty
popular data analysis tools so anyways
if anybody has any questions or comments
on that feel free to leave those below
as always thanks for watching thanks for
all the support subscriptions and until
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
