tutorial in this tutorial we're going to
be covering basically just the operators
right you have assignment operators
comparison operators and logical
operators and so if you don't know what
those mean just yet don't worry I'm
going to spin then so first let's do a
little quick comment if you remember
we're going to do a multi-line comment
and that's going to be just a boy / star
and then star forward slash to pull that
off and within here let's go over some
of the operators so the first one I
think we should do of course is
assignment operator but luckily we've
already done that and these this is an
assignment operator just a single equal
sign you're just saying this equals this
so we've already really covered those
not going to write it out it's just
defining something the next thing we
should do is the comparison operators
because these will start getting pretty
useful so far we've sort of done a
comparison operator as far as equal
equals is concerned but let's do some of
the other comparisons and so those are
of course you've got greater than less
than then there's less than or equal to
greater than or equal to then you've got
this where it's like it's not it's just
it's almost like it does not equal but I
want to really suggest using that out i
think the easier way to read it out is
like this with ! equal that means does
not equal then you can also do things
like is not less than right is not
greater than so those are your
comparison operators and so you can see
here like we've got a greater than or
equal to 9 99 so if age is greater than
or equal to 999 echo true else if age
equals 99 and in fact let's just go
ahead and delete this else if part
so we're not you know confusing anybody
and so then we'll run so if age is
greater than or equal to 99 will echo
true and then otherwise we'll just echo
false so that's our greater than or
equal to upload this to the server yes
come over here refresh false is not the
case that 99 is greater than or equal to
999 then you can do if age does not
equal 999 then we want to echo true
otherwise false let's put that up on the
server refresh true it doesn't equal 999
and so on you get the idea you can use
all these comparison operators for that
finally there are logical operators and
the logical operators are as follows
they go a double and sign which just
means and so like if age and day let's
just do this aged a equals so if you
could say like if age and day are less
than 999 echo true let's just try that
for an example nice and I'll throw that
up to the server up we got to do this
okay
oops is going on over here okay refresh
so if you do like if age and day or less
than 999 that go true we save that throw
it up on a server refresh you do get a
true they are less than but what if this
one was you know 1555 you can say that
will run that and it's false because one
of them is not it's not true but then
what if you said we can use the or which
is just like two bars basically save
that run it so one of these is not and
but one of these is your fresh and you
get a true because only one of them has
to be so that's it with the assignment
comparison and logical operators next up
we've got arithmetics I know you're
excited</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
