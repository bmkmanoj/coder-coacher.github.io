miniseries within the Python stocks and
mathematics tutorial video series this
mini series is going to be concerning
the shantae momentum oscillator so the
shona momentum oscillator it's mainly
used for finding overbought and oversold
situations now it's going to be a little
bit different from your RSI obviously
overbought and oversold immediately we
think of RSI the CMO defers because what
it does is it actually looks at the the
force the push in each direction it
looks at that push individually so
upward pushes and downward pushes
generally signals from the CMO here
we've got if it's greater than 50 it's
considered possibly overbought and if
it's less than negative 50 then its
oversold so honestly it fluctuates over
the zero line and crossover over the
zero line suggests obviously buying cell
points usually the shawnee momentum
oscillator is going to be just one
single line but a lot of people will
also plot up the simple moving average
of that CMO line and then you can kind
of treat treat as like a signal right so
what I'm going to go ahead and do now is
show you guys an example both of just
this the single line then also of the
simple moving average line as well and
actually I guess before that let me show
you guys the calculation so the
calculation of the Xiaomi momentum
oscillator is gonna be the following
here although I will just say sou equals
the sum of up movements and then s OD is
the sum of down movements so the CMO is
going to say what is the sum of all the
up movements minus the sum of all the
down movements divide that by the sum of
all up movements plus the sum of all
down movements and then multiply
whatever that fraction is times 100 now
movements right is kind of inherently
just kind of means and brings along with
it that there's some sort of time frame
usually people are going to use a time
frame of 10 so they're going to consider
the last you know 10 10 open high low
close prices looking at
and actually in our in our scenario we
use just closed prices so usually
whenever there's like a single line and
a single bit of data you people just use
the close price so sorry I misspoke so
close prices so a time frame of like the
last 10 closed prices and then from
price number one to number two did we go
up or did we go down and if we went up
that would be an up movement how much of
an up movement was that and so on you
can continue adding them so now let me
show you guys some of the examples from
the CML so this is that charting
application that we made there's a whole
series dedicated to this charting
application if you want to know exactly
how to make this charting application
we're going to be talking about in this
video in this entire series is really
all about each indicator since there are
just tons of these indicators so this is
the bottom one right here is our CML and
so at the 50 mark we drew a red line
just to kind of denote hey this would be
an over over overbought scenario
possibly and then we drew a green line
at the negative 50 mark to denote hey
this is quite possibly oversold now it
just so happens that we just left this
top indicator slot in its natural state
which was an RSI which is what we used
we used RSI up here and MACD down here
so it just kind of worked out that where
we do have an RSI - compared to but as
you can see it follows the RSI line
pretty similarly I mean there's some
stuff where you know like the peak the
mountainous peak over here is a little
different than this mountainous patina
but as far as directional movement they
are very similar but their trajectory
does defer quite often so it's kind of
interesting to compare the two where you
know they either they move up and down
at similar times but how much they move
up and down differs quite a bit so
anyway this is an example with just the
line but now what we can do is we can
also get out of this and the other thing
that we can do is plot it up with a
simple moving average so let me go ahead
and
make that change for us and now when we
plot the same Apple stock again let's
say bring it over now you can see that
we have the simple moving average line
is this like cyan line so each time
there's a crossover it's a warning right
so as the CML crosses over our simple
moving average it's kind of like a that
would be seen as kind of a warning like
maybe get out and then the same thing as
we continue on you can see also when it
crosses up words you know that okay well
maybe this would be a time to get into
the stock and then obviously here you
would be thinking about getting out but
probably not really into like this point
here you know but anyway Apple just kept
going up anyways so this is our CMO
indicator there's kind of the idea of it
so in the next video what we're going to
be doing is calculating this with in
Python and then the video after that
will actually be charting it in
matplotlib so anyway stay tuned for
those videos as always thanks for
watching thanks for the support in the
subscriptions and it's a next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
