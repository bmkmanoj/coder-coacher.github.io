with Python 3 and PI game tutorial
series what I aim to do here is first of
all we want to we're going to use a
programming language of Python
specifically Python 3 you should be able
to follow along with Python 2 and then
maybe even some later languages of
Python 3 there might be some minor
syntax changes but for the most part
everything should be relatively similar
what I like about Python and also PI
game and game development in general
with programming is that you can take a
topic that people find interesting so a
lot of people ask me what the first
thing they should do when they program
or like how to learn to program and my
question right back to them is well like
what do you want to what do you want a
program and you have to find something
that you're interested in so for me I
learned a program learning natural
language processing with the N LT k
module with Python and I just got like
this big natural language processing PDF
book basically and that worked for me
because I was really interested in that
that's not going to work for most people
because most people don't care about
natural image processing so that's not
going to be a good first topic but for a
lot of people games are a great first
topic because games are fun and the
other thing that's great about
programming games for education of
programming is because you can visualize
the logic that you code so a lot of
times you can't really visualize what
you're doing but with games you can you
can visualize everything you can
visualize the machine learning or
artificial intelligence you get to
visualize the mathematics like physics
and all of that and you get to visualize
your logic you know whether or not your
logic works so I think PI or Python is a
great programming language for new
program it's just because the syntax is
really simple but I think games are also
really really great for teaching people
how to program but also just to kind of
hone in on your programming skills now I
realize not everybody's watching this
tutorial
brand new to Python so some of you guys
just want to learn
dupuy game or make games with Python now
so this series if you don't know
anything about programming you can
follow this series might be a little
fast-paced for you but if you don't know
how some things work something works
then I highly suggest you just check out
the basics tutorial series for Python 3
I have a basic series for all the basics
of Python 3 so if there's something
you're confused about like a while loop
or a for loop check that out also if you
don't already have Python or PI game I'm
going to run through those things really
quick for Python you're going to want to
head over here to Python org head to
downloads and download either Python 3 4
or 2 7 but we're going to be using
Python 3 and if just for the record if
there's Python for out you'll probably
be able to do it if PI game is supported
anyways any version of Python 3 should
be fine though so download that also
just if you are on Windows or any
machine that you really wanted
preference between 64 and 32 bit if you
have a 64 bit machine you should
definitely choose 64 bit Python so
you'll have to go to downloads and like
latest release and then go to their
downloads page here the path might be a
little different depending on your
watching this but anyways here are like
here's your 64 bit released for Mac OS
here's your 64 bit release where is it
for Windows I don't see oh here it is
right so you want to do that once you
have python and first of all installing
python is really simple just download it
and install it and that's it so you'll
have python if you don't have it next
you're going to need PI game and 4 PI
game we're going to head over to PI game
org and we'll go to downloads and here's
where you can download they've got
various things split up use the source
if you want just download the source and
move move it yourself Windows UNIX Mac
Nokia if you want you can use PI game on
Nokia phones and then there's also PI
game for Android here all kinds of fun
stuff
so now I keep that in mind now for me
I'm on Windows for example so I would
download that also if you are on Windows
and you have 64-bit like I just said
get the probably the best thing you can
do is head over to this link that
they're suggesting and I've got that up
here and it's like this unofficial
Windows binaries page and you can
basically get like all of your packages
from from here so and they're all like
Windows installers and a lot of packages
don't come in 64-bit so you can get them
here so anyway if you're on Windows you
can just type in PI games so here's PI
game click on that and then we come down
here and we're three point four right
now and we want we only want 64-bit so
it would be this one right here click
that download PI game and you should
have PI game now once you're all done
what you'll want to do is we'll get out
of here and you should be able to open
up a Python command line so you can
either open up this and see it says your
version here and then whether you're 32
or 64-bit so you can open up your shell
and then go import and PI game like that
hit enter and make sure you can import
PI game if you can't import packing
something went wrong either reinstall
check your installation all that make
sure you matched up 34 and 62 Earth 32
and 64-bit also your python version
nature all that stuff matched up
otherwise if you set them in trouble
leave a comment below and I'll do my
best to help you out so make sure you
can import PI game and just as an aside
the kind of environment that I like to
program in is just the straight IDL II
which is interactive development
environment and it's actually not really
enter the one I use is not really active
but to get it you would go like if
you're on Windows you would just go to
start and then you can find it there but
it's just literally called IDL e for
Python you would click on that so you
can just search for idle whoops opened
up Python 2:7
so three four open up idle and come over
here and so this is interactive so if
you said print hi it's going to
immediately output hi and so it's kind
of annoying to me to have an interactive
develop interactive environment so what
we're going to be programming in is you
go here so you open up ideally if it's a
she'll go file new new file and that
opens up a blank document and from there
we can code right so you can say print
you know hi and you can keep coding it
and it's not spitting anything out at
you yet and then you can run it when
you're all done so that's the
environment we're going to we're going
to program in and then also to run it
you'll have to save so just go file save
as save it as something whatever it is
we want to call it doc PI whatever so
with that sorry if that was a little
long-winded for some of you guys who
already have PI game installed and
download and all that but um needed to
cover that just for anybody who doesn't
have that and now we're ready to
actually do some basic PI game code so
we're not going to get too in-depth in
this video but I just want to show you
guys a basic PI game window and on all
that so um so first we're going to go
import pugging because in order to use
PI game we have to import it so import
PI game and then PI game is like this
it's an instance quite literally so what
you're going to need to do is we're
going to go PI game dot in it which is
initiate and what this is going to do is
it's going to initiate PI game and all
the modules that come with PI games so
this is basically as necessary as your
import and it needs to be the first
thing you do with PI games so before you
do anything else like draw a window or
just anything before you do anything
else
you have to do import PI game and PI
game in it and obviously you would put
your other imports up here if you if you
needed them for those who don't know
with Tython you download a module you go
import that module there's a lot of
other syntax involved importing feel
free to look that up if you want on my
channel otherwise just know that we're
importing the module here in this
reference is the initiation function
with PI games so you just just
calls the init:function so now the next
thing we want to do is we want to set up
so all games are in Windows like a
window so to speak so the next thing we
want to do is want to set up our windows
so in the way that works if in just in
case you follow the two contra tutorial
series windows are actually more like
surfaces okay so or frames so you've got
a frame and then within the frame you
have windows and it's kind of like that
with PI game you've got a it's basically
your window is not really a window it's
a surface is what your going to call it
that's what you think of anyways but you
could have multiple surfaces and stuff
but for us we're going to keep things
really simple so anyway we're going to
say game display for our variable and
game display is going to equal PI game
dot display dot set underscore mode and
this is going to be the game's width and
height basically and with height or
basically the resolution so to speak of
the game it has to be supplied it's a
single argument so we just we supply it
with a tuple so if you remember your
basics the tuple is defines with
brackets like this you pretty much have
to because for example we're going to
say our game is 800 by 600 so 800 wide
600 tall um you can also if you remember
the basics a tuple can be one of two
things right you can either do this or
you can do it with that like this we
won't really get away with it like this
because since we're passing it through a
function it would treat each of these as
a parameter so we want to put it at a
round bracket so python knows that hey
this is just a tuple as a parameter
anyway so this sets our display sets the
size of our display and we're ready to
move on so next we go PI game dot
display dot set underscore caption and
for us what we're going to do is we're
going to make kind of got not really a
racing game we're not racing anything
but we're going to have a little car and
we're going to avoid objects I'm gonna
make the car a race car and I thought we
could call our game a bit I put a bit
racy
now what that's going to do is it just
basically changes the title of the
window so it says caption but it's
really like the window title so right
here Python three point four point one
right would be a bit racy instead so so
that's that next thing that we want to
do is we define the game's clock and
what a clock is is it basically it's
going to time things for us and for our
purposes we use it for frames per second
so let's break this out real quick so
we're going to say clock and that's
going to be our game clock equals PI
game time dot capital C clock and yeah I
don't really want to say too much more
on clock just besides the fact that it's
your it's your it's your specific game
clock so you could also use some sort of
timing feature as well but you
definitely wanna use clock because it's
based it's like a it imposes it on
everything in the game so anyway you
want to have your own specific PI game
clock now that basically defines every
like major thing we need to define but
then you have you know a game and so
your game has what's known as either
you've got a main loop or a game loop is
what people generally call it and
everything in that game loop is where
all your logic is thrown in and it will
change you know basically what the game
looks like and what's happening so now
we want to kind of make our little game
loop here and the only thing that will
break us out of this game loop that's
going on so basically the game loop is
like the logic for your game so the only
thing that would ever like stop the game
from from running would be like one of
two things either for us since it's a
race game we're going to say the only
thing that would stop us would either be
we crashed or we decided to quit and we
close out the window or something like
that so the quick command will come
later on that will have something that
breaks us out of the loop at any time
well anything the one thing that will
break us out of the loop every time it's
like part of the game logic would be if
we crashed so we start the game by
saying crash equals false
so we're saying we have not crashed
right so you start the game you have a
crash yet but then if crashed equals
true we need to do something right we
crash so probably going to reset or
something like that so let me clear this
up a little bit so crashed equals false
and then we're gonna say wow not crashed
so what this asks is Wow crash still
equals false basically so if you said
well crashed this would only run if if
you did crash but while not crashed
basically means exactly what it sounds
like so that's that's why I think Python
syntax is so easy it's like a sentence
pride pretty much but anyway well not
crashed what do we want to do well we
want to like sort our loop and at the
beginning of every lick loop and what's
nice about PI game is it grabs all of
the events for you it and it sort of
helps with event handling so I'll show
you that a little bit but for now what
we're going to say is what PI game does
is it grabs events so we don't have to
like code any of that so it makes it
really simple on us so we'll just say
for event in PI game event dot get and
what PI game dot event I get does is it
just gets any event that happens so
that's where's the mouse on the screen
are they clicking are they pressing Keys
what key are they pressing all of that
stuff is handled by PI game they have
the code that does that for you and what
this is going to do is basically it
creates a list of events that have
happened and this is a list of events
per frame per second right so generally
only one thing's actually going to
happen but you might have someone moving
the mouse and clicking at the same time
especially if amp like a frames like a
first-person shooter something like that
but generally is probably only gonna be
one of them but anyway at least for our
game it will be for event in packing
event get what do we want to do well for
now the only thing we're going to ask is
if the user wants to quit so we're not
going to force them to keep playing the
game forever so we're just say if events
dot type equals so double equals so this
is a comparison operator if you just had
a single equals sign
that's an assignment we don't want to
assign something to event dot type we're
going to ask if it equals
something leaves a double equal sign
it's a pretty popular place for people
to make typos so make sure you do the
double equals pygame dot and then all
caps quit and this is something that's
handled within again PI games so for the
most part well at least for our uses a
PI game quit is going to be when someone
hits the X so the X out of the window PI
game is going to automatically recognize
that is that's a PI game dot quit
function basically but then we can we
can ask the basically when the person
does that we can handle that right so we
could choose the map close the window if
they hit the X that's that's our choice
what we want to do in that scenario we
can make it pop up a message like are
you sure you want to quit stuff like
that so anyway or we just don't let them
quit and so packing back quit and then
what we want to do at this point is we
want to get out of the loop so the first
thing we're going to do is we're going
to say crashed equals true so we can
break out of this loop now we're just
doing that for now probably um we might
change that code I just want to show you
like how you might break out of a loop
this isn't really the best thing so
otherwise you know you're going to click
this and is going to run the crashed
segment basically on us
but anyway Christ equals true for now
and um the other thing I wouldn't mind
us doing is let's go ahead and for event
in PI game data my bucket we're going to
also print event so this will just print
a console whatever event is happening so
so you can just kind of see all of the
events that PI game is tracking on us
and that's basically it
now this will only work for a single
frame so we actually need to keep things
keep the ball rolling so and actually up
until this point all that's happened is
we've PI game dot in it that's fine so
we've initiated PI game we've said ok we
want our window to be you know this size
we want our title to be that here's how
we're going to measure frames per second
we've not crashed yet but if we do will
will say PI again quit and then we'll
just say we've crashed we're also going
to print the events that occur but
well with pygame as well as a lot of
things in computer graphics and stuff
like this you first kind of generate the
stuff in the background and then when
you're all done generating everything
the background you call a command to
push it to the foreground and actually
display and you'll find that a lot of
times the calculations and everything
that's occurring in the background
unless it's really really you know
complex stuff happening for the most
part even though it's like complex stuff
the most computationally taxing event is
actually when you go to display it to a
screen that's what really like takes the
most processing so you do all the
calculations the moving things around
the redrawing and all this in the
background without actually displaying
it and then when you're all done you'll
go to display it in a brand new frame
and so like that that's just kind of the
methodology for all kinds of things like
not only pygame but also like let's say
you're gonna do things in matplotlib for
example same thing you draw everything
first and then when it's all drawn then
you show it okay so anyway that's what
we'll do so after this for loop so for
all the events after we've gathered all
the events and we're printing the event
what do we want to do well we want to
update our display so we're going to say
PI game dot display dot update and
here's an important point to note
there's kind of two ways to do this you
can use Pi game display update and or I
guess you not and orbit or you could use
PI game display dot flip okay
and what PI game dot display to update
is going to do is you can put in a
parameter here and it will just update
that one thing so the background
processing would be a little easier and
just pressing in general processing in
general will be easier if you were to
just update us like small things at a
time but if you do not put any parameter
in there it just updates the entire
surface
so again surface you might as well think
of surface as your whole window it's
going to update everything you're seeing
PI game display dot flip on the other
hand will always it doesn't do just a
specific thing it will always just
update the entire surface
I'm personally not certain about why
anybody at least for like 2d games would
ever use anything but PI game dot
display to update and why would anybody
use PI game about to split out flip when
you can do the same thing with update
I'm not too sure if anybody's watching
this I don't know why they would be
watching an introductory video here but
if anybody knows why you would use flip
over to split update empty parameters
let me know so I don't see a purpose for
it moving on so we want to update the
the screen now and now the next thing we
want to do is we want um we want our
frame to update or we want to like move
the frame on basically so whenever so
we've just we've defined our clock and
now we want to define frames per second
basically how fast are we going to do
this this stuff or basically how fast
are you going to target because
sometimes the calculations might take
too long and we want to actually be able
to achieve the result we want but let's
just say we're going to try well to do
that we can do clock dock tick and then
in here you put the parameter of it
sounds kind of weird that this would be
it but the number you enter here is the
frames per second so if you put 30
that's 30 frames per second put 60 at 60
frames per second but if you want
something to move fast but smooth then
you increase the frames per second so
just see more what I mean later on but
if we want to like speed things up we
could just increase the frames per
second that you know go by and that
makes things just move faster the other
thing you can update is just how fast
things move so you do all kinds of stuff
and usually updating how fast things
move is usually a better option because
this frames per second will make sure
you run through this loop the whole loop
that fast so that's going to be far more
taxing on processing but anyway I just
wanted to cover frames per second and
why you might use various numbers now
that's it the only other thing left for
us is when the user wants to quit so
there's a very specific way we need to
exit PI again so just like we have to
initiate
my game we have to like uninitiated game
and the way that we uninitiated pot game
is with PI game dot quit empty
parameters and that will stop PI game
from running and then we can run any
other like quitting function for our
program with Python we can just quit
with quit empty parameters and that's it
so kind of a long intro but if we save
this and we run this we get our little
window here there's nothing here but
it's a window and you see our title a
bit racy and then here is all of our
events and you'll see if I put my mouse
over the window you see new events are
popping up and you'll see the same thing
we can also hit keys oops
let's hit the keys over here and you can
see in the background the keys are being
pressed anyway let me move it over here
see we're pressing keys now and you can
see like the keys are popping up and all
that so that's that and then when we
come over here and we hit our X that
exits the PI game and then we basically
that was what made the PI game disappear
is this right here and then we're being
asked are you sure you want to kill the
program because we're an idol this is
the way Idol works and that's just the
function of the quit parameter but we'll
hit okay but if you were to say run this
game um in our like any actual PI game
or Python window basically from the
command line there's all of our events
over here and we can press keys and all
that but then when we go to exit it just
exits entirely so that's that's the
purpose of quit but again an idol it's
going to be like are you sure anyway so
that's your quick quick intro to PI game
we just made a window and all that I've
got a long way to go a lot of stuff to
explain pag in such an in-depth module
it can get confusing really fast
especially like I still don't quite
understand why you would call it clock
tick 60 I guess it's like how many ticks
you want to happen per second I don't
know anyway there's a lot of other
functionalities with Pi game and just
making games in general that can kind of
be confusing but we'll get through it
and so anyways that's it for this one
now if you guys have any questions or
comments on this tutorial video leave
