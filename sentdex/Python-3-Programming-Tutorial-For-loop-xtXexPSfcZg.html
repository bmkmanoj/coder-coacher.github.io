another Python 3 tutorial this tutorial
is going to be covering the for loop the
for loop is used for pretty much the
same tasks as the while loop they're
completely interchangeable typically
you're going to see the while loop being
used for sounds kind of funny but I
suppose I would say finite or infinite
tasks and the for loop is usually used
to be a little bit more variable for
like uncertain kind of time frames and
stuff like that but that said the for
loop can actually be used for the same
tasks as the while loop and the while
loop can do all of the things a for loop
can do I mean they're completely
interchangeable performance wise action
wise all that so for this reason I I
would just say that it just comes down
to personal preference um I prefer the
for loop myself a lot of times a for
loop is much more condensed or
condensable than the while loop but
again it really just comes down to
personal preference and it just doesn't
matter so anyway what I'd like to do now
is show you guys some examples of the
for loop and where you're going to most
often see it because some people really
like myself included I do actually use
both it just depends you know what the
situation is so anyways let's go ahead
and get started so first what we're
going to want is generally you're going
to see the for loop being used iterate
through a list and what iterate means is
just go through a list so let's make an
example list so we're going to name this
example list and we're going to encase
this list and I'm just going to type in
random values you can do the same you
can try and copy my values if you want
but it's not necessary I'm just putting
some variables in here some values in
here so in a previous tutorial um with
the variables I was showing you guys
that if you add like multiple variables
here it's going to unpack right and so
it's going to try to unpack all of these
values right but if you just have one
and then again if you didn't have enough
on either side if they weren't equal it
would it would throw an error but if
you're just assigning a single variable
here this is totally fine to do it's
going to assign this entire list to this
variable but if you did like example
list var that would throw an error you
would need as many variables as here
because it's going to try and unpack the
list just as a quick aside so now what
we're going to do is we're going to say
for X in example list what do we want to
do so the way to think about this is
basically for each I so maybe what I'll
do is actually to make it a little more
understandable for each a number in
example list what do we want to do so
what it's doing is it's creating a
variable here right
each number now becomes a variable that
each step of the way
these numbers are being assigned to this
variable each number and obviously
example list is corresponding to example
list so we'll hit enter and if you
didn't notice already by now with like
the while loop and all that when you
make one of these loops and you hit
enter it automatically tabs it over for
you
so if you're coming from maybe another
language or not at all from any
programming language you have to usually
do this or actually you don't have to
really do it in Python you have to do it
you must have this space here in other
languages typically you've got like
curly braces and you come down and you
just you could put all you want it over
here and then most people say you should
have good standards and you should
automatically indent it yourself but it
is not necessary in other languages in
Python it is but luckily usually it's
going to automatically indent for you so
it is just fine so it makes your code
pretty automatically so that's kind of
nice written anyway so you must have
that indentation and this indentation
will apply throughout the entire loop so
in order to get out of that loop I'll
show you in a moment what you would need
to do but for now let's just say print
each number so we'll save and run that
and as you can see it just iterated
through the entire list in order one
five six once seven eight nine 345 53:5
pretty cool uh but now what you can do
to is then you come down here and we'll
just say print continue prog
and that run it and you'll see here that
it continues the program after the for
loop because it's not under the same
indentation but if you hit tab and you
indent this along with this for loop
you're going to see continued program
for every number so when we run this you
can see that at each step of the way
continue the program so just keep that
in mind that your that's how your
indentation really matters another quick
thing I'll show you guys real real fast
is first what can happen sometimes if is
this right you've copy and pasted a lot
of code maybe and it's not indented so
what you can do though is you can
highlight all the code like the what's
called a block of code and you can
highlight it and then hit tab and it
will tab the code over by that same
token if your code is too far tabbed
over that also will not work it
literally won't run well Python 3 just
keeps throwing me for a loop apparently
that's ok it's gonna go ahead and run
hold on let me try something else I'll
come down here paste and then let's do
this alright python 3 that was ok as
well well at least in python 2 7 you
can't do that but anyway i'll tell you
anyways how you can fix this just so it
does look right because even though
apparently python 3 is more accepting of
improper standards than python 2 7 you
should still try your best to give good
standards so because it gets very messy
uh when you want to do maybe another for
loop down here and do some stuff right
uh so anyways what you can do to move a
block the other way is highlight it hold
ctrl and it's uh the open bracket so you
can hit that a couple times and it tabs
it over you don't know what i'm talking
about it's this symbol right here like
this key you hit that while holding ctrl
and that will shift it over so that's
that but now back to some more stuff
about the for loop I was telling you
guys that you can use a for loop much
like you use while loop as a counter and
it's much better as a counter and here's
why so if you remember the for loop that
we wrote or the while loop rather I
believe that came out to be four total
lines of
but instead with the for-loop giving you
4x in range and ranges a built-in
function in Python so first I'll just
show you guys what it's going to do 1
comma 11 and all we want to do is just
print X for now so let's run that real
quick and you'll see that what it did is
obviously our previous program but then
it did 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
not 11 in the way range works it starts
at the first number goes all the way up
to the ending number or whatever it is
now um a couple of or one thing to note
range is a built-in Python function so
you don't have to import it and it will
literally make that range of numbers for
you in Python to seven pythons three
point or python 3 point threes a version
of range here has actually been back
ported to Python 2.7 and it is X range
it's known as X range in Python to 7 so
X range like that and what is beneficial
about this range function over the
Python 2.7
range function is when you do something
like in Python 3 3 and you say range 1
and like this number what it's going to
do in Python 2 7 is literally generated
a list that is this from 1 to this
number or whatever it is um and
obviously that's going to use a lot of
your virtual memory so your RAM and it's
probably going to max out your RAM
before it completes the operation but in
Python 33 or if you use what's called X
range in Python 2 7 it turns this into
what's known as a generator and
eventually we'll talk more about
generators later on but what a generator
does is it only visits that operation
once it doesn't store it in the memory
but it will count through so pretty
interesting stuff there but more on that
kind of stuff later since this is meant
to just be basics so that pretty much
covers the for loop a couple of examples
of the for loop here both as a counter
and then also as an iterator through a
list but really this iterated through a
list
only actually used a generator function
to do so so anyways that is that so
hopefully you guys learned something new
hopefully you guys are enjoying my
