to another Python tutorial video this
video is gonna be covering how to make
good-looking Python charts extremely
fast or even save setups and formats and
all this stuff for your Python charts
that you happen to like the newest
version of matplotlib comes with some
epic style sheets already especially the
one that looks kind of like ours
plotting for some reason the windows
installer right now at least does not
include this new update so if you
install from from the windows installer
on matplotlib org you are not gonna get
this you can however go to the source
and you can find this so you can install
with setup dot set up top hi all so you
might be able to just install it from
the tarball if you're on like linux or
something like that but free Windows
users it's good it's a little more
difficult also if you're like me I've
already made a lot of changes to my
matplotlib my matplotlib module so I
don't really see any point of installing
a newer version of matplotlib first of
all I think the changes made right now
are pretty minut the only time I'd ever
really want to change it as if they made
some sort of massive performance upgrade
or something like that so until they do
something like that I really don't want
to have to redo all my modifications
anyway so here either you can install
from the source or you can follow this
tutorial and just modify your
pre-existing matplotlib install so this
is what a default matplotlib chart looks
like you obviously can make various
changes yourself but what I'm going to
show you today is gonna be how you can
make a chart instead of looking like
this look like this okay so a little bit
better looking at least in my opinion
possibly at this size because I'm
recording a pretty large screen you
might think the numbers are too smaller
the lines are too thin but for your
typical size chart this is actually
pretty good and you can change all of
this stuff and this is actually
generated with only one line of code
we're actually accessing a sort of
stylesheet
so to speak so with that let's go ahead
and get started on how
we can actually achieve this so the
first thing that we want to do is first
we want to download this the style
itself so you're gonna want to go to my
website syntax comm and then go to slash
downloads
slash styles if and that should download
style dot zip for you once you've got
style does it download you're gonna want
to go to your download directory and
whenever you're there go ahead and
extract that so extract all will just
extract it here and you should have this
Styles folder style folder if you open
up style folder you should see the core
and it style live and within style it is
where your style sheets are so the one I
just showed you was ggplot and what we
can do is we're gonna open this up with
notepad plus plus come over here and we
can see here what the settings are for
this so here we could change the font
size right now it's ten you can make it
twelve or fourteen for example and make
the numbers a little bigger and all that
you can change your colors you can add
more stuff but basically it's like a
style sheet in CSS or whatever so let me
close out of this and now the next thing
that we want to do is su we've got it in
our downloads but now we want to
actually put this in our matplotlib
file or folder rather so from here go to
C Python to seven Lib site packages and
then matplotlib and when you open that
up this is where we want to put it so
we've got here style just click and drag
that right over to matplotlib and now
you've got your style directory and
that's really all you have to do to set
up Python to allow for this so now what
we want to do is we can create some
simple code for the to access our style
sheet and also I'll show you how easy it
is to implement this on any charting
that you've already got so first of all
as typical from matplotlib we want to
import PI plot as PLT and now let's go
ahead and make some simple quick lines
so I'm just gonna say x1 equals we're
gonna start with one two three four five
and one
do that now I'm gonna copy this and
paste this a couple of times and this
will be two three and now we're gonna
make the Y counterpart so we'll say y1
equals and I just put whatever you want
in here and I'm gonna go ahead and copy
this paste paste y2 y3 and then I'll
make some different numbers in here just
so it looks different than the other one
okay good enough so now I've got a
couple of lines now let's go ahead and
do plot or PLT dot fly
x1 y1 and then go ahead and copy this
paste paste two three two and three and
then finally we need to call plot show
so this will be just a typical plot so
let's go ahead and run that and up pops
this okay so this is our default Python
or our default matplotlib charting now
let's go ahead and use our styles so the
next thing we want to import is from mat
plot live in pour styles so that's going
to import that style folder for us now
all we have to do to change this up is
gonna be style dot use and then in here
you specify the name of the style we
want to use so if we come over here
style and actually you know what
after you have extracted style you're
gonna want this style to be the sink so
because of the way we extracted this we
might have some trouble so let me do
this so if you have two folders like
this really right within style you want
this not another style folder so real
quick right click this open it in a new
window and then come over here just the
first style highlight and drag that over
and then we can go ahead and delete this
second folder there there's no point for
that so now if you click on style should
look like this okay
so once we've imported style we come in
here we've got corn in it in it so
that's how we can use this kind of as
it's a little library and then within
style lib you can see it comes with
three different styles we've got ggplot
grayscale and dark background so for now
when we say use we can say ggplot okay
so it already knows to use the
stylesheet
so that's all we have to do so now let's
go ahead and save and run that and we
see that the chart that pops up is the
new version and we didn't have to
actually code any of the other you know
formatting and all this and we'd have to
customize it at all we just called that
style so by that same token if we come
back to where we just were and say we
want to use grayscale okay
so we can see what the other one is that
we have up here so grayscale we could
run that and now you can see that it
makes just a grayscale kind of chart
this one's not too interesting because
we don't have any we'd have a legend on
here we don't really have too much going
on so this doesn't look too enjoyable
but it is a grayscale chart nonetheless
and then finally we have dark underscore
background so this is gonna help us make
dark charts and kind of make everything
mesh together when it's dark
so obviously the access change we're
using more pastel II colors so it
reflects real well or contrast real well
with the black background and again if
you were using a any sort of Legend and
titles you just will automatically make
it work out best for you I happen to
like ggplot so that's the one I think we
might as well use I'm not sure if I left
that other plot up I didn't that's good
oops getting lost now there we go so I
kind of like this but yeah let's say you
want you're not happy with the size of
the text well we could close this and we
can come back over to our directory here
in style of we could edit ggplot over
here and it says font sizes 10 before we
can change that right we can say font
size 15 we can save that and we can come
over here and we can run this again and
now we can see the numbers are much
bigger and this is the only time we'll
ever have to touch this font size so
what you
you can start saving your own little
style sheets for very specific charting
applications that you might have or
think you know like light versus dark I
think is a good example where some
charts you like them dark and you know a
badass-looking and then some charts you
like them light they're usually a light
chart it's more user friendly it just
looks nicer so anyways that's kind of
how you can use these style sheets I
actually kind of like ggplot the only
thing my only complaint is I do feel
like the numbers are kind of small but
boom we just updated it and you can
change all kinds of stuff here and you
can even add there's more things that
you can add to this as well and so you
can make your own style sheets and this
way each time you have a plot you just
call that style instead of having the
coded in here or change your RC
parameters which will only allow you to
do it once
whereas or one type of chart whereas
here we can save multiple types of
charts that we might specifically want
for you know we want bar charts to look
like this I mean what scatter plots to
always look like this and so on so
anyways hopefully that's useful for some
of you guys I kind of liked the whole
style addition and I really wanted to
use it but I just couldn't really
install the newest version of matplotlib
just yet so that's just a quick way that
you can install it and start using those
style sheets if you have any questions
or comments something going wrong for
you feel free to leave them below as
always thanks for watching thanks for
all the support and subscriptions and
until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
