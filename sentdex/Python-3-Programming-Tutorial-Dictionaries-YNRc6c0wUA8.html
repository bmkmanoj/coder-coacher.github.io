another Python 3 basics tutorial video
in this video we're gonna be talking
about dictionaries so dictionaries are
kind of they're really Python specific
but there are a lot like associative
arrays and other languages and the idea
of them is they're an unordered
unordered unordered assortment of data
and the data is always keys and values
and again it's unordered so you might
enter it in an order and then you might
expect an order out of it or maybe you
want to order your dictionary you you
can kind of hacky order a dictionary but
not really there is no order inherently
up to a dictionary so anyway again the
idea of a dictionary is to have keys and
values a key will be a single element
values can be anything it can be lists
it can be lists within lists or
multi-dimensional lists your values can
be functions which can get exciting fast
be I think so anyway
with that you can even reference another
dictionary in the dictionary
so yeah let's go ahead and show some
examples so we're gonna say X dicks
equals and to notify Python that you're
going to create a dictionary use curly
braces and then within the curly braces
let's say we have a collection of people
and their ages so we're gonna say we got
Jack he's 15 years old we have ourselves
a bob who is 22 we have ourselves an
Alice who is she's 12 and then we
finally have a Kevin and Kevin is 17
years old okay so as example dick now
just for quick kicks print example dick
just to see how Python reads it as you
can see it's almost an exact printout of
exactly what we just typed easy enough
now what if I want to reference
something in this dictionary we want to
ask this dictionary hey how old is Jack
example dick well you go print
bags dicks and lips Jack so it should be
kind of familiar to you guys as far as
lists are concerned we're kind of
referencing a bit of data and so jack is
the key and then the value is this
number right here so hopefully it's
going to tell us 15 sure enough it does
now the next thing that we're going to
do is we found out how old jack is
that's cool we can reference this how do
we let's say we want to add something to
this list so for example let's say we
want to add Tim so to do that we'll say
X at X dict Tim so this is basically
exactly how we reference Jack right we
said X dict Jack just print out that
that value now we're saying X dick Tim
which doesn't exist already but we're
about to make it exist he's 14 okay so
now we can print X dict save and run it
it you hear sorry guys and then we have
Tim okay so see how it kind of added Tim
like almost like randomly into this um
so yeah keep that in mind it's there's
no order really to it but anyway it add
it's him now let's say Tim just turned
15 years old big one five so now we're
going to say example Dick's 10 equals 15
so as you can see we already defined Tim
here and now we're like redefining Tim
um and so you'll see this is why
dictionaries have to have unique keys
otherwise it would fall apart the sky
would literally fall whoops we need to
print Tim again so the example that
timmy was 15
look how it it's this this time like
just time to put Tim's second this time
it puts Tim all the way at the end Wow
crazy stuff anyway
Tim's 15 don't print example dicks and
we can see at first Tim is 14 now Tim is
15 fancy that sadly however Tim has died
we need to remove him from the
list these no use being in this list
anymore he's dead so now how do we get
rid of this Tim guy well let's make some
space here now to get rid of something
we can just do del de o example Dix
Tim this is going to remove the key and
value or values
- Tim whoops we got a Press print it out
after deleting Tim heads Dix so he was
here
great 14 turn 15 good for him then he
died bummer
now he's dead done so um now just as a
quick aside so this is our list let me
get rid of all this now and let's say
instead or not instead but now not only
are we tracking age but we're gonna
track hair color so Jack he's 15 and his
hair color is blonde bob is 22 and Bob's
hair color is colors Bob's hair brown I
heard Brown from the crowd now Alice
Alice is 12 years old
but Alice's hair is black and run out of
space but here's Kevin
Kevin's a ginger so he's got red head
sorry if I offended anybody um there we
go good now we can print
let's do print example Dick's a Jack oh
okay my spidey-sense was tingling that I
did something that sure did Python -
seven coming out of me anyway 15 and
blonde okay correct and we can even go
like this we can say well we want a
reference just as hair color boom blonde
nice okay so this list could go forever
if you wanted you could also create
other dictionaries and you could say
Jack is equal to another dictionary you
can create functions and say Jack is
equal to a function you do all kinds of
stuff will probably expand on that a
little bit
more once I get through all of the kind
of basic things I want to get through
with Python 3 then we'll get into some
more in-depth kind of hacky things some
more intermediate things that kind of
stuff so anyways if you guys have any
questions or comments feel free to leave
those below also I'm still kind of
making this series probably some of you
first viewers to this series I'll still
be generating this Python 3 series if
you have any requests or anything you
definitely want to see I highly suggest
you request them that way they show up
for you guys
but anyway someone's at the door so I'm
going to conclude this video here if you
guys have any questions or comments
leave them below as always thanks for
watching thanks for all the sports
subscriptions until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
