part 27 of our matplotlib tutorial
series in this part we're gonna continue
talking about base map and here we're
gonna talk about some of the options
available to us with base map and their
various functions and methods that we
can run with it
so where we started off in kind of where
we left off was with just a simple
representation using the Miller
projection of our base map graph now or
chart or map whatever you want to call
it now the next thing that I want us to
go ahead and do is talk about some of
the more the options that we have so
instead of it we're gonna stop I'm gonna
stop filling the continents for now but
just know you can fill the continents
and you can also change the color if you
if you want now in the projection we can
also add some more some more coordinates
and the way that these coordinates are
working is let me close out of this old
version of paint
don't save and we'll open up paint and
the way that it coordinates work is
you've got you know your entire map
might be like this and then you know
you've got stuff on the map let's say
I'm not going to attempt to draw the
world but let's just assume okay so this
is our map and then generally you pick
two points you pick the lower left
corner point and then you pick the lower
or the upper right corner point okay so
we're gonna pick that point and for
those of you who are not too familiar
with maps coordinates are in latitude
and longitude longitude goes left to
right okay and that's the long kind of
left to right longitude and then
latitude is the up and down okay so this
is your latitude now with latitude and
longitude the interesting thing that
comes up with plotting in a graph like
situation generally coordinates are
reported as lat/long so latitude
longitude but what is latitude mostly in
relation to well latitude is most like
the y-axis and longitude is most like
the x-axis so at some point with
matplotlib
we have to flip these around
to be to conform to the XY requirement
of graphs but you have to understand
that they're reported as YX but anyway
more on that later but back to the
original when we define a coordinate box
with base map we defined the lower left
and then the upper right the lower left
that's the XY coordinate for the lower
left point and then the XY for the
coordinate up here and then what ends up
happening is with these two points we
can draw a box that will be our graph so
we can draw a box like this right and
that's the box that is made up by these
coordinates not quite perfect but that's
the idea so what we can do is we can
minimize this and then we can say so we
want to have the Miller projection and
then we use a parameter called LLC RN R
la T that's lower left corner latitude
and let's say the lower left corner
latitude will be negative 40 and then
lower left corner longitude will also be
negative 40 we're gonna we're gonna have
this kind of focus in on Africa for us
and then oh you are CR n R lat so that's
upper right corner lat
will be 50 and then the upper right
corner long will be 75 okay so our our
bottom or a lower left point will be
negative 40 negative 40 and then our
upper right coordinate will be 50 75 so
that brings up another point is with
latitude and longitude generally what we
have is you've got you know your your
axes that'll look like this and
generally you've got north-south this
would be your West and this is your East
but in matplotlib you've got basically a
plus minus minus plus so all Eastern
coordinates are really pluses all
Western coordinates are negatives
northern coordinates are pluses southern
coordinates or negatives okay so this
coordinate
here negative 40 negative 40 what is
that
well that latitude is negative 40 that
would be south and then you've got
negative 40 or I'm sorry that would be
40 South not negative 40 South that
would make no sense so 40 South
forty West then you've got this 50 would
be 50 north and then 75 East basically
so let's do so let's go ahead and run
this real quick and see what comes up so
what we get is Africa with a little bit
of outlying Europe and slightly Asia
over here but mostly what we're looking
at is Africa now there's one more thing
that we can show with graphs and that
would be the resolution do comma
resolution and for now we'll do C so the
default is C which stands for crude and
so when we zoom in let's like zoom in
here okay you've got like it's very
jagged e right there's not very much
resolution here on the full term scale
or even especially like a full map it
looks okay like there's a little bit of
rounded edges but not really but
so that was crude then you have low so
that would be L for low and that takes a
little longer and you can see actually
we get it we've got a few more rivers
we've got some islands over here and
then again we can zoom into that same
Lake and we can see yeah there's
definitely a lot more granularity going
on there
you've got crude low I think H would be
high and I believe F is for full we'll
have to find out for sure there but I
believe F will be our full this one
takes a little longer and each step of
the way is an 80 percent change so
basically yeah you're like almost
improving eighty percent I suppose and
so anyway here with what we want to do
high I think we got a lot more detail
here and again let's just keep zooming
into that same Lake right now you got
even more detail here I mean even
showing the full lake we really don't
see
that much jaggedy edges anymore and
stuff but then we also again we got way
more islands over here that we can
actually zoom into and they're like you
know zoom way into these islands so
there's that and then there's finally f
is full let me just try to run that it's
gonna take a while to load that one but
that is another option that you have so
while we're waiting on that I'm gonna go
ahead and change this back to will just
will do l for low that's pretty quick
loading and some of the other things
that we're able to do we can also do
something like with like the United
States we can do something like this we
can say let's do this
draw coastlines well first of all what
we can do is we can do em draw let's do
draw countries first countries so we can
draw countries that map come up
you.thank is this is gonna take a while
so what this will do is allow us to draw
countries but not only do it can we draw
countries but we can throw other
parameters in here that are like our
original matplotlib parameters so an
example of this would be like line width
and we could say line width equals two
okay and I'm gonna run this in last
night it's still not up yet I was really
hoping to get a full resolution to show
you guys but I don't want sit here I
don't know how long it's gonna take me
to to render the the full one still not
there I guess we can just skip it but
you can feel free to wait on it yourself
if you'd like but yeah it's just not
gonna pop up let's just give that for
now so now we've got the country
definitions here so you can see that
we've got like the split of everything
and actually what I'll go ahead and do
is I'll have us return back let's do
negative 90 negative 180 and then here
this will be 90 180 so this would be the
full world again for us there you go
so you can see the country definitions
they have a thicker line width right
because we chose them to be line width
of two but now you've got definition
between the United States Canada and
then
you're like Brazil and Chile and all
that so I'll split up and then you've
got here in Africa and Europe we can see
all the divisions now we can close this
and that was so draw countries we can
have that but another thing we can have
is m dot draw states and we can color
these and we can have States B let's do
now I need something that we can see
really well let's do B for blue so save
that and run so let's take a little bit
longer but yeah so now we've got the
States drawn and you should see now that
we've separated Australia as well but
mainly we were interested in like the
United States so we get the States there
so those are all separated as you know
each of their own another thing that we
can do we can even take it in another
sector basically and we can do em dot
draw counties so now we have the
counties of every state and trying to
think of a color for these we'll call
these dark red see if we can get away
with that I've never tried these fancy
colors these will take a long time to
there's a lot of like little lines for
counties but that worked out cool so we
can zoom in a little bit here and then
we can zoom in to see the counties so
now you can see that we've all the
counties for the United States all taken
care of
lol at the amount of counties for Alaska
how many people care anyway okay
so we've got that there's a couple other
things that we can do let's close out of
here let's stop drawing I wanted to just
show the counties but that takes up a
lot of time so I'm going to comment that
out and then another thing that we can
do is we can add topography so we can
say something like this MD topo and we
can add topography to our graph so this
will take a little bit to load but it
should come up pretty quick and another
thing to note with topography and the
next one I'm about to show you guys the
resolution you draw should should affect
these so the higher the resolution the
the longer it will take to draw these
now we're doing a low I think but yeah
so here's your topography so now we've
got topography on this graph
that's something you're interested in
but we still have the divisions as well
so all the country divisions and all the
state diff divisions and all that
alongside the topography we have so
there you go got those but you can see
like as you zoom in they're getting kind
of like grainy and fuzzy so if you want
to you can increase the resolution and
that will improve now that was M the
topography another one you can do is m
dot blue marble and this would be the
last one I show you before we finish up
this specific tutorial and while we wait
the next tutorial we're going to cover
actually plotting a coordinate so
probably the main reason you're gonna
graph something with a map is not just
to look at a map all right you may care
about making the divisions between
States and countries and all that but
generally you're gonna want to plot
something on the map so anyway here's
Blue Marble it's kind of like the
topography only it's a Blue Marble so
you also get you know the oceans in here
and also the green versus you know
desert and all that and you get a little
more information here with the Blue
Marble but any way you choose to do
whatever the heck you want to do so
anyways just wanted to show you guys all
those kind of options with the graphs of
the Blue Marble is the most kind of
realistic looking graph and again you
can you can take blue marble and you can
actually do like a really high
resolution but if you're gonna do a
higher resolution you should probably
zoom in first and then apply the high
resolution rather than have the full
graph apply the resolution and then
yourself on the graph zoom in and what I
mean by zoom in is is modify these
coordinates here to be whatever location
you're truly interested in rather than
rendering everything for all the
locations so anyways that's it for this
tutorial
stay tuned the next tutorial for
actually plotting coordinates and stuff
like that on the map if you have any
questions or comments regarding this
tutorial or whatever up to this tutorial
