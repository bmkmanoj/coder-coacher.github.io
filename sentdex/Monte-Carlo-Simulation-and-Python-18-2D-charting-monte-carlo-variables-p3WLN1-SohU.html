another Monte Carlo tutorial video with
Python where we left off we were
generating some data and we were just
saving it to a CSV and basically the
data in that CSV is if the data is
better than one percent or worse than
negative one percent and we want to know
what variables contributed to that data
and then we save that to the CSV so now
what we want to do is we want to chart
it up and visualize the data because
what we're looking for is if there's any
clumps of data either and positive or
negative that can kind of give us a bit
of an idea of variables that correspond
to either the positive or negative
changes so with that what we're going to
do is I'm going to get rid of this I'm
just gonna literally delete everything
in here I suggest you save yours just in
case you want to revisit the code later
on or you want to run your own tests so
take a moment and save the data maybe
just go file new and open yourself up a
blank script anyway I'm gonna clear my
now now and start a new so what we're
doing here is we're gonna start plotting
this stuff so of course if you want to
plot you need Matt flood Lib and then we
want to import Matt Oh Matt plot lib dot
pi plot as PLT I assume everybody at
this point has my plot lib since we
needed it earlier in the video so anyway
and then we also want to import CSV
because we save this data to a CSV now
we want to graph this stuff so we're
gonna have a defined graph empty
parameter function and now we're going
to say with open filename here we have
Monte Carlo liberal dot CSV with the
intention to read and we're going to
open this
Monte Carlo data this is gonna equal CSV
dot reader and what do we want to read
well we want to read Monte Carlo with a
delimiter donator of a comma because
that was our delimiter mm-hmm so again
we're using CSV dot reader which is we
imported CSV up here and basically this
is just my Thon's CSV reading app or
module basically so just a good way to
easily read the contents of a CSV file
so when you use it you just have to tell
it what is it reading and then what's
the delimiter and it automatically
understands newline and all of that so
we've got data's next what we want to do
is for each line in data's we want to do
something with this data just so happens
we want to plot it so we're gonna need
to explain what's what here so first
we're gonna say percent ROI that is
equal to the flow of each line zero
wager size percent equals flow each line
one and what we've got going on here is
it's automatically being divided up by
the comma delimiter so each line in
datas is spit out as a list and you've
got chunks in that list and it's just so
happens it's split up in the in the way
that we set it up so anyway moving on so
the next part in that list is wager
count and that is equal to flow of each
line two and then finally pea color for
plot color equals each line three just
as a quick aside in typical debugging
and all this stuff for Python and
charting and matplotlib obviously the
word color where it doesn't really
correspond like before in this tutorial
i wanted to use results anyway or like
return that was what i wanted to use
and that you can't do that because
return is a you know building function
same thing with color though color is a
built-in parameter for you guessed it
color of plots so you can't just use
color you have to use something else
like P color just keep that in mind when
you need variables sometimes you might
name a variable that runs over the name
of a very important variable so each
time we find this data what do we want
to do with it well we're gonna scatter
plot it so plot scatter and for now
we'll just do a simple 2d scatter plot
so wager size % that's what we care
about and ways your count
finally color equals P color so we add
those the plots and then when
everything's all said and done after the
width we're gonna plot show now we'll
just have it automatically call graph
save it run it and the file was actually
I'm trying to think how big my file was
but it was actually a pretty large file
so anyways we have our plot now at least
with my eyeballs uh-huh I don't see any
correlation at all here this looks like
a pretty random plotting I mean there's
some places we've got groups but I mean
you really have to grasp it at straws
here if you think you're seeing any sort
of pattern so I don't see any pattern
but there is an unsaid variable so far
here and that is how much money so we
know that this is more than 1% return on
investment but we know nothing else we
just know it's more than 1% so we
definitely want to dig further into this
and the way we would dig further is by
how much money did we make you know what
is that percent so that's the next thing
that we want to look at so luckily we
obviously have percent ROI that's one of
our variables so we can plot that but we
also kind of want to plot it alongside
this stuff so what we're gonna do now is
we're going to plot with matplotlib x'
3d capabilities so that's what we're
going to do in the next video so stay
tuned for that
also the 3d plotting
is very intense for Python so what I
figured I would do is because this is
random it's also pretty hard to see
anything of significance just right now
anyways and I bet in the 3d we won't see
too much so I went ahead and I've been
building a file that it that requires 5%
so it has to be a return on investment
greater than 5% or less than negative 5%
so I've been building that at the moment
and so in my video I've got a couple of
different things I'll show you the 1%
file and I'll also show you the 5% and
all of that so anyway that's what we're
going to be doing the next video is
plotting this on a 3d plot so we can
actually see all of the variables here
so that should be pretty interesting as
always thanks for watching thanks for
all the support and subscriptions until
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
