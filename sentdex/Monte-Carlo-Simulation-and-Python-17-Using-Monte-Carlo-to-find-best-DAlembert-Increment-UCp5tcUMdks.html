another Monte Carlo in Python tutorial
video in this video we're just gonna
keep expanding on the last thing that
we're doing and that's building our
Monte Carlo simulator so scrolling down
to the bottom this is the percent ROI
that we really need to be but I'm gonna
go ahead and make this just an even one
just because we're probably gonna have a
lot of things that beat it but aren't
necessarily the better than it right so
if you recall when we did a short sample
size of even the this strategy that
returned a zero point eight six five ROI
that was with one million samples but
even at a hundred thousand samples we
were finding vastly changing amounts
between you know maybe plus a hundred
thousand and minus honored out or heck I
think it was even greater now is like
plus 800 - 800 thousand or something
like that so anyway let's go ahead and
continue on here what we want to do is
if this is the case we do care about it
the other thing I want to go ahead and
add is we also want to know like the
wager size percent because I think what
we're gonna do is we're gonna save
because we did say I think we yeah right
down here what we're gonna do is we're
gonna every time we find something we're
gonna save that variable and we're gonna
make this so we save that variable to
like a CSV or something like that so
over time we can build on it and then
eventually plot this stuff so the first
thing I want to do is first let's make
the variable we'll call it wager size
percent that's equal to this right here
so I'm just gonna cut paste and then
copy this and paste that there so now we
have that variable now if percent ROI is
greater than one so if the return on
investment was greater than one what do
we want to do well what we're going to
do is all of this and then we actually
want to save this stuff so the first
thing we should do is when
specifying save file and that save file
we're gonna call it oops save file
equals open you don't just up file
doesn't need to exist either it'll be
created we're gonna call it Monte Carlo
yes we'll call it liberal for now and
the reason why we're gonna call it
liberal is I think one is a pretty small
number and we're only we're using a
sample size that's pretty small as well
and so eventually maybe we'll raise the
percent ROI or we'll raise this number
and then we'll call that Monte Carlo
conservative and we want to open this
anyways with the intention for appending
now we want to create the line that we
want to save this is not the best way to
make it make this file but that's okay
save line equals we'll start with a new
line and then we'll add plus string
version of percent ROI right here plus
our comma plus the string version of
wager size percent plus the string
version of wager count with a final plus
comma G so the reason why I'm doing this
is this is just gonna be a save line
it's gonna start with a new line and
once this file starts I'll just delete
the first empty line that way we're not
dealing with any empty lines anymore a
string percent ROI we have to convert
this stuff to a string in order to
concatenate everything otherwise you
can't you know you can't concatenate a
string in a and in it so that's the idea
there and then at the very end we're
using that G because we're that's gonna
be the color of the scatterplot that we
have so we're gonna be plotting green
because this was a positive ROI so now
let me take this Oh No let me take this
copy and we'll just paste this here
and make this L if ROI is less than
negative one we lost money everything
else is the same but we want to this one
will be colored red when we chart it so
uh now I think we're all set we just
really wanted oh not all set
we need makes I need to save this stuff
so save file dot write save line and
then save file dot close and I'm just
gonna copy this go down here paste and
that should be it so when we run this
what it should do is begin saving this
data to a file for us so let's go ahead
and save and run see if we have any
errors for it just like it's running and
I'll open up the file here over okay so
here's our file and again the only thing
that we really need to do is get rid of
that empty line so do that do it quickly
before you get screwed up with this if
it prints out more but anyway as we can
see here let me move this over mmm this
is the file and again it's saving first
the percentage return on investment the
wager size percent and then we have I
think wager count yeah
then you've got wager count how many
wagers did you run through to get there
and then the color of these plots that
we want them to be so that's basically
it you can see that we've got a plus and
a minus obviously the minus is red and
the plus is green we haven't got anybody
else since the initial but anyway uh so
now what you'd want to do is you kind of
want to let this run for a while I would
just let it run at least for like 30
minutes or something so you can actually
have some data I'm still can't believe
we haven't got like anything else
beginning to wonder if we should like
make a counter and make sure this is
actually still running there's one
then there we go finally okay so anyway
so we got some more and we updated so
again in minus three red and we got some
more and so on so you get the point so I
would say you'd want to at least
populate this with 10 15 20 rows so just
keep running it until you have about 10
15 20 or more rows the more rows you add
the more data you have the better this
is gonna work out for you so I'm
actually gonna let this run for quite a
while and stack up quite a few rows so
anyways stay tuned to the next video as
always thanks for watching thanks for
all the support in the subscriptions and
until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
