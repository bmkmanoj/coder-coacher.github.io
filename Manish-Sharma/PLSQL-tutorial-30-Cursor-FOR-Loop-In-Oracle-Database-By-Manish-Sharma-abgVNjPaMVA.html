rebellionrider.com it won't be fair to
not talk about cursor for loop
especially when we are doing a series on
database cursors so in today's tutorial
we will learn about how to use cursor
for loop in Oracle database as the name
suggests cursor for loop is a type of
for loop provided by Oracle PL sequel
which makes working with cursors in
Oracle database a lot easier now you
asked how as we have seen in previous
tutorials where we learnt how to create
explicit cursors that in order to work
with a cursor in Oracle database we have
to follow a chain of process such as
declare the cursor first then open it
and then fetch data from it and when you
are done close it cursor for loop
reduces the burden of opening fetching
and closing the cursor from your
shoulders things will be clearer when we
will do an example but before that let's
take a quick look at the syntax of
cursor for loop syntax is pretty simple
first line is the loop statement which
starts with the keyword 4 followed by
that we have loop index this is a row
type record variable which will hold the
data written by the cursor again we have
another keyword in followed by that we
have to specify the cursor name over
which you want to create the for loop
then we have the loop body where you can
write your executable statements now
let's do an example which will help you
in understanding the concepts more
clearly however it would be better if
you have knowledge of pl/sql for loop
before hand thus I would suggest you to
watch for loop tutorial first find the
link in the description below that being
said now let's do the example of cursor
for loop
declaration section is similar to the
previous one I just declared a simple
explicit cursor with name cor underscore
rebellion rider on select D ml which is
retrieving the data from first and last
name column from emploice table where
employee ID is greater than 200 usually
after declaring a cursor what we do is
that we open the cursor fetch the data
and close it but cursor for loop will do
all these steps for you so let's move
ahead and see how to write a cursor for
loop here is the execution section as
you can see we only have a for loop no
open fetch or closed statements this for
loop will open the cursor and fetch the
data returned by the cursor see you are
underscore rebellion rider which is the
first name and last name of all the
employees whose ID are greater than 200
into the loop index l underscore ID X
which is a record type variable now what
is a record type variable I will do a
separate video tutorial on record data
type meanwhile for the sake of this
tutorial just understand that record
type variables are composite data
structures which can hold data from
multiple columns of different data type
now the question arises here unlike
numeric for loop with cursor for loop we
don't have minimum or maximum range
which will decide the number of
execution so how many times will this
loop execute this loop will execute for
each row returned by the specified
cursor and it will terminate either when
there is no road to return or there is
an occurrence of an exception then
inside the loop body we have a DBMS
output statement which is printing the
data returned by the cursor on the
screen let's try to execute this code
and see whether it will work or not and
here is the result do make sure to visit
my blog for more information on the same
pick find all the links in the
description below so that is all on
cursor for loop with simple explicit
cursor stay tuned I will be back with
another interesting pl/sql tutorial if

by sharing this tutorial on your
Facebook or Twitter or by any means you
