I am Manish from rebellionrider.com
And I am back once again with another SQL
tutorial.
And today we will learn how to create new
user accounts using Enterprise manager.
In the previous two tutorials I have explained
how to create user accounts using SQL Create
user statement and SQL Developer graphic user
interface tool.
If you haven?t watched those tutorials then
find the link in the description box.
And this will be the last tutorial in How
to create a new user account series.
So let?s start.
The simplest way to launch the oracle enterprise
manager is through your start menu.
Just go to your start menu then all programs
And find your oracle folder here, here?s mine,
Click and expand it
In this folder select Database control ?orcl,
orcl is my SID.
In your case it may be different or you may
have more than one database control options
here.
This is because Oracle enterprise manager
is a web-based management tool for individual
database.
This means that oracle engine creates and
configures unique enterprise manager for each
database.
Click and launch it.
Ohk google chrome warning here just click
proceed anyway.
Now you will get this login page.
Here you have to log on to your database as
sys user with sysdba privilege.
So in username write sys
And in password write your sys user password
And the most important, choose sysdba in Connect
as field.
Now click login.
And here we are, as you can see that we are
connected to the database which has SID ORCL.
Now just click and go to this SERVER tab.
Here from the security Section choose Users.
This will take you to the user?s page and
here you can see all the users of your database
and their settings.
To create a new user just click this Create
User Button.
I highly suggest you to watch my previous
videos on how to create user in oracle database.
There I have explained in detail each of these
options which are on the screen.
For better understanding of the concept you
must watch my previous 2 videos on how to
create user.
Link is in the description box.
Here specify the name of your user in name
field.
Hmmm this time I will choose superman because
I have already created users by the name of
ironman and batman.
Now profile, by default we have 2 profiles
one is Default and another one is Monitoring
profile.
But we are creating a default user thus I
will select Default profile here.
Next is authentication as I have explained
in my tutorial 37 that we have 3 ways of authentication
1st is password 2nd is externally and 3rd
is Globally.
When you set the authentication on to Globally
then all the login or authentication information
gets saved into a Central Oracle Security
Server,
In the case of externally the authentication
is handled by external services such as your
operating system and lastly
The password: when the authentication is set
on password then you have to supply the password
every time you want to log on to the database
using the user.
I am gonna use password here.
Thus I will enter the password and confirm
password field.
If you want to prompt your user to change
the password on its first login attempt then
check this checkbox here.
Let?s move ahead to the tablespaces here we
will choose the default and temporary tablespaces.
Click this torch button corresponding to default
tablespace.
This will open up a window where you can search
and select the tablespace.
You are free to choose any tablespace as default
tablespace except the undo and temp tablespace.
I will choose example here.
Similarly you can choose the temporary tablespace.
Now mind here you can only select those tablespaces
as temporary tablespace which are temporary
in nature or created as temporary.
In my case I have only one temporary tablespace
by the name of temp.
So I will choose this temp as my temporary
tablespace.
Now let?s move on to the account status.
If you want to lock the account then choose
this Lock option otherwise let it be Unlock.
Now the next table is Roles.
As I mentioned in my last video that Roles
are group of privileges.
As you can see there is already a role assigned
to our user which is Connect.
Actually as I told you guys before in my previous
tutorial that every newly created user needs
a mandatory system privilege which is Create
Session to get connected with the database.
Without this privilege user will not be able
to log on to the database.
I have also shown you the demonstration in
the video tutorial 37.
This connect role is a default role created
by oracle while installation and oracle has
assigned the create session system privilege
to it.
Thus you can either grant create session system
privilege separately or just grant this Connect
role to your user, both will work the same.
If you want to grant this role with admin
option then you can check this checkbox otherwise
let it be on default.
Now let?s jump over to the next tab which
is system privileges.
Here in this tab you can grant system privileges
to your user.
Say you want to grant create table to your
user.
For that click this edit list button this
will show you the list of all the available
system privileges for your user.
Here from this list choose create table.
Here it is now click this move button.
You can also choose this ?move all?
button to grant all these privileges to your
user.
But I don?t think any wise DBA will want to
take this risk.
Or you can use these remove buttons to remove
the granted privileges from this list.
When you are done click on this ok.
Here you can see the list of all the granted
privileges.
Check this checkbox if you want your user
to grant this privilege to some other user
or role.
Now move on to the next tab which is objects
privileges.
An object privilege is the right to perform
a particular action on an object or to access
another user's object.
I will be doing a separate tutorial on user
privileges where I will explain you the concept
in detail.
But for the time being let it be like this
as I don?t want to grant any object privilege
to my user.
So let?s move on to the next tab which is
Quotas
Quota clause can help you in specifying the
maximum amount of space which the user can
allocate in a tablespace.
I have used ?Example? as my default tablespace
thus will assign 50MB Quota on this tablespace.
For that click on this top down list.
Here we have 3 options
1st is none select this if you don?t want
to assign any space to your user on this tablespace.
2nd is Unlimited.
As the name suggests, you can select this
option if you want to allot unlimited space
to your user on this tablespace.
And the 3rd one is Value using this option
you can specify your own desirable size.
Such as in our case,
We want to assign 50 MB quota thus we will
select this option and specify 50 in this
textbox of value column.
You can also select the unit like Kilobyte
or megabyte here.
Let it be on megabyte as we want to allot
50 Megabyte size.
Next tab is consumer Group privileges we will
not be doing anything to this tab even not
in the next tab also.
Because we use this tab when we design resource
plans for database, Resource management which
in itself is a very big topic and impossible
to cover in time frame of this SQL tutorial.
It seems we have done all the necessary settings
to create a new user account.
If you want to see the SQL query corresponding
to all the settings which we have done so
far, then click this Show SQL Button.
Here is your SQL query.
Come back to our main window and here click
Ok.
And your user has been created.
Search your user name in this list.
Here is our user superman.
Click on the name of your user to see the
settings.
Like this here you can click this Edit button
if you want to edit your user
That?s the last way or the last tutorial on
how to create a new user account in oracle
database.
Hope you enjoyed watching.
Please like my video as your likes keep me
motivated for doing more such videos.
You can also write a comment.
And I?ll be very happy if you share my video
and help me in sharing knowledge with more
and more people.
Yes very important don?t forget to subscribe
and be the first one to watch my video.
I upload SQL tutorial every week.
Thanks
Will see you soon.
