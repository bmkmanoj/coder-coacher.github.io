I am Manish from RebellionRider.com and today’s
video is about how to install Oracle Database
12c on Windows 7 64 bit.
Unfortunately Oracle database 12c is not yet
available for 32 bit windows environment.
Also, if we talk about windows environment
then Oracle database 12c only supports Windows
7, Windows 8, windows server 2008, windows
server 2008 R2 and windows server 2012.
You can follow the same steps for the installation
on either of these versions.
Plus it’s highly recommended to have at-least
2 GB of main memory and 10GB of free disk
space along with the updated version of JDK
which you can freely download from the Oracle
website.
Before starting let me tell you first, that
I am going to install oracle database 12c
on Windows 7 professional 64 bit machine.
The same steps can be followed for the versions
that I mentioned just now.
So let’s start.
First we need to download the Oracle Database
12c Setup files, for that, head over to www.oracle.com.
Here on this website hover your cursor over
this Download menu and then choose this Oracle
database link under the database section.
Doing so will take you to the Oracle Database
Download page
On this page, you have to accept the OTN license
agreement.
After that come to this Oracle database 12c
release-1 section.
Here as you can see we have two versions of
Oracle 12c namely - the Enterprise Edition
and the standard, standard-1 and Enterprise
edition.
You can download either of them according
to your need.
I will download this second version which
is standard, standard-1 and Enterprise edition.
And as I am going to install the Oracle Database
12c on windows 7 64 bit thus I will go with
the first link.
Now we have to download these two files.
You can either download them directly from
here or you can click this “See All” link.
I will go with the latter option.
After Clicking the See All link you will be
on this Oracle Database 12c R1 download webpage.
Here again first accept the OTN license agreement.
And then download these 2 files.
To start the download you need to sign in
on oracle website for that you need to have
a valid account here.
If you have any then just fill the username
and password and hit the sign in button this
will start the download.
Otherwise you can create an account for free.
Just to save the time I have already downloaded
both the files.
Now I will make a folder by the name of Oracle
12c and then I will move these freshly downloaded
files in that folder.
Ok done let’s go to this folder.
Now as you can see both the files are compressed
as zip so first we need to un-compress them
and extract content of these files.
First I will un-compress our first folder.
It’s done.
Now I will rename it from Database to Database
1
Again I will un-compress and extract the content
of 2nd folder.
Here we are now, and I will rename this one
from Database to Database-2.
Now we have to go to the directory database-2
and then go to this folder Stage and then
Components.
Here you have to copy all these 5 folders
After doing so, come to our base Directory
which is Oracle 12c.
Now here this time open the directory Database-1
and then Stage and then components and here
paste those 5 folders which we copied from
database-2 directory.
With this we are done with all the pre-installation
process of Oracle Database-12c and we are
all set to start the installation.
So come to directory Database-1 and here right
click this setup.exe file and choose run as
administrator.
This will start the OUI.
Step1: configure security updates.
If you wish to have all the security notifications
on your email then you can provide your email
address here otherwise hit next.
Avoid this warning it’s just saying that
you haven’t provided the email address.
Hit yes and move ahead.
Step2: Software updates.
If you have Oracle support credentials then
you fill here and download the update or if
you already have downloaded the update then
chose this 2nd option.
Since in our case we just downloaded the fresh
and updated version of Oracle 12c hence just
select the Skip Update option and hit next.
Step3: Installation option.
Here we have 3 options:
1.
Create and configure a database
2.
Install database software only or
3.
Upgrade an existing database
If you already have a database and want to
upgrade that with Oracle Database 12c then
go with the 3rd option or if you just want
to install the oracle software and don’t
want to create any database then go with the
2nd option.
Otherwise if you want to create and configure
database along with installing all database
software then choose 1st one, as I am going
to do here.
So I am going to select the first option which
is already selected now Hit next and move
to next step.
Step4: System Class.
Here you have 2 options Desktop class and
Server class.
See if your system is capable for handling
the load of server class services then go
with Server class or if you are installing
Oracle Database 12c on your desktop or laptop
then go with the Desktop class.
I will choose the desktop class.
Which is already selected now hit next and
move ahead.
Step5: Oracle Home user selection.
Till the now the installation was pretty similar
to that of oracle 11g or 10g but here we have
a different step.
Now with Oracle database 12c you can create
an Oracle home user at the time of installation.
This user will be responsible for running
all Oracle home windows services.
Note that, this user is associated with an
Oracle Home and cannot be changed to a different
user after the installation.
Here we have 3 options; with the first option
you can use any existing windows user.
But this user must be a standard windows user
or say limited windows user and not the administrative
one.
If you choose the second option then Oracle
will create a new standard windows user for
you and then will assign this user as an Oracle
home user.
And if you will chose the 3rd option then
oracle OUI will use Windows Built-in Account
as the oracle home user.
Here I will choose the 2nd option and will
create a new limited or say standard user
for my oracle home.
I will name my user as RebellionRider- You
can give whatever name you want and I will
set the password as “oracle”.
Make sure to note down this information somewhere
safely because it will be required later to
administer or manage database services
Hit next and move ahead
Step6: Typical Installation.
This window will show you all the important
configuration settings of your Oracle Database
12c.
Such as Oracle Base, that indicates the location
of Base directory for your oracle software
which will serve as a top level directory.
Next we have Software Location which is very
well known by the name db_home directory.
This directory will indicate the location
where you can find all the binaries of your
oracle database.
Next is Database file location.
This field can be used to set the location
where all the important files like control
files, Data files and Redo logs will be saved
by Oracle.
Next we have database edition, here you can
choose what edition of oracle database 12c
you want to install.
I will let it be on the default one which
is Enterprise edition.
Next is character set.
Using this option you can tell your database
which method do you want it to use for saving
the character data into the database.
You have 2 options you can choose either of
them.
I will leave it on default.
Then we have Global database name using this
field you can set the global name for your
database this will also serve as the SID of
your database.
Let it be on ORCL, You can give any name of
your choice here.
In the next 2 fields you have to set the administrative
password.
This password will be used as the password
for privileged user such as Sys and System.
For this demonstration I will set my password
as oracle only
Make sure to note down global database name
and password safely.
Next we have a checkbox saying create as container
database.
Let it be checked.
This option will create a database as container
database that can support maximum up to 252
pluggable databases.
Next is pluggable database name.
Here you have to specify a unique name for
your pluggable database.
For this demonstration I will let it be on
default which is “pdborcl”, but if you
want you can change it.
Before moving ahead I just want to make a
small change in the directory path I just
want to add OracleDB12c directory here as
a base directory.
Its just to make directory structure more
specific in the system.
It’s purely an individual choice if you
want to change it then its ok otherwise let
it be on the default one
Ok then Click next and move ahead
Avoid this warning; it says that the password
which I have given is not according to the
oracle standard.
Just hit yes here.
Step7: Next window will check for the entire
Necessary prerequisite for oracle database
12c installation.
If there is any error it will show you here.
But fortunately we don’t have any errors
and are good to go.
Next just hit the Install button.
This will start the installation of Oracle
database 12c.
Just to save the time I am fast forwarding
this process.
Here is our DBCA window.
This utility will create and configure the
database on your system.
This process is also time taking so again
I am fast forwarding it.
Ok password management; Here on this window
of DBCA you can configure and unlock the sample
accounts if you want.
You can click this password management button
which will open up a password management window
for you.
Here just select the account which you want
to unlock and then uncheck the corresponding
column to that account and provide the password.
For example let’s say I want to unlock the
“Anonymous” account.
For that I will first uncheck this column
and then I will write my password here in
new password column and then enter the same
in confirm password column.
Then just hit OK
Again avoid this warning, this warning is
just saying that the password which we just
enter is not upto the oracle password standard.
Just hit yes and move ahead
We are back on our DBCA window here as you
can see we have all the necessary configuration
displayed such as Global Name of database,
SID of database and the URL of enterprise
manager.
I would suggest you to save this URL.
Here just hit Ok.
Your installation is successful.
You are free to close this window for that
just click close.
Hope this video will help you in installing
oracle database 12c on you system.
