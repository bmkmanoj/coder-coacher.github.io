Welcome back once again, I am Manish from
RebellionRider.com
And today in this SQL tutorial we will learn
how to import data from Microsoft excel sheet
into oracle database using SQL Developer.
So without wasting any time, let’s start
today’s tutorial.
The prerequisite for this tutorial are
1.
A Microsoft excel file with some data to import.
And
2.
A table in your database for holding the imported
data.
To save time, I have already created a Microsoft
excel file by the name of source and I have
saved it on my desktop.
Let’s take a look at this file.
As you can see, this file has 4 columns.
First name, last name, phone number and hire
date.
First two columns first name and last name
hold character data whereas column phone number
is a numeric column at the same time the last
column hire date holds the data of type DATE.
I explained this to you because we have to
take care of these data type while creating
table in our database.
Moreover this excel document has two worksheets
Sheet 1 and Sheet 2 but only sheet 1 has 12
rows of data and Sheet 2 is empty.
And now I will create a table in my database
using HR user, which will hold the data which
we are going to import from this Microsoft
excel sheet.
I have done series of videos on how to create
table using create table command, SQL Developer
and Enterprise manager.
If you want you can watch as well as like
those tutorials.
Links are in the description box.
Moreover you can also give me thumps up on
this tutorial and motivate me for doing more
such videos.
So let’s create the table.
CREATE TABLE DEMO
(F_NAME VARCHAR2(20), L_NAME VARCHAR2(20),
CONTACT NUMBER(20), H_DATE DATE);
Here is our table.
Here in this table I set the data type of
first two column f-name and L-name on varchar
means they can hold the character text easily.
The data type of contact column is number
and column h-date has DATE data type perfect
for holding the values from column hire date
of our excel sheet.
Now the ground is all set.
Let’s start the process of importing data
from Microsoft excel sheet to this table.
First go to your connection tab then double
click and expand the connection in which you
have created the table.
In my case I have created my table in my Local
HR connection.
This is the tree structure of all the database
objects owned by my HR user.
From all these database objects double click
and expand this table folder and after that
locate your table in which you want to import
the data.
In my case the table is DEMO.
Let me confirm for you once that this table
does not have any data.
As you can see there is no data in this table.
Now right click and select the table and then
choose import data or you can also select
import data option from this Action drop down
list
Here as you can see in this window we have
to find and open the Microsoft excel file
from which we want to import the data into
the our oracle database.
I have saved my Microsoft file by the name
of source on my desktop.
Here it is.
Select the file and hit open.
Here if you will look closely in the file
type drop down list, you will find that all
these are the type of file from which you
can import the data.
As soon as you hit open this will open up
the import wizard, there are total 5 steps
which we have to perform to import the data
from Microsoft excel to our oracle database.
Step 1: First step is Data preview.
You can see there are 5 options on the frame
Header, Skip Rows, Format Preview Row Limits
and Worksheet.
Header: If you want to treat the first row
of your excel sheet as your column header
or as your column name then let this checkbox
remain checked.
Let’s uncheck this checkbox and see what
happens.
As you can see if I uncheck this box the SQL
Developer treats my first line of excel sheet
as the actual data rather than the name of
column or column header.
I will let it remain checked as my first row
of excel sheet consists the name of my columns.
Next is Skip Rows: Here you can enter the
number of rows which you want to skip from
the top.
For example say I want to skip my top 2 rows
then I will write 2 here.
As you can see above 2 rows are removed.
Let it again set on zero
Third option is Format: Here you can chose
between xls or xlsx format for your excel
sheet.
Fourth option is Preview Row Limits: Here
you can set the limit on number of rows which
you wish to see in this preview panel at once.
Last option is Worksheet: This option is only
available when your excel document has more
than one worksheet.
However if your MS Excel has only 1 worksheet
then this option will not be there on your
screen.
Here you can chose from which worksheet of
your Microsoft excel document you want to
import the data.
I have two worksheets in my Microsoft excel
but only sheet 1 has data and sheet 2 is empty.
As you can see here.
Let me show you, as you can see there is no
data in sheet 2 but in sheet 1 we have some
data.
Now Hit next
Step 2: Second Step is the Import method.
Here we have 3 options import method, table
name and import row limit.
In Import method there are 2 options Insert
and Insert Script.
If you choose Insert then SQL Developer will
directly insert the data into your table but
if you choose the Insert Script then SQL Developer
will create a Script which you have to Execute
to insert the data into your table.
I will choose Insert here.
Second option is the table name.
Set it on DEMO which is the name of our table.
Third is import row limit.
Here you can choose how many rows you want
to insert in your table at once.
Let’s hit next
Step 3: Next Step is Choose Column: By Default
here SQL Developer has selected all the columns
of our Microsoft Excel Sheet.
Here in this step you can choose values from
which column you want to import.
Like if you don’t want to import values
from hire data column then you can simply
remove it but I want to import the values
from hire data column so I will select it
and put it select column panel
Let it be like this as we want to import the
values from all the columns.
Step 4: Match Column.
Here you can map the column.
Source data column panel consists of all the
column names of our Microsoft Excel sheet
and Target table columns panel has the information
of the columns of our table demo.
Here you must take care that the data type
of both side columns must match.
If there is any date column then the date
format of both side columns must be the same.
For example I want to import values of first
name column of excel sheet into the f name
column of the demo table.
Both have same data type and compatible column
width.
Similarly I will map last name column over
L-name and
Phone number column over contact column
And at the end hire data column over H-date
column but here we have to define the data
format which is mandatory.
So I will set my date format on DD-MON-YY.
Hit Next.
In the last step click this verify button.
So the status is success which means you are
good to go.
If something is wrong then SQL Developer will
show the error here.
But for now everything is ok
So hit finish
Let’s check the data.
And here we go as you can see we have successfully
imported the data from Microsoft excel to
our table demo.
That’s it for today.
Hope you learnt something.
