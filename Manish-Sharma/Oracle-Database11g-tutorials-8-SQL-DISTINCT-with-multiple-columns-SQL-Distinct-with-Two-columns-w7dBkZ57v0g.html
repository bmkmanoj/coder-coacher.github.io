would like to apologize for the delay in
uploading this video nevertheless better
than sorry so without further ado let's
see what we have today
this Oracle database video is in the
continuation of our previous video where
we saw how to use SQL distinct with one
column today we will see how to use SQL
distinct keyword with two or more
columns or SQL distinct with multiple
columns
let's open SQL Developer you can use
terminal if you are on Linux or command
prompt or PowerShell if you are on
Windows machine to make this concept
easy to understand I have created a
table by the name of example this table
has four columns first name middle name
last name and example ID here I have
inserted some values let's do a first
Curie and see what we have in a first
name column
execute press ctrl + Enter or you can
use function f9 key as you can see this
column has six entries named Steven this
first named Steven can belong to either
one person or to six different people
but we cannot say anything due to
insufficient data now if we use SQL
distinct we will get one row in return
because it will remove the redundant
data as seen in my earlier video now
let's do our second query and add middle
name to our first name Steven
then execute now we can see there are
six rows two rows each with named Steven
Paul and Steven Wilson and Steven damnit
now if we use SQL distinct then upon
executing we will get three unique pair
of data note here that uniqueness of
data decided by considering first name
and middle name together now let's move
on the last name column
then execute now we can see there are
again six rows two rows each with named
Steven Paul jobs and Steven Wilson grant
and to distinct row with new Steven
David Arthur at Steven David house
ok let's use SQL distinct keyword
as we can see now that the redundant
data have been removed and only four
unique names are decided by Oracle's
over so the final result consists of
four unique names Steven David house
Steven Wilson grant which are two
distinct row we have and Steven David
Arthur and Steven Paul jobs that's it
for today hope you enjoyed the video
please like share or comment your
appreciation means a lot to me thanks
