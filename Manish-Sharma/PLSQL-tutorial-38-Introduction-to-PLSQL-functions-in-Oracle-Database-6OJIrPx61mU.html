again i am manish from
rebellionrider.com till so far we have
seen several examples of anonymous PL
sequel blocks as well as named PL sequel
blocks such as database triggers
increase PL sequel tutorial we are going
to learn the concepts of another named
PL sequel block this is also the most
requested one on my social media it is
none other than PL sequel functions in
Oracle database yes this video is an
introduction to PL sequel functions in
Oracle database also if you don't know
what are anonymous and named PL sequel
blocks then I suggest you to check out
my PL sequel tutorial 1 where I explain
the concepts of blocks in detail find
the link on the right hand side corner
of this screen as well as in the
description that being said let's move
ahead and start today's tutorial and
learn what are PL sequel functions as
well as how to create them so what are
functions when we can define a function
as a self-contained sub program that is
mean to do some specific well defined
task functions are named PL sequel block
which means they can be stored into the
database as a database object and can be
reused that is also the reason why some
books refer to PL sequel functions as
store functions actually in Oracle PL
sequel there are two types of
subroutines or C sub programs these are
PL sequel functions and PL sequel
procedures the concepts of functions and
procedures are very closely related to
each other where both have some
similarities they have some differences
too we will say PL sequel procedure for
future videos and for the time being
concentrate on PL sequel functions only
so let's take a quick look at the syntax
of PL sequel functions the syntax of PL
sequel function is divided into two
parts
first is the header of the function and
second is the execution part of the
function the header consists of the
signature of the PL sequel function and
execution part holds all the executable
statements as well as defines the
working of your PL sequel function
sticker detail look at the syntax the
keyword create marks the beginning of
the syntax followed by another keyword
function which tells the compiler what
kind of object we want to create in
between create or function we have an
additional class or replace this Clause
can help you in modifying the definition
of an already created function anyways
next we have to specify the function
name this is completely user-defined and
could be anything which follows the
Oracle database normal closure rules
followed by function name we have the
parameters a function can either has
zero parameters or n number of
parameters you just have to make sure to
separate all the parameters from each
other using comma and enclose them
inside the parentheses followed by the
parameter list we have to specify the
value which the function will return
using the return keyword with PL sequel
functions it is mandatory to specify the
return value in order to specify the
return value we use return keyword
followed by the data type in the header
of the function yes you only have to
write the data type of the value which
you want your function to return then we
have giver is Skeever indicates the
ending of the header of the function now
in case you want to declare a variable
or a constant then you can do so right
after the S keyword or right before the
starting of the execution section that
too without the use of declare keyword
then we have the execution section of
our PL sequel function similar to
anonymous PL sequel block the keyword
begin marks the beginning of the
execution section and the keyword and
marks the ending in between these two
keywords you can write the executable
statements and define the working of the
function do not forgot to define the
return statement in the execution
section this will specify the actual
values which will be returned by your
function and the data type of this
actual value must match with the data
type that you have specified in the
header of the function that's all you
have to take care and that's it about
the syntax of PL sequel function in
Oracle database I have done an excellent
blog post on the same topic there I have
two PL sequel functions in detail if you
want to read and make notes for your
college exam or Oracle database
certification then to check that out
link is in the description that's it for
this PL sequel tutorial on introduction
to PL sequel functions in Oracle
database do make sure to subscribe as I
am going to show you the live
demonstration of how to create PL sequel
functions in Oracle database
in the next tutorial with the help of a
very easy example also if you like this
video then give it a thumbs up
you can also help others in learning as
well as support me and my channel by
sharing this video on your social media
with your friend thanks for watching
