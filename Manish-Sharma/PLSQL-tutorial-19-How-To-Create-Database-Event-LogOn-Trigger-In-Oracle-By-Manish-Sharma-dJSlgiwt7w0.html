I am Manish from RebellionRider.com
and I am back once again with another PL/SQL
tutorial. Today’s tutorial is all about
database event triggers also known as system
event triggers.
As discussed earlier in PL/SQL tutorial 14
that database event triggers come into action
when some system event occurs such as database
log on, log off, start up or shut down. These
types of triggers are majorly used for monitoring
activity of the system events and have been
proved a very powerful tool for a DBA.
Database event triggers can be created to
monitor the system event activities of either
a specific user or a whole database. Any user
of your database can create a database event
trigger in its own schema if it has CREATE
TRIGGER system privilege but to create a trigger
on the database you must need ‘Administrative
Database Trigger’ System Privileges.
Here is the syntax for creating a database
event trigger.
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER trigger_name
BEFORE | AFTER database_event ON database/schema
BEGIN
PL/SQL Code
END;
/
Syntax is fairly simple. In the beginning
we have keyword “create” followed by clause
“or replace” which is optional and comes
in handy when you want to alter the definition
of already created trigger followed by another
keyword TRIGGER which specifies the type of
object you want to create. Then we have trigger
name that is user defined which means you
can give whatever name you want.
In the second line we have keyword Before
and After which specifies when your trigger
will fire followed by database event which
could be either logon, logoff, startup, shutdown
or server error. Followed by database event
we need to specify where you want your database
event trigger to work. Is it either a specific
schema or the whole database?
Next we have the execution block with the
database event trigger which will define what
exactly this trigger will do when the respective
event occurs.
As now we have seen the syntax and discussed
all the necessary theory so I guess it’s
time to write some code and see some examples.
So here we are on the SQL Developer. Let’s
create a trigger for logon database events.
Suppose user HR is a control freak and wants
to monitor its every log on and log off activities.
In this case what HR can do is, create event
triggers on Log on and log off database event
in its own schema.
So first we need to connect to our database
using HR schema. And here we are.
Now we will need a table which will hold all
the logon and logoff entries. Let’s quickly
create one
CREATE TABLE hr_evnt_audit
(
event_type VARCHAR2(30),
logon_date DATE,
logon_time VARCHAR2(15),
logof_date DATE,
logof_time VARCHAR2(15)
);
So our table is created successfully let’s
close this output screen. Ok so
Here is our table hr_evnt_audit which has
5 columns. First is event type this column
will hold the type of event which fires the
trigger. Second and third column will tell
you the date and time when user HR logs on
to the database, similarly column fourth and
fifth will tell you the date and time when
user HR logs off from the database.
So we have our table ready, now let’s write
the trigger which will execute when user HR
will logon next time and every time on your
database.
But first let’s clear the screen… great.
Now let’s write the trigger
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER hr_lgon_audit
AFTER LOGON ON SCHEMA
BEGIN
INSERT INTO hr_evnt_audit VALUES(
ora_sysevent,
sysdate,
TO_CHAR(sysdate, 'hh24:mi:ss'),
NULL,
NULL
);
COMMIT;
END;
/
So here is our database event trigger hr_lgon_audit
which will execute after the user logs on
to the database. This is a schema level trigger
as this trigger is specifically designed to
work on a particular schema in which it is
created which in our case is HR schema.
Next is the working part of the trigger where
we have Insert statement which will execute
every time the HR user logs on to the database
and insert a row into the hr_evnt_audit table.
Let’s see how we are inserting the respective
values into the underlying table and what
are the functions we used in this insert statement?
First function is ora_sysevent which is an
event attribute function which will return
the system event which will fire the trigger.
Using this function we are inserting value
into our column which is event type.
Next function is SYSDATE this function returns
current date and time of your system and we
are using this function for populating the
log on date column of our table.
For populating the logon time column which
is the 3rd column of our table we are again
using the SYSDATE function but this time in
conjunction with TO_CHAR () function which
is returning only the time part as specified
in the format string.
I have done a blog on SYSDATE function explaining
how to format the output of SYSDATE. I suggest
you to take a look at that blog. The link
is in the description.
As trigger will fire only on logon event thus
values for logoff date and logoff time column
are null.
Now let’s execute this trigger and see whether
it works or not.
Trigger compiled successfully.
Let’s test this trigger. Before that let
me show you that the table hr_evnt_audit is
empty.
SELECT * FROM hr_evnt_audit;
No rows returned. Table is empty.
Ok, As I am already connected to the database
using HR user which means to test our trigger
I need to disconnect myself first and then
reconnect once again so that we can check
the working of the trigger.
Disc;
Ok I am disconnected from the database. Let’s
reconnect to the database using HR user.
Conn hr/hr;
Done now let’s check our hr_evnt_audit table
and see whether we have any entry or not.
SELECT * FROM hr_evnt_audit;
Great. Here is the entry for Logon event.
So that’s how we create a Schema Level database
event trigger for logon event in oracle database.
With this I will wind up today’s tutorial.

we will be going to see some more interesting
examples.
