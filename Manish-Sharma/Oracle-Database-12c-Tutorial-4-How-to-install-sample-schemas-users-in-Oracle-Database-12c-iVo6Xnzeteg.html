Welcome back once again I am Manish from RebellionRider.com.
Today in this Oracle Database tutorial we
will learn how to install sample schemas in
Oracle Database 12c.
And by sample schemas I mean HR, SH OE and
many more.
As I have already mentioned in my previous
tutorials that in Oracle Database 12c only
pluggable database can have the user data
and not the container database.
Thus we can install sample schema only in
a pluggable database rather than the container
database.
Therefore today in this tutorial we will create
a pluggable database in which we will install
all our sample schemas.
In case you want to learn how to unlock sample
schema in default pluggable database you can
refer to my tutorial 61, link is in the description
box.
By default pluggable database I mean the one
which is created either during the installation
of the oracle database 12c or during the creation
of a new container database.
Ok now let’s move ahead and start the tutorial.
As we are going to create a new pluggable
database thus we will use “Database Configuration
Assistant” also know by the name of DBCA,
a utility provided by oracle itself.
I would like to mention here that I am using
Oracle Database 12c Enterprise Edition in
case you were wondering.
To launch DBCA utility just click and open
your start menu and search for DBCA.
And then right click on DBCA.bat file and
choose run as administrator.
Here on the first screen of the DBCA you have
5 database operations among these, choose
the last one which is “Manage Pluggable
Databases” and then click next.
In the Next step you have to select the operation
which you want to perform on your pluggable
database.
As in our case we want to create a new pluggable
database thus we will go with the first option
which is “Create a Pluggable database”.
Select the first option and click next.
In the third step you have to choose the Container
Database in which you want to create your
pluggable database.
In my case I have only one container database
which ORCL so I will go with this one only.
Which is already selected ok.
Click next and move ahead
4th step is the most important one because
here we will install all our sample schemas
in our pluggable database.
In normal case we select the first option
and move on to the next step.
But in this scenario Oracle engine will create
a pluggable database for you but without any
sample schema.
Since we want to install the sample schemas
in our pluggable database thus we will select
the 3rd option which is “Create pluggable
database using PDB file set”.
Choosing this option will enable both its
text fields, where in the first field we will
have to specify the location of metadata file.
The name of the metadata file is “Sampleschema.xml”.
This file comes pre-installed with the oracle
database software but in case you don’t
have this file then check the documentation
of your software.
To select the metadata file, click the browse
button by default it will open location of
the “Templates” folder and as you can
see, here is our sampleschem.xml file.
But in case it doesn’t, then let me tell
you where you can find this template folder,
which has our sampleschema.xml metadata file.
For that first I have to zoom out a little
bit.
And here we go.
Now first go to your “Oracle Home” Directory.
And here I am.
Right now I am in my dbhome_1 directory which
is my Oracle Home in your case it may be different.
Now next you have to go to the “Assistants”
directory.
And inside the assistants directory go to
this “dbca” directory, and as you can
see this dbca directory has our “templates”
folder which has the metadata file “Sampleschema.xml”.
Let me show you and here it is.
Now you know the location of your metadata
file and can easily navigate to it so let’s
get back to our dbca window.
Let me set zoom before moving ahead.
I think now its ok nicely focused and clearly
visible.
Now here select “Sampleschema.xml” as
you can see software has automatically filled
the location of data-file backup.
If it doesn’t then choose the “Sampleschema.dfb”
file from the same templates folder.
Once you are done with this just click next
and jump to the next step.
Here in the 5th step you will have to do some
configuration setting for your pluggable database.
Let’s do it.
First I will name my pluggable database as
YouTubePDB.
Next is storage if you have configured ASM
then you choose ASM here and configure accordingly
but I will let it be on file system.
In the database location field you have to
give the location where oracle can create
and save files such as data files, log files
and so on and so forth.
I will again let it be on default.
But if you want then you can change it and
give a location of your choice.
Next is PDB user where you can create an administrative
user for your PDB.
Through this user you can administer your
PDB.
Let me quickly make a PDB admin user.
Let this “lock all existing PDB users”
box remain unchecked.
Now hit next and move ahead.
Here you can see the summary.
Next you have to hit the Finish button; doing
so will start the creation of PDB along with
the installation of our sample schemas.
Once this installation is finished we will
have to do the further configurations.
This will gonna take time thus I will fast
forward this process.
Ok creation of pluggable database is done.
Hit ok and then hit close Now let’s quickly
check whether our pluggable database is created
or not.
For that we have to log on to our database
using sys user.
Here I am, now let’s query v$pdbs view to
check the existence of our pluggable database.
SELECT NAME, open_mode FROM v$pdbs WHERE name
='MANN'
As you can see we have our pluggable database
created and it's open for read and write operations.
Next we have to update the TNSNAME.ORA file
and add a TNS service entry in it for our
pluggable database YouTubePDB.
First open your TNSNAME.ORA file for that
you have to go to your Oracle Home.
Here I am now go to the NETWORK folder and
next go to ADMIN folder.
Here is our TNSNAME.ORA file.
Open this file with any editor of your choice.
Next to make a TNS service entry copy this
whole ORCL block and paste it at the end of
the file.
Now change the name of this block from ORCL
to YouTubePDB which is the name of our pluggable
database and also change the value of this
SERVICE_NAME tag from ORCL to YouTubePDB.
In most of the cases the name of database
and its associated service is same but if
you want you can confirm it using v$active_services
view.
To know how you can confirm the name of associated
service please visit my blog on the same topic
link is in the description box.
Save and close this file.
As we just changed the listener settings so
to make them active we have to reload the
listener.
Open your command prompt with administrative
privilege.
Ok here write lsnrctl reload.
Everything is done.
Now the only step which remains left is to
unlock the users or say sample schemas.
For that we need to log on to our pluggable
database using sys user.
To log on to the specific pluggable database
which is YouTubePDB in our case we have to
specify the name of the TNS service while
executing connection command using @sign.
Let me show you how.
Sqlplus sys/oracle@YouTubePDB as sysdba.
Here in this connection command I specified
the name of my TNS service which we just created
in TNSNAME.ORA file using @sign right after
the username and password of my sys user.
Let’s hit enter and connect to the database.
Here we are.
Let me clear the screen for you first.
Now I will unlock the HR, SH and OE sample
schemas using ALTER user DDL commands.
ALTER USER hr IDENTIFIED BY hr ACCOUNT UNLOCK;
HR account is unlocked.
Let’s unlock other accounts also.
ALTER USER sh IDENTIFIED BY sh ACCOUNT UNLOCK;
SH account unlocked
ALTER USER oe IDENTIFIED BY oe ACCOUNT UNLOCK;
OE also unlocked.
Similarly you can unlock other sample users
also.
Let’s confirm whether we have successfully
unlocked these accounts or not by logging
on to the database using all these accounts
one by one.
Conn hr/hr@YouTubePDB
Connected, Let me quickly show you the user.
SHOW USER;
User is HR which means user HR is successfully
unlocked.
Now let’s check SH user
Conn sh/sh@YouTubePDB
Connected SHOW USER;
As you can see the user is SH which means
SH is also unlocked
Conn oe/oe@YouTubePDB
OE also Connected let me quickly show you
the user also SHOW USER;
User is OE which means OE is also successfully
unlocked.
So guys that’s how we install sample schema
or say sample user in oracle database 12c.
I have also done a video on how to unlock
HR user in Oracle 12c you can also watch that
tutorial.
The link is in the description box.
You can also check my blog on the same topic
for more in-depth knowledge.
Again, all the links are in the description
box.
With this I will wind up today’s tutorial
on How to install sample schema in oracle
database 12c or should I say how to create
pluggable database with sample schema in oracle
database 12c.
Hope you have learnt something and enjoyed
