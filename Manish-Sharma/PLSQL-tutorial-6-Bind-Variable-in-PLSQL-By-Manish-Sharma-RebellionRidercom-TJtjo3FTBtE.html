Manish here &amp;amp; I am back with another PL/SQL
tutorial.
It is all about Bind variables in PL/SQL.
So let’s come straight to the tutorial.
There are two types of variables in Oracle
database.
1.
User variables.
Which we have discussed in PL/SQL tutorial
2.
If you haven’t watched it then find the
link in the description.
And 2nd type of variables are
2.
Bind variables also known by the name of Host
variables.
Unlike user variables which can only be declared
inside the declaration section of PL/SQL block
you can declare a bind variable anywhere in
the host environment and that is the reason
why we also refer bind variables as host variable.
According to oracle docs, Bind variables in
Oracle database can be defined as the variables
that we create in SQL* PLUS and then reference
in PL/SQL.
Variable command
Let’s move ahead and see how to create or
say declare a bind variable.
We can declare a bind variable using VARIABLE
command.
Variable command declares the bind variable
which you can refer in PL/SQL.
Also as I mentioned earlier in this tutorial
that in order to declare bind variable we
do not need to write any PL/SQL block or section.
Let’s do an example and declare our first
bind variable
VARIABLE v_bind1 VARCHAR2 (10);
See how easy it is to declare a bind variable
in oracle database!
You simply have to write a command which starts
with keyword VARIABLE followed by the name
of your bind variable which is completely
user defined along with the data type and
data width.
That’s how we declare a bind variable in
Oracle database.
Did you notice that I didn’t write any PL/SQL
block or section here to declare this bind
variable which is very unlike the user variable.
Declaring the bind variable is the first use
of this variable command there are few other
uses also which I have explained in detail
in my blog so I highly recommend you to read
that article.
You can find the link in the description box.
Initialize the Bind Variable
As we have now declared the bind variable
next we have to initialize it.
We have several different ways of initializing
the bind variable.
Let’s see what those are?
1.
You can initialize the bind variable using
“Execute” command.
Let’s see how it works.
Let’s initialize our bind variable v_bind1
with a string RebellionRider.
Exec :v_bind1 := 'Rebellion Rider';
This statement starts with the keyword Exec
which is the starting 4 alphabets of Keyword
Execute.
You can either write the whole keyword Execute
or just the starting 4 alphabets which are
“Exec” both will work the same followed
by the name of our bind variable which is
v_bind1.
After the name of bind variable we have assignment
operator followed by the string Rebellion
Rider, as it’s a string thus it’s enclosed
in single quotes.
That’s the first way of initializing the
bind variable.
2.
Another way of initializing is by explicitly
writing execution section of PL/SQL block.
Let’s check this out also.
www.RebellionRider.com
This is a simple execution block where I initialized
the bind variable v_bind1 with the string
Manish Sharma.
Let’s execute, but first we will execute
this first statement and declare our bind
variable
ok done, now let’s execute this execution
block, check this box and hit apply as you
can see PL/SLQ procedure successfully completed
That’s how we initialize the bind variable
in Oracle Database or in PL/SQL.
Now you asked, Manish why did you put the
colon sign (:) before the name of bind variable
(:v_bind1) while initializing it?
Glad you asked.
Unlike user variables which you can access
simply by writing their name in your code,
you use colon before the name of bind variable
to access them or in other words you can reference
bind variable in PL/SQL by using a colon (:) followed
immediately by the name of the variable as
I did here.
Till so far we have learnt how to declare,
reference and Initialize a Bind Variable.
Next we will see how to Display the value
stored in this variable.
Display The Bind variable.
There are 3 ways of displaying the value hold
by bind variable in PL/SQL or say in Oracle
Database.
Let’s check them out one by one.
1.
Using DBMS OUTPUT package.
This is the simplest way to display the value
hold by any variable in PL/SQL.
So let’s check out how we can use this statement
to display the current value of our bind variable
v_bind1.
Let’s use this same execution block and
add our DBMS OUTPUT statement
BEGIN
:v_bind1 := 'RebellionRider';
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(:v_bind1);
END;
/
Things that you must keep in mind here are:
1.
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE is an executable statement
which will require the execution section of
PL/SQL block for its execution.
In simple words you can only execute this
statement in execution section of PL/SQL block
otherwise you will get an error.
also
2.
To see the output returned from this statement
you have set the serveroutput on.
You can do that by simply writing and executing
SET SERVEROUTPUT ON;
I have explained PL/SQL blocks and section
in my PL/SQL Tutorial 1.
I suggest you to take a look at that video
also.
The 2nd way of displaying the current value
of a bind variable is by using PRINT command.
Like DBMS_OUTPUT statement print command also
displays the current value of the bind variable
except that you can write this command in
host environment rather than inside any PL/SQL
block or section.
Yes similar to variable command, print command
does not require any PL/SQL block for execution.
Suppose you want to see the current value
of bind variable v_bind1 for that simply write
the print command in your SQL*PLUS.
Let’s do it
Print :v_bind1;
Let’s execute as you can see here is the
result
If you will write print command without any
argument then this will display you the current
values of all the bind variables with their
names in the session.
There is one more way in which you can display
the current value stored in any bind variable
and that is by setting the AUTOPRINT parameter
ON.
For that you simply have to write and execute
SET AUTOPRINT ON;
This command, That’s all you have to do
and this point onward oracle server will print
the values of your bind variable automatically
without the use of any specific command or
statements such as print or DBMS_OUTPUT which
we just saw.
Let’s do an example
First let’s close this output window and
clear out the screen.
SET AUTOPRINT ON;
VARIABLE v_bind2 VARCHAR2 (30);
exec :v_bind1 := 'Manish';
As you can see I simply wrote 3 separate statements
where in the first statement I am setting
the auto print parameter on, in second statement
I have declared a bind variable and in the
3rd statement I initialized that bind variable.
There is no statement which will display the
value of the bind variable which we have here.
But if auto print parameter is set to On then
oracle server will print the value of the
bind variable at the execution of the statement
which is initializing it.
This means that when I will execute the 3rd
statement the value of this bind variable
will be displayed automatically.
So let’s move ahead and execute each of
these statements one by one.
Statement one executed, auto print parameter
is on now
Statement 2 executed, bind variable is declared
now let’s execute the 3rd statement and
see what happens
Statements 3 executed.
And as you can see oracle has displayed the
value stored in the variable.
These are the 3 different ways of displaying
the current value of any bind variable in
Oracle PL/SQL.
This topic of bind variable is really very
important from the development, certification
exam and interview perspective thus I have
done a detailed blog on the same which I highly
recommend you to read.
You can find the link in the description box.
