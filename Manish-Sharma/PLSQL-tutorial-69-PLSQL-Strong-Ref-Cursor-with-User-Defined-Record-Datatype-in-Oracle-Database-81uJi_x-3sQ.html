create a PL/SQL strong ref cursor using table
based record datatype variable.
There we saw a demonstration where we used
the strong ref cursor to handle the data from
all the columns, mind you, all the columns
of the employees table.
This raises our concern that – What if we
want the data from some specific column of
the table?
That’s exactly what we will be addressing
in today’s tutorial.
What’s up internet?
I am Manish from RebellionRider.com and I
am back once again with another PL/SQL tutorial.
In this tutorial we will learn how to create
a PL/SQL strong Ref Cursor with a user defined
record datatype.
This tutorial will need a good working knowledge
of user defined record datatype.
Which you can get from the PL/SQL tutorial
37 whose link, is like always in the description
of the video.
So without wasting much of your time let’s
start with the tutorial and do an example.
Unlike the example which we did in the previous
tutorial, this time we want our strong ref
cursor to handle the data only from the salary
column of the employees table.
In order to achieve this we can use our old
and trusted method of user defined record
datatype.
Let’s see how…
SET SERVEROUTPUT ON
DECLARE
TYPE my_rec IS RECORD (
emp_sal employees.salary%TYPE
);
Here we have created a user defined record
datatype with the name my_rec.
This record datatype has one field which is
emp_sal.
Unfortunately, right now I don’t remember
the datatype and the data width of the salary
column of the employees table and I am too
lazy to check it out.
Thus I defined this field as an anchored datatype.
That way the field emp_sal will automatically
get the datatype and the data width of the
base column that is salary.
Now that we have a user defined record datatype
ready to use, let’s create a PL/SQL strong
ref cursor using this.
TYPE RefCur IS REF CURSOR RETURN my_rec;
cur_var RefCur;
at_var employees.salary%TYPE;
Here we have our strong ref cursor RefCur.
As you can see, this ref cursor is returning
a result of my_rec datatype which is the record
datatype we just created.
In the next line we have our cursor variable
cur_var.
This variable will be used to refer to our
strong ref cursor ahead in the code.
Apart from the cursor variable we also have
an extra anchored datatype variable.
This variable will be used to hold the data
returned by our strong ref cursor.
As we know our ref cursor is returning the
salary from employees table.
Thus the datatype of this variable must be
compatible with the returning result to hold
the data comfortably.
You can make this variable with the same datatype
and the data width as of the salary column
of the employees table if you have this information
handy.
If you don’t then you can use anchored datatype
to create them as we did here.
So much use of anchored datatype in this tutorial,
I didn’t know that before, anyways, if you
don’t know about anchored datatype then
you can refer to that PL/SQL tutorial 4.
But for now we are done with the declaration
section of this PL/SQL block.
Now let’s move ahead and write the execution
section.
But before that, I’ll ask you to subscribe
the channel if you haven’t already and like
this video as it keeps me motivated for producing
more such interesting videos.
Let’s see if we can reach 100 likes in a
week this time.
That being said let’s come back to our topic
and complete the remaining code.
Here we are writing the execution section
of this PL/SQL block.
Let’s do it.
BEGIN
OPEN cur_var FOR SELECT salary FROM employees
WHERE employee_id=100;
FETCH cur_var INTO at_var;
CLOSE cur_var;
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(' The salary of the employee
is '||at_var||'.');
END;
/
This execution section is pretty much the
same as we saw in the previous tutorial.
The only thing which is different here is
the SELECT statement for which we are opening
our cursor.
In the last tutorial the cursor was holding
data from all the columns of the employees
table whereas today in this example our cursor
is opened for a select statement which is
returning the data only from one column which
is salary of the employees table.
Note here, this cursor is holding the data
of a single column which is salary.
This will not be possible if our cursor returns
a table based record datatype.
In that case we will have to get our cursor
opened for the data from all the columns of
the table for a specific employee as we did
in the previous tutorial.
But, if that is not what you want then you
can design your ref cursor using a user defined
record datatype, like we have done here.
In the first statement we opened our cursor
for the “Select” statement which is returning
the data from salary column for the employee
whose employee id is 10 sorry 100.
In the second line we fetched all that data
into the variable at_var which we declared
earlier in our code.
In the third line we closed our cursor.
Closing a cursor that you are done with is
a good practice.
In the fourth line we have an output statement
which is displaying back the data which was
stored into the cursor and later fetched into
the variable at_var.
Let’s execute this code and see the result.
Here is our desired result.
So that is how we create a PL/SQL strong ref
cursor in Oracle Database using user defined
record datatype.

my blog on the same topic.
That’s it for this video do make sure to
subscribe as in the next video we will be
learning the concepts of weak ref cursors.
Also Like and share this PL/SQL tutorial on
your social media with your friends and help
them in learning.
So that is the tutorial on PL/SQL strong ref
cursor.
Thanks for watching.
