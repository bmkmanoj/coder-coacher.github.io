I am Manish from RebellionRider.com.
It’s been a long time since I have done
a Giveaway on this channel.
However a couple of days ago I have uploaded
a Giveaway on my second YouTube channel, which
is still open.
Feel free to participate.
Link is in the description.
Ok so remember the box I received from TP-Link.
Yep, this one.
It’s time to open it again and bring out
the second product.
I am absolutely positive that you are going
to love this product.
Let’s see what is it?
So the 2nd product from the box is TP-Link’s
10400mAh portable power bank.
Amazing, I mean who doesn’t need a power-bank
now days.
We all carry multiple mobile devices,
Yes, it’s Nokia 1200.
I am still using it on a regular basis.
Everyone had one in their life at some point
of time.
It was a rite of passage.
Comment below and tell me if you still have
one or have ever used one.
Anyways coming back to multiple devices
Tablets, cameras, and other products which
run on battery juice could be a real pain
to charge especially when you are travelling.
In such scenario power banks come in handy.
So here we have quite a powerful device in
the segment – TP-Link 10400mAh power-bank.
It is also one of the highest consumer rated
device on Amazon.
So let’s go ahead and take a look at it.
On the front of the box you will find the
name of the product and the company as well
as the picture of the product along with the
sticker saying that you will get a 1 year
warranty with this TP-Link power-bank.
On the right side we have a list stating the
contents of the box which we will see in a
minute when we unbox this 10400mAh power-bank.
On the left side we have the specification
of the product such as the capacity which
is obviously 10400mAh, dimensions and Input
as well as output volt.
On the back, there are graphics showing what
devices this TP-Link 10400mAh power-bank supports
or you can charge with it.
Nothing much on the top and the bottom.
So now, let’s cut open this box and see
what we have in here.
~unboxing~
So here you will get a User guide.
You should read it.
Next a Micro USB cable – Not very long but
sufficient and it is of really good quality.
Also you will get a Travel pouch.
Humm it’s soft and looks nice.
I have never seen any other company shipping
a power-bank with a travel pouch.
Nice work TP-Link.
And in the end we have the Power-bank itself.
Let’s talk about it.
Aesthetically, this power-bank looks really
sexy.
Made up of good quality plastic.
This glossy white and textured blue, I’d
say the company has nailed it.
I must add that this power-bank looks premium.
But because of its glossy look it’s definitely
not scratch proof and I guess that is why
company shipped this 10400mAh power-bank with
a protective travel pouch.
Clever move TP-Link!
Dimensions wise this power-bank is really
compact.
Honestly I wasn’t expecting that.
You can easily carry it in your pocket.
If I were you I wouldn’t do that, because
of its not so flat design, people can misunderstand
the bulge in your pocket.
That is all about the aesthetics of this TP-Link
power-bank but if we talk about the weight
then this product is hefty.
After all it carries a 10400mAh battery under
this plastic housing which justifies its weight.
Let’s take a look at all the ports that
it has.
On its side there is a micro USB input port
for charging this power-bank and on the top
there are 2 full size USB output ports.
Among which one is of 1A and another one is
of 2A for power charging your devices also
obviously for charging your tablets or iPads.
Moving on, there is a battery level indicator
using which you can keep track on the usage.
There is also a LED flash light which company
calls a practical flash light.
I don’t know what is so practical about
it but anyways if it is there we will find
its utility.
The only thing which is missing is a charger
brick.
Apart from the weight and the missing charger
brick TP-Link has done a marvelous job in
making this product.
If you are searching for a power-bank in the
market then I will definitely suggest you
to buy TP-Link 10400mAh power-bank.
