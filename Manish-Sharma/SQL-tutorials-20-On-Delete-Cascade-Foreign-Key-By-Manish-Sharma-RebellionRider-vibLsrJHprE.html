rebellionrider.com and today in this SQL
tutorial we will learn:about on delete
cascade clause or foreign key but before
that I'll suggest you to watch my
previous video on foreign key and on
delete set null to have better
understanding of this concept you can
also visit my website to read about on
delete cascade close link is in the
description below you can also download
the SQL script which we will be going to
create in this tutorial link is right
here I share all my resources used in
this tutorial using copy cloud copy
cloud gives 15 GB of free cloud storage
on joining but you can earn extra 5 GB
by using my referral link means you can
get total 20 GB of free cloud storage
pretty great isn't it
to get extra 5 GB you just have to use
my referral link which is in the
description below to sign up then just
verify your email address and download
copy cloud on your desktop or laptop and
you will receive 20 GB in strength Li ok
let's jump over SQL Developer now again
we will be using parent table authors
and child table books parent table
author has two columns author ID and
author name where author ID column is
primary key I have already inserted some
data into this table to demonstrate on
delete cascade clause as this is a
simple table with primary key you can
watch my SQL tutorial 17 on how to
define primary key and child table book
has three column book ID book title and
book author ID book author ID is our
foreign key column for this tutorial
let's recreate the child table with on
delete cascade Clause of foreign key so
let's create the child table books
book underscore call three underscore FK
is a user-defined constraint name you
can give whatever you want
I just specify be okay for table name
books call three four column three as we
are defining our foreign key over column
three book author ID and FK is for
foreign key as we have to define on
delete cascade Clause on our foreign key
so we have to specify on delete cascade
right here as column three book author
ID is referenced from author ID column
of table authors therefore it must have
the same data type and column width as
of author ID column of author table
execute table books created now we have
to insert some data as you can see I am
going to insert five rows in our book
table select them all and execute number
we have 5 rows let's check here is above
table here is our book table with three
columns bacardi book title book author
ID and data we have five rows here as
you can see one two three four five now
let's check since we have foreign key
with on delete cascade Clause on child
table books therefore it means that if
we delete a row from a parent table
authors then the corresponding value to
that row in the child table will get
deleted automatically that is the
purpose of on delete cascade clause so
let's delete first row of parent table
authors where we have author ID one let
me show you here is our author table and
we are going to delete this tip sorry
Row one where we have author ID 1 and
author name Bob let's add just this SQL
Developer
so let's delete this row from parent
table and see what happens with the
corresponding row in child table so
let's have our child table here this is
our child table and now let's delete Row
1 from author table for that just right
delete okay execute one row deleted okay
first row is deleted from author table
let's refresh the data of child table
here you can see we have 5 rows now
let's refresh there we go 2 rows Row 1
and Row 5 are deleted automatically
that's what on delete cascade Clause
does hope you learned something you can
visit my website to read more about on
delete cascade here you can find the
link in the description below help me
spreading the word by sharing my video
with your friends on your social media
that's it for today we will see you soon
with another SQL tutorial till then take
care this is Manish oh yeah one more
