rebellionrider.com and i must say that
your response on the previous video was
amazing thank you so much for that now
let's try to create another cool PL
sequel tutorial once again shall we
in this PL sequel tutorial we will learn
how to declare user-defined exception
using Ray's application error method it
is another way of declaring user-defined
exception this concept is important from
certification as well as interview
prospective and as usual I will also
create a corresponding block for the
topic which you can refer to for more
in-depth knowledge so without wasting
your time let's get started with a quick
introduction of Ray's application error
freeze application error is a procedure
which comes in built with Oracle
software using this procedure you can
associate an error number with the
custom error message combining both the
error number and the custom error
message you can compose an error string
which looks similar to those default
error strings which are displayed by
Oracle engine when an error occurs that
being said let's move ahead and write a
code to understand how to associate an
error number with the error message
using reads application error procedure
this time let's make a program more
dynamic and accept the value from the
user we know that we can do that by
using M % like this but there is no fun
in it it will give the user an input
popper box with the default message
however this time I want to take this
game a step ahead and want a popper box
with a custom message of my own desire
let's see how we can do that
if you want to print a custom message on
a pop-up box then you can use the accept
command as I did here this is a very
simple command first you have to write
the keyword except followed by the user
variable and its data type this variable
will be used to store the data only for
current session in our case this user
variable is var underscore s and it's
data type is obviously number then we
have the keyword prompt followed by a
string inside single quote this keyword
prompt will print the custom message
which you have specified right after it
on the input pop-up box now let's move
ahead and write the execution section
before moving ahead let's take a quick
look at this segment of the execution
section here I have called Ray's
application error procedure with two
parameters the first parameter is the
custom error number which will be
assigned to your user-defined exception
this number could be anything in between
minus 20000 to minus twenty thousand 999
the second parameter is the error string
which will serve as the custom error
message that will be displayed back to
the user basically which application
error procedure takes three parameters
in which these two parameters are
mandatory in order to learn the full
syntax of Ray's application error
procedure you can visit my blog on the
same topic but for now this reason
occation error statement looks good as
you can see I include this Way's
application error statement inside an if
then conditional control block this if
then condition will make sure that the
error will be reached only if the age of
the user is less than 18 years now let's
move ahead and complete this execution
section
right below the if-then block I have a
DBMS output statement which is again
printing a string this string will get
printed only if the age of the user that
is the input value is 80 or above for
the sake of simplicity I just have only
one statement here but if your code
requires it then you can write any
number of executable statements but for
the demonstration purpose I think this
will work
then at the end we have our exception
handler for the error which we raised a
raised application error procedure does
not allow us to name our exception does
we can only handle the exception Reeves
using the same procedure into the others
exception handler inside the exception
handler I have a DBMS output statement
in which I call the function SQL e RRM
this is a utility function provided by
Oracle which retrieves the error message
for the last occurred exception now
let's try to execute this program here
we have our input pop-up box with the
custom message which we specified in the
accept statement let's input some value
say 12 and the input is less than 18
does we get the error string displayed
back to us did you notice that along
with the error message we also get the
error number which is the one we
specified in a raised application error
procedure let's take another try but
this time we will input our value which
is greater than 80 say 35 no error this
time so that is how we associate an
error number with the error message
using reads application enter procedure
hope you learn something new do make
sure to visit the blog to learn what are
the shortcomings of declaring
user-defined exceptions using raise
application error procedure with other
information link is in the description
thanks for watching and make sure to
subscribe as in the next tutorial we
will learn how to leave an error and
associate an error message and number to
wait also to make sure to share this PL
sequel tutorial on your social media
thanks once again this is the PL sequel
tutorial on how to declare user defined
exception using lead application error
