Welcome back once again
I am Manish from RebellionRider.com. This
is the second video on Tablespaces in Oracle
Database series and in this video we will
learn how to create a smallfile as well as
bigfile permanent tablespace in oracle database.
Before moving ahead I would suggest you to
watch my previous video on the introduction
of tablespace for the better understanding
of the concept the link is in the description
box.
So without wasting much of your time let’s
start the tutorial.
The first step in the creation of any type
of tablespace is to connect to your database.
You can do this using sys user or any other
user which either has sysdba privileges or
CREATE TABLESPACE system privilege. I will
connect to my database using SYS user with
sysdba privileges.
Ok here we are
First I will demonstrate how to create small
file permanent tablespace and for this demonstration
I will create a tablespace by the name of
RebellionRider with two datafiles rebel1.dbf
and rebel2.dbf.
To create a tablespace in oracle database
we use CREATE TABLESPACE ddl statement. Let’s
see how to write this ddl.
This ddl statement starts with CREATE TABLESPACE
where both of which are oracle reserved keyword.
--- CREATE TABLESPACE
Next, since we are creating a small file tablespace
thus we can explicitly specify this by writing
keyword small file in between CREATE and TABLESPACE.
CREATE SMALLFILE TABLESPACE
Though this step is optional since oracle
by default creates all the tablespaces as
small file tablespace yet it is a good practice
as it makes your code more readable. After
CREATE SMALLFILE TABLESPACE you have to give
the name of your tablespace. Tablespace name
is completely user defined which means you
can give whatever name you want to your tablespace.
In my case I will name my tablespace RebellionRider.
CREATE SMALLFILE TABLESPACE RebellionRider
Next we will see some clauses necessary in
the creation of our tablespace. First clause
will be DATAFILE. Using this clause we can
add one or more datafiles to our tablespace.
As I mentioned in my previous tutorial that
Tablespaces are nothing but logical storage
units made up of one or more datafiles.
As I mentioned at the start that our tablespace
will have 2 data files Rebel1 and Rebel2.dbf
so let’s add these 2 files to our tablespace
RebellionRider.
CREATE SMALLFILE TABLESPACE RebellionRider
DATAFILE ‘c:\app\tbsp_demo\Rebel1.dbf’
To add the datafile you just have to write
the name of the clause which is DATAFILE and
then inside the single quote you either have
to specify the name of datafile along with
the directory path where you want to put your
datafile as I did here or you can simply write
the name of your datafile. In this case oracle
engine will create your datafile and placed
it in the default directory.
After writing the name of your datafile you
have to specify the size for your datafile
using SIZE clause which is mandatory, if you
forget to do so then oracle engine will give
you an error. Let’s say I want to specify
100MB as the size for my datafile rebel1.
For that I will write.
CREATE SMALLFILE TABLESPACE RebellionRider
DATAFILE ‘c:\app\tbsp_demo\Rebel1.dbf’
SIZE 100M
‘M’ here specifies Megabyte similarly
you can write ‘G’ for Gigabyte and ‘T’
for Terabyte. Now let’s add another datafile
i.e. rebel2 to our tablespace RebellionRider.
For that just put comma a (,) and write the
name along with the path and size of your
datafile.
CREATE SMALLFILE TABLESPACE RebellionRider
DATAFILE ‘c:\app\tbsp_demo\Rebell1.dbf’
SIZE 100M, ‘c:\app\tbsp_demo\Rebell2.dbf’
SIZE 100M
Now next is LOGGING CLAUSE: The logging clause
lets you specify whether creation of a database
object will be logged in the redo log file
(LOGGING) or not (NOLOGGING). Logging clause
has two options
1. Logging and
2. Nologging
If you specify Logging then oracle engine
will Generate redo logs for creation of tables,
indexes and partitions, and for subsequent
inserts.
CREATE SMALLFILE TABLESPACE RebellionRider
DATAFILE
‘c:\app\tbsp_demo\Rebel1.dbf’ SIZE 100M,
‘c:\app\tbsp_demo\Rebel2.dbf’ SIZE 100M
LOGGING
But in case you do not want to generate redo
logs for all those operations which I just
mentioned then simply write “NOLOGGING”.
However logging is always better as it makes
recovery much easier.
CREATE SMALLFILE TABLESPACE RebellionRider
DATAFILE ‘c:\app\tbsp_demo\Rebell1.dbf’
SIZE 100M, ‘c:\app\tbsp_demo\Rebell2.dbf’
SIZE 100M NOLOGGING
Let it be on LOGGING as its oracle recommended
and can be helpful in catastrophic events.
Next clause is EXTENT Management. Extents
are the group of fixed number of bytes of
disk space called data blocks or in simple
words extents are a group of data blocks.
You can use tablespaces either with local
extent management or the older technique of
dictionary extent management. The local extent
management clause lets you specify how the
extents of the tablespace will be managed.
Oracle gives you two ways to manage extents
1. Uniform
2. Auto allocate
Uniform option tells the database to allocate
and de-allocate extents in the tablespace
with the same unvarying size that you can
specify or let extents default to 1MB. UNIFORM
is the default for temporary tablespaces and
cannot be specified for undo tablespaces.
The clause for uniform extent management will
be
CREATE SMALLFILE TABLESPACE rebellionrider
DATAFILE ‘C:\app\TBSP_DEMO\Rebel1.dbf’
SIZE 100M, ‘C:\app\TBSP_DEMO\Rebell2.dbf’
SIZE 100M LOGGING EXTENT MANAGEMENT LOCAL
UNIFORM SIZE 100M;
On the other hand AUTOALLOCATE specifies that
the tablespace is system managed. Users cannot
specify an extent size. The clause for auto
allocate extent management will be
CREATE SMALLFILE TABLESPACE rebellionrider
DATAFILE ‘C:\app\TBSP_DEMO\Rebell1.dbf’
SIZE 100M, ‘C:\app\TBSP_DEMO\Rebell2.dbf’
SIZE 100M LOGGING EXTENT MANAGEMENT LOCAL
AUTOALLCOATE;
Simply write auto allocate on the place of
size because in this mode oracle engine decides
the sizes for the extents of your tablespace.
Next clause is Segment Space management, similar
to the extents Segments are the collection
of one or more extents. For tablespaces that
have local extent management, you can use
either manual or automatic segment space management.
Let’s see how to write segment space allocation
clause.
CREATE SMALLFILE TABLESPACE rebellionrider
DATAFILE ‘C:\app\TBSP_DEMO\Rebell1.dbf’
SIZE 100M, ‘C:\app\TBSP_DEMO\Rebell2.dbf’
SIZE 100M LOGGING EXTENT MANAGEMENT LOCAL
UNIFORM SIZE 100M SEGMENT SPACE MANAGEMENT MANUAL;
Unlike extent management here we do not have
to specify the size. Execution of this query
will set your segment space management on
manual mode. But Oracle strongly recommends
AUTOMATIC segment space management for permanent
and locally managed tablespaces. So let’s
change our segment space management from manual
to auto mode. To do so you simply have to
write
CREATE SMALLFILE TABLESPACE rebellionrider
DATAFILE ‘C:\app\TBSP_DEMO\Rebell1.dbf’
SIZE 100M, ‘C:\app\TBSP_DEMO\Rebell2.dbf’
SIZE 100M LOGGING EXTENT MANAGEMENT LOCAL
UNIFORM SIZE 100M SEGMENT SPACE MANAGEMENT AUTO;
Ok all the necessary settings have been done.
Now let’s execute this ddl statement and
create our tablespace. Tablespace RebellionRider
created. That’s how we create a permanent
small file tablespace.
Now let’s quickly see how to create a big
file permanent tablespace, but before that
let me quickly close this script output ok.
Process of creating a big file tablespace
is pretty similar to the process of creating
small file tablespace with some minute changes.
Let’s create a big file tablespace.
CREATE BIGFILE TABLESPACE &quot;RebellionRider2&quot; 
DATAFILE 'C:\APP\MANN\ORADATA\ORCL\Big_Rebell.dbf' SIZE 1G LOGGING 
EXTENT MANAGEMENT LOCAL 
SEGMENT SPACE MANAGEMENT AUTO
As this time we are creating a big file tablespace
thus we have to write keyword BIGFILE in between
create and tablespace keywords which specifies
that we want to create a big file tablespace.
Next if you remember I told you that a big
file tablespace can have only 1 datafile thus
unlike the smallfile tablespace this time
we have only one data file here which is big
rebell . dbf placed in this particular directory
and its of 1 gigabyte size. Rest of the clauses
are the same as previously discussed.
Always remember no two tablespaces and datafiles
in a database can have the same name. Thus
I have named my big file tablespace as RebellionRider2.
Let’s execute this query
Big file tablespace created
That’s how we create a big permanent tablespace.
