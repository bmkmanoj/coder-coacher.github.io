never got the chance to talk about them
in the study we will discuss collection
methods most of Internet
I am manish from rebellionrider.com
greece pl/sql tutorial is all about
collection methods in oracle database
before jumping ahead let me take a quick
second and ask you to like this video as
it keeps me motivated for creating more
interesting content also if you are new
to my channel then please subscribe so
without wasting much of your time let's
get started what our collection methods
collection methods are PL sequel
built-in functions and procedures which
can be used in conjunction with
collections so what they can do for you
using PL sequel collection method you
can get the information as well as alter
the content of the collection now you
must be wondering how many collection
methods do we have in Oracle database we
have three collection procedures and
seven collection functions in total we
have 10 collection methods you can see
the names of all these 10 collection
methods on your screen now next question
that comes in the mind is how do we use
collection methods in Oracle PL sequel
collection methods can be used using dot
notation let's take a look at the syntax
you first write the name of your
collection followed by the dot operator
and then the name of the collection
method if the collection method requires
parameters then you have to specify
those parameters inside the parentheses
this syntax remains pretty much the same
for all the collection methods that is a
quick introduction to collection methods
in the upcoming videos we will explore
each of the above mentioned methods
individually in detail but before
winding up this tutorial I just want to
tell you that by taking into the
consideration the certification exam and
interview as well as on public demand I
have drafted a very detailed blog on
associative array in this blog I have
answered all the important questions
about the thing go ahead read the blog
and Neil the interview as well as the
exam find a link in the description
