Welcome back once again.
I am Manish From RebellionRider.com. As promised
in today’s tutorial we will learn how to
write Dynamic SQL using Execute Immediate
statement.
So without wasting much of your time let’s
start the tutorial. So before we start writing
an example let’s first quickly see what
is an Execute Immediate statement in Oracle
Database.
Using Execute Immediate we can parse and execute
any SQL statement or a PL/SQL block dynamically
in Oracle Database.
Execute Immediate is best suited for those
SQL statements which return a single row of
results. If your statement returns more than
one row of results then there are other ways
which we will discuss in future videos. Let’s
quickly take a look at the syntax of execute
immediate statement.
EXECUTE IMMEDIATE dynamic_query
[INTO user_defined_variable-1, user_defined_variable-2…]
[USING bind_argument-1, bind_argument-2…]
[RETURNING|RETURN-INTO clause];
Syntax starts with the reserved phrase EXECUTE
IMMEDIATE followed by that we have to write
our query. This query could be a SQL statement
or a PL/SQL block. Compiler treats the dynamic
query as a string of VARCHAR2 data type thus
you have to make sure that you enclosed your
query into a pair of single quotes. We will
learn how to write a dynamic query properly
for execute immediate when we will do the
example.
Then we have an INTO clause. Using this clause
we specify the list of the user defined variables
which will hold the values returned by dynamic
SELECT statement. It is very similar to the
SELECT-INTO statement. Also it is an optional
clause, if you don’t require it then you
can omit it.
Next we have the USING clause. In case you
have used a bind variable in your dynamic
query then this clause will enable you to
specify the values for that bind variable
which will get substituted during the runtime
accordingly. Also, this is again an optional
clause.
Then we have the RETURNING or RETURN INTO
clause. It is sort of opposite to the USING
clause. Where in using clause we are supplying
the values to the dynamic query here in RETURNING
INTO clause we get the values returned by
the dynamic query and store them into the
specified list of bind arguments.
That sums up our syntax.
Before moving ahead I want to ask you guys
to give this video a thumbs up and share it
with your friends. Because your every single
like and share keeps me motivated to produce
more such videos. Thanks
Now let’s quickly do an example. In this
example we will see how to write a DML SELECT
statement using EXECUTE IMMEDIATE with INTO
clause in Oracle Database. Like always I will
try to keep the example as easy and simple
as possible so that we can understand how
to write an ‘Execute Immediate’ statement
properly. Let’s do it.
SET SERVEROUTPUT ON;
DECLARE
sql_qry VARCHAR2 (150);
emp_tot NUMBER(3);
Here is the declaration section of our PL/SQL
block. In this section we have declared two
variables. The first variable is sql_qry of
VARCHAR 2 type. We will use this variable
to store the SELECT statement which we want
to execute with our EXECUTE IMMEDIATE statement.
As this variable is going to hold a DML statement
thus we have to make sure that it’s got
a sufficient data width. In my case I have
assigned 150, it should be enough. If it is
not then we will change it later on.
After that we have another user defined variable
emp_tot. We will be using this variable with
INTO clause to hold the data returned by our
SELECT statement.
Now let’s write the execution section.
BEGIN
sql_qry:= 'SELECT count (*) FROM employees';
EXECUTE IMMEDIATE sql_qry INTO emp_tot;
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE (emp_tot);
END;
/
Here is our execution section. As you can
see we only have three statements inside this
section. Let’s see what are these.
Statement 1: In the first statement we are
assigning a valid SQL query to the variable
sql_qry. The query which we are assigning
to the variable sql_qry is a SELECT statement
which is returning the total number of rows
of the employees table.
There are a few precautions which we have
to take while writing the query for dynamic
SQL processing. We will discuss them in a
bit but first let’s see what is the next
statement?
Statement 2: The second statement is the EXECUTE
IMMEDITAE – INTO statement. If you take
a look at this statement then you will see
that, right after writing the reserved phrase
execute immediate we write the name of the
variable sql_qry. The same variable into which
we stored the SELECT statement.
On execution the runtime engine will replace
this variable with the content it is holding,
which in our case is a SELECT statement. If
there is no error then the runtime engine
will execute the underlying SELECT statement
and return its result if there is any.
Our SELECT statement is returning a value
which is the total number of rows of employees
table. Using INTO clause of EXECUTE IMMEDIATE
statement we are storing that returning value
into the variable emp_tot.
If you want, you can skip the first statement
completely just by writing the SQL query directly
after the reserved phrase EXECUTE IMMEDIATE.
Like this.
But I like the former way of coding. Because
it makes your code look neat and clean as
well as helps you in keeping a track on your
query if in case you ever want to change or
modify it. Anyways
Statement 3: The third statement is an output
statement using which we are displaying the
value of the emp_tot variable back to the
user.
Now let’s execute this program and see what
the output is?
Here is our output.
Now let’s come to the precaution part which
I mentioned earlier. There are two very small
things which we have to take care of while
writing a SQL query for Execute Immediate
statement.
First, enclose the query into single quotes.
Execute immediate treats the SQL query as
a string of VARCHAR2 data type. Thus it becomes
mandatory for us to enclose the query inside
the single quotes.
Second, No semi colons. Usually when we write
a SQL query we terminate it with a semicolon
(;) but in case of execute immediate whenever
you will be writing a query you have to remember
that you do not terminate your query with
a semicolon inside the single quotes.
On your screen you can see an example. Here
I am showing you the wrong way of writing
a query for Execute Immediate statement.
As you can see here we put the semi colon
inside the single quotes with the query as
well as outside the quotes to end the statement.
Here the first semi colon which is inside
the single quotes is wrong but the second
semi colon which is right outside the single
quotes is perfectly fine.
Now let me show the correct way of writing
this same query. Here we are. As you can see
this time, there is only one semi colon which
is outside the single quotes and none inside
the quotes.
You can head over to my blog to learn the
proper way of writing SQL Query directly into
your execute immediate statement. Link is
in the description.
Let’s call it for the day.
This is the tutorial on Execute Immediate
with INTO clause in Oracle Database. Hope
you enjoyed watching and learnt something
new. Please don’t forget to give this video
a thumbs up &amp;amp; also share it with your friends.
Most importantly subscribe as in the next
tutorial we will be playing with bind variables
with execute immediate statements.
