rebellionrider.com where we make
learning SQL pl/sql and oracle database
form now that we have learned the
concepts of first bound clause which is
lower and upper bound in the last
tutorial let's move ahead and learn how
to use for all a statement with the
second bound clause that is indices of
as we learned in the previous tutorial
that for all a statement takes the data
from the collection and stores it into a
table does we will start this tutorial
by creating a table for holding the data
here is the table this table has only
one column mu l underscore tab of number
data type except from the name the
structure of this table is pretty much
the same as the one we created in the
previous tutorial let's execute this
create table statement and create our
table table created so before we jump on
to this tutorial and start learning how
to write a foreign statement with
indices of pound clause let's just do a
quick demonstration and learn what
exactly is the need of indices of pound
clause when we have a bound Clause like
lower and upper bound here is a pl/sql
block in this block I have created a
nested table with the name my underscore
nested underscore table right after
creating this nested table
I have also initialized its first ten
indexes by storing ten numeric elements
into it using its collection variable ve
are under score and D this nested table
is a dense collection because the
indexes of this collection are populated
constitutively but if you look at the
first statement in the execution section
you will find that using collection
method delete I have deleted data from
index 3 to index 6 which means that now
the indexes of our collection is not
populated sequentially that changes the
nature of our collection
from dance to spas followed by the
collection method delete call we have a
for loop which will print the data is
stored into the index if it exists
otherwise it will print a formatted
string alerting the user that there is
no data stored into the index let's
execute this program and see the result
here is the result
as you can see that except from the
index number three to six all the other
indexes have some data stored into them
now we are sure that our collection my
underscore nested underscore table is a
Espace collection now let's see what
happens if we use for all statement with
the first bound clause which is lower
and upper bound with this is pass
collection first let's just close this
output panel okay now let's modify this
code the work of this for loop is to
show us whether we have data stored into
the index or not I think it has done its
work and we don't need it anymore so
let's get rid of this and write our for
all statement in its place
here we have our for all a statement
using this statement we are taking the
data from our collection and storing it
into the table T UT underscore 78 also
in this statement we have used 1 as our
lower bound and 10 as an upper bound
which means this statement will traverse
through the index number 1 to index
number 10 of our collection let's
execute this program now and see what
will happen here we got an error saying
the element at index number 3 does not
exist the shortcoming of the lower and
upper bound Clause is that we cannot use
it with Espace collection we can easily
solve this error by using a bound clause
like in disease of our values of so
let's move on and learn how to overcome
this shortcoming of lower and upper
bound clause by using indices of with
for all statement indices of bound
clause comes handy when the bulk data
processing involves our Espace
collection let's see how to write a for
all statement with indices of clause
once again just to save the time let's
modify this same block this time we just
have to modify the for all statement but
first let's close this script output ok
now let's do it
here is our modified for all statement
let's take a look the statement it
starts with the keyword for all followed
by a loop counter you can name it
whatever you want like here we named it
idx followed by the loop counter we have
another keyword in and then are bound
clause that is indices of right after
writing the result phrase indices of we
have to specify the collection whose
data you want to use like in our case we
want to use the data of our collection
which is my underscore nested underscore
table as we know we reference the
collection in the program through its
collection variable that is why we wrote
the name of the collection variable var
underscore nd here in our case var
underscore Andy is a collection variable
of our collection my underscore nested
table in that is the definition of our
for all statement using this statement
we are inserting the data from our
collection into the MU L underscore tab
column of table tu t underscore 78
that's all about this four whole
statement just to verify that we have
fact and inserted the right number of
rows let's add one more thing this
variable will hold the total number of
rows
inserted into the table after fetching
them from the collection
here in the execution section we have
added two statements among these the
first one is a select into statement
which will return the total number of
rows inserted into the table tu t
underscore 78 and we'll store that value
into the variable T ot underscore our EC
which we just declared remember here I'm
assuming that the table is freshly
created and no data is stored into it
the second statement is an output
statement which is displaying back the
value is stored into the variable T ot
underscore Ric with a formatted string
can you guess what could be the result
of this DBMS output statement yes the
correct answer is 6y okay let me show
you why in declaration section we
initialized our nested table with ten
elements then in the execution section
we deleted four elements after deleting
those four elements from index three to
six we are left with only six elements
that is why the answer of this output
statement should be six let's execute
and see the result as we guessed the
output is 6 which means we have felt six
elements from the collection and stored
them into our table since we haven't put
any restrictions in the program
therefore each time we execute it it
will keep on adding the same six
elements again and again so for example
if the first output is 6 then on second
execution it will be 12 because the
program will append the same six
elements again into the table now you
guys have to tell me how to solve this
problem go ahead and comment your ideas
down below in that being said let's wind
up today's tutorial so in this tutorial
we learnt how to overcome the
shortcoming of the first bound Clause
along with how to use for old statement
with is past collection using indices of
clause hope you enjoyed watching and
learn something new though make sure to
