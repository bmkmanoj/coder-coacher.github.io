again i am manish from
rebellionrider.com so far in this series
of collection methods we have learned
the first two collection functions which
are count and exist so let's take it
further and learn about the next few
functions in today's video these
collection functions are named first and
last yes you heard it right today we
will be covering two functions in this
video but before that if you are new to
this channel then go ahead subscribe and
be the first one to get the updates also
do make sure to smash that thumbs up
button and like the video that being
said let's move ahead we use collection
functions first and last to know the
first and last index values defined in a
collection you can use both these
functions with all three types of
collections that are associative array
nested table and V arrays which we have
learnt in previous videos both three
functions return null when applied to an
empty collection or when applied to an
initialized collection that has no
elements and there is collection is null
exception when applied to an
uninitialized collection if we want to
read more about these functions then you
can visit the blog I will leave the link
in the description of this video but for
now let's move ahead to do some examples
and try to understand these collection
methods more clearly let's start with a
very simple example
here we created a nested table ante
underscore tab which is local to this PL
sequel block after creating this table
we also initialized rate using the
connection variable see o L underscore
var and store some data into it now
let's move ahead here we have an
execution section inside this execution
section we have two output statements
first output statement will written the
first subscript number of the collection
whereas the second output statement will
return the last subscript number of the
nasty table in our case the first output
statement will return 1 which is the
lowest subscript and second output
statement will return 5 which is the
highest subscript into which we store
the data let's execute and see the
result here is the result now you must
be wondering what is the utility of
these two functions
this is because function first is always
going to return 1 and the lowest
subscript which is holding the data and
function last is always going to return
the highest subscript of the collection
yes it is true that is exactly what
these two functions are going to do
unless someone has trimmed the
collection or deleted the elements from
the collection if first element of
nested table is deleted the collection
method first will return the value which
is greater than 1 let's try this
in this code everything is same except
we have modified the execution section
in this section I deleted the first
element of the nasty table now let's see
what will be the output of the
collection method first as you can see
this time the output is 2 because after
deleting the first index 2 is the lowest
index in the collection which is holding
some value similarly if you trimmed the
collection from the end then the
collection method last will return the
next highest index in the collection
holding some value let's try this also
here we trim the last index from our
nested table let's execute this program
and see what will be the output of
collection method last this time here is
the result
this time the output is 4 instead of 5
that is how you can utilize the
collection method first and last when I
was explaining this same concept in a
class a student raised her hand and
asked me sir so far we saw that these
functions return the index number of the
collection what if we want to see the
data stored in to those index is there a
way to see the data stored into the
index using these collection methods
that is first and last what do you guys
think can we get the data stored into
the first and last index of the
collection using these collection
methods check out the blog to find the
answer of this question these are a few
ways of using first and last collection
method now let your creativity fly and
find out various other ways to use this
function if you find something new then
comment down below and let me know also
