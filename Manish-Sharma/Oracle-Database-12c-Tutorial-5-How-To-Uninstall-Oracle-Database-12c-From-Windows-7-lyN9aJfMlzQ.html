I am Manish from RebellionRider.com and 
I am back once again with another Oracle Database
tutorial and today we will see how we can
completely uninstall oracle database 12c from
your windows system. The process of un-installation
which I am going to show you in this tutorial
is completely manual.
So without further ado let’s move ahead
and see how to un-install oracle database
12c from windows 7. Though I am demonstrating
you the process on windows 7 but you can follow
the same process to uninstall oracle database
from any windows system whether it’s windows
8 or Windows server 2012 or any other version.
Steps are the same.
Let’s start
Step1: Delete the Environment variable.
While installing oracle database you must
have come across PRVF-3929 environment variable
PATH error saying that “environment variable
path is too long”. Just to avoid this kind
of error we will delete the oracle home entry
from the environment variable path in windows.
To do that, right click on your computer’s
icon and open the “Properties”. Here on
the left hand side panel of the properties
windows click and open “Advance System settings”
This will open up a system property panel
for you. Here on this system property panel
under the “Advance Tab” click and open
“Environment Variable” button. This will
give you the environment variable panel.
On this panel under the “System Variable”
section find variable by the name of PATH.
Double click and open it. Here we will delete
the oracle home entry but before performing
the deletion I would suggest you to take its
backup.
For that hit “control + A” and select
the whole environment path string and copy
it then save this string in an empty text
document. I have already taken my back up
so I will jump on to the deletion of the Oracle
home directory entry.
The Oracle home path in my case looks like
this
in your case path may different. So let’s
delete this oracle home path. Hit delete done
now just click OK and come out.
Step2: Delete the Registries
During the installation, oracle database makes
some registries in windows system to store
the information of its configurations such
as configuration of oracle services which
runs in the background, information of the
database such as Oracle home path, path for
oracle base directory etc. For complete deletion
of oracle database we need to delete all these
registries.
If you decide to re-install oracle database
in future then deletion of all these registries
can save you from various errors.
So let’s delete the registries. First let’s
close this properties window and now open
up your run dialogue box by pressing windows
key and R simultaneously. Here we are; And
in the run dialogue box write “regedit”
then hit enter. Accept the warning
This will open up your registry editor.
Before moving ahead a quick warning, this
specific step must be done under parent’s
guidance. So if you are under age then please
do not perform this step. [laugh] Ok Jokes
apart
Messing with registries can harm your system
and can be catastrophic. Therefore I would
highly suggest you to first take backup of
the registries and then proceed ahead. If
you mess up your system then I will not be
responsible for that. You can visit my blog
as there I have explained registry backup
process in detail.
Having said that let’s move ahead and delete
the registries.
Click and open HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE and then
go to sub directory SOFTWARE. And under the
software Search for Oracle Directory – Here
it is. Right click this oracle directory and
Delete it. Now collapse this Software directory.
Next expand the “System” directory then
“Current Control Set” and the go to “services”.
Here under the Services directory you have
to delete all the directories whose names
start with “Oracle”. And as you can see
here I have 5 directories whose names start
with “Oracle” so I will delete all these
five directories. Ok done now close this registry
editor.
Next you have to re start your system so that
your operating system can blend in all the
settings which we just altered. So I will
restart my system. And I am back again. Let’s
move ahead
Step 3: Delete the Oracle Home Directory.
All the oracle windows services have been
deleted as we have deleted all the oracle
registries from the system which means that
now we are free to delete all the files of
oracle database from the folder. Thus next
we will delete the Oracle home directory and
its root from the system.
My Oracle home directory is in my C drive.
I have named it Oracle DB 12c during the installation,
remember. This oracle db 12c folder has all
oracle related files and folder inside it.
Thus I will delete this Oracle DB 12c folder
completely.
If in case your folder is not getting deleted
then don’t worry. First try to refresh your
system or you can also reboot the system then
try deleting again. If still not deleting
then re-check the services and registries
and see whether you have deleted all the oracle
registries or not, If not then delete the
all that are still left and then try deleting
the Oracle database folder again.
As you can see I just got this error don’t
worry hit cancel and then try again, as you
can see now its deleting my folder. All the
files of this folder has been deleted but
for some reason this folder is still here,
just don’t worry once again select and delete
this folder and as you can the folder has
been completely deleted from the system.
let’s move on and delete some other folders.
Step 4: Delete Directory from Program file
Next go to your program file directory and
search for folder with the name Oracle. As
you can see I have one here and now delete
this folder. Folder deleted
Step 5: Delete Directory from Start Menu.
Next we have to delete the directory from
start menu. For that open you start menu and
go to all program and here search for Oracle
Folder. Here it is mine. Now Right click this
folder and select “Properties”.
From the properties window copy the location.
Now open your Run dialogue box and paste the
location hit enter. You can also use your
explorer to navigate to this location.
Here in this location search for your Oracle
folder. Here is mine and now delete this folder
also. Folder deleted
Now let’s jump to the next step.
Step 6: Clear the Temporary files and Recycle
bin
But first close this window, this one also
and this one also
now to clear the temporary files again open
your Run dialogue box and write %temp% this
will open the temporary folder. Here delete
all the files.
Next come to your desktop and empty your recycle
bin.
Step 7: Delete the Oracle user
Next and the last step is to delete the oracle
home user which we created during the installation
of the oracle database. In order to do so,
right click computer icon and select manage
and inside the computer management window
click “Local User Groups” and then click
and open “Users” folders. From the list
of the user you can delete the ones which
you have created as an oracle home user during
the installation. In my case its RebellionRider,
Right click and Select Delete. Accept the
warning user deleted close this computer management
window.
That’s it, that’s all you have to do to
uninstall the oracle database 12c from your
system.
With this I will wind up today’s tutorial
on How to uninstall oracle database 12c from
windows system.
