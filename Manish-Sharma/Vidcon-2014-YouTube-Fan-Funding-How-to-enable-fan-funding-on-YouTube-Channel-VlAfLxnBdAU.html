On Thursday 26 june at Vidcon 2014 YouTube
announced several new features for creators
as well as for viewers.
For example now you can upload video on 60
fps and automatic subtitles along with subtitles
contributed by fans in their preferred language
and yes fan funding as well!
The YouTube Creator studio helps you to keep
in touch with your channel statistics even
on the go.
Moreover there is a new fan funding feature
to help your fans support you.
This means if you are a content creator like
me then now your fans can help you through
monetary contribution similar to patreon or
say kick starter.
It�s like a tip on your video.
They can contribute any amount of money through
this service.
Although Google has announced it in beta stage
but according to google blog - few channels
like king of randoms, the young turks and
others are already trying it.
And if you want to have this kind of fan funding
feature for your channel as well then you
can request it from google by simply signing
up.
You just need to fill out a very simple form
and submit it.
Thereafter Google will verify your form and
will let you know whether you are eligible
or not.
If you are lucky enough you will get this
feature enabled on your channel.
You can also read about other updates announced
from Google on Google blog at vidcon2014
Link for the sign up form and Google blog
is in the description box below.
Hope you enjoyed watching.
Don�t forget to like and subscribe to my
channel.
Will see you soon have a great day.
