rebellionrider.com today in this
tutorial we will learn how to uninstall
Oracle database 11g from Windows 10 64
bit version though I am performing this
Oracle 11g and installation on Windows
10 64 bit but you can also follow this
same process for Windows 10 32 bit
version as steps are the same that being
said let's see how to uninstall Oracle
11g from windows 10
if you are planning to reinstall the
Oracle database and do not want to face
the error which says environment
variable path is too long then in that
case you must leave the variable
beforehand so that your next
installation is a smooth and glitch-free
so let's see how to delete Oracle 11g
environment variable first right click
on your disk PC icon in Windows 10 and
select properties once you are into the
properties of your computer then select
the advanced system settings from the
left-hand sidebar doing so will open up
the system properties there is a button
called environment variable at the
bottom of the Advanced tab of system
properties click this button and launch
the environment variable window on this
window we have two sections that are
user variables and system variables come
to the system variable section and find
a variable with the name path double
click and open the edit environment
variable windows in Windows 10
environment variables are better
organized in comparison to previous
version which make their management less
painful anyways you must be wondering
among all these strings which one is the
environment variable for Oracle 11g
and which one should you delete in my
case the environment variable for my
Oracle database looks like this in your
case also it should look more or less
similar to this a string but depending
on your installation it can be different
whatsoever at least you get the idea so
select the string you want to delete and
press the delete button that's all you
have to do in the fossa staff
once you are done with the environment
variable the next thing which you have
to delete is the windows registries for
Oracle database software this step is
very crucial and meticulous you have got
to be very careful while deleting the
registries one wrong move can cause
severe damage so let's see how to delete
Oracle database 11g s windows registries
first open up your run command box by
pressing Windows key + r key
simultaneously in order to open up the
registry editor in your windows you have
to write vlag edit in your run dialog
box press ok and here we are there are
two sets of registries that we have to
delete here one is for Oracle database
11g software and another one is for all
those services which runs in the
background and are responsible for
proper working of your Oracle database
let's start with the later option and
delete the registries for Oracle
database services first to delete these
service registries first go to H key
underscore local underscore machine
directory and then go to system
subdirectory after that go to
currentcontrolset and then services here
in this services directory you will find
all the registries which we have to
delete in order to find the registries
for Oracle database services from this
list press alphabet o on your keyboard
and navigation will take you to all
those registries whose name starts with
O and luckily all the Oracle database
registries name starts with the world
Oracle for Oracle database 11g we have
each windows registries make sure to
delete only these and nothing else to
delete these registries right click on
them and choose Tilley do the same with
all these 8 registries so as we have
deleted all the Oracle database services
registries now it's time to get rid of
windows registries for Oracle database
software and to delete that registry
again come back
to edge key underscore local underscore
machine folder and this time go to the
folder software the name of the registry
which we are looking here is Oracle so
again press alphabet o and find the same
here it is let me expand this register
for you okay just give me a second
great okay but before deleting this
registry makes your only Oracle database
11g software is installed in your system
in case if you have other software from
Oracle installed then take a good look
at the content of this folder and delete
those only anyways taking a backup of
registries is highly recommended you can
learn how to take the backup of your
windows registries and other interesting
stuff by reading the blog on the same
topic on my website link is in the
description that being said let's delete
this folder okay done so now all the
registries of your Oracle 11g have been
deleted next in order to bring these
changes to effect you must restart your
system so I am going to restart my
system we'll be back in a second Here I
am my system is restarted and all set to
jump ahead on third step
so as we have now deleted all the Oracle
registries so we are free to delete all
the Oracle database folders from our
Windows 10 let's do it so locate the
base directory of your Oracle database
in most of the cases the name of the
base directory of Oracle is app and it's
located directly in the C Drive or in
the main drive where your OS is
installed here is mine now delete this
directory in case you are struct and it
won't delete then don't panic take a
deep breath restart your system and try
deleting again also make sure you have
done all the above steps properly or you
can try deleting the files in Windows
safe mode
okay Oracle home is deleted next go to
the Program Files folder and here find
the directory with the name Oracle and
delete that also here is mine and it's
deleted next we have to delete the start
menu entry for Oracle database to do
that go to the location which is
flashing on your screen in your windows
10 don't worry if you missed it as you
can find this location path in the
description below as well as on my blog

database folder and delete it here is
