Welcome back once again
I am Manish from RebellionRider.com. Today
in this tutorial we will talk about variables
in PL/SQL and learn how to declare and initialize
them. There are different ways of initializing
a variable in PL/SQL we will see all those
in this tutorial. So keep watching.
First things first – what are variables?
Variables are nothing but a place holder in
computer memory that holds some data. We call
them variables because the value or say data
they hold is of variable nature which can
be changed at any point in your program. Every
variable must have a valid name, a data type
and a data width. Like various other programming
languages in PL/SQL also variable must be
declared prior to its use.
Right now I am on my SQL Developer but you
can use whatever IDE or tool you want. So
let’s write some code and try to understand
this concept more clearly. As I said, in PL/SQL
every variable must be declared prior to its
use and the declaration of the variables or
even other objects can only be done in the
declaration section of the block in PL/SQL.
So let’s declare a variable.
SET SERVEROUTPUT ON;
DECLARE
v_test VARCHAR2(15);
Ohk, here we have declared a variable v_test.
Declaration of a variable means announcement
of your variable to the compiler. As soon
as the compiler comes across to the signature
of your variable it first checks for the validity
and allocates the memory according to the
data type of the variable.
Anyways let’s come back to our code. First
this is an anonymous PL/SQL block in which
the first line of our code is SET SERVEROUTPUT
ON. For the time being just understand that
this is a special PL/SQL command which allows
the server to communicate with you and enable
the display of result on your default output
device. I will do a separate tutorial explaining
this command as it’s a very important topic
from both Interview and examination point
of view.
In the second line we have a keyword DECLARE
which indicates the Declaration section of
our block. Inside our declaration section
we have our variable which is v_test with
data type varchar2 and data width 15. Followed
by the semicolon which indicates the “End
of Line”. That’s it that’s how we declare
a variable.
Now as we have successfully declared our variable,
next we have to initialize it. In PL/SQL like
various other languages when we declare a
variable it’s completely empty and holds
no data. Thus to make a variable useful we
need to put some data into it, and this process
of assigning value to the variable is called
variable Initialization.
So let’s see how to initialize a variable
in PL/SQL.
Unlike declaration of a variable which can
only be done in declaration section of PL/SQL
block the initialization can be done anywhere
inside in your program. Yes, you can initialize
a variable either in declaration section while
declaring it or in execution section or even
in exception handling section.
Let’s do an example which will help you
in understanding this. First we will initialize
the variable in declaration section.
Suppose I want to store a character string
“RebellionRider” into our variable v_test.
SET SERVEROUTPUT ON;
DECLARE
v_test VARCHAR2(15) := 'RebellionRider';
As we are assigning the value which is a character
string “RebellionRider” to the variable
v_test thus we used assignment operator.
If you have noticed the assignment operator
is slightly different here than in other languages.
In PL/SQL assignment operator is combination
of colon (: ) and equal to sign which is very
unlikely compared to other programming languages
where just an equal too (=) sign is considered
as an assignment operator.
Followed by assignment operator we have our
string “RebellionRider” which we want
to store in our variable. As it’s a string
thus we have enclosed it into single quotes
and at the end we have the semi colon.
That’s how we initialize the variable in
declaration section. Now let’s see how to
initialize the PL/SQL variable in execution
section. And for this we have to write the
execution section of our anonymous block.
You can watch my previous PL/SQL tutorial
where I explained this block and Section thing
in detail. Link is in the description below.
Let’s write.
SET SERVEROUTPUT ON;
DECLARE
v_test VARCHAR2(15);
BEGIN
v_test := 'RebellionRider';
END;
You can check the value stored in your variable
by calling put line procedure of DBMS_OUTPUT
package. Let me show you how.
SET SERVEROUTPUT ON;
DECLARE
v_test VARCHAR2(15);
BEGIN
v_test := 'RebellionRider';
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(v_test );
END;
When we initialize the variable in execution
section we just write the name of the variable
followed by the assignment operator and then
the value which is a string “RebellionRider”
in our case. There is no need to write data
type and data width at this point, just make
sure the variable which you are initializing
must be declared prior to in declaration section.
As this PL/SQL block has the execution section
which means we can execute this. So let’s
execute and see the result.
Here is our result.
These are the two different ways of initializing
a variable and they are called Direct Initialization
as we are putting value directly into the
variable.
In the next tutorial I will show you how you
can fetch a value from a table of the database
and store it into the variable or say use
it to initialize the variable.
So stay tuned and don’t forget to watch
