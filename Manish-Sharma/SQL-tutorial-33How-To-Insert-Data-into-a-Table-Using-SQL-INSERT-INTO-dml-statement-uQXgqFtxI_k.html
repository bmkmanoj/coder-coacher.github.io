with another sequel tutorial in today's
simple tutorial we will learn how to
insert data into a table using insert
DML statement this is the second
tutorial in the how to insert data into
a table series before we start I want to
make one little request please subscribe
to my channel and like my videos you can
also share my videos on your social
networking and help me in reaching to
more people
thanks let's start today's tutorial for
the demonstration of insert statement I
have already created a table actually
this is the same table student which I
had used in the last tutorial let's see
the structure of student table this
table has four columns where column one
is to ID is a primary key and column two
first name has not null constraint
before moving ahead let's take a look at
the syntax of insert DML statement you
can use insert statement in two ways
first when you want to insert data only
into some specific columns here is the
syntax insert keyword is always followed
by into keyword thus our insert
statement it starts with insert into
followed by the table name in which you
want to insert 0 and then we have a list
of column enclosed in parentheses and
after that we have our keyword values
followed by the value of the column
which you want to insert again enclosed
in parentheses second when you want to
insert data into all the columns of your
table and here is the syntax syntax is
pretty similar to the previous one
except that here we do not have a list
of column name when you do not specify
the list of column name then Oracle
engine will automatically assume that
you want to insert value in all the
columns of the table which you have
specified thus it become mandatory for
you to supply value for all the columns
of your table failing to do so will
result in error there are few
restriction with both these syntax which
you can read on my website link is in
the description box
hope syntax is clear let's once again
jump to the sequel developer and do some
curri curri 1 insert data into all the
columns of table student as I have
already told you that I will be using
same student table which I have created
in the last tutorial table student has 4
column and we will be inserting
in all these four column let's write DT
but before that let me add just the
sequel developer IDE this is our student
table and as you can see right now we do
not have any data inside this student
table now let's write our for security
this is a very simple QT we are
inserting value in all four columns of
our table student but as I have already
told you while explaining the syntax
that when we are inserting values in all
the columns of a table then specifying
column names are not mandatory rather it
is optional
thus we can modify this Curie and delete
the column name list followed by the
table name student just to show you the
difference what I will do is that I will
copy and paste the Curie and modify it
so let's copy this Curie and I will
paste it here and now we will modify it
but we have to do we just need to delete
this column nameless that's it both
these Curie's are the same and perform
the same task of inserting value in all
the four columns of the table let's
execute both of them one by one
let's execute the first one one row
inserted now let's refresh and see the
result here is our first row in the
table student now let's execute the
second theory but before that we have to
change the value of s to ID column as
it's a primary key so we cannot enter a
duplicate value by the way I have done a
video on primary and foreign key
constant if you want you can watch them
I will put the link in the description
box
okay now let's quickly modify this QT
what we have to do we have to change
this value from 1 to do you can specify
any number here okay now execute this
Kure one row inserted let's refresh here
as you can see here is our second row as
you can see both dqt perform the same
task and enter the value in all the four
columns of student table there are few
things which you should always remember
such as all the column name and their
value must be separated using commas
order of values must met with the order
of column name in case you are not
specifying column name as we did in the
second query then the order of column
must be exactly the same as that of the
order of column in your table and date
and character values means the column
with the data type char or varchar and
date must be enclosed in single
quotation mark you can visit my blog and
read the full list of restriction on
insert statement I suggest you to read
as this will prevent you from writing
wrong insert Curie now let's
second Curie say we just want to enter
data only into is to ID first and last
name column and not into the contact
column we can only omit last name and
contact column as these both column
allows null values but column is to ID
is a primary key and first name has not
null constraint thus these two are
mandatory column let's write the Curie
let me make some space as I told you
while explaining the syntax that when
you want to insert data into selected or
say some specific columns and not in all
the columns then you have to specify the
column name in which you want to insert
the data let's execute the query here we
go one row inserted let's refresh and
check out the result here is our third
row as you can see we have values in our
first three column stu ID which is 3
first name which is super last name
which is men but the last column has
null value which is contact hope you
learned something in the next tutorial
we will see the third way of inserting
data into a table please do comment your
feedback that's it for today hope you
guys enjoyed watching don't forget to
