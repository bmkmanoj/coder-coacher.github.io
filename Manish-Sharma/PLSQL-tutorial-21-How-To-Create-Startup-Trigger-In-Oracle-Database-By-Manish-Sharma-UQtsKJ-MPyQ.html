I am Manish from RebellionRider.com
and I am back once again with another PL/SQL
Tutorial for beginners. Till so far we have
seen what are database event logon and logoff
triggers and how to create them with easy
to understand examples. We have also discussed
the necessary theory on database event triggers
as well.
If you haven’t watched the previous tutorials
then I highly suggest you to have a quick
look at them. Anyways let’s come to today’s
topic. Today in this video we will learn to
create the database event triggers on Startup
and Shutdown Events.
So let’s start today’s tutorial right
away.
Startup triggers execute during the startup
process of the database. In order to create
a database event trigger for shutdown and
startup events we either need to logon to
the database as a user with DBA privileges
such as sys or we must possess the ADMINISTER DATABASE TRIGGER system
privilege. You can watch the SQL Tutorial
46 for detailed knowledge of System Privileges
and how to grant them.
So let’s write the trigger using which we
can keep track of the database startup.
First let’s logon to the database using
SYS user.
Here we are. Next similar to the logon and
logoff trigger we will need to create a table
to journal the data.
Let’s quickly create one
CREATE TABLE startup_audit (
Event_type VARCHAR2(15),
event_date DATE,
event_time VARCHAR2(15)
);
So here we have the table. Next we will write
the trigger which will execute every time
the database starts up.
So let’s write the trigger but before that
let’s close this script output and clear
the screen. And here we go
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER startup_audit
AFTER STARTUP ON DATABASE
BEGIN
INSERT INTO startup_audit VALUES(
ora_sysevent,
SYSDATE,
TO_CHAR(sysdate, 'hh24:mm:ss')
);
END;
/
There it is. This trigger will execute with
every startup of your database and insert
the information into the underlying table.
That is how you can create a trigger for the
startup database event in oracle database.
You can visit my website to read about the
theories and practices of database event shutdown
trigger and learn how to create a trigger
for the shutdown event in oracle database.
With this I will wind up today’s video hope
you enjoyed watching. Stay tuned for more
interesting videos. Make sure to hit that
