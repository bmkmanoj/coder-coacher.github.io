rebellionrider.com and i am back with
the second tutorial in the PL sequel
collection in Oracle database series
today in this video we will learn what
are nested tables and how to create them
so without further ado let's go start it
and learn how to create nested tables in
Oracle database but first let's start
with a quick introduction if I ask you
to define what are nested tables what is
the simplest thing which comes to your
mind a table inside a table yes indeed
this is the simplest definition one can
think of also it is exactly the name
nested table suggests our table which is
embedded within another table is called
nested table right if we have to define
it more technically than we can say
nested tables are one dimensional
structure which are persistent and
unbounded in nature they are accessible
in SQL and pl/sql and can be used in
tables records and object definitions
since it is an unbounded PL sequel
collection as it can hold any number of
elements in an unordered set for those
who have no idea what a persistent and
unbounded collections I have explained
them in the blog post of the previous
tutorial you can find the link in the
description now let's take a look at the
syntax for creating unnecessary table in
Oracle database you can create a nested
table either inside the PL sequel block
or as a database collection type object
as both are the different aspect of
creating the Nestea table does both
carry different syntax for example here
is the syntax for creating a nested
table in PL sequel block we create a
nested table in this declaration section
of the pl/sql block in order to create a
nested table in pl/sql we use type
statement which is start with the
keyword type followed by the name of
your table which is user defined then we
have a reserved freeze which is is table
of followed by the element type which
could be either any primitive data type
or C PL sequel data type or a
user-defined type then
at the end we have an optional national
clause which makes sure that your table
doesn't have any null values now that we
have seen this syntax let's do some
examples like always I will try not to
make it too fancy and keep it simple yet
helpful to you so let's create a nasty
table in pl/sql block server output it's
set to on so that we can see the return
values let's stop here for a second and
understand these three lines as they are
going to form the piece of this program
first line is just a declare keyword
marking the beginning of the PL sequel
block which is obvious in the next line
we created our nested table in order to
avoid the confusion I mean the table my
nested table and this table will hold
the elements of number data type which
we are making sure by using the is table
of result phase in the third line we
created a variable var underscore ante
and use it to initialize the created
table to initialize the table and store
the data we first write the name of the
variable followed by the name of the
nested table with assignment operator on
the right hand side of the assignment
operator we again have the name of the
nested table followed by the data we
want to store into it enclosed inside
the parentheses do make sure the data
type of the data you pass to store into
your table must match with the data type
you mentioned while creating your nested
table now that we have created and
initialized in sa table
next we have to learn how to retrieve
the values stored into it so let's move
this program ahead as I mentioned in the
previous video that the values are
stored into the nested table collection
in the same VLC
of any third-generation programming
language this means every element of the
nested table has an index associated
with it which we can use to play with
its corresponding values that's exactly
what we are going to do now here in the
execution section using this DBMS output
statement we display the value stored at
the first index of the nested table
let's execute this program and see the
result as you can see the value stored
at the first position is 9 similarly you
can change the value here and see the
desired value for example if I want to
see the value at index 2 and 3 I will
modify the program like this
note here though the structure of
collection is very similar to the a but
the index start with the one not with
zero which is a like Eric also in
programming languages like Java in Eddy
to write the index we use the square
brackets but here we use parentheses
using a square bracket to specify the
index number industry table will slap an
error on your screen you can read my
blog for more differences between array
and collection meanwhile let's
concentrate here instead of writing
individual statements for retrieving the
values from a collection we can use the
old enter of T that is retrieving value
using loop let's see how here we use for
loop to access the values of master
table you can watch PL sequel tutorial
13 for in-depth knowledge on for loop
the iteration count of this for loop is
set from 1 to 10 10 because our nested
table has 10 elements into it and using
the function count we are making sure
that this loop will execute once for
each element of the collection let's
execute here we have the result written
from our PL sequel collection nested
table head over to the blog to find out
what data dictionary you can use to
gather the information on your
collection that is the tutorial on how
to create PL sequel nested tables
collection in Oracle database hope you
enjoyed watching
