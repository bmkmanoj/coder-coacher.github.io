What�s up Internet?
I am Manish from rebellionrider.com
And I am Back once again with another SQL
tutorial. Actually it�s more of an oracle
database tutorial and today we will learn
How to create database using Database Configuration
Assistant (DBCA).
I planned to do this particular video at the
end of this SQL tutorial series but I have
got so many requests for How to create database
using DBCA tutorial that I thought to do this
now.
I love you all guys you people are so damn
amazing. Keep on posting your suggestions
I will try to make the video as soon as possible
based on your suggestion.
Just on 1 condition hit the like button on
my videos and don�t forget to share and
subscribe.
So let�s start today�s tutorial
DBCA database configuration assistant is a
utility provided by oracle to create and configure
a database. Moreover DBCA is an oracle recommended
way for creating and configuring a database
on your system.
You can find this database configuration assistant
DBCA utility with every regular oracle database
product like standard and enterprise version
BUT if you are using Oracle express edition
then I am sorry guys you will not find this
utility there as Oracle XE can only have maximum
1 database which comes preinstalled.
By the way I have done a video on How to install
oracle database 11g express edition the link
to which is in the description box.
So
There are two ways to open Database configuration
assistant DBCA on your windows machine. I�ll
show you both.
Before that I am assuming that you have installed
oracle database 10g or 11g on your system.
It doesn�t matter whether you have 10g or
11g. Steps for creating database using DBCA
are same for both. If you haven�t installed
then please watch my tutorial 1 on how to
install oracle database 11g. All the links
are in the description box.
So to launch this DBCA utility go to start
--&amp;gt;Programs--&amp;gt;Here you should have a Folder
by the name of Oracle followed by Home name.
Here is mine Oracle - OraDb11g_home1click
and expand it
Now go to Configuration and Migration Tools,
and then Database Configuration Assistant.
Right click and select run as administrator.
Or you can simply search for DBCA in your
start menu just open up your start menu and
search for DBCA. There it is Right click and
select run as administrator.
This is the first way now let�s take a look
at the second way to open DBCA utility. Before
that let me close the previous DBCA window.
Ok now
Just go to your command prompt. And here write
DBCA and Hit enter. This will open up the
DBCA utility for you.
But I highly recommend you to run DBCA with
Administrator privileges otherwise you may
get access denied directory errors. Thus I
will start the DBCA with Administrative privileges.
So right now we are into DBCA windows.
This is the welcome screen of DBCA with lots
of text describing what you can do with this
utility.
If you want you can read it otherwise Hit
Next.
Now this will bring you to the database creation
wizard.
Before starting let me clear on one thing
your DBCA window�s screen may look different
or you may have some extra options than mine.
That depends upon the Oracle Database Software.
So just don�t worry
Step 1
This is the first step out of 12 for creating
the database. And these are the operation
which you can perform with database configuration
assistant DBCA. You can create a new database
or configure the existing database, delete
a database and manage template if you have
any.
As we are creating a new database thus we
will choose the first option here which is
�Create a Database�.
Now Hit next.
Step 2 Database template
Here in step 2 of DBCA we have to choose the
template of our database which means that
here we have to choose what kind of database
we want to create.
Here we have 3 options
First one is general purpose of Transaction
processing.
You must have come across this kind of database.
These are the often used database such as
Retail billing system general purpose Database
and ATM Automatic teller machine which is
a very good example of transaction processing
database.
And the 2nd one is Custom Database. Pretty
similar to the general purpose one but it�s
a bit more flexible. Here you can chose individual
component of the database which you want to
use such as oracle extension for dot net,
Oracle OLAP, text, lab Security and enterprise
manager repository etc. You can even assign
your desired table space to all these database
components.
And the third one is Data warehouse. Data
warehouse is also a type of relational database
which is basically used for query and analysis
rather than for transaction processing. So
if you want to create a data warehouse then
choose this one.
But we are creating a general purpose database
thus we will select the first option which
is �General purpose or Transaction processing�.
Now Hit enter.
Step 3 Database Identification
Here in step 3 you have to provide the global
database name for your database. Global database
name is the full name of your database. This
helps you in uniquely identifying your database.
This should be in the form of �Database_name
. domain name�. This is also an oracle recommended
format for global database name. But you can
give whatever name you want.
For this demonstration I will write �youtube.rebellionrider.com�
Here YouTube is our database name and rebellionrider.com
is the domain name.
In the second field you have to specify the
SID which stands for system identifier. As
you can see by default it takes database name
from Global database name field which is YouTube
in our case.
I have explained allot about SID in various
videos in the playlist but still if you want
to read then please visit my Blog on How to
create database, link is in the description
box.
Now Hit Next.
Step 4: Management options
Here in this step you will choose whether
you want to configure enterprise manager or
not. Oracle enterprise manager is a web-based
management tool for individual database.
Along with enterprise manager you can also
configure your alerts. Supply your email server
details and this will send you all the alerts
on your emails.
Moreover you can also configure daily disk
back up if you want
But make sure automatic maintenance task must
be enabled. To know what it is you can read
this text
For this demo database creation all these
default settings are good for me. I am not
gonna change anything. But I recommend you
to configure this oracle enterprise manager.
This is a good tool.
Hit next
Step 5: Database credentials
Here you have to configure the security for
all these accounts. These are few administrative
mandatory and by default configure accounts.
Here you have 2 options either you can configure
separate passwords for each of them or you
can assign same password to all of them.
I will choose the second option and will assign
same password to all these administrative
accounts.
Now hit next.
Step 6: database file locations
Here in this step you have to specify the
type of storage you would like your database
to use.
In the storage type we have 2 options first
is file system and the second is ASM automatic
storage management. If you have configured
ASM then I recommend you to choose the same
otherwise go for file system.
Since I do not have ASM configured on this
system thus I will choose the file system
here.
After choosing Storage type you have to specify
the storage location.
For storage location we have 3 options
First one is Use Database File Locations from
Template. By using this option you don�t
need to do anything instead DBCA will create
an ORACLE HOME directory for you.
Second one is Use Common Location for All
Database Files Here you can choose your own
directory. DBCA will set that directory as
your ORACLE HOME and then all the database
files will get created at this location.
Last and third one is Use Oracle Managed Files.
This option instructs Oracle Database to directly
manage operating system files. It provides
you with a flexible way for multiplexing online
redo log and control file. This is recommended
for security purposes.
I will chose the default and first one option
And now Hit NEXT.
Step 7: Recovery Configuration
I highly recommend you to enable Archiving
and if you want to set your desirable location
for flash recovery area then enable this checkbox
and select the Directory and specify the area
size. Make sure flash recovery area size should
at least be twice the database size.
But I am good with the DBCA default location
for flash recovery area 
and if you want to know more about Archive
logs then please watch my Video tutorial 9
Link is in the description box.
Now hit Next
Step 8: Database Content.
Here in this step tick this check box if you
want to install sample schema such as HR,
scott OE and many more.
Now hit next.
Step 9: Initialization Parameter
Here in this step you can change the default
initialization parameter settings. Such as
Memory, Sizing, Character set and Connection
mode.
You can also click this All Initialization
Parameters button to display a list of all
the database initialization parameters and
their current settings.
I�ll go with all these Default settings.
To know more about all these options please
visit my blog.
Hit next.
Step 10: Database Storage
This window will show you the summary of your
database and its entire files. Like how many
control files you have and where are they
saved. You can even see all your datafiles
along with their locations and many more.
Here you can also check for all your redo
logs groups and if you want then you can even
create more redo log groups.
Hit Next here.
Step 11: Creation Options
This is the last step where you have to tell
DBC what you want to do? Either you want to
create a database or save all these settings
as template for future use or you want to
generate the database creation script.
You can also perform these three steps altogether.
Now Hit finish
This will show you your database creation
summary. Press OK here
If you need full in-depth knowledge on how
to create database using DBCA please visit
my blog. I have explained every step of database
creation in detail there. You can find the
link in the description box.
Database creation using DBCA may take time
thus I am going to fast forward this section
of video.
As we have installed sample schemas thus here
we can unlock some accounts such as HR. To
unlock the accounts click this password management
button and now here select the account which
you want to unlock.
Let�s unlock the HR account. Search for
HR and here unselect this Lock account field
and then supply the password I�ll give HR
here as password press ok avoid this warning.
All this is just about the oracle password
standard if you want you can read it.
Now click exit. As soon as you click it, all
the windows get closed and your database gets
created.
That�s all folks. Hope this video helps
you with your Database creation. Please do

Have a great day!</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
