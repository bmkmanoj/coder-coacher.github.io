I am Manish from RebellionRider.com
And I am back once again with the third tutorial
in the user Privilege series.
Till so far we have seen Introduction to User
Privileges and a detailed tutorial on System
Privileges and today in this SQL tutorial
we will learn about Object Privileges.
The links for my previous 2 tutorials of user
privileges series are in the description box,
in case you haven’t watched them.
So let’s start today’s tutorial.
As I have explained in my Introduction video
that object privileges allow user to perform
certain actions on database objects, for example
Executing DML on tables.
Every database object has a particular set
of object privileges associated with it.
The most commonly used object privileges are
Select, Insert, Update, Delete and Execute.
So without further ado let’s jump over SQL
Developer and start the fun.
Query 1: In the first query we will see how
to access data from a table which is owned
by some other user.
If you remember, in the previous tutorial
we granted Create Table privilege to user
Hulk and Batman which means both these users
can create a table but what if they want to
access the data from the tables which are
owned by some other user.
For example say user hulk wants to select
some data from employees table which is owned
by 
HR user.
Let’s try
Select * from hr.
Employees;
As you can see we got an error here.
This is because user Hulk doesn’t have any
privileges which allow him to perform Select
DML on employees table owned by the HR user.
So to solve this problem we will grant Select
object privilege to user hulk.
For that first I will connect to my database
using SYS user.
Ohk now 
I will grant the SELECT object privilege on
Employees table to user hulk.
GRANT select ON HR.
Employees TO hulk;
Our statement starts with GRANT keyword followed
by the name of object privilege which is SELECT
in our case.
After that we will write ON, which is again
a keyword followed by the database object
name.
In our case “employees” table is the database
object that belongs to the user HR.
This relationship between the user and the
database object can be shown by supplying
a prefix “HR” which is our user name followed
by a dot that denotes the link between employees
table and user HR.
After that we again have another keyword “To”
followed by the username HULK to which we
are granting this object privilege.
Now let’s try to 
execute the first query once again.
And as you can see, here is the result returned
from this query.
Let’s move on to 2nd query.
Query 2: How to grant Multiple Object Privileges
to a user in Single Grant statement
On database Object Tables apart from Select
object privilege we can also grant Update,
Insert, Delete, Index and References object
privileges.
To grant these privileges we can either write
separate grant statements for granting individual
privilege or we can club all the privileges
in a single Grant statement.
Such as
GRANT select, update, insert, delete, index,
references ON hr.employees TO hulk;
Or you can replace this list of Object privileges
by ALL keyword for example
GRANT ALL ON hr.employees TO hulk;
Let’s execute.
Now user Hulk has all the object privileges
on employees table.
Isn’t it simple?
Query 3: Object Privilege on column level
Oracle allows you to grant object privileges
on column level also, but you can only grant
INSERT, UPDATE, and REFERENCES object privilege
on column level.
Say you want to grant update object privilege
only on First name column of employees table.
Then for that the query will be
GRANT update (first_name) ON hr.employees
TO hulk;
On executing this query user hulk will be
able to update only the first name column
of the employees table.
Similarly you can grant Insert and reference
object privileges also.
Let’s move on to the next query and see
how to use WITH GRANT OPTION.
Query 4: WITH GRANT OPTION
Just like we use Admin option flag with system
privileges similarly we use Grant option flag
with object privileges.
GRANT OPTION flag allows the user to grant
an object privilege to another user.
Let’s see how.
Let’s grant update privilege on employees
table of user HR to user Hulk.
GRANT update ON hr.employees TO hulk WITH
GRANT OPTION;
After executing this query user hulk not only
gets update object privilege but can also
grant and revoke the same privilege to and
from any user or roles.
Let’s execute.
Grant succeeded.
Now I will connect to my database using user
hulk and then grant this update privilege
to the user batman.
For that I will use my command prompt.
Here I am, now I will grant the update privilege
to user batman.
GRANT update ON hr.employees TO batman
If you want you can also add the WITH GRANT
OPTION flags here.
Let’s execute.
Here we go, Grant succeeded.

That’s it for today guys.
