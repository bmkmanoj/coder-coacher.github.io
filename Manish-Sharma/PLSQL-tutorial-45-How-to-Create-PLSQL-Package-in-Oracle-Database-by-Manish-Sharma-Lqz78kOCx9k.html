rebellionrider.com where we make
learning SQL pl/sql and oracle database
form in the previous video we learnt
about packages in Oracle database their
architecture and the syntax so today we
will take a step ahead and learn how to
create PL sequel packages in Oracle
database in order to make the concept of
creating PL sequel package easy to
understand I will create a package which
will consist of a PL sequel function and
a stored procedure both the function and
the procedure are independent from each
other and work as a standalone unit so
without further ado let's start the
tutorial and learn how to create PL
sequel package in Oracle database for
the demonstration I am going to create a
very simple package which will consist
of two elements a function and a stored
procedure so let's start with creating
the header of the package
here we have the hello I think this
package header is quite neat just by
looking at it we can say that the name
of the package will be PKG underscore
rebellion writer and there will be two
package elements first is a PL sequel
function with name prnt underscore str
ng with return data type watch r2 and
second is a store procedure with name PR
OC underscore superhero with two
parameters f underscore name and l
underscore name that's all we will be
having in this package let's compile
this package header here we are in order
to provide some meaning to this package
header we need to write the package body
where we will write the code for the
function and procedure which we have in
a packet so let's do it
let me write this package body on a
flash worksheet I guess that will be
clearer and here we have our fresh
worksheet
create so in the package body we have
implemented both the package elements
which we define in the package header as
you can see the PL sequel function prnt
underscore STR ng is returning the
string of watch are to type which is the
name of my blog rebellionrider.com also
the procedure PR OC underscore superhero
is accepting two parameters fname and
lname
and inserting those values into a table
new superheroes I have been asked many
questions about these superheroes tables
these are nothing but just tables which
I create according to the need for the
demonstration in the tutorial for
example the new superheroes table which
are created for this tutorial you can
see the structure of this table on your
screen by judging from this structure
you can see it is a very simple table
with only two columns anyways now that
we have written the implementing code
for all our package elements next we
have to compile the package body package
body compiles successfully this means
that now we have a package ready for use
but how how can we access and use the
package elements let's move further and
learn how to use the package elements in
a PL sequel code as it is apparently
clear that a package has to package
elements one is the PL sequel function
and second is the stored procedure so
let's write the code and try to access
them so what do you suggest should we
start with the PL sequel function or the
stored procedure okay
it is PL sequel function then
here I have a very simple anonymous blog
which consists of only one DBMS output
statement inside which I have called the
prnt underscore string function of PKG
underscore rebellion writer package on
execution of this block we will see the
string rebellion rider calm let's
execute and see the result
but remember in order to see the result
you need to first set the server output
on now let's execute here is the result
similarly you can execute this stored
procedure let me first clear this screen
and close this output panel done before
calling the procedure first let's see
whether we have some data in the
underlying table new underscore
superheroes into which our procedure is
inserting the data no returns which
means no data now let's execute the
procedure of our package
here again for calling the procedure I
use the anonymous block into which I
call the procedure P roc underscore
superhero to do so I first wrote the
name of the package followed by the dot
operator and then the name of our
procedure along with the valid parameter
values let's execute this code and see
whether it works or not PL sequel
procedure executed successfully now
let's check whether we have this new
superhero entry inserted into the table
or not here it is you can refer to my
blog on how to create PL sequel function
and stored procedure to learn different
ways of calling them links are in the
description and that is how we create a
PL sequel package in Oracle database and
access its elements into the code I hope
you find this PL sequel tutorial helpful
if so then give this video a big thumbs
up and help others in learning by
sharing this tutorial video on your
social media out with your friends also
do make sure to subscribe thanks for
watching stay tuned I will be back soon
with more interesting tutorials till
then take care this is manish from
