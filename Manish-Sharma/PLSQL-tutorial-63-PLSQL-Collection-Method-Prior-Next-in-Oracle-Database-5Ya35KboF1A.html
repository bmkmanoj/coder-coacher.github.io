last two collection functions which we
will be learning today what's up
Internet I am manish from
rebellionrider.com and i am back once
again with another PL sequel tutorial
before starting let me remind you to hit
that thumbs up button and like the video
also if you are new to this channel then
go ahead and subscribe one more thing
don't forget to share this video with
your friends that being said let's start
the tutorial it is always good to have
some functions under your sleeves which
can help you in navigating through the
content of your collection the function
prior and next could be those functions
both these functions take an index of
the collection as input and return the
result
for example pl/sql collection method
prior takes an index as input and return
the value stored into the previous
lowest index whereas the collection
method next returns the value from the
next higher index let's do an example
and try to understand what does it mean
here I just created a nested table with
the name my nested table and initialized
it using the collection object VAR
underscore and D I also store 10
numerical values into it that is
actually the same nested table which we
created in PL sequel tutorial 51 on how
to create nested tables so if you have
any confusion about the nested table you
can refer to that tutorial all the links
are in the description of the video
anyways let's move ahead
so here we have our execution section of
this PL sequel block in this section I
have two almost identical output
statements the only difference between
these two is the way we call the
collection function prior in the first
statement we have a very simple function
call of collection method prior where we
are calling the function prior using the
collection object VAR underscore NT this
statement will return the index number I
know it is obvious that index prior to 3
is 2 or index prior to 2 will be 1 then
the question arises that what is the
need of calling the function like that
though this statement is returning the
index number which sounds obvious and
somewhat irrelevant but if we supply
this whole function call as the
parameter to the collection object then
we can easily get our desired result
which is the value stored in the prior
index that's exactly what we did in the
next statement as you can see here I
have used the function call from the
previous statement as a parameter to the
collection object on execution this
statement will return the value stored
at the prior index let's execute and see
the result here is our result the output
from the first statement is 2 and the
output from the second statement is 80
which is the value stored at index 2
which is prior to the index 3 hope this
made the working of prior function clear
and you have learned how to work with
this collection function now let's come
to another collection method which is
next as mentioned above that the PL
sequel collection method next takes an
index of the collection as input and
returns the value stored at the next
subscribe or the value stored at the
next higher index let's modify this code
and see what will be the output of the
collection method next we don't have to
change much in this code we will just
change the function calls here
let's also update the text so that it
will look climatically correct okay done
on execution the output from the first
statement will be 4 because that is the
next higher index after 3 and the output
from this second statement will be 36
because that is the value stored at the
index 4 which is the next highest index
after 3 let's execute and see result and
here is our result as you can see the
result of first statement is 4 and the
result of second statement is 36 that is
how we use PL sequel collection method
prior and next in Oracle database I have
a question for you in this tutorial we
saw that we can use both these
collection methods with nested table
but can we use function next and prior
with associative arrays best way to find
out the answer is to go ahead and create
an associative array and try using these
functions with that if you get it done
then take a screenshot and share it with
me on my Twitter and Facebook I will
review your code right there and will
give you a huge shout-out on my social
media
don't forget to check out the blog on
the same topic because there I will
answer those questions which you can
expect in your certification exam as
well as in your interview I highly
suggest you to check out that blog link
is in the description also do make sure
to LIKE share and subscribe to the
channel that's the tutorial on PL sequel
collection method prior and next in
Oracle database thanks for watching this
