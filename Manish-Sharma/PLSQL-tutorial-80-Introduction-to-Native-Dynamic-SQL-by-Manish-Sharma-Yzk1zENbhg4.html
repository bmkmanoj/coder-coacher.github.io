rebellionrider.com and i am back once
again with another short and crispy
pl/sql tutorial into this video we will
discuss the introduction to the native
dynamic SQL most commonly known as
dynamic SQL before jumping on to this
tutorial I just want to ask you guys
something
we have covered almost all the concepts
of pl/sql on our youtube channel this
dynamic SQL series might be the last of
the pl/sql concepts if there is any
topic which I have forgotten to cover
then please let me know you can tell me
the name of the topic either in the
comment section or you can also leave
your suggestions on my Facebook page as
well as on my Twitter you can find all
the links in the description of this
video that being said let's come back to
our to be stop ik which is the
introduction to pl/sql native dynamic
SQL but first let's see what is a static
SQL as the name suggests any SQL
statement which does not change during
the runtime and remains fixed is called
a static SQL statement the advantage of
aesthetic SQL statements is that we
already know whether all the dependent
objects over which we are writing this
statement are present or not and the
biggest advantage of aesthetic SQL is
that we hard code these statements into
our application
thus we can tune them for optimal
performance but sometimes hard coding
something into the application is not
the solution that's why we need dynamic
SQL so what is this native dynamic SQL
again as the name suggests any SQL
statement which is constructed at the
runtime is called dynamic SQL as these
statements are built on the fly thus
they can not be hard-coded into the
application which in turn increases the
flexibility where has static SQL lets
you execute only DML statements inside
your pl/sql block the dynamic SQL
enables you to execute detail statements
and that to inside your pls
block which means using dynamic SQL you
can create a table or drop an index or
truncate your table right inside your
pl/sql block this is an advantage of
native dynamic SQL over static SQL you
can head over to my blog to read more
about the advantages and disadvantages
of a static as well as dynamic SQL find
link in the description of this video
ok now you may be thinking but constable
pl/sql on the fly yes we can
similar to dynamic SQL the process of
constructing pl/sql code at runtime is
called dynamic pl/sql so how do we use
dynamic SQL in Oracle database that two
most common methods of using dynamic SQL
and pl/sql in oracle database are
execute immediate statement and open for
fetch and close block yeah the same
block which we saw in the cursor
tutorial apart from these two most
commonly used methods the other ways of
using dynamic SQL or pl/sql our bulk
fetch bulk execute immediate bulk for
all and bulk collect into statement we
have learnt all the above commands and
statements in the previous series on
bulk data processing if you haven't
forced those videos then I will share
the link of the playlist in the
description to check it out in the next
video we will do some practical
demonstration on how to build a dynamic
SQL statement in Oracle database but
those tutorials will require a working
knowledge of point variables luckily I
have already done a detailed video as
well as blog on the PL sequel Pyne
variables again you can find the links
in the description that's all in this
tutorial on the introduction to pl/sql
native dynamic SQL in oracle database
hope you enjoyed watching if so please
give it a thumbs up and share it with
your friends also if you are new to this
channel go ahead and subscribe right
away as in the next tutorial we will be
exploring dynamic SQL to its next level
