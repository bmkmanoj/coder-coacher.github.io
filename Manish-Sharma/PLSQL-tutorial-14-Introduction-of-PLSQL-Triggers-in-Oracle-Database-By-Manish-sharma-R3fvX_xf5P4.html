again i am manish from
rebellionrider.com today's tutorial is
on introduction of triggers in oracle PL
sequel in this tutorial I will try to
explain the concepts of triggers as well
as give you the answers of almost all
the questions which you might face in
your certification exam or in your
interview so without further ado let's
start the tutorial triggers are named PL
sequel blocks which are stored in the
database or we can also say that they
are specialized store programs which
execute implicitly when a triggering
event occurs which means we cannot call
and execute them directly instead they
only get triggered by events in the
database now the question arises here
what are these events these events can
be anything such as a DML statement for
example update is insert or delete
executing on any table of your database
or DDL statement such as create or alter
these triggers are generally used by DBS
for auditing purposes a system event yes
you can create a trigger on a system
event and by system event I mean shut
down or startup of your database
another type of triggering event can be
user events such as log off or logon on
to your database next topic is about
types of triggers there are five types
of triggers in Oracle database in which
three of them are based on the
triggering events which we just discuss
let's take a detailed look at the types
data manipulation language triggers or
DML triggers as the name suggests these
are the triggers which depends on DML
statements such as update insert or
delete and they get fired either before
or after them data definition language
triggers or DDL triggers these are the
triggers which are created over TDL
statements such as create or alter using
this type of trigger you can monitor the
behavior and force rules on your DDL
statements that we will see in upcoming
tutorials system or database event
triggers third type of triggers is
system or database triggers you must
have guest till now that these are the
type of triggers which come into action
when some system event occurs such as
database logon or log off instead of
trigger this is a type of trigger which
enables you to stop
and redirect the performance of a DML
statement often this type of trigger
helps you in managing the way you write
non updatable views you can also see the
application of business rules by instead
of triggers where they insert update or
delete rows directly in tables that are
defining updatable views and the last is
compound triggers these are multitasking
triggers that act as both a statement as
well as row level triggers when the data
is inserted updated or deleted from
whatever compound triggers can be used
to audit check save and replace the
values even before they are changed
right when there is a need to take
action at a statement as well as row
event levels you can visit my blog on
the same topic for an in-depth knowledge
on triggering events and triggers type
in Oracle database click the YouTube
card on your screen for the link next we
will discuss the syntax you must be
thinking what is the need for this
knowing a correct syntax helps you new
smoothly answering questions in your
certification exam where you have to
guess the error you can easily answer
these guess the error questions if you
know the correct syntax that being said
let's take a look at the syntax of
triggers in database create or replace
our two keywords where keyword or
replace is optional and come in handy
when you want to alter the definition of
already created trigger followed by
another keyword trigger which specifies
the type of object you want to create
then we have trigger name which is user
defined that means you can give whatever
name you want giver before or after
specifies when the trigger fires
followed by triggering event which can
be anything from the list which we just
discussed then we have to specify the
table name using keyword on over which
you want your trigger to work then we
have an optional clause for each row
this clause specifies that the trigger
is a row trigger and fires once for each
row that is inserted updated or deleted
next clauses follows which is again
optional and allows you to specify the
order in which trigger should fire this
Clause is useful when you have multiple
triggers defined on the same table and
you want to set an order for their
execution and then we have enable or
disable clause using this Clause you can
set the status of your trigger if the
status of your trigger is in
then it will fire when a triggering
event occurs while if it is disabled
then it simply does not fire when a
triggering event occurs next clauses
when using this you can gain more
control on your triggers because when
closed lets you specify the condition
which needs to be evaluated to true for
the trigger to fire followed by when
clause we have our declaration execution
and exception section which we have
discussed in our first PL sequel
tutorial as we have discussed syntax now
let's see some uses of triggers first
using triggers we can enforce business
rules that cannot be defined by using
integrity constants second using
triggers we can gain a strong control
over the security third we can also
collect the statistical information on
table axes fourth we can automatically
generate values for drive columns such
as auto increment numeric primary key
fifth using triggers you can prevent
invalid transactions similar to uses
there are several restrictions on
triggers in Oracle databases to which
you can read on my blog you can visit my
website for more in-depth knowledge on
same topic which will help you in
getting good marks in your certification
exam and kneeling your interview link is
