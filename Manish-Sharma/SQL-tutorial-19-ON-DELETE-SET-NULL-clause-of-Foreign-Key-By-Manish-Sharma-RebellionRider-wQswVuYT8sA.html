from rebellionrider.com and i am back
once again with another SQL tutorial and
in today's SQL tutorial we will talk
about own delete set null Clause of
foreign key constraint before jumping
ahead I'll suggest you to watch my
previous video on foreign key it will
help you to understand the concept of
own delete set null Clause you can find
its link in the description below you
can visit my website to read and have
in-depth knowledge of own delete set
null Clause again neck is at the
description below okay then let's move
ahead in the last tutorial of foreign
key we created two tables by the name of
authors and books with simple foreign
key where author is our parent table and
book is our child given let's check them
out our parent table has two column
author ID and author name where author
ID is a primary key and child table has
three columns book ID book title book
author ID and we have foreign key on the
third column book author ID we created
these two table with simple foreign key
means without any clause such as on
delete set null or on delete cascade
whenever we define a simple foreign key
without any clause then Oracle puts a
default clause this is on delete no
action in which you can update the rows
of parent table but cannot delete them
let's check I have already inserted some
data in author and book table let's
first try to update the first row of
parent table author where author ID is 1
and author name is ball but before that
let me set my SQL developer tool so that
you people can see what is going on in
here
okay I think it's now clean and clear
let's update the first row of our parent
table author
execute let us refresh here as you can
see we have successfully updated the
column now let's try to delete this row
execute as you can see on attempt to
delete this row we got integrity
constraint violation error to avoid this
error we have clause like on delete set
null and on delete cascade today we will
see on delete set null to demonstrate
this I have to alter the foreign key
constraint on child table books but
unfortunately we do not have any alter
table DDL to modify or alter constraint
so to modify are already defined foreign
key constant on child table books either
we can drop the constraint and recreate
it or we can drop the whole table and
recreated both these ways have advantage
as well as disadvantages to make this
easy to understand I am going to drop my
child table books and recreate it but
this time with own delete set null
foreign key constraint step 1 drop the
child table books let me clear this
script output so that you can see the
outputs execute
table books drop step to recreate the
child table with own delete set null
foreign key constraint
let's format the core of K that's our
create table statement from here let me
separated from the others okay execute
table books created step three we have
recreated child table books but this
time with own delete set null Clause we
can check it by executing a Curie on
user constraints data dictionary I
already have the Curie you can select
constraint name constraint type and
delete rule from user constraint and as
we are checking it on our child table
books that is why we have table name
books in our where clause let's execute
book call 3fk that's our constraint name
and r is for referential integrity
constraint which is also known as
foreign key and delete rule is set null
let's insert some data into this table I
already have the insert commands or
insert statement to save the die
okay let's execute and we cut an error
and that's because we didn't select the
whole table whole Kure executed
separately okay and we must be having
five rows in our book table yes we have
a fibro now let's delete some data from
parent table authors and see what
happened to corresponding design child
table books let's delete first row from
author table where we have author ID 1
and author named Nick let me show you
author we are going to delete this first
row author ID 1 and
attorney Nick get back to work Pope and
this row has two reference row in child
table books row one here as you can see
Bukater ID is 1 and row 5 again book
author ID is 1 so let's see what
happened to these two rows when we
delete the parent roof from the author
table let me clear it first clear this
script output also execute and now let's
refresh the data of our child table
books as you can see corresponding value
to the row are automatically set to null
that's because we define foreign key on
our child table books with on delete set
null Clause you can visit my website to
read more about on delete set null
concept that's it for today hope you
enjoyed this tutorial you can connect
with me on my Twitter Facebook Linkedin
all the details are in the description
you can also help me spread the words by
sharing my videos on your social
networking I appreciate your help
I'll be back soon with another SQL
tutorial till then take care and keep
watching my videos have a good day this
