I am Manish from RebellionRider.com
And I am back once again with another SQL
tutorial.
And today's SQL tutorial is about Primary
Keys in Oracle database.
If you want to have in-depth knowledge of
Primary key or
Want to read some theory and make some notes
then
Visit my website. I have explained everything
about primary key there. I mean everything.
You can find the link in the Description below.
So Primary Key
There are two types of Primary keys
First is Simple primary Key: Primary key which
Involves only one column and
Second is Composite Primary Key: Primary Key
which involves more than one column.
We will start with Simple primary key.
You can create Primary key either with Create
Table statement of by using Alter table Statement.
Let's define simple primary key using create
table statements.
With create table statement we can either
define primary key at column level or at table
level.
We will start with defining Primary key at
column level using create table statement.
For that we will create a table by the name
of &quot;Product_Master&quot;
CREATE TABLE product_master
?(
??Product_id ???NUMBER(3) ?PRIMARY KEY,
??Product_name ?VARCHAR2(30),
??Product_price ?NUMBER(5)
? );
You just have to put keyword Primary key after
data type and size of column while defining
a column of a table. Here oracle server will
create a primary key on product id with default
constraint name which will be slightly difficult
to understand. You can give your own name
to your constraint which is also a good practice.
Let see how
CREATE TABLE product_master
?(
??Product_id ???NUMBER(3) ?CONSTRAINT
?pmstr_pid_pk ?PRIMARY KEY,
??Product_name ?VARCHAR2(30),
??Product_price ?NUMBER(5)
? );
Here Constraint is a keyword pmstr_pid_pk
which is user defined constraint name. You
can give whatever you want, I just specified
pmstr for table name product master, pid for
column name product id and pk for primary
key.
I prefer and recommend this way of defining
a constraint because constraint name will
be a big help when you want to refer the constraint
for the purpose deleting, modifying or checking
constraint in data dictionary.
We just saw how to define a primary key using
create table at column level.
Now we will see how to define a primary key
constraint using create table at table level.
To read more about this visit my website www.rebellionrider.com/sql-primary-key.htm
Let's see.
Again we will create a table this time with
the name ORDER_MASTER
You can watch my video on how to create table.
Link is in the description below.
Ok
CREATE TABLE order_master
?(
??order_id ??NUMBER(3),
??order_data ??DATE,
??order_qnty ??NUMBER(5),
??CONSTRAINT ??ordmstr_oid_pk ??PRIMARY KEY
( order_id )
?);
Here we will first define all the columns
of a table without any constraints and after
that we define our constraint.
Here constraint is a keyword and ordmstr_oid_pk
is constraint name. Its user defined so you
can specify whatever name you want and PRIMARY
KEY is our constraint which is also a key
word and mind here that after Primary key
we put column name over which we want to define
primary key constraint in parenthesis.
That's how we define Primary key constraint
at table level.
Now we will see how to define Primary key
Constraint using Alter Table statement.
We define primary key constraint or any other
constraint using alter table, when we already
have a table and we want to put constraint
on that.
Here we are altering table and putting a constraint.
To illustrate this first we have to create
a simple table. After creating a table we
will alter it to put primary key constraint.
Ok let's create a table by the name of customer.
CREATE TABLE customer
(
Cust_id number(3),
Cust_name varchar2(15),
Phone_number number(10)
);
Customer is just a table with 3 fields cust_id,
cust_name, phone number
As of now as this table has no constraints.
To define a primary key constraint on this
table we have to alter it for which we will
use ALTER TABLE DDL statement
Say we want to put a primary key constraint
on cust_id column for that we will execute
ALTER TABLE customer ADD CONSTRAINT cust_cid_pk
PRIMARY KEY (cust_id);
ALTER TABLE is DDL statement whereas customer
is our table name. As we want to add a constraint
thus ADD Constraint cust_cid_pk is user defined
constraint name PRIMARY KEY is the constraint
and cust_id in parenthesis is the column from
customer table over which we want to put primary
key.
Now If we talk about Composite Primary key
The Primary key defined using more than one
column is called a composite primary key.
We will define composite primary key at table
level using create table
Lets try
Again we will create our customer table for
that we have to drop the previous customer
table first.
DROP TABLE customer;
Now let's create it again but this time
with composite primary key.
??phone_no ?NUMBER(10),
??CONSTRAINT ?cust_cid_pk ?PRIMARY KEY ( cust_id,
phone_no)
);
Here again we define all our column first
and then at the end we define a composite
primary key on cust_id column and phone_no
column
As you can see Constraint is a keyword, cust_cid_pk
is user defined constraint name. I'll show
just in a second how and where to use constraint
As we are defining composite primary key so
I took out two columns cust_id and phone_no.
However you can take upto 32 columns.
Now let's see how to define composite primary
key using Alter Table statement
But before that we have to drop primary key
constraint from our customer table
Thus I'll first show you How to drop Primary
Key Constraint.
Now here we will use user defined Constraint
name for dropping a constraint
So, here on our Customer table we have a composite
primary constraint with the name cust_cid_pk.
To drop this execute DDL alter table statement
as
ALTER TABLE ?customer ?DROP CONSTRAINT ?cust_cid_pk;
That's it
So we just dropped primary key constraint
from customer table
We now have customer table without any constraints.
Ok Let's see how to define composite primary
key using alter table
For that just write
ALTER TABLE customer ADD CONSTRAINT cust_cid_pk
PRIMARY KEY (cust_id,phone_number);
Alter table is our DDL, customer is our table
name, ADD CONSTRAINT is what we want to do
with our table, cust_cid_pk is constraint
name and we are using cust_id and phone number
column for defining Composite Primary Key.
Similarly you can Enable primary Key constraint
or Disable primary key constraint
To know how to do that, visit my website Link
which is in the description below.
You can also learn about the data dictionaries
related to constraint, what are they and how
you can use them/
I have explained everything here on this page.
So do pay a visit and read this article. I
sincerely hope you will enjoy reading.
That's it for today.
Hope you enjoyed watching.
