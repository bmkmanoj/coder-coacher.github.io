rebellionrider.com so i suppose that
after watching the previous videos on
instead of triggers you have well
understood that their main advantage is
that by using them we can update the
views which are non obtainable
unfortunately with oracle database we
are restricted to write such powerful
triggers only on views and not on tables
anyways let's move ahead and see the
third trigger in the series on instead
of triggers in Oracle database and learn
how to create an instead of delete
trigger similar to other instead of
triggers which we have seen so far using
this we can override the standard action
of delete DML on a view so let's proceed
to create our own instead of delete
trigger for this demonstration I will
again use the view VW underscore
rebellion Rider which we created earlier
and have consistently used in this
instead of trigger series so far
needless to say that executing delete
DML on this view will return an error
because of its non updatable nature does
the only way to perform delete DML on
this view is by using an instead of
trigger let's quickly create one but
before that let's close this script
output and clear the screen that's great
here is our trigger first line starts
with the keyword create followed by or
replace optional clause this Clause will
replace the already created trigger with
the same name if you have any next we
have another keyword trigger which lets
your compiler know that we are creating
a database object which is a trigger
then in the second line we have action
event that is instead of delete this
call for action will make sure that this
trigger will execute every time our
delete DML fires on the underlying view
which is VW underscore rebellion writer
which we have specified next using
keyword on in third line we have for
each row clause in which will ensure
that the trigger executes for every
single row of the view finally we have
the body of the trigger for the sake of
better and clearer understanding of the
concept we only have to delete DML
switch will do the work so let's execute
this instead of delete trigger and
compile it trigger compiled successfully
now let's test whether we can execute a
delete DML on our view or not execute
all the rows where fellini was Tony
Stark are deleted which means our
trigger is working successfully hope you
learned something and enjoyed watching
if so then make sure to smash the thumbs
up button also help others in learning
by sharing this video on your social
media I guess this will be the last
tutorial in the series on triggers in
Oracle database next week we will start
something new so stay tuned check out
this blog on my website for some helpful
tips on LinkedIn profile building link
is in the description also in the
previous video I announce another
giveaway so make sure to participate you
can also follow me on my Twitter for
more regular updates thanks for watching
