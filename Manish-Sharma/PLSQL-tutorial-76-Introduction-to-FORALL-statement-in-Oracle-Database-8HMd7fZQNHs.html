So now that we have learnt how to use TAB
view to get the information of all the objects
created into the schema let’s come back
to our bulk collect series and learn how to
achieve bulk data processing using FORALL
statement.
So without wasting much of your time let’s
get started with the introduction to the bulk
data processing using FORALL statement in
Oracle Database.
FORALL statement reduces context switches
which occur during the execution of a DML
statement in a loop.
In other words we can say that FORALL is a
bulk loop construct which executes one DML
statement multiple times at once.
FORALL statement reduces context switches
by sending execution call of DML such as Insert,
Delete, Update or Merge from PL/SQL to SQL
in batches instead of one at a time.
Let’s see the syntax of FORALL statement
FORALL index IN bound_clause
[SAVE EXCEPTION]
DML statement;
FORALL statement starts with the keyword “forall”
followed by an “index”.
This index is an implicitly defined loop counter
which means you do not need to define it.
It is already declared by PL/SQL engine for
you and its scope is limited to the FORALL
statement in which it is defined.
The value of this index and the number of
loop iterations are dependent on the bound
clauses.
This we have to specify right after writing
the IN keyword.
We will come back to these bound clauses in
a minute, but first let’s see what we have
next.
Next we have a reserved phrase SAVE EXCEPTION.
This option keeps the FORALL statement running
even when DML statement causes an exception.
This is an advantage of FORALL statement over
FOR LOOP that it won’t exit abruptly even
when there is an exception.
Also the use of SAVE EXCEPTION is optional.
But using it is recommended.
Followed by save exception we have DML statement.
This could be any DML statement like INSERT,
UPDATE or DELETE or a MERGE statement.
These DML or MERGE statements need to reference
at least one Collection in its VALUES or WHERE
clause.
Also remember, unlike FOR Loop, with FORALL
statement we can only use one DML at a time.
This is the shortcoming of FORALL.
Anyways, that is the syntax of FORALL statement.
Now let’s learn about the bound clauses
which we can use with FORALL statement for
bulk processing in Oracle Database.
As mentioned before, the bound clause controls
the value of index as well as decides the
number of iteration of a FORALL statement.
There are three types of bound clauses.
1.
First is Lower and upper bound: Similar to
FOR LOOP in this bound clause you have to
specify the valid starting and the ending
of the consecutive index numbers of the referenced
collection.
Make sure the collection whose index numbers
you are referencing here should not be sparse.
If your referencing collection is sparse then
you might want to use the second option, which
is
2.
Indices of: If you are referencing a sparse
collection and don’t have consecutive index
numbers to specify then you can take help
of the second bound clause which is INDICES
OF.
Using INDICES OF you can specify the subscript
numbers of your sparse collection such as
a Nested table or an Associative array.
3.
In case you want to use FORALL statement with
very specific individual elements of a particular
collection then you can use the third bound
clause which is VALUES OF.
Using “Values-of” bound clause you can
specify a group of indexes which don’t need
to be either unique or consecutive that a
FORALL statement can loop through.
If they confuse you then don’t worry all
your doubts will be cleared when we will do
the demonstration of FORALL statement with
each of these mentioned bound clauses in upcoming
tutorials.

That is the tutorial on the introduction to
bulk data processing using FORALL statement
in Oracle Database.
