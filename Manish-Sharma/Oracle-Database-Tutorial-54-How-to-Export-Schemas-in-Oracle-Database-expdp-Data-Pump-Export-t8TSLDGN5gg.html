I am Manish from RebellionRider.com
Till so far in this data pump series we have
learnt how to export full database and how
to export tablespaces using expdp export utility.
And today we will learn how to export schemas
such as HR, OE and SH using expdp export data
pump utility in oracle database.
But before starting the tutorial, just a quick
reminder guys, please make sure to hit the
thumbs up button if you liked this video.
That will bring a smile on my face!
Also I want to ask you guys whether you want
me to do a tutorial on tablespace that discusses
topics like – what are tablespaces and how
we can create one? If yes then please leave
a comment or you can also tweet me.
Now let’s get back to the topic.
So what are schemas?
Oracle defines schema as the collection of
logical structure of data, or schema objects
such as views, synonyms, indexes and many
more.
Generally Oracle database schema has similar
name as the user and every user owns a schema
moreover you can manipulate these schema using
SQL language.
So let’s move ahead and see how we can export
schemas in oracle database using expdp data
pump export utility.
The first two steps where we create a directory
for holding the exported files and then create
a directory object are same as that of the
previous tutorial. Since I have explained
those steps in detail there hence I would
suggest you to watch my previous tutorial
for the in-depth knowledge and better understanding
of the concept. You can find the link of these
tutorials in the description.
Ok let’s start the tutorial.
In order to save time I have already created
a directory. This time I have named it “Schema
Export”. This directory will serve as a
default location where expdp export utility
will save all the exported files for example
dump files and log files. The path for this
directory is. D:\Data Pump\Schema Export.
As you can see right now this directory is
empty.
Now we will create the directory object. To
create a directory object you either need
to be a privileged user such as sys or you
must have “create any directory” system
privilege. In my case I will use my privilege
user sys to create a directory object.
Now I am connected to my database using my
sys user with sysdba privileges. Next I’ll
create a directory object
SQL&amp;gt;CREATE DIRECTORY exp_schema AS ‘D:\Data
Pump\Schema Export’;
Directory object created and the name of the
directory object is “exp_schema” and this
directory object is pointing to the directory
“Schema Export” which we just created.
Next we will grant the mandatory privileges
to the user who wants to perform the export.
Say the user HR wants to perform the export
then first we need to grant user HR read and
write privileges on the directory schema export
and to do that we will use the directory object
“exp_schema” which we just created. Let
see how.
SQL&amp;gt;GRANT read, write ON DIRECTORY exp_schema
TO hr;
Grant succeeded
Apart from these two privileges we also have
to grant DATAPUMP_EXP_FULL_DATABASE role to
the user who wants to perform the export.
In my case this user is HR thus I have to
grant this role to HR user.
Ok, I guess I should clear the screen first
Ok, now let’s grant the role to our user
HR
SQL&amp;gt;GRANT DATAPUMP_EXP_FULL_DATABASE TO hr;
Grant succeeded
For the demonstration I have used HR user
but any user in the database can perform the
export and import. You just need to grant
the necessary privileges.
Now we can perform the export. To perform
the export first we need to come out of SQL
prompt.
Just write exit and hit enter. Here we are.
Let me clear the screen again.
It seems like everything is perfectly in place.
Now let’s write expdp command and perform
the export. Here I will demonstrate to you
how you can export “Scott” schema using
expdp.
C:\&amp;gt; expdp hr/hr@ORCL DIRECTORY = exp_schema
DUMPFILE =exp_scott_schma.dmp LOGFILE=schm_lg.log
SCHEMAS = scott
The result of the successful execution of
this command will be a dump file with entire
scott schema written into it along with a
log file.
let’s hit the enter and execute the export
This export may take some time depending upon
the size of schema.
Ok. Export is successful. If in case you want
to perform the export of multiple schemas
then you just have to write the name of schemas
separated by comma.
Say you want perform export of HR and OE schema
for that the expdp command will be.
Let me clear the screen once. Now let’s
write the expdp command for the xport of HR
and OE schema
C:\&amp;gt; expdp hr/hr@ORCL DIRECTORY = exp_tblsp
DUMPFILE =tablespace.dmp LOGFILE=tblsp_log.log
SCHEMAS = hr,oe
On executing this command your schema HR and
OE will get exported. Let’s hit enter and
execute this command. This export might take
some time that’s why I will fast forward
this process
As you can see export is successful
You can find all the command with more detailed
knowledge of the schema export using expdp
export utility such as why DATAPUMP_EXP_FULL_DATABASE
is necessary? And restriction on schema object
on my blog so I would highly suggest you read
the blog. You can find the link for the same
in the description box.
That’s it for today. Don’t forget to hit

You can also comment your feedback. Will be
back soon. Till then take care.
