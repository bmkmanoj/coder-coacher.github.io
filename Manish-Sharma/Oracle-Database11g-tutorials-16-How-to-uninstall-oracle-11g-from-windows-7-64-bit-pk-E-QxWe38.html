rebellionrider.com once again and today
in this oracle database tutorial I'll
show you how to manually uninstall
Oracle database 11g from windows 7
machine since we are going to uninstall
Oracle database 11g manually therefore
we will not be using ou UI for
uninstalling the software ok without
further ado let's start with deleting
the environment variable if we are
planning to reinstall Oracle database
11g or any version after uninstalling
then this step is important to avoid PR
vf3 9 to 9 environment variable error to
delete environment variable right click
on my computer and select properties and
then choose advanced system setting
ground right side panel after this you
will get a system properties on system
property window go to Advanced tab and
select environment variable now in
system variable section select and
double-click path variable which will
give you edit system variable window
here in this window you can find the
Oracle home path which will be like C
app one product 11 point 2 point 0 TV
home one slash pin here one is the
username you'll have your username here
select this string this environment path
and delete after that press ok and exit
now move on to second step in order to
uninstall Oracle database 11g from
Windows we have to stop all these
services and demand process related to
Oracle database that are run by Windows
automatically in background for that we
have to delete all the Oracle registries
from windows please be careful while
doing this and do not delete any other
registry as this might cause serious
problem such as system or any other
service crash
thus I suggest you to take backup of all
the registry first and then proceed
ahead now open up your run command by
pressing together Windows key + r key or
you can just go to your Start menu and
write run now we have to open Windows
registry editor for that right ragged it
in run command and hit enter see now
let's first take the backup of
registries for this go to H key local
machine and then software select the
software and right-click and then select
export give it a name like I'll give
easy software backup 1 click Save
you can save it anywhere in this system
like you have to choose the location so
choose whatever location which you think
is the safest one for your registry okay
now after taking the backup again go to
H key local machine and then software
and then Oracle and right click Oracle
and select delete say yes
Oracle registry holds all the important
data such as Oracle home path and Oracle
s ID required by Oracle services to
start up thus it become mandatory to
delete this registry in order to
uninstall Oracle 11g and to avoid error
in fresh installation now we have to
delete few more registries which are
responsible for Oracle background
processes and services but before that
once again take their backup fast for
taking backup go to H key local machine
then system then currentcontrolset right
click currentcontrolset and select
export
give it a name you can select whatever
location which you think is safe for
your registry backup give it a name and
click Save
okay now navigate to H key local machine
then system then currentcontrolset and
then services here in services select
and delete all those Oracle registry
which are started by Oracle knee scroll
down a little bit here as you can see we
have these Oracle registries 1 2 3 4 5 6
7 8 and as you can see the name of these
registries are started with Oracle we
have to delete all these registry just
right-click and select delete
you
okay done with deleting all this
registry now to stop all these services
point with Oracle it's important to
restart the system so restart your
system just wait let me restart my
system I will be back in a second okay I
am back now to uninstall Oracle database
11g from Windows we have to delete all
the Oracle database files in order to
delete Oracle database file open up your
computer go to your C Drive and any
other drive where you have installed
your Oracle database 11g then go to app
then to the directory with your username
in my case it's Mon select all the files
and delete them if you want to save
backups then do not delete flash
recovery area but since I do not want to
see so I will delete everything
it can take few seconds our few minutes
you
