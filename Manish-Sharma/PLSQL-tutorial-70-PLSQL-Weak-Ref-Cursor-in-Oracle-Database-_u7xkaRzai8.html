rebellionrider.com welcome to the fourth
tutorial in pl/sql RAF cursor series so
far we have learnt how to create a
strong RAF cursor using table paste
record datatype and user-defined record
data type today we will learn how to
create a weak RAF cursor in Oracle
database so without wasting much of your
time let's get started
unlike the strong RAF cursor a RAF
cursor which does not have a fixed
return type is called a V craft cursor
because we craft cursors do not have a
fixed return type thus they are open to
all types of select statements this also
makes them most frequently used RAF
cursors in comparison to others now
let's jump onto the tutorial and do some
examples but before that if you enjoy
watching this tutorial then to make sure
to subscribe and like the video
now let's write the example here is the
declaration section of our code in the
first line after the declare keyword we
have declared our V craft cursor with
the name wk underscore RAF see you are
as you can see this time we do not have
any return type associated with this RAF
cursor right below this in the second
line we have declared our cursor
variable of RAF cursor type apart from
cursor variable we have also declared
two extra variables F underscore name
and EMP underscore SEL both these
variables are of anchor datatype and are
based on the first name and salary
column of the employees table we will
use both these variables to hold the
data which will be fed into the V craft
cursor now let's write the execution
section
just like the previous two tutorials the
execution section is pretty simple in
this section we again have four
statements let's have a look a statement
one the open for statement using this
statement we are opening our vqf cursor
for the Select statement which is
returning the data of the employee whose
employee ID is hundred from the first
name and salary column of employees
table statement to the fetch statement
using this statement we are fetching the
data from the cursor into the variables
F underscore name and EMP underscore SEL
statement 3 the closed statement closing
a cursor that you are done with is a
good practice statement for the output
statement the fourth and the last
statement of the execution section is
DBMS output statement which is
displaying back the data fetched using
ref cursor and retrieved into both the
anchored data type variables with these
four statements we sum up the code for
her we craft cursor let's execute this
code and see the result here we are as
you can see we use the V Kraft cursor to
retrieve the data of two different data
types from two different columns of a
table this wouldn't have been possible
with strong graph cursor because of its
fixed return type unless we had created
it using the user-defined record data
type that is a very simple example just
to show you how to create and work with
a pl/sql V Kraft cursor in Oracle
database hope this helped you in
learning the basics of V Kraft cursor
for more in-depth knowledge please refer
to the blog post
the same topic link is in the
description please do like the video and
subscribe to the channel as in the next
tutorial we will learn what our sis RAF
cursors that being said let's wind-up
thanks for watching this is the tutorial
on how to create pl/sql V craft cursor
in Oracle database by your friend manish
