I am Manish From RebellionRider.com.
Till so far we have learned about system as
well as object privileges and so today we
will going to learn user Roles in Oracle Database.
User Roles is kind of an extension to user
privileges and gives an ease in managing and
controlling the privileges in oracle database,
using roles you can save a lot of time and
efforts. How? We will see ahead…
So let’s start todays tutorial
The first question which arises here is, what
exactly are roles?
Roles are named group of privileges that you
can assign to users or other roles.
So let’s move ahead and see how we can create
a role and grant it some privileges.
By the way if you want to know what are the
features and advantages of user roles with
many other information you can read my blog
on the same topic. Link is in the description
box.
Query 1: Role without any Security Authentication
Let’s see how we can create a role.
Only user with CREATE ROLE system privilege
can create a role and to create a role we
use Create Role statement.
And if you are a DBA and can log on to your
database using Sys user than that’s the
best way to create any role because sys user
has all the system privileges. That’s why
I am going to connect my database using my
user sys. sys@localhost is my sys connection
so I am going to connect using this connection.
And here I am. Let me quickly show you the
user. As you can see right now I am connected
to my database using Sys user with sysdba
privileges
Let’s create a very simple role by the name
of Demo1. Let me close this script output
ok
CREATE ROLE demo1 NOT IDENTIFIED;
Query is pretty simple. First we have create
role both of which are the Oracle reserved
keywords followed by the name of the role
which is Demo1 in our case, Name of the role
is user defined thus you can give whatever
name you want. Then at the end of the statement
we have NOT IDENTIFIED clause, NOT IDENTIFIED
clause indicates that this role is authorized
by the database and no password is required
to enable the role. This is an optional clause
statement thus if you want you can skip it.
Let’s move on to our next query.
Query 2: Role with Security Authentication
We just created a very simple role demo1 with
no authentication or security. Now let’s
create a role with password authentication.
Again we will use Create Role statement to
create this role.
CREATE ROLE Demo2 IDENTIFIED BY password123;
The first half of this query is very identical
to the first query but in the second half
we have Identified By clause. IDENTIFIED BY
clause indicates that a role must be authorized
by the specified method. In our case the specific
method is password.
Followed by Identified By clause we have our
password. Let’s execute, User created.
Query 3: External Role
We just created a role Demo2 with password
authentication in oracle we can also create
external roles. The authentication of external
roles is handled by external services such
as your Operating System. Let’s see how
we can create an external user.
CREATE USER Demo3 IDENTIFIED externally;
On executing query, oracle will create an
external role.
Similarly you can also create global role
in oracle database. The authentications of
global role are handled by enterprise directory
service or say Central Oracle Security Server
before the role is enabled at login.
Let me again close this script output. The
query for creating a global role will be.
Please read my blog for more information about
global and other authentication of a role.
The link is in the description box.
Grant Privileges to a role
After creation every role is like an empty
box because it doesn’t have any privilege
within it thus it’s of no use. To make a
role useful we need to grant it some privileges.
We can grant both ‘system’ as well as
‘object’ privileges to a role; we can
even grant a role to another role. To do the
same we use GRANT statement. Let see how:
First we will grant a system privilege to
a role demo1. You can grant any system privilege
to any role in your database. You can even
grant system privilege wit Admin Option to
the role as well.
I will suggest you to watch my videos on System
and Object privileges for the better understanding
of the concept.
Ok let’s write the query and see how we
can grant a create table system privilege
to our role demo1. If you want you can also
use with admin option flag here.
GRANT create table TO Demo1 WITH ADMIN OPTION;
In this query I am granting create table system
privilege with admin option to our role Demo1.
Let’s execute
Similarly we can grant Object privilege to
our role.
Let’s grant select object privilege over
employees table of hr user to the role demo1.first
let me close this script output. Ok let’s
write our query 6
GRANT select ON hr. employees TO demo1;
While granting an object privilege to a role
oracle doesn’t allow us to use With Grant
Option Flag. Let’s execute. Grant succeeded.
Similarly you can grant a role to another
role. For the demonstration I will grant the
role Demo1 to role Demo2.ok let’s write
the query. let me close this script output.
Let me make some space I think everything
is set and you people can see things clearly.
So let’s write the query
Grant demo1 to demo2;
On executing this query role demo2 will get
all the privileges which we granted to role
demo1. So let’s execute this query
Grant Role to a User
Ok let’s move ahead and see how we grant
a role to database users. A role can be granted
to any user in Oracle Database and a user
with GRANT ANY ROLE system privilege can grant
and revoke a role except a global role to
or from other users or roles of the database.
Say you want to grant a role demo1 to our
user batman. For that we will again use GRANT
statement. And the query will be. Let’s
close this script output
If you want you can grant the role demo1 to
user batman WITH ADMIN OPTION also
GRANT demo1 TO batman;
Ok let’s execute this query
As role demo1 doesn’t have any authentication
and instead is authorized by database itself
thus its by default enabled. But sometime
roles with authentication are not enabled
by default in such cases you have to enable
them. Let’s see how.
We have role Demo2 which has password authentication
and have create table System privilege. Let’s
grant this role Demo2 to our user hulk.
GRANT demo2 TO HULK;
Let’s execute this query.
Though this role is successfully granted but
still user hulk cannot use the privileges
of this role as it is in disabled state. May
be possible that it’s enabled in your case,
but in case it’s disabled then you can enable
it by using SET ROLE statement;
Let me show you how.
SET ROLE demo2 IDENTIFIED BY password123;
On executing this query oracle engine will
enable this role and user hulk can use all
its privileges. Let’s execute this query.
Role Demo2 Succeeded. Means now role demo2
is enabled.
