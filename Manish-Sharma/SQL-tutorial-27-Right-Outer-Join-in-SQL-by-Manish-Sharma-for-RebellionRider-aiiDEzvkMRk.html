rebellionrider.com and today in this SQL
tutorial we will see what right outer
join is as the name suggests right outer
join is a form of outer join that
returns each and every record from the
source table and returns only those
value from the target table that fulfill
the join condition since we are talking
about right outer join has source table
is the one situated on the right side of
the right outer join clause where the
target table is the one on the left side
of this clause so let's jump over the
SQL Developer and start with the
tutorial to make this concept easy to
understand let's quickly create two
tables the name of our first table will
be EMP and it will be having three
columns by the name of EMP ID EMP name
and EMP salary
here comes EMP ID will be the primary
key let's create
now we have our EMP table let's create
our second table the name of our second
table will be de PT and this table will
consist three columns the EPD ID the EPT
name and EMP ID here de PT ID will be
the primary key and the column EMP ID
will be the foreign key reference from
our first table EMP let's create
now we have created both our table let
me insert some data into these tables so
that we can use them to understand this
concept okay I have inserted the data
now let me show you the data in both
this table we have five rows in EMP
table now data in the dep t table here
as you can see we have five department
sales account fineness ID and marketing
and corresponding to each department we
have the employee ID if you remember EMP
ID is a foreign key constraint here
sales department one has employee ID 1
meaning employee with employee ID 1
which is steve work in sales department
similarly employee with employee ID to
work in account and employ ID 3 work in
finance department but none of the
employee working IT and marketing
department as we haven't assigned any
employee ID here now let's start with
the Curie's so table is created data is
inserted now we are all set and good to
go so let's do our first Kure of right
outer join our first Kure will be the
simplest one and here we will see how to
use right outer join with on clause but
before that let me clear this output
panel and make some space here so that
you people can see what's going on
here in this curie we are selecting EMP
name from EMP debug and de PT name from
de PT table as you can see here table
EMP is on the right hand side of a right
outer join Clause thus it's a source
table and table te PT is on the left
hand side of right outer join Clause
does it's a target table and next is our
join condition
basically there are two join condition
on and using we will see how to use
right outer join with using join
condition in our next Curie but for this
one we will concentrate our on join
condition as its on join condition then
it become mandatory for us to compare
columns from both source and target
table now when should we use on join
condition in SQL joints you asked first
when column which are participating in
on join condition have different name
and same data type or when columns which
are participating in on join condition
have same name and same data type so
let's execute the query and check out
the result here is our result as you can
see in this result all the records from
EMP table which is our source table are
returned but only those column from
target table de PT are written which
satisfy the expression in on join
condition now Curie two but before that
let me clear this output panel in our
last Curie we saw how to use right outer
join with on join condition now we will
see how to use right outer join with
using Clause for that we will use the
same previous Curie that's why we will
copy this Curie and paste it right here
and then after we will modify it so here
is our Curie now we typically apply
using clause with joins in SQL under two
circumstances first when we are
performing equi-join
this means that whenever we use equal to
comparison operator for comparing
columns over which we want to put join
secondly using Clause is also used when
the name and data type of column over
which you want to put join in your Curie
is
same to read more about equation you can
read SQL join article on my website the
link for that is in the description box
below when both these conditions are
satisfied then we can use using clause
let's use it as both on and using clause
or join condition we can use only one at
a time and not together in using Clause
we just have to supply name of a column
over which we want to emphasize join
let's execute this query here is our
result which is the same as previous
Kure now let's check out our third query
we use where clause when we want to
filter the result written by our curing
in the previous query we were extracting
employee's name with the department name
in which they were working say now you
want to extract only those employees who
have salary greater than 50,000 for this
our curie will be the same as previous
but along with an additional where
clause as our curie will be the same as
previous so we are going to copy this
query and paste it here and now we will
modify it accordingly we just have to
put where clause after the using or on
clause which is our join condition you
just simply have to write where and your
expression here this is our expression
now let's execute here is our result
that is all on right outer join for now
