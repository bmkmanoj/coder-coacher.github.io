I am Manish from RebellionRider.com. Today’s
video is the 2nd tutorial on the Data Pump
in Oracle Database Series. In the previous
video we learnt how to export full database
using expdp export utility of data pump. If
you haven’t watched it then just for you
link is in the description box.
And today we will learn how to export tablespaces
using expdp export utility of data pump in
oracle database.
Exporting tablespace means only the tables
contained in a specified set of tablespace
are unloaded along with its dependent objects.
Exporting tablespace using expdp export data
pump utility is also a way of taking logical
backup of tablespace of your Database.
So let’s move ahead and see how we can export
the tablespaces.
First log on to your database as sys user
with sysdba privileges
Ok here we are, now I am connected to my database
as sys user.
Now we have to decide which tablespace we
want to export. In order to do that first
we need to know how many tablespaces we have
and what are their names? For that we can
query “v$Tablespace” view provided by
oracle database.
SELECT name FROM v$tablespace;
As you can see I have six tablespaces in my
oracle database but in your system it can
be different. From these six I want to export
my Users and example tablespace.
Let’s see how we can export these two tablespaces
using expdp export utility.
Step 1 Create a directory
You can create a directory anywhere in your
system or on your network.
If you remember in my previous tutorial I
created a directory in my D drive by the name
of Data pump here it is. Now I will create
another directory by the name of Tablespace
Export inside this Data pump Directory.
The path for our Tablespace Export Directory
is D:\Data Pump\Tablespace Export.
So our directory has been created
Let’s move on to our Second step
Step 2: Create Directory Object and Grant
It mandatory Privileges.
Let’s get back our command prompt once again
and here we are
We use Create Directory command to create
a Directory Object. Let see how
CREATE DIRECTORY exp_tblsp AS ‘D:\Data Pump\Tablespace
Export’;
This command starts with Create Directory
keywords followed by Exp_tblsp which is the
name of our directory object you can give
whatever name you want to your directory object.
Then keyword AS which is followed by the Directory
path enclosed in single quote. Let’s hit
enter. Directory Created!
Now we have to grant read and write privileges
on this directory object exp_tblsp to the
user from which you want to perform the export.
In my case I want to perform the export using
my HR user thus I will grant these privileges
to my HR user.
GRANT read, write ON DIRECTORY exp_tblsp TO
hr;
This grant query is quite simple using this
grant query we are granting the read and write
privileges on the directory tablespace export
using the directory object exp_tblsp to the
user HR.
Everything is set. Now it’s time to perform
the export. As you can see right now I am
on my SQL prompt and expdp is a command line
utility which can only be executed on command
prompt not on SQL prompt thus we have to come
out of the SQL prompt for that simply write
exit and hit enter.
Here we are let me first clear the screen.
[CLS]
So now we are on the third and the last step
of exporting the tablespace using expdp export
utility where we will perform the export of
the tablespaces.
As we decided in the beginning of the tutorial
that we will export the USERS and EXAMPLE
tablespaces thus we will write the command
to export these two tablespaces. Let’s see
how
C:\&amp;gt; expdp hr/hr@ORCL DIRECTORY = exp_tblsp
DUMPFILE =tablespace.dmp LOGFILE=tblsp_log.log
TABLESPACES=USERS,EXAMPLE;
Let’s take a look at this command.
At the starting we have expdp which is our
data pump utility. Followed by the user credentials
through which you want to perform the export
though specifying the SID is optional but
it’s a good practice.
For specifying a SID of the database just
write @ followed by the SID as I did here.
Next we have DIRECTORY parameter here we have
to specify our directory object which we created
in the 2nd step as the value of this parameter.
This parameter tells export utility the location
where all the files of export will get saved.
Next we have DUMPFILE parameter. Dump file
are the files which will contain all the exported
data. Using this parameter you can set the
name of your dump files. Just like, here I
have set the name as tablespace.dmp. You can
give whatever name you want. If you want to
have more than 1 dump files then you can specify
their names here separated by commas. Remember
Dump files are written in binary language
by server and they must not be tampered by
any user.
Regarding the extension of your dump file,
you can give whatever extension you want to
it but it’s recommended as well as a good
practice to give them default extension which
is dot (.) dmp.
Next we have LOGFILE parameter. Using log
file parameter you can set the name of your
log files. Log files are human readable files
which consist of all the logs of your export.
Log files are very helpful in tracking the
status of your export. You can set whatever
name you want to your log file.
At the end we have tablespaces parameter.
First this parameter tells the data pump that
we want to perform a tablespace export which
means that we want to run data pump expdp
utility in tablespace mode. Second using this
tablespace parameter you specify the names
of tablespaces which you want to export. For
example here I have specified USERS and EXAMPLE
tablespace.
Let’s get back to the command prompt and
execute this expdp export command;
Export is successful. Let’s quickly take
a look of our tablespace export directory.
As you can see here we have our dump file
and log files.
That’s it for today hope you learnt something
you can also read my blog on the same topic
there you can find all these commands which
I performed here along with more in-depth
knowledge.
