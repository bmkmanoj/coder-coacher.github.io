I am Manish from RebellionRider.com and I
am here with another interesting SQL tutorial
for you all.
Today in this tutorial we will learn the concepts
of two interesting functions in SQL, LPAD
and RPAD.
I have done a few videos on SQL functions
before.
You can watch them also.
Links are in the description box.
So without further ado let’s start today’s
tutorial.
These two widely used functions return an
expression padded with special characters
to a specific length.
The expression can be a value stored in a
column or any user specific expression.
Let’s take a better look at the definition
and usage of these functions.
LPAD stands for Left Pad.
This function returns an expression padded
with the special character to the left side
of that expression returned.
And here is the Syntax
LPAD (expression/column name, length, padding-expression)
Expression/column name: first input is the
expression which you want to pad.
This can be any mathematics expression, character
strings or a column name.
Length which is a second parameter, using
this parameter you can set the maximum length
of the return value as it is displayed on
your screen.
And the last parameter is padding expression
which is a text expression that specifies
the padding characters.
The default value of padding expression is
a single blank.
Here also as a padding expression you can
either specify a special character such as
asterix sign, Hash or dollar sign etc. or
a mathematics expression or string.
But generally we use special characters.
Similar to the LPAD, RPAD function returns
an expression padded with the special character
to the right side of that expression returned.
The syntax of RPAD function is pretty much
same as that of LPAD function.
RPAD (expression, length, padding-expression)
Hope things are clear to you guys now so it’s
time to jump over to the SQL developer and
see some examples.
LPAD with Character String as Expression.
SELECT LPAD ('RebellionRider', 20, '#') FROM
dual;
In this query RebellionRider is our expression
which has a length of 14 character, and hash
sign is our padding character which will get
added to the left side of the string RebellionRider,
and 20 will be the total length of the string.
By Total I mean padding expression + the expression
which is a string RebellionRider in our case.
Let’s execute and here is our result.
As you can see 6 hash signs are added to the
left side of the string RebellionRider.
If you will count the total length of the
result then it will be 20 characters.
Let’s try RPAD function in the same query
SELECT RPAD ('RebellionRider', 20, '#') FROM
dual;
Execute, here is the result but this time
padding characters are on the right side of
the expression string.
Let’s see another example,
SELECT LPAD (salary, 20, '*') FROM employees;
Here in this query we are using values stored
in salary column of employees table as the
first parameter of LPAD function.
We set the total length of the result string
on 20 and we are using astrix sign as our
padded character.
Let’s execute
Here is our result.
All the rows of salary column with the astrix
sign are padded on the left side.
Let’s execute the same query with RPAD function
SELECT RPAD (salary, 20, '*') FROM employees;
Execute, this time also the result is the
same just the padding is on the right side.
Hope this made your concept clear and you
learnt something.

can also visit my blog for more in-depth knowledge
of the same concept.

Will see you soon with another tutorial till
then take care this is Manish from RebellionRider.com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
