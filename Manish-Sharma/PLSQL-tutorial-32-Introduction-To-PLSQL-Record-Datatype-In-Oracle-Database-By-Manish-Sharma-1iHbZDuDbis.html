Welcome back once again,
I am Manish from RebellionRider.com. Today
in this PL/SQL tutorial we will learn what
are Record DataTypes in Oracle Database?
I promised to cover this topic while doing
a PL/SQL tutorial on cursor for loop. On that
note, I want to say thank you so much guys
for the amazing response on database cursor
series which we just finished with the last
tutorial. For those who haven’t watched
that series, find the link of the playlist
in the description. That being said let’s
start today’s tutorial.
In Oracle PL/SQL we are provided with two
special kinds of data type which makes coding
PL/SQL much easier by reducing the line of
codes and give a cleaner look to your program.
These are:
• Anchored Data Type and
• Record Data Type.
We have already learnt the concepts of Anchored
types in PL/SQL tutorial 4. Thus today in
this tutorial we will learn what are records
in Oracle database? so
What are Records in Oracle Database?
Records are composite data structures made
up of different components called fields.
These fields can have different data types.
This means that you can store data of different
data types in a single record type variable.
In simple words we can say –
A record is a group of related data items
stored in fields, each with its own name
and datatype. Next is
Types of Record datatype in Oracle database
In Oracle PL/SQL we have three types of Record
datatype.
1. Table Based Record
2. Cursor Based Record, and
3. User Defined Record.
We will learn about each of these record datatypes
one video at a time. Now let’s see
How to declare a Record Datatype in Oracle
Database
Similar to %TYPE which is for declaring an
anchored datatype variable, Oracle PL/SQL
provides us an attribute % ROWTYPE for declaring
a variable with record datatype. Let’s take
a look at the syntax to understand how to
use % ROWTYPE attribute for declaring a record
type variable.
Syntax of Record Datatype
Let’s first checkout the syntax of table
based record datatype.
Variable_name table_name%ROWTYPE;
In order to declare a record type variable
first you have to specify the name of your
variable which could be anything you want.
But you have to follow the oracle guidelines
for variable name. You can read about variable
declaration in detail in PL/SQL tutorial 2.
Anyways after variable name we have to write
the name of the table, this table will serve
as the base table for the record. Also the
Oracle Server will then create corresponding
fields in the record that will have the same
name as that of a column in the table.
After the table name we have the %ROWTYPE
attribute, and then you end the declaration
using the semicolon.
In case if you want to declare a cursor based
record type variable then simply replace the
table name with the cursor name.
Variable_name cursor_name%ROWTYPE;
That’s it! A quick tutorial explaining the
basics of Record in Oracle Database. Stay
tuned as in the next tutorial we will learn
how to create a table based record as well
as see how to access data from record type
variable into our code.
For in depth knowledge you can also read about
the same topic on my website. Link is in the
description.
Hope you liked this quick introduction of
Records in Oracle Database. Please give this
video a thumbs up, also share it on your social
media. And don’t forget to subscribe. Thanks
for watching. I will be back soon with another
interesting tutorial. This is Manish from
