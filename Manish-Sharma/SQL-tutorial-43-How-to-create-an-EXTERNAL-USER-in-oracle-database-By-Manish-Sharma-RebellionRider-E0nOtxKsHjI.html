I am Manish from RebellionRider.com
Today in this SQL tutorial we will learn how
to create an external user.
I have already done a series of videos where
I showed you the different ways of creating
a local user in oracle database.
The authentication of local user is handled
by oracle data dictionaries using password.
But the authentication of external users is
managed by external services such as your
operating system.
The user who is authenticated by the operating
system can easily access the database without
being requested for a password.
So without further ado let’s start today’s
tutorial.
Before starting the tutorial I just wanna
tell you that using these steps you can create
external user in any windows, Linux as well
as on Mac environment.
Steps are the same.
The name of external user is a string which
is a combination of three factors.
These three factors are
1.
Hostname
Which is your computer’s name.
You can very easily find the hostname of your
machine, by simply writing hostname in your
command prompt and hitting enter.
This will show you the hostname of your machine.
Note here that a Hostname is only required
when you are creating an external user on
windows machine but if you are using a UNIX
or Linux machine then there is no need of
a hostname.
So you can Skip this step if you are on a
Linux Machine.
As we can see here my host name is ____________.
2.
User account name of your operating system
Second factor is the User account name of
your operating system.
This is the name of user account for which
you want to create the external user.
Mind here that the authentication information
of this account such as password will be served
as the authentication information of your
external user.
To find the user name of your OS simply write
echo %username% (Linux echo &quot;$USER&quot;).
My Username is __________.
3.
OS_AUTHENT_PREFIX, a special Oracle parameter.
The third factor here is OS_AUTHENT_PREFIX
which is a special oracle parameter.
This parameter is responsible for telling
the oracle that the user which we are going
to create is an external user and not a local
one or for that matter any other type of user.
The name of all the external users must start
with the value of this parameter.
To get the value of this parameter first you
need to log on to your database using sys
user with sysdba privileges.
And then write
SQL&amp;gt;Show Parameter os;
And here in the fourth line you can see the
value of OS_AUTHENT_PREFIX parameter which
is OPS$
Ok now we have the values for all the three
parameters now let’s create the name of
our external user.
While creating the name of the external user
you have to keep certain things in mind such
as
1.
Name of external user must always start with
the value of OS_AUTHENT_PREFIX parameter.
Followed by the hostname and then a backward
slash (\) after which comes your user account
name.
In case you are using UNIX or Linux Machine
then we will skip the host name from the name
of our external user.
Since now we know the name of our external
user hence creating it is a piece of cake.
To create an external user we will again use
the create user statement.
Let see how
SQL&amp;gt;CERATE USER “OPS$MANN-THINK\MANN”
IDENTIFIED externally;
Above query is fairly simple CREATE and USER
both are the keywords followed by the name
of our user which we just determined and then
IDENTIFIED clause which is followed by externally
keyword.
Always remember to enclose the name string
in double quotes as we have $ sign in the
string and this name string should be in all
caps
I highly suggest you to watch my videos on
how to create user for the better understanding
of the concept.
Link is in the description box.
Our external user has been created now we
have to grant this user a special as well
as mandatory system privilege which is “Create
Session” so that we can log on to database
using this user.
Now as it’s an external user this means
that all its authentications are handled by
operating system.
Thus to log on to our database using this
user we have to simply write
C:\&amp;gt;SQLPLUS /
No need to supply user name and password.
Let’s quickly check 
the user
SQL&amp;gt; SHOW user;
That’s it, that’s how we create an external
user.
That’s it for today hope you enjoyed watching.
