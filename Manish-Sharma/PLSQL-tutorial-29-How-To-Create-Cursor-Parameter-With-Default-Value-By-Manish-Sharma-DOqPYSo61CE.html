rebellionrider.com this PL sequel
tutorial is in the continuation of the
previous tutorial where we learned how
to create a parametrized cursor today we
will learn how to create a cursor
parameter with default value in order to
better understand this tutorial I highly
suggest you to watch the previous PL
sequel tutorial first if you haven't
already you can find the link on the top
corner as well as in the description so
without wasting much of your time let's
start the tutorial so as we have already
learnt that in PL sequel we are allowed
to create a cursor with parameter every
cursor parameter has some restrictions
which we have to comply with for example
we have to specify the argument for each
parameter when we open the cursor
otherwise we will get a pls double zero
3:06
error to overcome this restriction we
have the option called default value
default value is the value which you
assign to the parameter of your cursor
during the Declaration of the cursor
let's see how we do this
as you can see in this declaration
section of our PL sequel block we have
declared two variables V underscore name
and we underscore a ID for holding the
data returned by the cursor then we have
the parametrized cursor the cursor
declaration is pretty much similar to
the one which we declared in the
previous tutorial except for a minor
change in the parameter declaration this
time along with specifying a parameter I
have also assigned the value to it and
then next we have this select statement
this select statement will retrieve the
values from first name and employee ID
column where the employee ID is greater
than the value is stored into the
parameter that is the Declaration of the
cursor parameter with default value now
let's write the execution section of
this PL sequel block
as you can see in this execution section
I did not supply any argument to the
parameter when I open the cursor
followed by open cursor statement we
have the loop inside which we are
fetching the data from the cursor into
the variable V underscore name and we
underscore ie ID and displaying it back
on the screen let's try to execute this
PL sequel block and see whether our
cursor parameter with default value
works or not so here we have got the
result which consists of the first name
and employee ID of all the employees
whose employee ID is greater than 190
let me show you this result in full
screen here it is so we have 16 rows
returned by the cursor which means we
have 16 employees whose employee ID is
greater than 190 let's come back to the
cursor okay so we just saw how to create
a parameterised cursor with default
value and learn that the default value
minimizes the necessity of supplying
arguments for each parameter in open
cursor a statement you must be wondering
money what is the use of providing
default value to a parameter glad you
asked default value is not a substitute
value for the parameter of your cursor
this means that the default value comes
into action only when the user does not
specify the argument for the parameter
while opening the cursor in case you
have a parameterised cursor with default
value like the one we just created and
you also specified an argument for the
parameter in your open cursor statement
then the result written by the cursor
will be according to the value which is
supplied in the open cursor statement
and not according to the default value
let's see the demonstration but first
let me close this script output ok now I
will specify an argument value in open
cursor statement in this cursor and then
try to execute it again so I just
supplied an argument value which is 200
for the parameter var and s code e
underscore ID now if I will execute this
cursor then the result will be different
because this time the result returned by
the cursor will be according to the
value 200 not 190 let's execute
here is the result let me show this to
you on a separate screen here you can
see that this time we have only six rows
returned by the cursor unlike in the
previous execution where we had 16 rows
returned so we can say that is
specifying the default value for the
parameter of your cursor can increase
the efficiency of your app or code by
minimizing the chances of pls 0 0 3 0 6
error so that's it on the tutorial on
how to create parameterised conserving
default value hope you enjoyed watching
and learn something new you can share
your experience with me either by
leaving a comment down below or you can
also tweet me do make sure to give this
video a thumbs up and also share this PL
sequel tutorial with your friends on
your Facebook Twitter or by any means
you find convenient stay tuned I will be
back with another interesting PL sequel
tutorial soon till then take care this
