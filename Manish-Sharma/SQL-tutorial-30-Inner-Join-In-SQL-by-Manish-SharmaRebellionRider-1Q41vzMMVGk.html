I am Manish from rebellionrider.com.
And today�s SQL tutorial is about Inner
JOIN
With the previous tutorial we have completed
all the outer joins.
If you haven�t watched them, then I am putting
the link for those videos in the description
box.
So go ahead and knock yourself out!
Let�s start today�s tutorial with a brief
intro of Inner Join.
Unlike outer join, Inner Join returns only
those records from both the tables which satisfy
the ON or UISNG clause or for that matter
the Join condition.
Let�s have a look of Inner Join�s Syntax
Syntax is pretty similar to that of outer
join.
But still:
I am assuming that you have watched my previous
videos on Outer Join so I am not going to
bore you with the explanations of this syntax.
Anyway if you want then you can pause this
video and have good look at this syntax.
Still if you want to read the explanation
then it�s right there on my website only
for you.
And you know where to find the link� Yes
in the description box.
Be happy and enjoy SQLing�.
So let�s Jump over to our first query.
Once again we will be using the same table
which we have used so far in the Outer Join
series.
These are the emp and dept tables.
Before that just want to tell you that you
can download this SQL script from my website.
Link is in the description box;
Ok Let�s write our first query.
SELECT emp_name,dept_name FROM emp
You can either write INNER JOIN or Just JOIN
both are permissible and perform the same
task.
INNER JOIN dept ON(emp.EMP_ID = dept.EMP_ID);
Here in the first line of our query we are
retrieving employee�s name from emp table
and department�s name from dept table
And in the second line we have our join clause
which is inner join
In the third line we have our Join condition
which is ON clause
And is fairly simple as we are comparing values
of emp id column of emp table with the values
of emp_id column in dept table
Let�s execute and checkout the result.
And here is our result which consists of only
3 rows.
Let�s have an in-depth look of this result.
Here is our two table emp and dept which we
have used in our query.
And here is our result table.
I have already told you in the definition
of inner join that it returns only those records
from both the tables which satisfy the ON
or using clause or Join condition.
Which means as soon as SQL engine finds a
matching record in emp id column of both the
table it will return the corresponding records
which is emp name and dept name in our case.
For example for emp id 1 in emp table there
is matching record in dept table which is
row 1 thus corresponding records get returned.
Similarly for emp id 2 there is a matching
record in dept table which is row 2 and so
on.
Since the last two records do not fulfill
the Join condition hence they are not the
part of our result set.
Hope things are clear now.
Now Let�s jump over to our second query
which will be inner join with USING clause.
Hope you remember we use USING clause when
the column in join condition share same name
and same data type and are compared only using
= comparison operator and no other comparison
operator such as greater than, less than etc.
To demonstrate the Inner join with USING clause
we will copy our first query and modify it.
Let�s copy 
and paste this query.
As you can see, in the ON clause we have used
emp id column which is common in both tables
and share the same name and data type moreover
we are comparing emp id column of both table
using = comparison operator thus we can easily
replace this ON clause with USING clause.
On executing the result of this query will
be the same as that of our first query.
Let�s execute and check out.
There you go.
You can visit my website for more in-depth
knowledge on inner join with Where and ORDER
BY clause.
That�s it for today.
Hope you enjoyed watching.
