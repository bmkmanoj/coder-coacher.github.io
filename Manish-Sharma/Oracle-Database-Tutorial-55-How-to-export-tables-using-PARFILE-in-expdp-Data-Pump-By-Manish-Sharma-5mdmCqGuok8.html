And I am back once again with another Oracle
Database tutorial. Till so far we have seen
how to export full database, schema of the
database and tablespace of the database. The
only export which remains left is table export.
Thus in today’s data pump tutorial we will
learn how to export tables using expdp export.
But there is a twist in today’s tutorial.
In the previous three tutorials I demonstrated
you the traditional way of exporting but today
I will show you how you can perform the export
of tables using parameter file in expdp utility.
So without further ado let’s start the tutorial.
Like always first we need to make a directory.
You can create a directory anywhere in your
system and give it a name. This directory
will serve as the default directory which
will hold all the files created by expdp data
pump utility such as Dump file and Log file.
So let’s create the directory.
I just created a directory and named it Table
Export and I placed this directory inside
the folder data pump which is in my D drive.
Thus the full path of our directory Table
Export is “D:\Data Pump\Table Export”.
Next we will create a directory object. As
I have already explained in my previous tutorial
that Directory object is a pointer pointing
over a directory which you want your expdp
utility to use when storing all exported files.
So to make a Directory object first we need
to log on to our database using sys user with
sysdba privileges. Here I am.
Now let’s create the directory object but
first let me clear the screen for you. Let’s
create the directory object
SQL&amp;gt; CREATE DIRECTORY exp_table AS ‘D:\Data
Pump\Table Export’;
Let’s hit the enter and execute the query.
Directory created
Using this query we created a directory object
and named it exp_table. This directory object
will point the directory Table export.
Next we will grant the read and write privileges
on the directory table export which we just
created to the user who wants to perform the
export. For the demonstration I will use my
user HR to perform the export. You can use
whatever user you want.
SQL&amp;gt;GRANT read, write ON DIRECTORY exp_table
TO hr;
Grant succeeded
Apart from read and write you will also have
to grant “Datapump_Exp_Full_Database”
role to your user from which you are performing
the export. And as I already told you in my
case this user is HR.
SQL&amp;gt;GRANT datapump_exp_full_database TO hr;
Grant succeeded
These are a few general settings which you
have to do before performing the export.
Next we have to create the parameter file.
Parameter file is just a simple text file
which you can create anywhere in your system,
and give whatever name and extension you want
though it’s always recommended to give .par
extension.
I will create my parameter file in my D drive.
Let’s come here and just go back now I am
in my D drive.
Creation process is very simple just right
click and select new then select text document.
Let’s give it some name
For the demonstration I have named it table
dot par.
Next I will open this file with my Notepad.
This file must contain all the required parameters
of expdp data pump utility. Let’s write
it
Let’s take a look of our parameter file
First is the directory parameter which is
set on the directory object exp_table which
we just created.
Next is DUMPFILE parameter using which you
can set the name of your dump-files. You can
give whatever name you want as I have given
hr_table.dmp.
Similarly using log-file parameter you can
set the name of your log file.
And the last parameter here is TABLES.
This parameter specifies that we want to perform
a table mode export. As I want to export employees
and departments tables of my HR schema thus
I have specified employees and departments
tables as the value of this parameter.
Similarly you can supply SCHEMA parameter
Or TABLESPACES parameter if you want to do
schema or tablespace export.
But right now we want to export tables so
let it be tables here.
Save this file and close it.
Again come to your command prompt. Now it’s
time to perform the export Do remember to
exit from your SQL prompt. Because we can
execute expdp only on command prompt not on
the SQL prompt.
Ok as you can right now I am on my command
prompt. Let me clear the screen first
Ok now let’s write the expdp export command.
C:\&amp;gt;expdp hr/hr@ORCL PARFILE = ‘D:\Table.par’
Command is fairly simple first we have our
expdp utility followed by login information.
You cannot supply login information in your
parameter file and so you have to write your
login information at the time of writing expdp
command only. Then we have PARFILE parameter.
The value of this parameter is the path of
your parameter file.
Let’s execute this command. Here we go.
As you can see export is successful.
Please visit my blog here you can find the
answers of questions like what is parameter
file/ where should we create it and what are
the naming conventions of parameter file also
what are the contents of the parameter file
along with all the commands which I have performed
in this tutorial and the in-depth knowledge
of the topics. You can find the link of this
blog in the description.
