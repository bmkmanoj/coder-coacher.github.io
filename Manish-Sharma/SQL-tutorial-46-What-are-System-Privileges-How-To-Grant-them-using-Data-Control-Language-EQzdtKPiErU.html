Welcome back once again this is Manish from
rebellionrider.com
And as I promised in my previous video, today
we will learn about system privileges in this
SQL tutorial.
As we have already discussed in the previous
video, System Privileges are some powerful
special rights given to a user to perform
standard administrator tasks in the database.
As these rights are quite powerful that means
you should be a bit cautious while granting
them.
I have done a blog post over System privilege
on my website where I have explained everything
in detail; I encourage you to read it.
So without wasting much time let’s jump
over to SQL developer and start the fun.
For the demonstration I will use two users
HULK and BATMAN which I created during my
“Create user tutorials”. If you haven’t
watched the tutorials on how to create user
then find the link in the description box.
Hulk and batman both these users are normal
user and don’t have any rights or privileges
except the create session system privilege.
So now I am going to demonstrate you the different
ways of granting system privileges to these
users. As you know to assign any privilege
to any user in oracle database we use GRANT
data control language statement or DCL statements.
And to use GRANT statement you must have either
GRANT ANY PRIVILEGE system privilege or you
must have been granted the system privilege
with the ADMIN OPTION. And if you are a Sysdba
then you can simply log on to your database
using sys user with sysdba privileges. Which
I am going to do right now,
I am going to connect to my database using
“sys” user.
Now I am connected to my database using my
“sys” user. Let me show you the user once.
As you can see my user is sys.
Now let’s perform our first query.
In our first query we will grant a very basic
privilege which is create table to our user
HULK. To grant create table system privilege
to user hulk we will write
GRANT create table TO hulk;
This query is fairly simple, Grant is an oracle
keyword followed by create table which is
the name of system privilege which we want
to grant to our user HULK. Then we have another
keyword TO followed by the username hulk to
which we want to assign this privilege. Isn’t
it simple?
Now let’s move on to Second Query
Generally after creating a user we have to
grant several system privileges to them. In
this case we can either write separate grant
statements for granting individual privilege
or we can club all the privileges in a single
Grant statement. Let’s see how.
Say we want to grant create synonym, create
view and create sequence system privileges
to the user HULK, for that we will write
GRANT create synonym, create view, create
sequence TO hulk;
Query is very similar to the above one except
that here we write all the system privileges
together and have them separated using comma
(,).
But here we have to take care of a few things
such as this list of privileges must only
contain system privileges and not any object
privilege. This is because system privileges
and object privileges cannot be granted together
in a single grant command.
Remember this tip because if you are preparing
for SQL Expert exam then chances are there
that you may face this question. Let’s execute
the query. Grant succeeded.
Now third query
In the previous query we saw how to grant
more than one system privilege to only one
user in a single Grant statement. What if
you want to grant privileges to more than
one user? In this query we will see how to
grant system privilege to more than one user
in a single grant statement.
Let say we want to grant create procedure
system privilege to both our user Hulk and
Batman. For that the query will be.
GRANT create procedure TO hulk, batman;
Query is pretty similar to the last one except
that this time we write the username separated
by a comma.
Now let’s move on to our next query (query
4).
In this query I will demonstrate you how to
grant system privilege with Admin Option.
But before moving ahead let me tell you that
you can use admin option flag only while granting
system privilege not with object privilege.
Granting a system privilege with Admin Option
Flag means that the grantee can grant or revoke
the system privilege or role to or from any
user or any other role in the database.
Also the grantee can further grant the system
privilege or role with the ADMIN OPTION to
any other user and role.
So let’s say we want to grant CREATE TRIGGER
system privilege to our user Batman with Admin
Option then for that we will write.
GRANT create trigger TO batman WITH ADMIN
OPTION;
On executing this query our user batman not
only gets create trigger system privilege
but can also grant, revoke, and drop the create
trigger privilege to and from any user and
roles.
Now our user batman has create trigger system
privilege with ADMIN option, Means user batman
can now grant this create trigger system privilege
to any other user. Let me demonstrate this
thing to you. For that what I will do I will
use my command prompt.
And here is our command prompt.
Now What I will do I will connect to my database
using the user Batman. For that we have to
write. Now I am connected to my database using
the user Batman. Let me show you the user.
As you can see the user is Batman.
Now I will grant the create trigger system
privilege to user HULK using this user BATMAN.
For that we have to write. If you want you
can also add WITH ADMIN OPTION here. Now hot
enter, grant is succeeded.
See ! that is the purpose of WITH ADMIN OPTION
flag.
That’s all for today guys.
