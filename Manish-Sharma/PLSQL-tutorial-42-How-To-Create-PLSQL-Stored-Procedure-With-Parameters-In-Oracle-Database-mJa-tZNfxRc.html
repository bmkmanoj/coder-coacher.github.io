rebellionrider.com and today in this PL
sequel tutorial we will learn how to
create PL sequel stored procedures with
parameters in Oracle database for those
who are new to this stored procedure
series we have already discussed the
foundation theory in PL sequel tutorial
40 on introduction to stored procedures
we have also learnt how to create rule
procedures without parameter in the
previous tutorial you can find all the
links in the description below also
those of you who are new to my youtube
channel a hearty welcome to the family
here on this channel we make learning
Oracle database fun so please do make
sure to subscribe as many more
interesting tutorials are on their way
that being said let's start this PL
sequel to Sharia here I will do an
example where I will create a stored
procedure which will accept two
parameters here is our procedure with
name EMP underscore cell in the
signature of this PL sequel stored
procedure we can see that it is
accepting two parameters first is DEP
underscore ID and the second is SEL
underscore raise and both these
parameters are of number data type here
I want to mention one thing actually I
forgot to mention this in the last
tutorial whenever you create a PL sequel
procedure or a function without
parameter you don't put parentheses
followed by the name unlike other
programming languages okay so let's move
forward and write the execution section
of this procedure and find out what is
it gonna do
so here we have the execution section of
our procedure by looking at the code of
this execution section you must have
understood that this procedure is for
giving a department-wide celery wreath
to all the employees for a better
understanding I have tried to make this
code as simple as possible in the
execution section we only have one DML
statement which is update using which we
are updating the salary column of
employees table as you can see in this
update statement we have consumed both
the parameters first parameter which is
the DEP underscore ID is used to
determine the ID of the department and
second parameter which is SEL underscore
real will become the multiplication
factor in these salary fields you can
write the business logic like this then
wrap them up into a procedure and call
them in your app when needed this will
give you more control on your app it
will also save you from writing the same
code again and again you can make this
execution block and DML statement more
sturdy as well as complex according to
the need of your project but for the
purpose of demonstration of how to
create PL sequel stored procedure with
parameter I think this will suffice
simple clean and easy to understand so
let's execute this stored procedure and
see whether it works or not procedure
EMP underscore Cell compiled
successfully before winding up this
tutorial here is today's question for
you write a stored procedure with
parameter for calculating third highest
salary of the employee use the
employee's table of HR schema you can
send your answers in the comment section
down below or on my social profile all
the links are in the description hope
this example helped you in learning the
concepts of PL sequel stored procedure
creation if you learned something and
enjoyed watching then do make sure to
give this video a thumbs up you can also
help others in learning as well as
support me and my channel by sharing
this video on your social media with
your friends that's it for today on how
to create
else equal stored procedure with
parameters in Oracle database thanks for
watching this is money from
