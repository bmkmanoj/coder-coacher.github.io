rebellionrider.com two years back I did
the tutorial on how to install Oracle
SQL Developer on windows 7 since then so
many things have changed several updates
and voyages of SQL Developer have come
out moreover most of us have updated our
OS from windows 7 to Windows 10 so I
guess it's the right time to do an
update video and learn how to install
Oracle SQL Developer on Windows 10 64
bit all those who have Windows 10 32-bit
shouldn't worry as you can still follow
this tutorial since all these steps are
the same
before we get on with this tutorial let
me clear the most common doubt that I
received from you guys in comments and
email
SQL developer is a free database
management and development tool created
by Oracle itself you do not have to pay
a single penny to use this software
though sequel developer is completely
free yet it is a very powerful tool in
the market and packs several features
which you don't even find in various
paid software moreover both database
developer an administrator can take
advantage from this tool before starting
this SQL developer tutorial let me be
clear that this is not a sponsored video
and I am NOT getting paid for doing this
tutorial that being said let's star
SQL developer software will require the
latest version of JDK Java development
kit installed on the system for the
proper working if you already have JDK
installed on your Windows 10 then you
can skip this step let's quickly
download JDK first head over to google
and search for JDK then go to the first
link once you are here click this
download button under JDK section this
will take you to the java SE development
kit 8 download page to download the JDK
you first have to accept the License
Agreement and then from the list
download the JDK compatible with your
operating system in my case I'm
installing it on my Windows 10 64 bit so
I will download files from the last link
which is Windows x64 if you are
installing JDK on Windows 32-bit version
then download the JDK from the windows
x86 link which is the second last in the
list you can find this red link for JDK
download in the video description right
below the like button anyways just to
save your time I have already downloaded
the JDK 8 as you can see here it is an
executable file
thus right-click on it and select run as
administrator press next on the welcome
screen from the custom setup note down
this directory path somewhere this will
be your JDK home path where your JDK
will be installed and you will need to
supply this part to your sequel
developer tool if you want then you can
change this directory location for your
JDK but I am good with the default
location now click Next this will start
the JDK installation this installation
could take some time thus I am
fast-forwarding this process Java
development toolkit will also install
JRE Java Runtime environment on your
system for that it will ask you to
specify the location for its
installation if you want to change the
default location you can click this
change but an otherwise hit next
so what Java SE development kit it has
been successfully installed next we have
to install the sequel developer on
Windows 10
SQL developer does not require any
installation you simply have to download
and extract the SQL developer executable
files and start using them let's see how
first we will have to download the
sequel developer software for that again
go to google and search SQL Developer
then go to the SQL developer download
website which is usually the first link
in the search for your convenience I
have provided this SQL developer
download direct link in the description
below once you are here accept the
License Agreement and scroll down a
little bit here you will find the list
of all the SQL developer tools available
for different platforms here you have
two options you can either download the
SQL developer from the first link which
is only available for Windows 64-bit and
include JDK 8 or you can download the
SQL developer from this second link
which is available for both Windows 32
and 64-bit version as we have already
downloaded and installed the JDK 8 on
our system thus we will download the SQL
developer from the second link to
download the SQL developer files you
need to supply the username and password
and sign in to your Oracle account if
you don't have your Oracle account then
create one it's completely free of
course again to save the time I have
already downloaded the SQL developer
software as you can see software is
downloaded as a zip file it does first
we have to extract the contents of this
jipped folder
here we have the extracted content which
is a folder with the name SQL Developer
I always prefer to place this folder
along with all my Oracle database
directories even though it is not
mandatory at all you can place this
folder anywhere in your Windows 10 next
open this folder and find an executable
file whose name is SQL Developer dot exe
remember I said SQL Developer does not
require any installation to launch the
software you simply have to find SQL
Developer dot exe and execute it so here
is the desired executable file now
double-click and execute it on execution
you will see a security warning don't
worry about that if you do not want to
see this warning again simply uncheck
this checkbox and hit run this will
launch your SQL Developer next SQL
Developer will ask you to supply the
Java JDK home path this is the path
which we noted down in the second step
of JDK installation in case you forgot
to do that you can always find your JDK
home in the Java folder which is located
in Program Files directory also you do
not have to specify a JDK path every
time you open your SQL Developer it's a
one-time thing only once you specify the
correct path then hit OK you will get
your SQL Developer that's all you have
to do if you want to learn how to make a
database connection using users such as
HR or sis in SQL Developer then I
suggest you to watch the SQL video for
or read the blog on the same find all
the links in the description that's all
about on how to install oracle SQL
developer on Windows 10 64-bit hope you
