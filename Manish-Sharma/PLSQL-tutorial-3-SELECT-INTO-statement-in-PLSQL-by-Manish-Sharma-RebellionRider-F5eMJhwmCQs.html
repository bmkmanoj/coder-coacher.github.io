I am Manish from RebellionRider.com and I
am back once again with another PL/SQL tutorial.
This tutorial is in the continuation of the
previous PL/SQL tutorial where we learnt what
are variables as well as how to declare and
initialize them.
There we saw two different examples of direct
initialization.
Now today in this tutorial we will learn how
to initialize a variable using SELECT INTO
statement.
In other words how to initialize a variable
by fetching data from any table of a database.
So without wasting much of your time let’s
get started.
As I said in my previous tutorial, that every
variable must be declared prior to its use
and we can only declare a variable in declaration
section of PL/SQL block.
So let’s write our declaration section and
declare our variable.
DECLARE
v_salary NUMBER(8);
Ok here is my declaration section where I
declared a variable by the name of v_salary
which has data type Number and data width
8.
One thing you must take care while declaring
variable here is that the data type and data
width of your variable and the column whose
value you want to fetch must match.
Ok next let’s write our SELECT INTO statement.
This statement is an executable statement
thus this will go into execution section of
our block.
So let’s write this execution section.
BEGIN
SELECT salary INTO v_salary FROM employees;
END;
This is our execution section as its starts
with BEGIN keyword and ends with END keyword.
Inside this section we have our SELECT statement.
Using this Select statement I am fetching
values from salary column of employees table
and by using INTO clause I am storing these
values into the variable v_salary.
v_salary is a variable which is capable of
holding one record at a time but the select
statement which we have here is returning
multiple values thus we will get an error
if we attempt to execute this block.
To solve this problem we can use the WHERE
clause and filter the result let’s see how.
BEGIN
SELECT salary INTO v_salary FROM employees
WHERE employee_id = 100;
END;
Now this select statement will return single
record which will be the salary of the employee
whose employee id is 100.
There are other ways also to solve this problem
such as using collection that we will discuss
in separate video.
For time being let’s concentrate on this.
Let’s execute.
Block compiled successfully without any error
but it didn’t display anything.
To display the value stored in our variable
v_salary let’s add DBMS_OUTPUT statement
to this anonymous block.
BEGIN
SELECT salary INTO v_salary FROM employees
WHERE employee_id = 100;
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE (v_salary);
END;
Also we have to enable the server output so
that we can see the result returned by this
DBMS_OUTPUT statement.
So let’s set the server output on
SET SERVEROUTPUT ON;
Now let’s execute this anonymous block again
and here is our result the salary of employee
with employee id 100 is 24000.
That’s a very simple example explaining
the concept of initializing the variable by
fetching values from base table or say using
SELECT INTO statement.
Before winding up this tutorial let’s do
one more example.
That will better clarify the concept and help
you in understanding.
Ok suppose along with Salary you also want
to display the first name of the employee
using PL/SQL.
Let’s write another PL/SQL block.
This time we will have to declare two different
variables as we are fetching data from two
different columns.
Ok so let’s go ahead and write our second
anonymous block but before that let me close
this script output.
Now one more thing I want to say here, when
you are done writing your anonymous or any
named block don’t forget to put this forward
slash.
This forward slash indicates the completion
of your block.
Ok now let’s write our second anonymous
block
DECLARE
v_salary NUMBER(8);
v_fname VARCHAR2 (20);
Ok here I have two variables v_salary which
will hold the value from salary column and
v_fname which will hold the value from first
name column of employees table.
Now let’s write our Select statement.
BEGIN
SELECT first_name, salary INTO v_fname, v_salary
FROM employees
WHERE employee_id =100;
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(v_fname||'
has salary '||v_salary);
END;
This select statement is very similar to the
previous one except the one extra column first
name and variable v_fname.
This select statement will return the first
name and salary of the employees whose employee
id is 100 and then those values will be stored
into our variable v_ fname and v_salary.
Few things which you must take care here are
1.
As I explained a while ago that variable v_fname
and v_salary can hold only one data at a time
thus make sure your select statement will
return data from one row at a time.
You can ensure this by using WHERE clause.
2.
The value from salary and first name columns
will be stored into variable v_salary and
v_fname respectively hence you should always
make sure that the data type and data width
of the variable matches that of the columns.
Ok so let’s execute this anonymous PL/SQL
block and see the result.
And here is our result.
The sole purpose of doing this example is
to demonstrate how you can store values from
multiple columns into multiple variables.
Hope you learnt something.
With this I will wind up todays tutorial.
