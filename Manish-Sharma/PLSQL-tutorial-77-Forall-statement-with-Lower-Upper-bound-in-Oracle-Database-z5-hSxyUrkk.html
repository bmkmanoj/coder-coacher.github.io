rebellionrider.com welcome to the second
tutorial in the for all series and the
sixth one in the bulk data processing
series today we will learn how to use
for all statement with the first bound
clause which is lower and upper bound
before starting let's understand one
thing for all a statement does the same
work as the bulk collect clause but in
the inverse manner for example with bulk
collect we were fetching the data from
the tables and storing it into the
collection but now with foreign
statement we will fetch the data from
the collection and store it into the
table that being said let's come back to
our first bound clause or Forell
statement which is lower and upper bound
in lower and upper bound we have to
specify the valid range of consecutive
index numbers of the collection taking
both the points which we discussed so
far let's do an example and try to
understand for all a statement with
lower and upper bound clause more
clearly so with for all statement we
fetch the data from the collection and
store it into the table which means we
need a collection with some data and a
table into which we can dump that data
let's first set the server output on and
then start with creating a new table for
holding the data here is the table just
to keep the demonstration simple we have
a table with no constraints on it and
consists only of column mu l underscore
tab for holding the multiplication table
no fancy stuff I think it is simple
enough to easily understand the concept
let's move ahead next we will write a
pl/sql block into which we will be
creating a collection and then
populating it with some data then using
for all statement we will dump that data
into our table tu t underscore 77 so
let's do it
before writing the execution section
let's quickly take a look at what we
have done in the declaration section
here in this section we have declared an
associative array with the name my
underscore array along with its
collection variable for more details on
associative arrays you can refer to my
pl/sql tutorial number 57 I will leave
the link in the description below next
to the associative array we have
declared another variable with the name
tu t underscore Ric of number data type
we will use this variable to check how
many records are fetched from the
collection and is stored into the table
now let's move ahead
we have started our execution section
with a four loop using this numeric four
loop we are populating our collection my
underscore array with the multiplication
table of nine task number one creating a
table is done task number two declaring
and populating the collection is also
done these two tasks set the stage for
the demonstration of the for all
statement now we are left with the last
task here we will take the data from the
collection my underscore array and store
it into the table tu t underscore 77
using for all statement
so let's write the for all statement
here is our for all statement in this
statement we have used 1 as our lower
bound and 10 as our upper bound the DML
operation which we are performing using
our for all a statement is insert using
this insert DML we are inserting values
into our table tu t underscore 77 so
what are these values these are the
values which we inserted into the
collection my underscore airing as you
know that there are two mandatory rules
that must be followed while writing the
for all statement these rules are
firstly a for all statement can have
only one DML statement at a time
secondly that DML statement in its
either values or where clause must
reference the collection whose indexes
we used in our bound clause
let's analyze our for all statement our
for only statement has only one DML
which is insert and this insert DML
statement is referencing the collection
my underscore Eric through the
collection variable Co l underscore var
in its values clause which means both
the rules are being fulfilled and we are
good to go let's do one more thing
before execution
just to insure that our program has
executed as we expected we have these
two statements here using the first
statement we are storing the value which
is the total number of Records of the
table tud underscored 77 into the
variable T ot underscore our EC and
using this second statement which is an
output statement we are displaying back
that value from the variable T ot
underscore R is e to the user if the
output of this DBMS output statement is
10 then we can say that our program has
executed successfully this is because we
have programmed our for all statement to
insert only 10 records into our table I
am expecting there is no data initially
stored into this table as we have just
created it so let's execute this program
and raise the curtains here is our
result
unfortunately it is 10 this means the
program worked as per our expectations
every execution of this program will
append 10 records to the previously
stored data in the table and the result
of this output statement will change
accordingly hope this demonstration
helped you in understanding the concepts
of for all with a lower and upper bound
Clause if so then to make sure to hit
the thumbs up button and like the video
also share it with your friends on your
social media and subscribe to the
channel if you haven't already this is
the tutorial on bulk data processing
with pl/sql for all a statement with the
first bound clause that is lower and
upper bound in Oracle database
