rebellionrider.com and am back once
again with another oracle database
tutorial actually today's tutorial is
more about oracle database 12c so today
we will learn how to unlock HR schema in
Oracle Database 12c unlocking HR schema
in Oracle Database 12c is not as easy as
it was with the earlier version of
Oracle databases such as 10g and 11 it's
because of the new and updated
architecture of Oracle Database 12c
where we have container and pluggable
databases Here I am presuming that you
already have some knowledge about 12c
architecture because in order to
understand this tutorial a brief
knowledge of multi-tenant architecture
is required so without further ado let's
start the tutorial in Oracle Database
12c the HR sample schema is placed
inside the pluggable database which is
created either during the installation
of this version of Oracle database or
during the creation of a new container
database just to unlock the HR schema in
Oracle Database 12c first we need the
name of that pluggable database along
with the name of the service which is
associated with the pluggable database
and responsible for client and database
communication so let's find out this
information to get all these information
we need to log on to the database using
sis user for that open up your command
prompt and connect with the database
unlike the previous version of Oracle
database here in Oracle Database 12c
when we log on to the database we
connect with the containers this
container can either be of CBD container
or PPD pluggable database container but
by default it's always root CBD
container you can check whether you are
inside the root CBD container or any
pluggable database container from the
value of corn underscore name parameter
let me show you how but before that let
me clear the screen okay done now right
as you can see right now I'm inside my
CBD root container next we will find out
the name of the pluggable database which
has our HR sample schema using V dollar
pdbs view in this query along with the
name of all pluggable databases
I am also retrieving their container ID
because using the corresponding value of
corn underscore ID column we can easily
find out the name of service which is
associated with the pluggable database
that we require so hit enter and execute
the query and here we are as you can see
right now I have two pluggable database
available in my system first is PB DC
with the container ID 2 this is a
default pluggable database that the
system uses as a template for user
created pdbs next is pdborcl
which is applicable databases that was
created by me during the installation of
my Oracle 12c in
the last video and has a HR sample
schema thus we are going to use this
pdborcl pluggable database to unlock our
HR schema and using its container ID
which here is 3 we will find out the
name of its service to find out the name
of this service we will use V dollar
active underscore services view in most
of the cases Oracle's of way creates
database and their service with same
name this query will return the name of
the service of pdborcl as I have a
specified corn ID 3 in the where
condition let's execute as you can see
the name of the service is also pdborcl
next we have to make an entry in a TNS
name dot or a file for the hassle-free
login from our HR user and to avoid TNS
or errors so first let's zoom out a
little bit and come to our desktop and
here we go let's minimize this command
prompt also ok everything is set so
first open your TNS name node or a file
for that first you have to go to your
Oracle home directory and mine is inside
the C Drive and then Oracle DB 12c next
is app then rebellion writer then
product and then 12.1.0 and then DB home
one here fine network directory and here
it is then go to this admin directory
and here is your TNS name dot or a file
open this file with a text editor i will
use my notepad plus plus now though you
can use net CA to add a service entry
but here I will add the service entry
manually just to save the time to add
pdborcl service entry i will copy this
ORCL service block and paste it at the
end of the file now in this block we
have to change two things firstly the
name of the service entry and the value
of the service underscore the impact
just replace the name of our CL from
pdborcl which is the name of our
pluggable database and replace the value
of service name tag again with pdborcl
which is the name of this service which
we just found out ok save the file and
exit as we just change the listener
setting by adding a new service to it
does we need to reload the listener to
make all these services active for that
open up your command prompt but this
time with administrative privilege in
order to do that open your Start menu
and search for CMD and then right-click
or CMD dot exe and select run as
administrator
ok and here we are now to reload the
listener just right and to EXCI
you dis just hit enter the command
completed successfully
now again log on to your database using
sis user versus DBA privileges but first
let me clear the screen now let's again
log on to our database using our sis
user and here we are as you can see
right now I am in route CBD container
and as I mentioned earlier that in
Oracle Database 12c HR sample schema
resides inside the pluggable database
container thus first we need to switch
the container from root CBD to pdborcl
or that we will use alter section
commands let me show you how but first
let me again clear this screen okay
such an Alta means we have successfully
switch our container let's confirm it by
checking the value of corn underscore
name parameter again as you can see that
now our container is pdborcl next as you
already know that to perform any details
such as alter user command the database
need to be open but by default in most
of the cases pluggable databases are in
bound stage you can check the present
open mode of pluggable database using v
dollar pdbs view let me show you how
from the result returned from this query
we can clearly see that our pluggable
database pdb ORCL is in the mount stage
so first we need to open this pdborcl
database for that we have to use alter
pluggable database DDL commands let's
see how okay hit enter and execute
pluggable database alter okay let's once
again confirm it as you can see our
pluggable database is now open and ready
for read and write operation with this
we are done with all the settings and
now we are all set to unlock the HR
sample schema and to unlock the HR
sample schema just write the legendary
alter user come on let me first clear
the screen
okay hit enter user alter now let's try
to connect to our database using this HR
user unlike the earlier version of
Oracle databases 12c requires you to
provide service name along with the
login credential of HR user the service
entry which we created in DNS name dot
or a file can be specified here using at
the rate sign followed by the username
and password in connection string let me
show you how let's hit enter and connect
to our HR user as you can see right now
I am connected to my database using my
HR user let me quickly show you the user
and here is the username which is HR
so we are now successfully logged in
using our HR user with this I will wind
up today's tutorial on how to unlock HR
user in Oracle Database 12c you can
visit my website for in-depth knowledge
of the concept and can find out all the
commands in detail which I perform here
along with the solution of some common
error related to this topic the link for
the blog is in the description box
that's it for today hope you learned
something and enjoyed the tutorial I
would appreciate if you can help me in
