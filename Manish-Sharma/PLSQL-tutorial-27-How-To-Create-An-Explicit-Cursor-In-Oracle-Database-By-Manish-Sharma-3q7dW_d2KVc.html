rebellionrider.com welcome to the second
video of database cursor series
in the previous PL sequel tutorial we
saw what our database cursors today we
will learn how to create a cursor in
Oracle database using easy to understand
examples in order to better understand
to this PL sequel tutorial I highly
suggest you to first watch the previous
video on the introduction to the
database cursor link is in the
description so without wasting much of
your time let's start the tutorial in
the first example we will learn how to
create a very simple explicit database
cursor so let's do it
here is the declaration section of our
PL sequel block where we have declared
our database cursor and a variable let's
quickly understand what we just did here
before starting the PL sequel block in
the first line we set this server output
on so that we can see the output return
from this cursor on the default display
screen then inside the declaration
section first we declare a variable we
underscore name with date at I watch our
two to hold the data returned by the
cursor also we declared a database
cursor cursor Declaration starts with
the keyword cursor followed by the name
which is Cu our underscore rebellion
right now you can name your cursor
whatever you want as you can see I have
named my cursor on the name of my
website rebellionrider.com followed by
the name we have the keyword is and then
we have our select statement using this
select statement we are retrieving the
first name of all the employees whose ID
is less than 1:05 in employees table now
let's write the remaining part of this
code which is the execution section
you
so here is the remaining part of the
code which is the execution section
let's see what we have here as we
already know that after declaring a
cursor we have to open it first so that
we can use it does the first statement
in execution section is the cursor
opening a statement followed by that we
have a simple loop which contains three
statements into it first statement is a
fetch statement using which we are
fetching the data from the cursor see
you are underscore rebellion writer into
the variable V underscore name this data
is the first name of all the employees
whose employee ID is less than 1:05 this
we specified using the Select statement
during the cursor declaration second
statement inside this simple loop is a
DBMS output statement which will display
the output on the default output screen
and that output will be the value stored
into the variable V underscore name the
third and the last statement inside this
simple loop is an exit statement which
will terminate the loop and save it from
entering into an infinity cycle as a
test condition of this exit statement we
have used a cursor attribute not found
which will stop and exit the loop when
there is no data remaining into the
cursor to return cursor attribute not
found is a boolean attribute which
returns true only when previous fetch
command of the cursor did not return a
row you can read my blog on introduction
to cursor to know more about all the
cursor attributes also watch the PL
sequel tutorial 11 for detailed
knowledge of simple loop and exit
condition all the links are in the
description below then using n loop
statement we end the simple loop and
flight outside the simple loop we have a
closed cursor statement which will close
our cursor see you are and the score
rebellion writer do make sure to close
the cursor after working with it as
closing the cursor will relinquish all
the resources associated with it so
let's execute this PL sequel block and
see whether our cursor works or not and
here is the result which is the first
name of all the employees whose employee
ID is less than 1:05
so that is how we create a simple car
do try making your own database cursors
and practice the concepts you can tweet
me the screenshot of your code and I
will give you a shout-out that's it for
this tutorial on how to create an
explicit cursor in Oracle database
stay tuned as in the next tutorial we
will see another interesting example
hope you enjoyed watching
if so then make sure to give this video
a thumbs up and share it with your
friends on your social thanks for
watching this is Manish from rebellion
