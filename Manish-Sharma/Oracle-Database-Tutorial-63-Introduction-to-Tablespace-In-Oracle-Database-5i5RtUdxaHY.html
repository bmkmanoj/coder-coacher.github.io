rebellionrider.com and i am back once
again with another oracle database
tutorial for you and as i promised you
all a while back this time we will learn
the concept of tablespaces
one video at a time so let's take a look
at the first video in the series of
tablespaces in oracle database title the
introduction so what are tablespaces
oracle databases towards the schema
objects such as tables indexes views etc
etc logically into the table spaces and
physically in data files associated with
corresponding tablespace so we can see
table spaces are logical storage units
made up of one or more data files I know
this whole deal with data files and
table species is slightly confusing but
don't worry let me try to explain it to
you data files data files are physical
files stored on your test created by
Oracle database and has dot DB F
extension these files are not only
capable for storing tables but also
indexes synonyms views and other schema
objects created by you these are
physical files because they have
existence on your OS file system and you
can see them these files are written by
database writer process and use by
Oracle database for proper functioning
of your database system do not try to
modify these files manually a data file
cannot be shared between multiple table
spaces which means that every data files
belongs to a specific tablespace then
there comes tablespace table spaces a
logical entity in your database and
logically organized data which is
physically stored in data files they are
called logical storage unit because they
are not visible in your OS file system
our tablespace belongs to only one
database and has at least one data file
that is used to store data for the
Associated tablespace
you can also define tablespace as
logical storage unit made up of one or
more data files one tablespace can have
up to 1022 data files this number also
depends upon your OS hope things are
clear now next are the type of table
spaces in Oracle database we can
differentiate tablespace
on the basis of two vector type of data
and size of data type of data consists
three kind of tablespace including
permanent tablespace temporary
tablespace and undo tablespace and on
the basis of size of data we have to
kind of tablespace big file tablespace
and small file tablespace permanent
tablespace is the tablespace which
contains persistent schema object which
means that data stored in permanent
tablespace persist beyond the duration
of session and transaction
object in permanent tablespace are
stored in data files on the contrary
temporary tablespace are the tablespace
which contains a scheme objects only for
the duration of a session which means
their data stored in temporary
tablespace exists only for the duration
of a session or a transaction objects in
temporary tablespace are stored in temp
files then there comes undo tablespace
undo tablespace is a special type of
table space used by Oracle database to
manage and do data if you are running
your database in automatic and do
management mode undo tablespace stores
data permanently which means that undo
tablespace are permanent in nature undo
tablespace play a vital role in
providing read consistency for select
statements that access tables that in
turn consist of rows which are in the
process of being modified and the
ability to rollback a transaction that
has failed to commit next we have big
file tablespace and small file
tablespace big file tablespace a new
concept started from Oracle 10g big file
tablespace is best suited for storing
large amount of data big file tablespace
can have maximum one data file which
means big file tablespace are built on
single data files which can be as many
as 2 raised to 32 data blocks in size so
a big file tablespace that uses 8 GB
data blocks can be as many as 32
terabytes in size then we have a small
file tablespace this is the default type
of tablespace in oracle database small
file tablespace can have multiple data
files and each data file can be as many
as 2 raised to 22 data blocks in size a
small file tablespace can have maximum
up to 1022 data files but this number
depends on your operating system also
you can create permanent tablespace
temporary tablespace or undo tablespace
either as big file tablespace or small
file tablespace but by default they are
always a small file tablespace the
system and SoCs tablespace are always
created when the database is created one
or more temporary tablespace are usually
created in the database along with the
undo tablespace and several application
table spaces because system and socks
are the only tablespace always created
with the database they are the default
tablespace that's all for two days on
tablespaces in Oracle database hope you
