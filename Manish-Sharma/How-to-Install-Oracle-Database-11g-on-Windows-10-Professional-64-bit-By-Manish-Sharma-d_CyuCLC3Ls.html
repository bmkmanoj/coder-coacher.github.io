installing Oracle database 11g are the
same having said that let's come
straight to the tutorial and start
installation in order to install the
Oracle 11g we have to download the
software which you can do by visiting
the oracle website go to Oracle comm and
click the download from the menu and

versions of Oracle 11g choose
accordingly and download both the files

files from Microsoft Windows x64
option as I'm installing 11g on Windows
10 64-bit those who have Windows 10
32-bit please download files from
microsoft windows 32-bit option rest of
the process of installation is same for
Windows 10 64-bit and 32-bit it doesn't
matter if you have Windows 10
professional or home or any other
version I have already downloaded the
files to save the time and here are
those next you have to extract these
file as they are compressed let's do
that an extract file from first folder
rename this folder from database to
database one let's do the same for
second folder let's rename this folder
from database to database to next go to
folder database to then go to this
folder stage and then go to this
directory components and copy all the
directories from this components folder
press ctrl a to select all and then copy
now we have to come to our folder
database 1 and here is our folder
database 1 inside this you have folded
stage go to it and then go inside the
folder components and now here paste all
those files which we copied earlier
that's it now you are all set to start
the setup and install the Oracle
database 11g on your windows 10 so let's
come to our folder database 1 where we
have our setup dot exe file here it is
right click the setup dot exe file and
choose run as administrator accept the
warning this will start your Oracle
Universal installer avoid this warning
just hit yes and move ahead on the first
screen you need to provide your email
address if you want to receive all the
notifications and news alert from Oracle
if you do not want it then simply leave
these fields empty and move Next accept
this warning it is just reminding you
that you didn't provide the email id hit
yes and move ahead on the next screen
you will be presented with three
different installation options you can
choose any of them according to your
need in my case I want to install Oracle
server software and want to create a
database also thus I will choose the
first option if you choose the second
option then only Oracle server will be
installed and no database will be
created you can create a database after
the installation of Oracle server using
dbca if you want to do that then I have
a video tutorial on how to create
database using dbca just for you link is
in the description you can go with the
third option if you want to perform the
of the database and software but I will
choose the first option and we'll hit
the next and move ahead on this step you
have to choose between server class and
desktop class if you are installing this
Oracle database 11g on your laptop or
desktop then go with the first option
which is desktop class if you are
installing this Oracle 11g on a server
which is capable enough to handle the
load of all the server components and
processes then choose the second option
which is server class in my case I am
installing Oracle database 11g on
Windows 10 Professional which is
installed on my laptop does I will
choose the first option and hit the next
here in this step you can configure the
basic settings of your database for
example using first three text fields
you can set the Oracle based location
software location which will be your
Oracle home and database file location
which will be the location where Oracle
server will store all your important
files such as data files control files
and redo logs be careful while setting
them I am good with the default location
thus won't change them using database
Edition drop-down list you can choose
which database version you want to
install in my case it's the Enterprise
Edition next is character set let it be
set on default I am good with this if
you want you can change it okay now next
is global database name which will be
the name of your database also serve as
your database s ID you will need this
while making connection with your
database using tools such as sequel
developer by default it is set as ORCL
if you want you can change it and give
whatever name you want but make sure to
remember it I suggest you to write it
down somewhere as your database s ID in
the next two fields you have to give the
password this will be the password of
your administrative user such as sis or
system ok be careful here write it down
somewhere or remember it this will be
the password for your sis user or system
user let's fill it up and move ahead
don't worry about this warning this is
just saying that the password which you
just entered is not as per the Oracle
password standard you can read this
warning click yes and move ahead
oh you I will check for the
prerequisites such as hardware
compatibility if everything goes well
then we will be good to install it if
there is any error then oh you I will
show you here fortunately there is no
error
hit finish doing so we'll start the
installation
this installation might take some time
depending on your hardware don't go
anywhere
there is one more important step left in
the installation I don't want to waste
your time does I will fast forward it
here we are the last step where we will
unlock the users which we want such as
HR Scott or anything else click this
password management button now here in
this password management window we have
all the users which are by default
locked you can unlock any of them for
example I want to unlock HR user thus I
will find that user in this list and
here it is now I will uncheck this box
which is in front of the name of the
user and will write password and
confirmed it in the respective fields
now I will hit OK again the same warning
saying that password are not up to the
Oracle password standard avoid and hit
yes and move ahead again click OK and
installation is done here is the link
for your Enterprise Manager save it
somewhere but if you forgot then don't
worry you can use your Start menu entry
for the Oracle software to launch your
Oracle Enterprise Manager let me quickly
show you but before that click this
close button and finish the installation
ok now go to your Start menu and search
for Oracle folder and inside the Oracle
folder search Oracle control ORCL here
our CL is my s ID in your case it can be
different click it this will take you to
the login screen of your Oracle
Enterprise Manager if you got this error
just don't worry click advanced and then
proceed to localhost that's all you have
to do here is the login screen of your
