this is manish from rebellionrider.com
today in this Oracle database video we
will see default function of character
manipulation category which is SQL
concat function SQL concat function is a
character manipulation function which is
a category of SQL character function we
have already discussed the intro SQL
character function in video 10 you can
find the link of this video in the
description below okay let's go ahead
SQL concat function concatenate to
separate character string into one
character string let's see the syntax
note here that SQL concat function takes
only two arguments at a time this SQL
concat function will return string 1
concatenated with string 2 this also
means that it will return a single
string which is a combined string of
parameter string 1 and string to both
the parameter of the SQL concat function
string 1 and string 2 can be of any data
type you can even specify the column
name of the table here SQL concat
function is equivalent to the
concatenation operator SQL concatenation
operator is represented by double solid
vertical path or we can say double pipe
sign how to concatenate more than two
string as SQL concat that can have only
two parameter and what is the difference
between SQL concat function f SQL
concatenation operator the answer for
the second question what is difference
between SQL concat function and SQL
concatenation operator is while SQL
concat function takes only two
parameters the concrete operator can be
repeated as often as is necessary
meaning by the help of SQL concat
operator you can combine as many string
as you want and concatenation operator
is also not supported by several
databases such as sequel server so this
might cause problem how to concatenate
more than two string as SQL Kinkaid that
can have only two parameter we will have
to jump over SQL Developer let's see
some examples say we want to retrieve
the full name of an employer from
employees table let's try it using SQL
concat function
here in this QE we use to column name
first name and last name as argument on
for concave function execute now you can
see here we get full name or parameter
there is no space in between first name
and last name we will see how to format
this string using SQL concat function in
few seconds but before that let's see
how to do the same task using SQL
concatenation operator as you can see
this theory also produces the same
result now we will see how to format
full name of employees first we will do
this using SQL concatenation operator
now you can see we get space between
first name and last name of the employee
again let's do it using SQL concat
function here we will see the nested
function concept where we will be using
nested concrete function to achieve this
formatted string
inner concrete function has two
parameters these are first column name
first name and an empty string which
will be a space between the first name
and second name this Kincaid will now
return a string which is the first name
with space this returning a string will
be the first input of our outer
conquered and column last name will be
recycle input all together this will
give us the desired output as you can
see this method is complex than the
first one
where we use as 12 concatenation
operator to have an in-depth knowledge
