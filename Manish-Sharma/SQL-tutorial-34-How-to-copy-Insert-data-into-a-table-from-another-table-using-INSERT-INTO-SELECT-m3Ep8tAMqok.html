rebellionrider.com and i am back once
again with another sequel tutorial and
in today's tutorial we will learn how to
insert or copy data from one table to
another using sequel insert into
statement or say insert into select
statement in the previous tutorial we
have seen how to insert data into a
table using sequel developer as well as
using insert DML statement today we will
see the third way of inserting data into
a table without much ado let's jump over
sequel developer and start writing curie
as you know we have student table which
we have created and used in the previous
tutorial and i have populated this table
with some data let me show you this
student table will be our source table
whose data we are going to copy into a
target table now we need this target
table this target table should have same
structure as that of student table to
save the time I have already created
this target table by the name of student
copy and for the sake of simplicity
there are no constraint on any column of
this table let me show you the structure
of student copy target table and as you
can see this table is empty this whole
process of copying rows from one table
to another involves only one simple
insert into Kure let's see how to write
this
there is no need to be intimidated by
this little bit of sub-query concept
involve you I will be doing a separate
tutorial on subtly non furry for now
here in this Curie we are inserting the
entire data of table student which is
our source table into table student copy
which is a target table for the better
understanding of this concept let's make
some space between these two lines now
you people can see things clearly as you
can see this Curie is a combination of
two Geary's in the first half of this
Curie we have our insert DML statement
followed by name of target table student
copy and in the second half we have a
simple select statement where we are
selecting entire data from source table
student before execution let me add just
this equal developer IDE so that I can
show you the execution side by side
okay everything is set now as you can
see targetable student copy is entirely
empty now let's execute our Curie four
rows in sorted
okay let's refresh here is our result
isn't it simple entire data of the
source table student is copied into the
target table student copy let's do a
second Curie but first let me close this
output panel so that I can make some
space and you people can see what I am
going to do next okay I think everything
is set now now in our second Curie we
will see how to insert selected data
into a table from another table but
before writing this Curie I will remove
entire data from the target table
student copy so that you can better
understand the concept say this time you
just want to insert data from column
first name and last name of source table
student into target table student copy
okay let me make some space now I think
you raise clearly visible to you guys
okay let's move ahead
this Curie is slightly different from
the previous Curie whenever we insert
data into some selected columns of a
table we have to mention those column in
the insert Curie right after name of
target table as we did here as you can
see right after the name of target table
student copy I have specified the name
of column in which I want to insert the
data and in our case its first name and
last name mine here to not to forget and
close the list of column name in
parenthesis otherwise sequel compiler
will give you an error after that we
have our select statement this is
statement we'll return first name and
last name which we want to insert let's
execute the query now refresh here
and here we go as you can see in the
result all the value in is to ID and
contact column is null there are values
only in first and last name column what
happened with this Curie is that the
output of select statement becomes the
input of the insert statement let's take
the example of this curie here our
select statement is returning value from
first and last name column which is its
output the output becomes the input
offers insert Curie furthermore there is
one on one mapping between the column in
this list
this means that value from the first
column in the Select list gets copied
into the corresponding first column you
mentioned in the insert list hope this
Curie is clear let's jump on the third
Curie once again let me close this
script output now let's write the
tertiary similarly you can use where
clause to copy the data from one table
to another but once again let's delete
all the data from the table okay
everything is set say now you want to
copy only that row from the student
table where is to ID is five let's
execute it says zero rows inserted means
let me check okay we do not have any
fifth row in our source table student so
what we will do we will change this five
from four let's copy the data of a
student where is two IDs for let me
check who is their student with is two
ID for is Batmen with 4 5 6 7 8 contact
number ok oh sorry
yes our target table student copy
doesn't have anything so now let's
execute this query one row inserted so
now let's refresh here is our result
hope you enjoyed watching that's it for
today there is no reason of making
videos if you don't like the content

me motivated comment your feedback and
