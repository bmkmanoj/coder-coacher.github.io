rebellionrider.com and welcome back to
my youtube channel where we make
learning SQL pl/sql and oracle database
form with the previous video we finished
the exception handling series and now
it's time to start another chapter has
increased tutorial i'm starting a new
series on another highly demanded topic
that is the collection so without
wasting much of your time let's start
twisted oriole on the introduction of PL
sequel collection in oracle database so
what are collections in oracle database
a homogeneous single dimension data
structure which is made of elements of
same data-type is called collection in
oracle database in simple language we
can say that an array in oracle database
is called collection as we know that the
array consists data of same data-type
and so the z PL sequel collection which
is why we call them homogeneous data
structure the structure of PL sequel
collections consists of a cell with
subscript called index data is stored
into these cells and can be identified
and accessed using the index number this
is again very similar to the structure
of array but unlike array PL sequel
collections are strictly one-dimensional
types of PL sequel collections in Oracle
database PL sequel collections can be
divided into two categories persistent
and non-persistent persistent collection
as the name suggests are those which
store the collection structure with the
data physically into the database and
can be accessed again if needed
whereas non persistent collection only
stores data and structure just for one
session on the basis of above categories
collections are further divided into
three types in estate tables variable
sized arrays or V arrays and associative
arrays let's quickly discuss the intro
of above-mentioned types briefly but
later we will see each of these type of
collections in detail in separate videos
master table nested tables are
persistent collection which means they
can be stored into the database and can
be
we use nested tables has no upper limits
on roosters they're unbounded
collections we Ares similar to nested
tables variable sized arrays are also
persistent collections because they can
be created in database as well as PL
sequel block and can be reused but
unlike nested tables three arrays are
bounded in nature which means we Ares
can hold only a fixed amount of elements
associative array
unlike nested tables and Vieira's
associative arrays are non persistent
collections does they cannot be stored
into the database since they cannot be
stored health they cannot be reused but
they are available in PL sequel block
for this session do make sure to stay
connected as we will be learning each of
these type of collections in detail in
the upcoming videos where we will
perform some interesting examples also
you can head over to my blog to find out
what are bounded and unbounded as well
as dense and sparse collection that is
the quick introduction to PL sequel
collection in Oracle database to make
