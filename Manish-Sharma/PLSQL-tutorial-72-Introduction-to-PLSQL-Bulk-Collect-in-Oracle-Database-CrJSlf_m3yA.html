I am Manish from RebellionRider.com and welcome
to the first tutorial in PL/SQL bulk collect
series which is “The Introduction to PL/SQL
bulk collect clause of Oracle Database”.
So without further ado let’s jump in and
start the tutorial.
Let’s begin with what is Bulk collect in
oracle database?
Bulk collect is all about reducing context
switching and improving query performance.
So in order to define the bulk collect we
first need to understand what is context switching?
Whenever you write a PL/SQL block or say a
PL/SQL program and execute it, the PL/SQL
runtime engine starts processing it line by
line.
This engine processes all the PL/SQL statements
by itself but it passes all the SQL statements
which you have coded into that PL/SQL block
to the SQL runtime engine.
Those SQL statements will then get processed
separately by the SQL engine.
Once it is done processing them the SQL engine
then returns the result back to the PL/SQL
engine.
So that a combined result can be produced
by the latter.
This to and fro hopping of control is called
context switching.
Though it sounds neat how oracle engine processes
both SQL and PL/SQL statements separately
in an organized manner but when it comes to
performance, it is not as good as it sounds.
The higher the hopping of controls the greater
will be the overhead which in turn will degrade
the performance.
Keeping this in mind, wouldn’t it be great
if we could replace multiple context switches
by a single one.
Well, then my dear friends you will be happy
to know that we can do so by using BULK COLLECT
clause in Oracle Database.
Bulk collect clause reduces multiple control
hopping by collecting all the SQL statement
calls from PL/SQL program and sending them
to SQL Engine in just one go and vice versa.
It is like instead of taking multiple trips
for transferring players from their hotel
to the stadium using a bi-cycle just put them
all into a bus and take them to the stadium
in one single trip.
Hope this explanation helps you in understanding
the concept of Context Switching between PL/SQL
and SQL engine.
Now using this information let’s define
the Bulk collect clause.
Bulk collect clause reduces/compresses multiple
switches into a single context switch and
increases the efficiency and performance of
a PL/SQL program.
Also, this process of fetching batches of
data from PL/SQL runtime engine to SQL runtime
engine and vice versa is called bulk data
processing.
Bulk collect clause is not the only bulk processing
statement in Oracle Database.
We have another statement which is FORALL.
We will discuss about FORALL bulk processing
statement once we are done with bulk collect
clause.
Anyways, let’s move ahead.
Bulk Collect clause can be used with SELECT-INTO,
FETCH-INTO and RETURNING-INTO statements in
Oracle Database.
We will learn how to use Bulk Collect clause
with each of these statements.
We will start with the first one which is
SELECT-INTO from the next tutorial.
So stay tuned and make sure to subscribe to
the channel as we will be unfolding the topic
of query performance with PL/SQL Bulk Collect
clause of Oracle Database in this series.
So in this tutorial we learnt what is bulk
collect clause and why do we need it?
I will also be answering more questions on
bulk collect in the corresponding blog, whose
link is in the description.
That’s it for this tutorial.

Thanks for watching.
