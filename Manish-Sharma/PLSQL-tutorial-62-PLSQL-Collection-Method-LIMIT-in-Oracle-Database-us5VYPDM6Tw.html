please PL sequel tutorial is all about
connection method limit we have already
seen for functions in this collection
method series that are count exists
first and last limit is v function which
we will be learning today so ladies and
gentlemen fasten your seat belts because
this flight is ready to take off before
that - make sure to smash that thumbs up
button and like the video
- to keep the captain of this flight
motivated for doing more such
interesting videos and if you are new
here then be sure to subscribe because
here we make learning SQL pl/sql and
oracle database form so let's start the
tutorial but before we jump on to the
example let me quickly tell you a bit
about the collection method limit
collection method limit which is
actually a PL sequel function returns
the maximum number of elements that a V
array can hold this means that by using
this function you can find out how many
elements you can store in a V Airy
let's understand this using an example
here I declared a Viera with the name in
block underscore vry which can hold five
elements of number data type in the next
line we initialize the V array in block
underscore vry using the collection
variable v ry underscore ovj let's move
ahead here we have the execution section
inside this section we have an output
statement which will return the total
number of indexes that we have in a V
array on execution this statement should
return 5 so let's execute here is the
result which is 5 this result of limit
function shows that the maximum strength
of our V array is 5 you must be thinking
that don't we have the function count
which gives the same information mean I
can see you guys have been paying
attention I like it anyways let's modify
the above code and see what happens if
we use function count here
let's execute what happened here while
the function limit returned five yet
function count returns zero let me
explain it to you the collection
function limit returns the total number
of indexes of a V array regardless of
whether these indexes are empty or
holding some data it checks the
definition of TV air a and C is the
total number of elements it is designed
to store and return that number while
the collection function count returns
the number of indexes which are not
empty and holding some data and
according to the definition of our v-ray
in block underscore vry it is clear that
it can hold five elements that is why
the result of collection function limit
is five but since we haven't stored any
data into our VLE has all the indexes of
TV array in block underscore v ry is
empty that is the reason why the
collection function count returns zero
as the result let's store some value
into this very and see what then will be
the result of both these collection
functions
here first using collection procedure
x10
we allowed the memory space and append
an element to the VRE and in the next
line we stored a numeric value into the
first index of RV array don't be
confused about the collection procedure
extent as we will be discussing that in
the future video very soon for now let's
execute this PL sequel program and see
the result here is a result result from
function limit is a still 5 because that
is the total strength of our V array but
the result from the function count is
now one and not zero this is because
this time the total number of indexes
which are holding some data in this V
array is one hope now the concept of
collection function limit is clear to
you as well as you have understood the
difference between the collection
methods count and limit now the next
question is can we use the collection
method limit with nested tables to
answer this question I have a PL sequel
block here in this program everything is
the same except this time we have used
limit function with nested table instead
of V arrays the name of this nested
table is my underscore nested underscore
table and it is again capable of holding
elements of number data type we have
also initialized this nested table using
collection variable var underscore and D
and stored 10 numeric values into it in
the execution section we have two output
statements the first output statement
will show you the result returned from
the collection function limit and the
second output statement will show you
the result from the count function let's
execute this program and see the result
as you can see the collection function
limit doesn't return any value or a
result while the function count returns
10 which is the total number of indexes
holding some value this
because the collection method limit only
works with VRS if applied to nested
table or associative array it will
either return null or no value here I
have demonstrated an example of
collection method limit with collection
vieni and nested table now your work is
to tell me what will be the result of
collection function limit if it is used
with an associative array if you want
you can take help of PL sequel tutorial
57 where I have explained how to create
associative array in Oracle database you
can find the link in the description
also check out the blog to know how to
find out the total number of elements
left unused for you to store data into a
V array using collection method limit
link is again in the description hope
you learned something new and find this
tutorial helpful do make sure to share
it with your friends on your Facebook
Twitter Instagram email or by any means
you find convenient and help others in
learning most importantly don't forget
