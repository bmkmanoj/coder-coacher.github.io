rebellionrider.com and this is the
second video in SQL set operators here
in this video I will try to cover up
both the remaining set operators that
are intersect and - so without further
ado let's start today's tutorial I will
be using the same table football and
cricket which I have used in the
previous tutorial for the demonstration
so I would suggest you to watch it if
you haven't already link is in the
description box let's start to read SQL
tutorial first with the intersect SQL
set operator the intersect operator
returns rules that are common to both
queries what does that mean let me
explain it to you through this
PowerPoint animation both these tables
that is cricket and football have three
rows each in them if you will look
closely then the first row with the
first name o'clock and the last name
Kent are the same in both the tables
this means that this row is common to
both d tables thus if we execute the
intersect operation on these two tables
then our result will be this common row
with the first name o'clock and the last
name Kent
so now let's jump over to sequel
developer and write the sequel intersect
query using these two tables and see the
results so here we are let's read sequel
intersect query using both these tables
execute
and here is our result as you can see
the results had consist only one room
hope the concept of sequel intersect
operator is clear to you guys now let's
check out this equal minus set operator
- is the fourth and the last set
operator in Oracle database so let's dig
in and see what is it the - SQL set
operator returns rules in the first
query that are not present in the second
query the definition is self-explanatory
which means if we will execute - set
operator on cricket and football tables
then all the rules from cricket table
which are not present in the second
table for example football will get
returned and vice versa
so let's write the query and see some
practical execution I will use the same
query and clean the set operator from
intercept to - and here we are I have
modified the query accordingly and now
let's execute here is a result and as
you can see the results that contains
two rules from the cricket table which
were not present in the football table
that's it for today with this tutorial I
am finishing the SQL set operators also
just for you guys I have created a
practice sheet which you can download
for free and practice the concept of
sequel set operator in Oracle database
you can find the link in the description
box for more updates you can follow me
on my Twitter Instagram and other social
media again the link is in the
