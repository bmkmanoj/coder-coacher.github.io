again and today in this Oracle database
video we will see what are archive and
no archive love more and how to enable
our kind of mode in your database before
jumping over archive log and no archive
log more a brief intro about redo lock
wise redo log files generally get
created at the time of a database
creation and a database has many more to
redo log files redo log files generally
whole history of all the changes made to
your database say I user perform some
transaction at all to some value that
transaction get stored into a buffer
code redo log buffer and by the help of
the log data which is a background
process all the data from riddle of
buffer moves moves into redo log files
while you do not point in archive log
mode database archive already log files
once they are filled instead of
overwriting them hence understanding of
your do log files is important
log modes of database Oracle database
has to log modes one is archive log mode
another one is no archive log mode by
default Oracle database is in no archive
log mode let's talk about no archive log
mode first when your database is in no
archive log mode it start overwriting
the radula files when they are filled
instead of archiving them has
permanently losing the previous data
this can become complication during the
recovery of the older data that is why
it's always recommended to run your
database in the archive log mode always
now let's talk about archive log mode in
archive log mode database make copies of
all online redo log files after they
failed and these copies are called
archived redo loans how to check whether
archive log mode is enable or not ok
let's check whether archive log mode is
enabled or not as you can see I am using
command prompt because I am on Windows
machine if you are using Linux machine
you can use terminal all these steps are
same so let's log in and into our escrow
make sure you are log in with a user who
has a system via privileges I have
logged in with a user sis let's check C
here and log in as ourselves so to take
weather archive log mode is enabled or
not we have two ways first one is the
simplest one in which we just fire a SQL
command which is are a long list we just
have to write archive log list on your
SQL front and then press Enter as a
result we get all these things as you
can see the first line of one result is
database log mode we're showing that I
am in archive log mode right now my
automatic archival is enable because I
am in archive log mode it means my all
the redo log files as they get will they
get archived automatically use DB
recovery file destination this is the
parameter from which you can get the
location of your archived redo logs
where they are saved these are the
sequence number of your oldest online
log next log sequence or current long
second way to know whether your archive
log mode it is enable or not is by
curing we dollar database view you can
select log mode from read on a database
as you can see it returns our log mode
it is archive log mode if we are in no
archive log mode it would have shown you
know archive log mode here
now we have seen how to know whether our
archive log mode is enabled or not now
let's see how to enable archiving
occurred in your database
first of all let's check whether we are
we are in archive log mode or in no
archive log mode for that just queue so
as you can see right now I am in no
archive log mode let's change it to
change just make sure you are logged in
with a user who has says tbo privileges
I am logged in with this user now first
of all we need to shut down our database
sorry
wait for few seconds now we have to
start a database in mount stage for
doing that just right startup bound Dean
wait for few seconds
okay now we are in mounted stage let me
clear this screen so that you can see
what I am going to do a a head now as we
are in mounted stage of our database we
have to switch our database from North
cap to archive log mode as I have
already shown you that we are in no
archive log mode right now so let's
change it to archive log mode for doing
that we have to give an out alter come
on database has been altered now let's
check as you can see we are in archive
log mode right now and our our automatic
archival is enabled but we are still in
mount stage means we cannot use our
database we cannot perform any DML or
you cannot give any theory here so to
make this database usable we need to
switch from mount to open state for
doing that just right or down database
open it in a few seconds okay now we are
in open stage let's check our let's
check our database mode again this time
we will use our V dollar database
you can see we are in archive log mode
right now
these are few commands related to
archive log list I hope you will find
them helpful
hope you enjoyed watching if you asked
then give me a thumbs up and don't
forget to subscribe bye thanks to all my
subscribers and all my viewers I'll see
you soon
that's it for today this is Manny</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
