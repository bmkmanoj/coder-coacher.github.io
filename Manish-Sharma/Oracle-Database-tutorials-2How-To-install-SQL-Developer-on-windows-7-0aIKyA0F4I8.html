this oracle database video i am going to
show you how to work on oracle database
11g or 10g using SQL Developer now what
SQL Developer is SQL Developer is an ID
integrated development environment
always say a graphical tool for database
development provided by Oracle it sir
the ID is written in Java language and
generally do not require any
installation to know more about SQL
Developer you can read this oracle blah
the blink of of this blog is in the
video description below one more
important thing guys SQL Developer
required jdk 1.7 or later does make sure
you have JDK installed on your system to
download JDK you can go to this length
this website and download JDK from here
don't worry the link is in the
description below you can get it from
there okay to work with SQL Developer we
need to download it so just open up your
browser and go to oracle comm then go to
download and in the developer tool
section just click SQL Developer after
doing that you will be here here first
of all you need to accept the License
Agreement just click it and accept it
and choose the appropriate version of
SQL Developer it depends upon the system
or the operating system of your machine
I am working on Windows 7 64 bit I am
going to download this file it's around
224 MB if you don't have JDK install you
can download this file also or you can
download JDK individually from here ok I
have already downloaded this file for
you this must be in my directory
download directory here it is as you can
see it's a Jif file compressed file we
need to uncompress it as jpg just right
click and extract here I have already
extracted here this is what we get after
unzipping this file ok now just copy
this folder and move this folder to your
Oracle home directory and where you will
find the Oracle home directory just go
to your root directory my root directory
C then go to app and just paste it here
it may take take one or maybe less
minutes okay now just open this folder
and in this folder you will get SQL
developer dot exe this is a file which
me requires so as we are going to work
with this SQL developer on everyday
basis so it will be better if we make a
shortcut of this file on the text also
right-click it to send to and send it to
desktop and here is our SQL Developer
shortcut just open it by clicking or
clicking it double-click it out and here
we are it's ok back to work with our
database first of all we need to make a
connection to make a connection with our
database just click this green plus
button after doing that you will get
this window in the connection name you
can give whatever you want like I am
going to the MySQL the username you need
to supply the username if you remember
we unlocked three user safe system and
HR during the installation if you
haven't watched my installation video
just go back and check it out my
database playlist you will get how to
unlock these usernames
so here we are going to connect with our
user HR and password for my HR user is
HR only see if this password otherwise
is going to ask you for the password
again it in every time you connect to
this user in the host name if the
database is installed on the same
machine over which astir which you have
this SQL Developer then just don't mess
with this let it be localhost but if the
database is installed on some other
machine then you need to supply the IP
address of that machine
in here that we will see how to connect
with the server in the future video port
ID is 1 5 to 1 this is the default port
for our database in the s ID this is the
important thing here s ID is a unique
identifier for your database whenever
you are going to make a database you
going to provide a unique name which is
a global database name that that's our s
ID if you remember during the
installation the global database name of
our database is or CF or if I say there
is only one or one database I have made
here by the name of what see also I'm
going to put what CL yeah sorry
what CL and after that just it will be
better if we test whether we are not
connected or not if something is wrong
here then we going to get an red color
error message here but it as it is
showing success it means everything is
fine just click connect and here we are
this is our box shade where we going to
put our every jury and try to execute it
for the for this video purpose what I am
going to do I am going to show you the
user doing so just I decide should W
show user Terminator and to execute the
jury either you can aggress rebuttal you
want to get your result of this QE here
in this output window or if you are a
fan of keyboard shortcut like me then
you can do ctrl + enter you can press
ctrl + Enter to execute it after doing
that you'll get the answer here
everything is seen that's it for today
