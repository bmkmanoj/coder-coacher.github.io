rebellionrider.com and i am back again
with the second tutorial in PL sequel
stored procedure series as we have
already covered the introduction of the
stored procedures does today in this PL
sequel tutorial we will learn how to
create PL sequel stored procedures in
oracle database with the help of an easy
to understand example so without further
ado let's start and learn how to create
PL sequel stored procedures in Oracle
database in the demonstration I will
show you the very simple example which
will teach you the creation process of
with stored procedures in Oracle
database
here is a very simple stored procedure
with name P R underscore rebellion
writer you can name your procedure
whatever you want as it is completely
user-defined this is a procedure with no
parameters as you can see here we don't
have any parameter list followed by the
name which indicates that this PS equal
procedure does not accept any parameters
moving on in the body of this stored
procedure I have declared two variables
of watch or two datatype for holding
these strings here the first variable
will hold the name and second will hold
the name of the website then inside the
execution section I have printed the
value stored into these two variables
with a formatted string using the DBMS
output statement as you can see in this
code unlike PL sequel functions we do
not have any written class this is
because PL sequel stored procedures does
not return any values like functions so
let's go ahead and compile this code and
check whether it works then we will see
how we can call the procedure to see the
result procedure PR underscore rebellion
writer compiled successfully with no
errors which means we are good to go now
that we have created and compiled our
stored procedure successfully next we
will learn how to call it and see the
output from the procedure the procedure
which we just compiled is simply
displaying a formatted string which is
its output so how can we see that output
there are multiple ways of calling a
procedure similar to function we can
call a procedure using an anonymous as
well as unnamed PL sequel block or we
can use an execute statement just to see
the output of a PL sequel procedure so
let's start with the simplest way of
checking the output or see executing the
procedure which is the execute statement
but first let me close this script
output and open a fresh walk sheet
great yes you simply have to write the
keyword execute followed by the name of
your procedure or if you are lazy like
me then simply write the first four
letters of the keyword execute which is
e x EC both these statements will do the
same work
let's check but before executing these
two statements we have to set this
server output on so that we can see the
result done now let's execute our
procedure call statements one by one
here is the result of our PL sequel
procedure from the first statement now
let's check the second one and here we
are both the results are the same this
is the first way of executing a PL
sequel procedure another way is to
directly call the procedure inside your
anonymous or named PL sequel block let's
check out that also but before that once
again let's close this script output and
clear this screen done that is the
execution section of the simplest
anonymous PL sequel block which consists
of only one executable statement which
is the name of our PL sequel stored
procedure or say the procedure call
statement on execution of this PL sequel
block we will see the output from the
mentioned procedure so let's execute and
here is the result
always remember unlike PL sequel
function you cannot use a procedure as a
right-hand side operand to the
assignment operator to assign its value
to a variable in simple words value
written by the procedure cannot be
assigned to a variable similarly you can
call a stored procedure using a named PL
sequel block and that will be your
homework right a stored procedure and
try
calling it using a named PL sequel block
such as a PL sequel function or a
trigger you can send answers to me on my
email or on my social media like Twitter
or Facebook all the links are in the
description that's it for this tutorial
on how to create a PL sequel stored
procedure with no parameters
stay tuned as in the next tutorial we
will see some more examples of how to
create stored procedures in Oracle
database also if you like this video
