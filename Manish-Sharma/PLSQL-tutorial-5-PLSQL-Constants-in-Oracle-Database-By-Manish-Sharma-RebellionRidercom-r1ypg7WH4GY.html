Welcome to my channel once again.
I am Manish from RebellionRider.com.
Topic of today’s tutorial is Constants in
PL/SQL.
As I have already done a tutorial on Variables
in PL/SQL so I thought why not make a tutorial
on Constants as well since they play a very
important role in programming.
So without wasting much of your time let’s
start the tutorial.
Like several other programming language, the
constant in PL/SQL is a user defined identifier
whose value remains unchanged throughout the
program.
Like variables in PL/SQL constants also needs
to be declared prior to their use and you
can only declare them into declaration section
of your PL/SQL block.
PL/SQL has its own way of declaring a constant.
To learn how to declare a constant in PL/SQL
let’s quickly take a look at the syntax.
And here we are and here is our syntax
constant_name CONSTANT datatype (data-width)
:= value;
First you need to give a valid name to your
constant followed by keyword CONSTANT that
indicates the declaration of a constant in
your program.
Then you have to specify the data type and
data width for your constant followed by the
assignment operator and the value which you
want to assign to your constant.
Note here.
You must initialize a constant at its declaration.
Yes you have to initialize your constant at
the time of its creation in declaration section
of your PL/SQL block.
You cannot initialize a constant anywhere
else.
That said, let’s come to the SQL Developer
and do some examples.
First example will demonstrate you how to
declare and initialize a constant.
SET SERVEROUTPUT ON;
DECLARE
v_pi CONSTANT NUMBER(7,6) := 3.141592;
BEGIN
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE (v_pi);
END;
This is a simple example of Constant declaration
and initialization.
Here in declaration section I have declared
a constant v_pi and initialized it with the
approximate value of pi.
In the execution section we have our DBMS
output statement which is displaying the value
stored into our constant.
Let’s execute and see the result.
And here is our result.
This is the proper way of declaring and initializing
a constant in PL/SQL.
Ok
Next let’s see the improper way of declaring
and initializing a constant.
In the beginning of this tutorial I said that,
you must initialize a constant at its declaration
not doing so will raise an error.
Let’s see what does that mean.
Let’s modify this code and see.
DECLARE
v_pi CONSTANT NUMBER(7,6);
BEGIN
v_pi := 3.1415926;
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE (v_pi);
END;
/
This time I simply declared a constant in
declaration section and didn’t initialize
it rather I initialized this constant in our
execution section.
This type of declaration and initialization
is legally accepted with variables but when
it comes to constants in PL/SQL this is not
accepted by the compiler.
This means there will be an error if we will
execute this code.
Let’s execute this code and see.
As I said there is an error.
Hope this made the concept of declaring and
initializing a constant clear to you.
Don’t worry this tutorial isn’t finished
yet.
We have two more attributes of PL/SQL constants
to discuss which are “DEFAULT” and “NOT
NULL”.
Let’s start with the default keyword.
You can use default keyword instead of assignment
operator to initialize the constant in PL/SQL.
Let’s do an example and see how to initialize
a constant using DEFAULT keyword.
But before that let’s close this script
output and make some space so that you people
can see things clearly.
Ok done
DECLARE
v_pi CONSTANT NUMBER(7,6) DEFAULT 3.1415926;
BEGIN
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(v_pi);
END;
/
Same code just this time I used keyword DEFAULT
instead of assignment operator for initializing
the constant.
Next attribute is NOT NULL.
Using this attribute you can impose NOT NULL
constraint while declaring constants as well
as variables this will prevent you from assigning
NULL values to your constants or variables.
For the demonstration let’s modify this
code only to add NOT NULL attribute.
This will save us from writing the whole code
again and save time.
To impose not null constraint simply write
NOT NULL keyword before the Keyword default
or before assignment operator in case you
have used it.
Let me show you how
DECLARE
v_pi CONSTANT NUMBER(7,6) NOT NULL DEFAULT
3.1415926;
BEGIN
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE (v_pi);
END;
/
That’s all you have to do.
Let’s execute this code.
Here is our result.
Hope this made your concept clear.
With this I’ll take your leave.

I will catch you soon with another PL/SQL
tutorial till then take care this is Manish
