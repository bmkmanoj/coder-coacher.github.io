Welcome back once again I am Manish from RebellionRider.com
and today I am going to do a tutorial on Set
operators in Oracle SQL.
In this tutorial we will see what Union and
Union All operators are and how to use them
along with restrictions on Set operators.
So without wasting much of your time let’s
get started.
Set operators allow us to combine rows returned
from two or more queries.
In SQL we have four set operators.
1.
Union
2.
Union All
3.
Intersect
4.
Minus
In this tutorial we will concentrate over
Union and Union All set operators and I will
explain the remaining set operators in the
next tutorial.
For the demonstration I have created and populated
two tables Cricket and Football.
Both of these have two columns first name
and last name.
Let’s take a quick look at the structures
of both these tables along with the data contained
by them.
Here are the structures of both these tables.
As you can see both the tables have two similar
columns – first name and last name and both
these columns share the same data type which
is Varchar2.
Now let’s take a side by side look at the
data that they are holding.
Both these tables have 3 rows of data and
if you will look carefully you will notice
that there is a duplicate row in both the
tables which is row 1 where first name is
Clark and last name is Kent.
You must be wondering why I am telling you
this!
Don’t worry just sit tight and I’ll let
you know in a bit.
So let’s jump over to SQL Developer.
Here we are
Now let’s do some queries.
First I will demonstrate to you the Union
Set Operator of SQL.
The UNION set operator returns results from
all the participating queries after eliminating
duplications.
Let’s see the example
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM cricket
UNION
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM football;
Here we have 2 separate queries.
In the first query we are selecting rows from
first name and last name column of Cricket
table and in the second query we are retrieving
rows from first name and last name column
of Football table and both these queries are
bound using union set operator.
In this whole operation Union is our operator
and both these queries are operand over which
union set operator will work.
On executing this query all the rows of both
the columns of both the tables will be returned
except the duplicate one.
Let’s execute and see
Here is our result and it consists of only
5 rows not 6 because the row with the duplicate
entry which was Clark Kent is eliminated.
But same is not true with Union All operator
because The UNION ALL operator returns results
from all the participating queries, including
the duplicate rows.
This means that if we will execute the same
query then we will get all the rows returned
from both the tables along with the duplicate
one.
Let me demonstrate this to you.
For that I will copy this query and modify
it accordingly.
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM cricket
UNION
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM football;
Here we go.
Now I will change the set operator from Union
to Union All.
Ok done.
Let’s execute and as you can see this time
the result set contains 6 rows including the
duplicate one.
That’s the difference between union and
union all.
Now there are few things which you should
always take care while writing any SQL Set
queries.
Such as number of columns and column data
type returned by the query must match however
the column name can be different.
For example if you see here both our queries
have same number of columns as well as the
same data type.
Name of the column doesn’t matter.
This means that even if I swap the current
column names, it won’t affect the execution
of the query.
The only things that should always match are
the data type and the number of columns.
Let’s do another example to further clarify
this concept.
For this example I have created another table
by the name of demo emp.
This table also has 2 columns first is the
Name with Varchar2 data type and the second
column is age which is of Number data type
as seen in the structure of this table.
I have also populated this table.
And here are the rows of this table.
Let’s write a query using this table demo_emp
and table football and perform the Union Set
operator.
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM football
UNION
SELECT name, age FROM demo_emp;
If we try to execute this query we will get
an error because the data type of last name
column of first select statement does not
match with the data type of age column of
second select statement.
Let’s execute, See I told you error!
To solve this error you can cast the age column
of second select statement and make it a character
data type.
Let me show you.
Now execute.
This time execution is smooth and successful.
Similarly if number of columns in both the
select statements do not match then also the
query results in error.
For example if I delete this age column from
the 2nd select statement let me do it and
now try to execute the query then I will get
an error this is because in the 1st select
statement we have 2 columns and in the 2nd
select statement we have only 1 column.
Let’s execute
See again error
