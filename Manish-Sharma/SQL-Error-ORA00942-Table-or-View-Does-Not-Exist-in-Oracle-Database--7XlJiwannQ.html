This is Manish from RebellionRider.com.
Welcome to the new series of quick and short
videos.
I was reading your comments, and saw that
some of you guys are having problem in finding
objects like table or views in the schema
and facing error.
The error reads as ORA-00942: table or view
does not exist.
So what does it mean?
It means what it says, the table or view you
are executing your query on does not exist
in your schema.
For example, as you can see here I am trying
to retrieve data from “emp” table and
I am connected with my HR schema in turn I
am getting this error.
This makes very clear that the table EMP does
not exist in the HR schema.
Now the question arises here that how we can
solve this error.
In order to solve this error we have to first
find out how many tables do we have in our
schema and what are their names?
We can easily get the answers to both these
questions by the help of “TAB” view which
comes pre-created in SYS schema.
Let’s see structure of this TAB view
DESC tab;
This view has three columns which are TNAME,
TABTYPE and CLUSTERID.
First two columns TNAME and TABTYPE hold the
names and types of the objects.
The third column holds the cluster id of the
cluster object.
Although this view is created into the SYS
schema but it can easily be used in any schema
you want thanks to its public synonym which
is available for all the users of the database.
Now.
Let’s find out how many tables do we have
in our HR schema using this TAB view.
But before that let me first close this script
output
ok
In order to know how many tables we have in
HR schema and what are their names we first
need to connect with the HR user.
As you can see I am already connected with
it.
If you want to confirm once again you can
do so just by writing “Show User;” command.
So as you can see we are connected with our
database using HR schema.
Next, to get the names of all the tables and
views you just have to write a very simple
query.
That will be…
SELECT * FROM tab;
It will show you the list of all the objects
like tables, views, synonyms and clusters
created in the schema with which you are connected.
Let’s execute and see.
Here we have the names and the types of all
the objects of the current schema.
Here you can also see that in total we have
8 objects into our HR schema.
Among those 8 objects, 1 is a view and the
rest 7 are tables.
You can tweak this query according to your
needs.
For example, let’s say, you only want to
see the name of all the objects which are
table.
Then this query will be.
SELECT * FROM tab WHERE tabtype = 'TABLE';
This will show you the names of all the tables
created into the schema with which you are
connected.
In our case that schema is HR.
Let’s execute and see.
Here are the names of all the 7 tables of
our HR schema.
Now let’s say you only want to see how many
objects are there into the schema.
For that you use COUNT function into this
query.
Like this
SELECT COUNT (*) FROM tab;
On execution this query will return you the
total number of objects created into the schema.
Let’s see.
Here is the answer which is 8.
You can execute any of these queries in any
of the schema of the database, whether it
is HR, OE, Scott or SYS.
They will show you the result accordingly.
Like always, I will be doing a blog on the
same where I will list down all the missing
details on TAB view.
You can find the blog on my website, I will
also put the link in the description.
Hope now you have understood how to deal with
ORA-00942, table or view does not exist error.
