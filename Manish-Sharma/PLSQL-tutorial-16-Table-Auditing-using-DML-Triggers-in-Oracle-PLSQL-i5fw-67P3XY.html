rebellionrider.com where we make
learning SQL pl/sql and oracle database
form in the previous tutorial we learnt
how to create various DML triggers such
as insert delete and update also we saw
the use of if-then-elseif with DML
triggers today's video is in the
continuation of the previous tutorial
today we will see slightly more complex
examples of DML triggers and learn how
to keep an eye on the user who is
inserting updating or deleting data from
a particular table in other words we
will learn how to audit a table I would
highly suggest you to watch the last
tutorial for a better understanding
having said that let's start the
tutorial suppose you want to keep an eye
on the users who are inserting updating
or deleting data from the superheros
table which we created in the previous
tutorial let's see how we can achieve
this to do so we will need another table
in which we can journal the auditing
data entries let's start this example by
creating this table
and here it is I name this table Sh
underscore audit where s H stands for
superheroes you can name your table
whatever you want this table has 5
columns which will hold our auditing
data such as the first column will hold
the new data which is either inserted or
updated whereas the second column will
hold the old data which is either
changed or deleted while column username
and entry date will hold the name of the
user who is performing DML operation
along with the date on which it is
performed and the last column operation
will show you the type of DML statement
executed by the user though you can make
auditing more complex but for this
tutorial
I guess this much complexity is fair
enough now it's time to write the
trigger which will do all the dirty work
but before that let's close this output
panel and clear the screen
that's much better now
here is our trigger quiet lambda huh
anyways let's see the detail part of
this trigger first that is the forceful
line first line indicates that we
created a trigger with the name
superheroes underscore on it that is
completely user defined which means you
can name your trigger whatever you want
in the second line you can see that this
trigger will execute before insert
delete and update the ml statements all
superheroes table also this trigger will
work for every single row which is
either inserted updated or deleted from
the superheroes table which is indicated
by for each row Clause in third line
lastly the Clause enable in the fourth
line shows that this trigger will start
working as soon as we compile it now
let's come to the working part of this
trigger where all the drudge work is
happening in the declaration section I
have declared two variables we
underscore user which will hold the user
name who has been tampering with your
table and we underscore date which will
hold the date and time when the data was
tampered in the execution section first
we have a select into statement using
which we are storing user name and deed
in a specific format into a variable V
underscore user and we underscore date
followed by select into statement we
have our if-then-else if a statement
this statement has three conditions each
for their respective DMS insert delete
or update these conditions are set to be
true when their respective DMS will be
executed our underlying superheroes
table before moving ahead let me tell
you that in order to better understand
the select into statement you can refer
my PL sequel tutorial 3 and easy to
understand blog post overseas state
function links are in the description
below now let's move ahead as you can
see each of these conditions consists
one insert statement which is inserting
a row consisting auditing data into SH
underscore audit table which we just
created let's take an in-depth look at
these insert statements each of these
three inserted statements are fairly
simple as column username is populated
with the value stored in the V
underscore user variable similarly the
column entry deed is populated with the
value of V underscore date very well the
column operation
consists of a string which indicates the
type of DML performed this string is
insert in case of insert DML update in
case of update DML and delete if delete
DML is performed now there is a catch in
populating new name and old name column
these columns will consist of the data
which are either inserted or updated or
deleted from the underlying table
superheroes thus we need to populate
these columns by fetching data from
superheros table and we can do that by
using pseudo records which are : new and
call an old pseudo record new allows you
to access a row currently being
processed in other words when a row is
being inserted or updated into the
superheroes table whereas pseudo recall
old allows you to access a row which is
already being either updated or deleted
from the superheroes table now the
question arises how we can use pseudo
records to fetch the data from the
source table in order to fetch the data
from the source table you have to first
write the proper pseudo record followed
by a dot and the name of the column of
the source table whose value you want to
fetch for example in our case we want to
fetch the data from SH underscore name
column which belongs to our source table
superheroes thus we will write column mu
dot SH and the score name for fetching
the current value and to fetch the
previously stored value we will write :
old dot SH underscore name once the
values are finished that insert DML will
store these values into the respective
columns of the audit table now always
remember there will be no all values in
case of insert DML as we are inserting a
new row and there will be no new values
in case of delete DML as we are deleting
an old record but in case of update DML
we have both old and new values as we
are replacing old value with the new
value hope this makes things clear to
you guys and now you have clearly
understood this trigger let's execute
and compile this trigger trigger
successfully compiled now let's take
this trigger for a test run but for that
first close this output panel
and clear the screen much better now
first let me show you that our audit
table as such underscore on it is
completely empty zero row returns now
let's insert a row into the superheros
table one row inserted let's again check
the SH underscore audit table this time
you can see that we have a row here
showing you that one record is inserted
by HR user on this particular date and
time and the DML operation was insert
similarly you can check this figure
against update DML let's do this
here we change the value of SH
underscore name column from Superman to
Iron Men let's check our audit table
again here is the result showing you
that the old name which is Superman was
replaced with the new name Ironman by
user atcha
on this particular time indeed and the
DML operation is update let's delete a
row from the source table superheroes
and see whether this trigger work for
that or not one row deleted now again
check the audit table one last time and
here is a record have you noticed that
the user who is performing DML has no
idea that you are keeping an eye on him
everything is happening in the
background covertly see how easy it is
to spy on the user and increase the
level of security of your table just by
writing a single trigger anyways before
winding up let me tell you that you can
find all the necessary links in the
description below also you can find code
for this trigger on my blog on the same
topic with in-depth explanation if you

thumbs up button and make sure to
subscribe as in the next tutorial we are
going to learn another cool trick for
triggers also you can share this video
with your friends on your social media
