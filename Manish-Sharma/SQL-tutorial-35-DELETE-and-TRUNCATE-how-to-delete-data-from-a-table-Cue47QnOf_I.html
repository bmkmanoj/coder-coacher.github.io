rebellionrider.com and today sequel
tutorial is all about sequel delete and
truncate statement till so far we have
seen three different ways of inserting
data into a table so I thought to wrap
the whole how to insert data series with
this tutorial and today in this tutorial
we will learn how to delete or remove
data from a table using delete and
truncate a statement once again I will
be using the student table which I have
used so far in this how to insert data
into a table series and fortunately this
student table has few rows in it and we
are going to delete them let's start
today's tutorial with delete DML command
delete command can be used to delete
entire as well as selected rows from a
table or views let's take a look at the
syntax as it's a delete Kure does it
starts with delete keyword followed by
from keyword after that you have to
specify the table name from which you
want to delete the data and at the end
we have our where clause where Clause
enables you to choose rows from the
reference table or view that need to be
deleted conditionally that is the only
those rows that meet the search
condition are deleted if we omit the
where Clause all the rows in the table
or view are deleted let's perform our
first curing say we want to delete the
row where is to ID is for student with
is to ID for is Batman and we will
delete this row let's write the query we
are deleting selected rows as we have
used we're close here with is to ID for
delete condition as we just want to
delete only those records where is two
IDs for let's execute one row delete it
now refresh here as you can see the
record for student Batman which has s to
ID 4 is now deleted similarly now say
you want to delete all the rows from a
table as we are deleting all the rows
from a table thus we do not need to
specify the where clause let's execute
now let's refresh here now we don't have
any rows in our table as you can see
here delete is a DML command and all the
data which has been deleted using sequel
delete command get stored into a buffer
till you
back or coming means if you have deleted
something from your table accidentally
and you want it back then you can
perform rollback to get back your data
to perform rollback you can either write
rollback and execute or if you are using
sequel developer then press function key
f12 or press this rollback button let's
do it as we have already deleted all the
rows from our table and now we do not
have any rows here let's perform a
rollback let's execute now let's refresh
here and here is our data now let's take
a look at the truncate come on unlike
delete truncate is a DDL Caban which can
be used to delete all the rows from a
table since where Clause is not allowed
with truncate command thus we cannot
delete selected rows using truncate
let's do a Curie say you want to delete
all the rows again from student table as
you can see here we have four rows in
student table now let's write the query
let me make some space so that you can
see what I am going to do next I think
everything is now perfectly visible
truncate command has pretty similar
syntax you just need to write truncate
table both are the key words followed by
the name of table from which you want to
delete the data before executing this
query mind that we cannot perform a roll
back once we truncate means rollback is
not possible with truncate command and
the deletion is permanent let's execute
table student truncated now let's
refresh here once again all the rows are
deleted let's try to rollback now let's
execute rollback completed now let's try
to refresh nothing happens let's try to
roll back by pressing this rollback
button now let's again refresh nothing
happens for more in-depth knowledge of
the topic as well as the difference
between truncate and delete command you
can read my blog link is in the
description box hope you enjoyed
watching hit the thumbs up and keep me
motivated moreover you can comment your
feedback and don't

we'll see you soon this is manish from
