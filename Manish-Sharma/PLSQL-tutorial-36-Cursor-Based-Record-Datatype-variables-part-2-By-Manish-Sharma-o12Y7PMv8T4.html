again i am manish from
rebellionrider.com in the previous
tutorial we learnt how to create cursor
based a record date and I variable when
underline cursor is returning values
from only one row or say returning the
record of only one employ now what if
the cursor is returning the records of
multiple employees how are we going to
handle it so as I promised in the last
PL sequel tutorial today we will learn
how to handle multiple values returned
by the cursor using cursor based record
data type variable in Oracle database so
without wasting much of your time let's
move ahead and start this tutorial by
creating a simple explicit cursor
so here we are take a closer look at the
select statement of this cursor this
statement will return the first name and
salary of all the employees whose
employee ID is greater than 200 which
means this cursor will return multiple
rows of data and what we want to see is
whether we can handle all this data
returned by this cursor see you are
underscore rebellion writer just by
using a single record variable if we
talk about the traditional approach then
we have to declare two separate
variables with the same data type and
data width for holding the values from
the corresponding columns which are
false name and salary in our case I know
at this point some of you will think
it's impossible so let's see is it
really impossible or not as you can see
here I have declared only one cursor
base record data type with name var
underscore EMP using our simple cursor
see you are underscore rebellion right
up now we have to see whether this
single car service record data type
variable can handle all the values
written by the cursor or do we have to
go with the traditional approach as I
mentioned in the previous tutorial also
that we are dealing with cursors does we
have to make sure that we follow the
cursor life cycle properly hence I open
the cursor before I start using it
here I have a simple loop inside which
using fetch into statement I am fetching
data from the cursor see you are
underscore rebellion Rider and storing
it into our cursor record var underscore
EMP next statement will terminate the
loop as soon as there will be no rows or
data inside the cursor to be returned
next using the DBMS output statement I
am printing the values stored into our
cursor base record variable which in our
case are the first name and salary of
all the employees with employee ID
greater than 200 then write outside the
loop I close the cursor so that all the
resources held by the cutter
see you are underscore rebellion Rider
gate relinquish this is also the proper
way of working with cursor if you have
no idea about what I am saying or about
working with cursors then do go and
watch PL sequel tutorial 27 find the
link in the description now let's
execute this code and see whether it
will be a success or a failure and here
we have the result which means a single
record variable can handle multiple
values written by the cursor so that is
how we handle multiple values using
single cursor based record data type
variable in Oracle database before
winding up this tutorial I have a
question for you
can we simplify this code or is there
any other way of getting the same result
using cursors and record variables if so
then what is it if you need a hint
then watch PL sequel tutorial 30 on
cursor for loop or read my blog on the
same topic that's it for today if you
