rebellionrider.com and i am back again
with another SQL tutorial today's SQL
tutorial is about foreign key in my
previous video I have shown you what
primary key is and how to define it if
you haven't watched it then please find
the link for the video on primary key in
the description below
okay let's check out the foreign key
similar to primary key we can define
foreign key using either create table
statement or alter table statement first
we will see how to define foreign key
using create table statement we can
define foreign key using create table
statement in two different ways first
one is on column level and second one is
on table level we will start with
defining foreign key using Create table
statement on column level we have to
create two separate table that of parent
and child table so our parent table is
authors and child table is books our
parent table author is just a simple
table with two columns author ID and
author name where author ID is a primary
key column as I have already shown you
different way of defining a primary key
on table in my last video so I am going
to fast forward this if you haven't
watched my primary key tutorial then I
am providing the link in the description
below so please watch this video and now
let's jump our SQL Developer let's
create our parent table
okay we have our parent table author we
will be using author ID column of author
table in our foreign key thus it's
mandatory to define this author ID
column in parent table as either primary
key or unique key please note that it's
mandatory only the primary key column or
the unique key column of parent table
can participate in foreign key
constraint avoiding this may result in
error so we have our parent table author
with a primary key column author ID now
let's create the child table books child
table is the core of foreign key
constraint let's create it we are
defining foreign key on column level
this is the main column over which we
are going to put foreign key using
author ID column from our parent table
so this column must have same data type
and size as of the author ID column of
parent table author you can give
whatever name you want to this column
but as I said data type and size of this
column must match with the parent table
column author ID let me explain this to
you in order to define foreign key we
first define our column then we specify
constraint which is a keyword followed
by user defined constraint name and then
references which is again a keyword and
then name of parent table and the column
of parent table in parentheses which you
want to use in foreign key so we have
created our child table with the name of
box now let's see the second way of
defining foreign key using Create table
on table level so for that we will be
using our same parent table author for
demonstrating I have to drop our child
table books and recreate it okay let's
drop our child table books for that plus
write drop table and the table name
which is books execute there we go and
now let's recreate our child table box
just a second let me give a comment
as I have already told you that we are
going to put our foreign key on book
author ID column the third column here
so it must have the same data type and
this size as of the column in our parent
table which we are going to reference
here which is our author ID column let's
move ahead let me give some spaces so
that you can create it clearly okay
execute there we go
as you can see I first define all the
column of the table and then at the end
I define my constraint let's see the
last statement of the table constraint
is the keyword followed by the
user-defined constraint name and our
constraint foreign key which is again a
keyword and then the child table column
in the parentheses over which you want
to put foreign key and the key word
references followed by the name of
parent table and the column of parent
table in parentheses that's it now let's
see how to define foreign key using
alter table statement let's say we have
a child table box with all three columns
book ID book title and author book ID
but we do not have any constant over the
table yet so let's start by dropping our
child table book and recreating it once
again we have to execute this command
now we don't have any child table book
let's recreate it
okay let me give some space so that you
people can see it clearly remember we
are yeah I was saying remember we are
going to create a simple book table
without any constraint this means we are
not going to emphasize or put any
constraint right now on this table
execute that's it just a simple table
without any constant now we have to put
warranty constant on third column author
book ID or sorry book author ID before
emphasizing foreign key constant on the
column make sure this column has same
data type and size as that of column in
parent table which we are going to
reference in foreign key now let's alter
the table for that just write this GDL
command
let's format it first up kay let's let
me check already word box that constant
book foreign key just make it come here
both are not o DS ID same you for
references okay let's execute okay let's
check whether we have this constant on
our table books or not for that just go
and click over the table name you can
click here here it doesn't matter just
click over the table name and then press
shift key and f4 key and SQL Developer
will show you this visit and here just
click constant and as you can see we
have our foreign key constraint Bo ki ki
FK and if you click here double click it
sorry
and you will get to know that this
constant is on column position 1 and
every detail about this constant you can
get from here it means we have a foreign
key constraint on our table books here
so guys that's it for today for more
in-depth knowledge on foreign key you
can read this article just right here on
my website you can find the link in the
description below also please share this
video tutorial with your friends and
peer on your social networking if you
haven't subscribed already please do so
and get latest update on SQL tutorial in
case of any curie feel free to comment
take care see you soon with another
interesting SQL tutorial this is manish
