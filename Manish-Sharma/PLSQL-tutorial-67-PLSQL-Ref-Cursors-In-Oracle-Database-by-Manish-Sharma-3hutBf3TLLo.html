I am Manish from RebellionRider.com and I
am back once again with another PL/SQL Tutorial.
In today’s tutorial we will learn what PL/SQL
Ref Cursors are in Oracle Database.
A little bit knowledge of database cursors
will be required for the better understanding
of this tutorial.
Fortunately we already have a series covering
the concepts of Cursors.
You can find that the link, as always, is
in the description.
I suggest you to watch those tutorials.
So without further wasting your time let’s
start this PL/SQL tutorial and learn what
are Ref Cursors in Oracle Database.
Ref Cursor is an acronym of Reference to a
Cursor.
It is a PL/SQL datatype using which you can
declare a special type of variable called
Cursor Variable.
Unlike static cursors which we have already
discussed on this channel, a single cursor
variable can be associated with multiple SELECT
statements in a single PL/SQL block.
On the other hand a static cursor can only
access single SELECT statement at a time.
Cursor Variables and Ref Cursors are two inter-dependent
topics so do not get confused with them.
Just take them as, in Oracle Database cursor
variables exist in the form of Ref Cursors.
Let’s go ahead and see how many types of
Ref Cursors we have in Oracle Database.
Types of Ref Cursors:
There are two types of Ref Cursors in Oracle
Database.
These are:
1.
Strong Ref Cursors and
2.
Weak Ref Cursors.
Strong Ref Cursors
Any ref cursor which has fixed return type
is called Strong Ref Cursor.
Let’s see the syntax of strong Ref Cursor
and here it is…
DECLARE
TYPE ref_cursor_name IS REF CURSOR RETURN
(return type);
The return type of a cursor must always be
of record type only.
It can either be a record structure of a table
or a user defined record structure.
You can refer PL/SQL tutorials 40, 41 and
42 to learn more about record datatype in
Oracle Database.
Weak Ref Cursors
In contrast to strong ref cursors, weak ref
cursors are those which do not have any return
type.
In simple words, those ref cursors which do
not have fixed return type are called weak
ref cursors.
Such cursors are most frequently used ref
cursors as they are open to all SELECT statements.
Whereas strong ref cursors can only be used
with those SELECT statements that return the
result whose datatype matches with the one
that you have fixed during the strong cursor’s
declaration.
Let’s take a look at the syntax of weak
ref cursors in Oracle Database.
DECLARE
TYPE ref_cursor_name IS REF CURSOR;
Except from the missing return clause the
syntax is pretty much similar to the strong
ref cursors.
Apart from strong and weak Ref Cursors, Oracle
Database also provides us with one more type
of special Cursor variable.
Before talking about that I just want to take
a quick second to ask you to give this video
a thumbs up and if you are new here than do
make sure to subscribe.
You can also help others in learning as well
as help us and our channel in growing by sharing
this video on your social media.
Thanks, now let’s come back to our topic.
So we are talking about that special cursor
variable provided by Oracle.
It is known by the name of Sys_RefCursor.
Sys_Refcursor
Sys Ref cursor is an Oracle built in cursor
variable.
It declares a weak ref cursor and that too
without declaring the ref pointer type.
We will see what that means when we will do
a separate video on sys ref cursor.
Till then stay tuned and do subscribe because
in upcoming videos we will do the examples
of strong and weak ref cursors as well as
sys ref cursors.
Also do make sure to Like and share this video.
This a quick introduction to PL/SQL ref cursors
/ cursor variable in Oracle Database.
Thanks for watching.
