rebellionrider.com where we make
learning pl/sql fun now that we have
learned the concepts of nasty table and
we array type collection in the previous
tutorial thus today we will jump on to
the next type of collection which is
associative array but first if you are
new to the channel then please subscribe
and don't forget to like this video as
it keeps me motivated to continue doing
my work which is to help you by sharing
the knowledge let's see if we can have
hundred likes on this video okay so that
being said let's move ahead
unlike master table and very associative
array whole elements of similar data
typing key value pairs nature of
associative array is non persistent
which means neither the array nor the
data can be stored in the database also
similar to the nested table the
associative array is also an unbounded
collection which means there is no upper
bound on the number of elements it can
hold let's do some examples and try to
understand associative array in more
detail now that we have set the server
output on and started our PL sequel
block next we create the associative
array remember that similar to nested
table and we array you can only create
the associative array inside the
declaration section of the PL sequel
block
here I have created an associative array
with name books which can hold elements
of number data type Dell so far the
statement looks very similar to two
statements which we use for creating VRE
and nested table right but then we have
an additional clause which is indexed by
followed by a valid index data type
using index type clause we specify the
data type of the associative arrays
subscript you can read more about syntax
of associative array on my blog whose
link is in the description let's move
ahead next we will create an associative
array variable it will be used for
referencing the associative array
features created this array variable can
be created very easily you just have to
write the name of the variable which is
user defined followed by the name of the
associative array let's do it here we
have our array variable named it is BN
unlike other forms of collection
associative array does not require
initialization and have no constructor
syntax like these next we will see how
to insert values into the collection
associative array as I said before in
associative array we store the data in
key value pair the value store against
the index which signifies the data type
of array subscript will act as the key
whereas the data of number data type
will be devalued let's insert some data
into the associative array
as you can see using the area variable
ISBN we inserted two key value pairs
into the associative array books
inserting data into the array is easy as
there is no need to write insert into
DML similarly updating value is as easy
as inserting them if you want to change
any value write the same statement which
is used for insertion with the modified
values for example say you want to
change the value against the key my SQL
from nine eight zero six two one zero
one zero then you just write that's it
on execution this will update the values
for specified key which in this case is
my SQL now that we have learned how to
insert and update values of an
associative array next we will learn how
to retrieve the values from it just like
we don't need insert DML statement for
inserting values or update the ml for
updating values similarly we don't need
select e ml for retrieving values see
how easy it is let me show you suppose
you want to see the value stored against
the key Oracle database for that you
just need to write
that's it that single DBMS output
statement is all you need on execution
you will get your value what am I
waiting for let me execute this code for
you but for that we have to first close
this block with keyword and and a
forward slash we are good to go let's
execute here is the value 1 2 3 4 stored
against the key Oracle database this is
the case when you want to retrieve one
specific value what about if you want to
retrieve all the values stored into the
array
any guesses yes right we will use the
loop to retrieve all the values from the
associative array let's modify this
block and write the loop but before that
let's close this output panel I'll start
with deleting this DBMS output statement
and it's done for this demonstration we
will be using while loop to use while
loop we will need a loop counter let's
declare a scalar variable which can be
used as a loop counter here we have our
loop counter which is of watcher to type
now let's write the loop
here is are you right before the loop I
stored the first key into the loop count
out to do that I use a collection method
called first this method will return the
first index from an associative array
then we have our while loop using the
loop counter flag we are making sure
that this loop will run from the first
index value which we just stored into it
till it encounters any null value store
against any key inside this loop we are
printing the data stored as key and
value in our associative array the last
statement of the loop is for increasing
the counter to the next value after
every iteration if you are confused
about the while loop and it's working
then make sure to check out the PL
sequel tutorial 12 we will discuss the
same in detail as always link is in the
description so let's try to execute and
see whether we can retrieve all the
values is stored into the associative
array books or not here are all our data
which we store earlier into the array so
in this tutorial we learned how to
create an associative array how to
insert and update values of the
associative array and then we saw two
different ways of retrieving values from
it hope you enjoyed watching you can
head over to my blog for more in-depth
knowledge of the concept do make sure to
like and share and if you are new to the
channel then smash that big red
