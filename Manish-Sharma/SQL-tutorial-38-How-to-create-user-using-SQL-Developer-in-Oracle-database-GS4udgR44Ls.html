I am Manish from RebellionRider.com
And I am back once again with another SQL
tutorial.
Today in this SQL tutorial you will gonna
learn ?How to create a new user account using
SQL Developer tool.?
In the previous video I showed you how to
create a new user account using SQL Create
User statement.
There I explained the syntax of SQL create
user with example in detail so I highly suggest
you to please watch my previous video for
the better understanding of this concept.
You can find all the links in the description
box.
Let?s start todays tutorial.
As you can see, here I am on my SQL Developer.
Now the first thing, as I have already told
you in my previous tutorial is that in order
to create a user you must have the CREATE
USER system privilege.
Or you can use sys or system user accounts
for creating a new user, these are 2 highly
privileged administrative accounts created
automatically during installation.
So I am going to log on to my database using
sys user.
So let?s quickly create a new connection to
connect with our Database using sys user.
By the way I have done a detailed video on
how to connect with database using SQL Developer
and Command prompt, its tutorial no.4.
You can watch it.
Link is in the description box.
To make a new connection click this big green
plus button it will open up a new window.
Now here in this new window you have to fill
in all these details.
In the connection name you can give any name
you want.
I will write let?s say sys@localhost
Now user name, here you have to give a valid
user name and in our case its sys as we want
to log on to our database with sys user
Now password, my password for the sys is oracle.
Please don?t tell my password to anyone ;).
Now check this save password checkbox.
Connection type let it be basic it?s ok.
Now Role, you must choose sysdba here otherwise
you will get an error,
Now host name, my host name is localhost for
the obvious reasons.
If your database is installed on server then
you can give server name or ip address here.
1521 port number it?s ok for me I have configured
my database on default port which is 1521.
You may have a different port number.
You can check you listener.ora file for valid
hostname and port number.
My sid is orcl.
Watch my tutorial 4 for detailed information
Let?s test.
Success...
We are done click connect.
--
So now we are connected to our database using
sys user.
Now double click on your sys user and expand
it.
Here select the last option which is Other
user.
Right click on Other user and select Create
new user.
This will open up the create user wizard.
Write the name of your user in this username
field.
You can give whatever name you want.
In the previous video I made a user by the
name of Ironman so today I am gonna make a
user by the name of BATMAN.
Write password in password field for the authentication
of your user.
Write same password in confirm password field.
If you check this checkbox next to password
expired field then your user has to change
the password on the first login attempt.
Similarly you can Lock the user and enable
the edition.
I don?t want to lock the user and expire the
password or enable edition so I am not gonna
check any of the boxes here.
Next is Tablespaces.
Here you have to choose the default and temporary
tablespaces.
As default tablespace I will choose example
this time.
You can choose any table space as default
tablespace except temp and undo tablespace.
Everything is done here.
Now click this Grant Role tab
Now what are roles?
Roles are group of privileges.
Suppose there are a large number of users
and you have to assign same system and object
privileges to them.
This will become a very tedious task if you
start granting individual privilege to each
of these users.
So instead of doing this you can create a
role where you will group all the privileges
and grant this role to the users.
Don?t worry I will do a separate video on
roles soon.
But for now I don?t want to assign any role
to my user batman.
So I am not going to select anything here.
Ok now come to system privilege tab.
These are all the system privileges which
you can assign to your user.
And if you remember
I told you guys in my previous tutorial that
to establish a connection with database every
newly created user must have ?create session?
system privilege.
Create session system privilege is mandatory
privilege needed by all the users to log on
to the database.
So here also, we have to assign create session
privilege to our user batman.
Let?s search create session.
And here it is.
Now check this checkbox against the name of
the privilege in granted column.
If you check this admin option checkbox then
this user.
This means user batman which I am creating
right now?can grant or revoke the system privilege
or role to or from any user or other role
in the database.
Say if you want to create table using this
user then you grant ?Create table? to your
user.
Let?s search create table
Here it is Grant it.
You can browse this list of privileges and
see what privilege you want and then grant
accordingly.
Done here,
Now come to this QUOTA tab.
Using Quota clause you can specify the maximum
amount of space that the user is capable of
allocating in the tablespace.
Before that let me tell you one thing ? you
cannot assign a quota on temp and undo tablespace.
If you try to do this you will get an error.
Now if you want to allocate unlimited space
to the newly created user then you can just
tick on the checkbox provided against the
name of the Tablespace which in this case
is ?example?.
You can even allocate a certain quota of space
to the Tablespace named ?example? by double
clicking on the appropriate box in the Quota
column and filling in the amount of space
that you wanna give.
Similarly you could even specify the units
such as K for kilobytes, M for megabytes and
G for gigabytes.
Now the next tab is SQL which contains all
the SQL statements corresponding to the settings
which you have done so far.
If you are learning SQL then you can take
help from these SQL statements.
Everything is done, if you want you can review
your settings once again, otherwise click
apply.
Now a new user account is created.
You can check your user.
For that expand this Other users folder, here
you can see the list of all the user accounts
of this database.
Let?s search our user, here it is.
So now you have your new user account created.
Let?s try to log on to our database using
this user batman.
To save the time I will use Command prompt
for the demonstration.
As you can see we are connected to our database.
Let me quickly show you the user.
Here we go.
That?s how we create a new user account using
SQL Developer tool.
That?s it for today.
Hope you enjoyed watching.

interesting videos on SQL.
I will be back soon with another tutorial.
Till then take care.
