I am Manish from rebellionrider.com.
Previously we talked about the conditional
statements in PL/SQL and their types.
In today’s tutorial we will see the first
conditional statement in PL/SQL which is IF
THEN or you can simply say IF condition.
IF THEN is the most basic kind of conditional
statements in PL/SQL that enables you to specify
only a single group of action to be taken.
You can also say that this specific group
of action is taken only when a condition is
evaluated to be true.
Correct me, if I am wrong, I think IF conditional
statement is used in almost every programming
language.
If you disagree then do comment below and
tell me which programming languages do not
support IF statements.
Ok now let’s quickly take a look at IF THEN
structure in PL/SQL
IF condition THEN
Statement1;
…
Statement N;
END IF;
In the starting we have the keyword IF which
marks the beginning of IF THEN block followed
by a valid condition or a valid expression
which will get evaluated followed by another
keyword THEN.
Similarly the reserved phrase END IF marks
the ending of IF THEN block.
In between we have a sequence of executable
statements which will get executed only if
the condition evaluated to be true otherwise
the whole IF THEN block will be skipped.
Hope this is clear to you guys.
Now let’s do some practical example which
will help you in understanding this concept
more clearly.
Let’s go for it.
SET SERVEROUTPUT ON;
DECLARE
v_num NUMBER := 9;
BEGIN
IF v_num &amp;lt; 10 THEN
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Inside The IF');
END IF;
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('outside The IF');
END;
/
This is a very simple PL/SQL anonymous block.
In the declaration section I have declared
a variable v_num with data type NUMBER and
initialized it with integer 9.
Let’s come to our execution section.
Here as you can see we have 2 DBMS_OUTPUT
statements 1 is inside the IF THEN block and
another is outside it.
The first DBMS_OUTPUT statement will execute
only if the condition of our IF THEN block
is evaluated as true otherwise it will be
skipped but the 2nd DBMS_OUTPUT statement
which is outside the IF THEN block will execute
every time you execute this PL/SQL block.
This means that if the condition is true then
both the strings INSDIE THE IF and OUTSIDE
THE IF will be printed otherwise only the
string OUTSIDE THE IF will be printed.
So let’s execute and see the result
Right now condition is v_num &amp;lt; 10 which is
true as current value inside the variable
v_num is 9 which is smaller than the integer
10.
Let’s execute
Here is the result where both the strings
is displayed back to you.
Now let’s change the condition and make
it false.
Then execute and see the result but first
let’sclose this script output.
Ok now let’s change this if condition
V_num &amp;gt; 10
Now the condition is v_num &amp;gt; 10 which is obviously
false now let’s execute
And as you can see this time in the result
only the string from 2nd DBMS_OUTPUT statement
is printed.
Let’s do another example
But first let’s close this script output
and clear the screen ok now let’s do the
example
DECLARE
v_website VARCHAR2(30) := 'RebellionRider.com';
v_author VARCHAR2(30) := 'Manish';
BEGIN
IF v_website ='RebellionRider.com' AND v_author=
'Manish' THEN
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Everything is Awesome
:)');
END IF;
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Give this Video a Thumbs
Up');
END;
/
This one is slightly different than the previous
example.
Here we used logical AND operator in the condition.
If this condition is evaluated to be true
then both strings from both DBMS_OUTPUT statements
will be printed otherwise only the string
from 2nd DBMS_OUTPUT statement will be displayed
back to you.
This example is for showing how you can check
multiple conditions in a single go using logical
operator.
You can even use logical OR instead of logical
AND operator.
Let’s execute this block and see the result.
Here is our result.

the same topic link is in the show notes.
That’s it for today.
Hope this tutorial helped you in understanding
the concept of IF THEN conditional statement.
