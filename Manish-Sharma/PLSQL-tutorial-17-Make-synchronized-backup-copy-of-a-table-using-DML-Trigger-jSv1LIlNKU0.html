I am Manish from RebellionRider.com.
Hope you guys have watched the previous video
and are ready to participate in the giveaway
which I am going to conduct very soon. If
you haven’t then don’t worry you still
have a chance. Watch the last video and follow
the instructions to ensure your participation.
Link is in the description.
Anyways let’s come to our today’s tutorial.
Today we will see how we can make a complete
synchronized backup copy of a table. By synchronized
backup copy I mean the backup table gets automatically
populated or updated with the main table simultaneously.
Let’s see how we can achieve this.
As it’s apparently clear that for the demonstration
we will require two identical tables; One
which will serve as your main table that will
accept the data from your database user and
the second which will be your backup table.
I will use the Superheroes table which we
have been using since the beginning of this
DML trigger series as our main table. This
table only has one column with name SH_NAME,
and here you can see the structure of this
table. Next we will have to create an identical
table to this one which will work as our backup
table.
Let’s create this backup table.
CREATE TABLE superheroes_backup AS SELECT
* FROM superheroes WHERE 1=2;
This particular “Create Table As” command
will create the table with name superheroes_backup
which will have the identical structure as
of the table which you have specified in the
select statement which is superheroes in our
case. In order to better understand the “Create
Table As” command please read my blog on
the same. Link is in the description.
Let’s execute. Table created
So as of now we have our both main as well
as the backup table. Next we have to write
the trigger which will insert, update or delete
the rows from the backup table when someone
does the same with our main table. Let’s
do it. But before that let’s close this
script output and clear the screen
CREATE or REPLACE trigger Sh_Backup
BEFORE INSERT OR DELETE OR UPDATE ON superheroes
FOR EACH ROW
ENABLE
BEGIN
IF INSERTING THEN
INSERT INTO superheroes_backup (SH_NAME) VALUES
(:NEW.SH_NAME);
ELSIF DELETING THEN
DELETE FROM superheroes_backup WHERE SH_NAME
=:old.sh_name;
ELSIF UPDATING THEN
UPDATE superheroes_backup
SET SH_NAME =:new.sh_name WHERE SH_NAME =:old.sh_name;
END IF;
END;
/
Here is our trigger. As you can see the name
of this trigger is sh_backup and this will
execute for each and every row before Insert,
Delete or Update dml statement on the main
table superheroes. As we have set status of
this trigger enable which means it will start
performing its work as soon as we execute
and compile it.
Now let’s come to the working part of this
trigger and see what’s happening. Here we
have the execution section, inside this we
have IF THEN ELSIF statement. This statement
has 3 conditions each for their respective
DMLs Insert, Delete or Update. These conditions
are set to be true when their respective DMLs
will be executed over underlying superheroes
table.
For example if a user executes an Insert statement
on main table superheroes then 1st if condition
will set to be true and respective dml will
insert a value into the backup table ‘superheroes
backup’ and pseudo record NEW will make
sure that the value will be the one which
is currently inserted into the main table.
As pseudo record ‘NEW’, allows you to
access a row currently being processed.
Similarly in case a Delete statement is executed
over main table then 2nd if condition will
set to be true and respective delete dml will
delete the row from the backup table. In this
case pseudo record OLD will make sure that
the value which is deleted in the backup table
is the same one which was currently deleted
in the main table.
And In case of Update DML 3rd if statement
will set to be true and respective Update
dml will update the record in the backup table.
Using pseudo record New we are fetching the
new updated value from the main table and
replacing the old value which was specified
using pseudo record OLD.
The working of Pseudo records has been explained
in detail in the previous video so I would
suggest you to watch it for a better understanding
or you can read about the same on my blog.
Now let’s test this trigger by writing DMLs
on our main table Superheroes. Before that
let me show you that both Main and Backup
tables are empty and contain no rows.
SELECT * FROM superheroes;
0 rows return.
SELECT * FROM superheroes_backup;
0 rows returns again, which indicates both
the tables are empty.
As it’s confirmed that both the tables are
empty so now move ahead and test the trigger
but before that let’s execute and compile
the trigger first.
Trigger compiled successfully
Now let’s insert a row into the main table
superheroes.
INSERT INTO superheroes VALUES ('Batman');
1 row inserted. Let’s insert one more row.
INSERT INTO superheroes VALUES ('Superman');
Ok so now we have two rows in our main table.
Check both the table once again and ensure
the success of the Insert DML we just executed.
SELECT * FROM superheroes;
We have 2 rows in main table superheroes.
That’s great now check the backup table
SELECT * FROM superheroes_backup;
Amazing both the rows exist into our backup
table too. Which means trigger is working
for Insert DML. Now let’s check Update statement
too.
UPDATE SUPERHEROES SET sh_name = 'Ironman'
WHERE sh_name = 'Batman';
So row updated successfully let’s check
the main table.
SELECT * FROM superheroes;
Here the value Ironman replaced the old value
batman. Let’s quickly check the backup table
too
SELECT * FROM superheroes_backup;
Great changes got reflected here too.
Now delete the superman record from the main
table.
DELETE FROM SUPERHEROES WHERE SH_NAME='Superman';
One row deleted. Let’s quickly check the
main table
SELECT * FROM superheroes;
No superman record
Now check the status of backup table
SELECT * FROM superheroes_backup;
No superman record here too. That shows we
have successfully created a trigger which
is backing up our main table superheroes.
Though you can write this trigger for any
table but I would not advise you to use such
trigger on those tables that involve heavy
data input, deletion and updation. This is
chiefly due to the performance reasons.
Though it will work fine but could slow down
your query processing.
Anyways you can find this code with more details
on my blog, link is in the description.
