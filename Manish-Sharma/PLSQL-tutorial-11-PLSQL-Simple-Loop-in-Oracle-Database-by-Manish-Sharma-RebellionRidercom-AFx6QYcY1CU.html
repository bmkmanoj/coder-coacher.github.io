Welcome back once again
I am Manish from RebellionRider.com. Today
with this tutorial I will be starting a new
series on Iterative statements also known
as Loops in Oracle PL/SQL.
As we know that loops execute block of statements
or a part of a program several times. In PL/SQl
we have 4 types of loops.
1. Simple Loop
2. While Loop
3. Numeric For Loop and
4. Cursor For loop
In this series we will focus over the first
3 types of loops. The last type which is “Cursor
For Loop” will be discussed with Cursor
in future videos. Having said that let’s
start today’s tutorial with Simple Loop.
Simple loop is the most basic loop in Oracle
PL/SQL. Let’s take a look at the syntax.
This will help you in better understanding
as to why we call it a simple loop.
LOOP
Statement 1;
Statement 2;
…
Statement 3;
END LOOP;
Here keyword LOOP marks the beginning and
phrase END LOOP marks the ending of the loop.
In between we have a sequence of executable
statements.
As you can see in this syntax that unlike
conventional loops here we do not have update
statements or for that matter exist conditions
which will terminate the loop. May be that
is why we call this a simple loop.
But wait, it doesn’t have an exit condition!
Does that mean that it is an infinity loop?
Hmmm yeah, you can say so.
To find out the answer of this question let’s
jump over to our SQL Developer and do some
examples. I think nothing is better than a
multiplication table for the demonstration
of this loop.
So let’s write a program to print a Multiplication
table of 19. Why 19? Because I am still struggling
with it. God why is it so hard.
DECLARE
v_counter NUMBER :=0;
v_result NUMBER;
BEGIN
LOOP
v_counter := v_counter+1;
v_result := 19*v_counter;
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('19'||' x '||v_counter||'
= '|| v_result);
END LOOP;
END;
So here we are. In the declaration section
we declared 2 variables of Number data type.
Variable v_counter will serve as a counter
and variable v_result will hold the result
of multiplication. Down in the execution section
we have our simple loop. In this loop we have
3 statements first statement will work as
our update statement. This will update our
counter and increment it by 1 with every iteration.
Statement 2 is an arithmetic expression which
will perform the multiplication of our table
and will store the result in v_result variable.
Statement 3 is an output statement which will
print the result of the multiplication in
a formatted manner.
But here we do not have any exit statement
to terminate the loop. This means that if
we execute this program then the execution
will keep on printing till we halt it manually.
In this case Oracle PL/SQL gives us two clauses
to terminate the loop
1. Exit
2. Exit When
Exit clause will terminate the loop when Exit
condition is evaluated to be true. The exit
condition is evaluated with the help of Simple
IF THEN condition which we discussed in PL/SQL
Tutorial 8. So let’s see how you can use
this exit statement in this example.
IF v_counter &amp;gt;=10 THEN
EXIT;
END IF;
You simply have to add this IF THEN block
either right above the phrase END LOOP or
immediately below the keyword loop. What this
IF THEN block will do; you ask? This block
will keep an eye on your counter and will
tell the control to exit the loop when counter
either becomes greater than or equal to 10.
Which means loop will execute for 10 times.
Let’s execute and see.
And here is our result.
You know what? Writing extra LOC was never
my style I always search for the option which
can help me in reducing line of codes. For
terminating this loop we have that option
which is the 2nd clause EXIT WHEN. Using this
clause you can replace this whole IF THEN
block with a simple single statement. Yes
You heard it right just a single Line of code
in place of this whole block. Let me show
you how.
EXIT WHEN i_counter&amp;gt;=10;
That’s all you have to write at the place
of the IF THEN block. Let’s execute and
see the result,
Here we are as you can see the result is the
same as that of the previous one.
Hope this example helped you in learning the
concept of this simple loop. If you like this
video then give it a thumbs up and help your
friends by sharing this video with them or
on your social media. More importantly don’t
forget to subscribe as many more interesting
videos are yet to come.
That’s it for today, Thanks for watching
will catch you soon till then take care. This
