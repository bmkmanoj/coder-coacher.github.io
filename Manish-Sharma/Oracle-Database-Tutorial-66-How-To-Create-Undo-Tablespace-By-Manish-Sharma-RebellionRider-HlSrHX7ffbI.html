Welcome back once again
I am Manish from RebellionRider.com and this
is the 3rd tutorial in how to create tablespace
series. Today in this tutorial I will show
you how to create an Undo Tablespace.
Undo tablespace is a kind of permanent tablespace
used by oracle database engine to manage undo
data if you are running your database in automatic
undo management mode. This undo data or say
undo records are generally used to
• Roll back transactions when a ROLLBACK
statement is issued
• Recover the database
• Provide read consistency
• Analyze data as of an earlier point in
time by using Oracle Flashback Query
• Recover from logical corruptions using
Oracle Flashback features
Similar to other two tablespaces i.e. Permanent
and Temporary tablespace which we have discussed
in the previous two tutorials, undo tablespace
can also be created as small file as well
as big file tablespace. By the way if you
haven’t watched my previous two tutorials
then find the links in the description box.
Ok so let’s move ahead and see how to create
an undo tablespace in Oracle Database.
As we are creating an undo tablespace thus
we will use CREATE UNDO TABLESPACE clause.
First let me write create undo tablespace
clause then I will explain it to you along
with the restrictions of undo tablespaces.
So let’s write the clause.
CREATE SMALLFILE UNDO TABLESPACE &quot;tbsp_undo&quot; 
DATAFILE 'C:\APP\TBSP_DEMO\tbsp_undo.dbf' SIZE 100M 
AUTOEXTEND ON NEXT 500M 
MAXSIZE UNLIMITED 
RETENTION NOGUARANTEE;
Here the create undo tablespace statement
is slightly different than those that we have
done so far. So let’s dig into this statement
and see what we have done here.
The first line is self-explanatory. Here we
are creating a small file undo tablespace
by the name of tbsp_undo.
In the second line we have our data file clause
using which I have added a data file tbsp_unod.dbf
to our undo tablespace which has an initial
size of 100MB. As it’s a small file tablespace
that means we can add multiple data files
into it which is otherwise not possible in
case of big file tablespace that can have
maximum 1 data file only. For the simplicity
of the demonstration here I have added only
one data file.
In the third line we have auto extend clause.
Using this clause we are ensuring that as
soon as our data file tbsp_undo.dbf which
is of 100MB size gets filled with undo segments,
oracle engine will extend it automatically
and increment it by 500 Megabytes.
In the fourth line we have clause MAXSIZE.
Using this clause we can set the maximum size
to which the data file of our tablespace can
extend or say grow. Here I have set the maximum
size of our data file tbsp_undo.dbf to UNLIMITED.
You can also limit the max size of your data
file for that, simply write the size. For
example say you want to set the max size of
your data file to 50MB in that case simply
write 50M in place of UNLIMITED.
Let’s do it see that’s all you have to
do
In the 5th and last line we have a Retention
clause which is as of now set on No Guarantee.
You can set Retention clause either on Guarantee
or No Guarantee.
RETENTION GUARANTEE specifies that Oracle
Database should preserve unexpired undo data
in all undo segments of tablespace. This setting
is useful if you need to issue an Oracle Flashback
Query or an Oracle Flashback Transaction Query
to diagnose and correct a problem with the
data.
RETENTION NOGUARANTEE returns the undo behavior
to normal. Space occupied by unexpired undo
data in undo segments can be consumed if necessary
by ongoing transactions. This is the default.
If you do not specify this clause oracle engine
by default sets the retention on No Guarantee.
Every necessary setting is done. So now let’s
execute this query but on executing this query
we will get an error so let’s execute and
see what will be the error.
As you can see here we have ORA – 02494
error which saying that invalid or missing
file size in MAXSIZE clause. This is because
the value we have specified in maxsize is
50M which is smaller than the value we have
specified in SIZE clause which is 100M. To
avoid these kid of errors either try to set
the value of maxsize clause greater than the
value of size clause or set the maxsize clause
to UNLIMITED. So let’s do one thing set
the maxsize clause to UNLIMITED.
Ok now let’s try executing this query but
before that let me close this script output
now le’s execute
As you can see this time Small file tablespace
is created
See how easy it is?
In case if you want to create a big file undo
tablespace; and yes we are allowed to create
one! Just replace this small file keyword
with big file and make sure you have added
only one data file to your tablespace as big
file tablespace can have only one data file.
So before winding up let’s take a look at
some Undo tablespace restrictions
• You cannot create database objects in
this tablespace. It is reserved for system-managed
undo data.
• The only clauses you can specify for an
undo tablespace are the DATAFILE clause and
the extent_management_clause to specify local
extent management.
• All undo tablespaces are created permanent,
read/write, and in logging mode. Values for
MINIMUM EXTENT and DEFAULT STORAGE are system
generated.
• You can create more than one undo tablespace
but only one of them can be active at any
given time.
That’s it for today hope you enjoyed watching.
