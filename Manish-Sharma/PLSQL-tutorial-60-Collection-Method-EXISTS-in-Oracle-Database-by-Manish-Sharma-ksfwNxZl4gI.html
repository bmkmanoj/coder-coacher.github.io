again i am manish from
rebellionrider.com
today in this PL sequel tutorial we will
learn the second function in collection
method series and debt will be exists
let's start the tutorial with a quick
intro of the collection matter exists in
Oracle database connection method exists
checks the existence of an element at a
specific index in a collection if it
finds the specified element then it
returns true otherwise it returns false
let's do an example to understand the
concept so here we have declared a local
nested table this is the same less
suitable which we created in PL sequel
tutorial 51 let's move ahead
here we have initialized our nested
table by inserting three entries using
the collection variable Co l underscore
var underscore one so now we have a
nested table which has data at index one
two and three let's write the execution
section in this section we will see how
to use collection method exist to find
the existence of the elements here in
this code we are checking if we have
anything at index one or not if
collection function exists returns true
then it will execute the first part of
the if-else statement and will show the
data otherwise it will execute the else
part of the if else statement let's
execute here is our result before moving
ahead let me take a quick second to ask
you to subscribe if you haven't already
also make sure to smash that thumbs up
button and like the video your every
single like means a lot to me and keeps
me motivated for doing more such videos
having said that now let's move ahead
that is how you can check the element at
a specific index without reversing the
whole collection along with checking the
element at an index you can also take
advantage of this function in inserting
the data into a cell of a collection and
that too without overwriting the already
existing data suppose you want to insert
a data into a specific index but you are
not sure whether that index is already
holding some data or not in case if it
is holding any then you don't want to
override it let's see how we can do that
but before that let's close this script
output and delete this execution section
done
in this code we are checking if we have
any data stored at index 4 using exist
function if there exists an element at
index 4 then the first part of if-else
statement will execute which will show
the data stored in the index but if
there is no data at index 4 then the
else part of if-else statement will
execute in the earth´s part we have
three statements first statement is a
simple output statement with a custom
string in the second statement we are
extending the collection using the
extend collection method we will discuss
this collection method extend in another
video anyways in the third statement we
are inserting the data which is
spider-man into the collection at index
4 let's execute the code and see what
happens here is the output so these are
a few of the ways of using exist method
now let your creativity fly and find out
various other ways to use this function
if you find something new then comment
down low and let me know meanwhile give
this video a thumbs up also by sharing
this tutorial you can help others in
learning and our channel in growing so
go ahead and share this video on your
social media this is the tutorial on
collection method exist in Oracle
database thanks for watching this is
