rebellionrider.com so in the previous
tutorial we learnt how to create cursor
for loop with simple explicit cursor now
what if we have parameterised cursor
hence today in this PL sequel tutorial
we will learn how to create cursor for
loop with parameterised cursor in Oracle
database thérèse PL sequel tutorial
requires knowledge of parametrized
cursor and cursor for loop beforehand
and fortunately I have done video
tutorials as well as blocks on both the
topics find the links in the description
now that I have notified you about it
let's move ahead and do an example of
cursor for loop with parameterised
cursor in Oracle database
I think we should put some space here
okay now it's good here in this
declaration section I declared a
parameterised cursor with named CU r
underscore rebellionrider cursor name is
user defined and you can give whatever
name you want to your cursor this cursor
is taking a single parameter var
underscore e underscore ID which is of
number data type and the Select
statement over which this explicit
cursor is created is returning the data
from employee ID and first name column
of employees table where employee ID is
greater than whatever number you will
pass as argument to the parameter var
underscore e underscore ID of the cursor
now let's move a step ahead and write
the execution section of this PL sequel
block and learn how to pass argument to
the parameter of the cursor using cursor
for loop
here is our declaration section pretty
simple isn't it just four lines of code
let's see what's happening here
loop statement starts with keyword four
followed by loop index loop index is a
record type variable you can name your
loop index whatever you want followed by
that we have another keyword in using
which we are specifying our cursor name
over which we want this cursor for loop
to work here you can see this time I
have supplied a value 200 right after
the name of the cursor this value is the
argument for the parameter var
underscore e underscore ID of our cursor
which we have declared this means if you
have a parameterised cursor and want to
work with it using cursor for loop then
you can specify the value for your
parameter right after the name of your
cursor into the loop statement don't
forget to enclose the values of your
parameter into the parentheses that's
all you have to do anyways next we have
another keyword loop followed by that we
have an output statement which is
printing the values back on the output
screen at the end we have a result
phrase and loop which indicates the
ending of this cursor for loop and that
keyword and indicates the end of this
whole PL sequel block now let's try to
execute this block and see whether we
will have the employee ID and first name
of all the employees who have employee
ID greater than 200 or not here is our
desired output that is just a simple
example to demonstrate you how to work
with cursor for loop when we have
parameterised cursor though this concept
looks very small but it is important
from both oracle certification as well
as interview prospective hope you
enjoyed watching and learn something new
today don't forget to check the blog on
the same topic to learn how to bypass
the declaration section using inline
cursor declaration within the cursor for
loop find the link in the description
that is for today on cursor for loop
with parameterised cursor do make sure
to give this video a big thumbs up you
can send me your love support and
feedback either in the comment section
down below or tweet me at rebellion
writer find all my
contact details in the description
section is stay tuned I will be back
with another interesting tutorial soon
