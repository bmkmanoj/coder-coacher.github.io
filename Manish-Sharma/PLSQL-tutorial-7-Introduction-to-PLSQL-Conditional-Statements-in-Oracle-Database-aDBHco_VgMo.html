rebellionrider.com with another PL
sequel tutorial today's tutorial is
about conditional control statements
statements which allow you to control
the execution flow of the program
depending on a condition in other words
the statements in the program are not
necessarily executed in a sequence
rather one or other group of statements
are executed depending on the evaluation
of a condition in Oracle PL sequel we
have two types of conditional control
statements which are if statements and
case statements both these statements
can be further divided into different
forms for example if statements has
three different forms if then if then
else if then else if and cases statement
has two different forms such as simple
case and surged case I have already done
two different tutorials explaining both
simple and search case statements I
highly recommend you to watch them
linked for those like always are in the
description box by the way both these
tutorials got really good response from
you guys so a huge thanks for that as
key statements have already been
discussed in my previous tutorials does
this time we will concentrate on if a
statement and in coming tutorials we
will discuss all the three forms one
video at a time so that you can
understand things in much better way
with this I will wind up this
introduction of conditional control
statements stay tuned in next tutorial
we will learn if-then statement till
then take care
