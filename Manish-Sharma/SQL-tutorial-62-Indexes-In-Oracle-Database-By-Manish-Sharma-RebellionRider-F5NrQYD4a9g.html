again this is manish from
rebellionrider.com
and today in this sequel tutorial we
will learn about another database object
called indexes so let's start the
tutorial with a brief intro of indexes
in Oracle database indexes our database
objects which you can create over one or
more columns of a table creating an
index over columns of a table can help
you in increasing the performance of
data retrieval indexes are logically and
physically independent of the data thus
you can drop and create indexes with no
effect on the tables or other indexes so
all applications continue to function
even after you drop an index let's take
a look at the syntax this is syntax for
creating a b-tree index or b3 index is
an ordered list of values divided into
ranges b3 index associate a key with row
or range of rules as well as provide an
excellent retrieval performance for a
wide range of queries here in this
syntax between create an index keyword
we have an optional parameter which is
unique if you specify this parameter
while creating an index then your index
will ensure that the value of the column
over which you have created this index
continue neke values and restrict the
duplicate column insertion next we have
index name which is user-defined and you
can give whatever name you want to your
index then we have on keyword and
followed by on keyword we have to
specify the name of the table along with
its column over which you want to define
your index and at the end we have
tablespace clause this Clause is
optional and using it we can specify the
name of the tablespace in which we want
to store our index it's always a good
practice to store your indexes in a
different tablespace from your tables
for performance reason hope syntax is
clear now so let's move ahead and see
some examples for the demonstration I
will use my demo table this table has
two columns demo ID and demony where
column demo IDs numeric column and
column demo name is capable of handling
variable character string also I have
already populated this table although it
has few rows but it will do for now
since we only need it for the
demonstration next I will create an
index on demo ID column of this table
let's write they come on let's close
this query result okay let's write they
come on if you want to make this index
our unique index then you can add unique
keyword in between create and index
let's execute unique index created as we
have created a unique index our demo ID
column that means the value which you
will insert in this column must be
unique let's try inserting a row in this
table and see what happens if we insert
any duplicate value let's execute one
row inserted now let's try inserting the
same value once again and see what
happens we got this error saying unique
constraint violated see that's how we
can create an index or say unique index
now let's move ahead and see another
type of index which is function based
index similar to the b3 index we can
also create a function based index a
function based index computes the value
of a function or expression involving
one or more columns and store it in the
index function based index are efficient
for evaluating statements that contain
function in their where clause
the database only use the function based
index when the function is included in a
query let's see how to create an
function based index suppose we have
this query let me close this script
output okay here in this query we have
used upper function in where class and
index can be created over this upper
function in order to improve the
performance of this query so when the
function based index is included in your
query then it is used by the database
let's write the query and see how to
create a function based index let's
execute index created that's how we can
create a function based index hope you
enjoyed this video and learnt how to
create a b-tree index and function based
index please hit the like button if you
find this video useful also subscribe
for more interesting videos on Oracle
database I will be back soon with
another informative tutorial till then
take care guys this is money from
