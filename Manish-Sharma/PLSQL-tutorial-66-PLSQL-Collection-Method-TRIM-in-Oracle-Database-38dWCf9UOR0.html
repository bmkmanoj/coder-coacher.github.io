rebellionrider.com till so far we have
seen how to extend a collection and
delete elements from the collection now
it's time to learn how to trim elements
from the PL sequel collection so without
further ado let's start the tutorial and
learn what PL sequel collection method
trim is trim is an overloaded procedure
using which you can remove one or more
elements from the end of the collection
and spial sequel collection method trim
is an overloaded procedure
thus we can call it by two different
ways these two different calls of trim
procedure are first trim procedure
without parameter if we use trim
procedure without any parameter then it
will remove only one element from the
end of the collection with which it is
used
second trim procedure with one parameter
trim procedure called bypassing one
argument will remove number of elements
from the end of the collection as
specified by the parameter you are
looking confused don't worry we will do
the examples of both these procedure
calls but before that I want to take a
quick second and ask you to like this
video as this will motivate me to keep
doing my work and produce more such
videos for you and if you are new here
on this channel then go ahead and
subscribe that being said let's do the
examples of PL sequel collection method
trim in Oracle database
in the first example we will see how to
use stream procedure without parameter
with nasty table so here we have our
nasty table we also have five numeric
elements stored into this table for
those of you who have no idea what is a
nested table then go ahead and watch PL
sequel tutorial 51 link is in the
description now next we will write the
execution section of this program in
this section using for loop we will
print the elements of this nested table
this is just to ensure that everything
is ok and all the elements are properly
stored let's do it
on execution this will print all the
five elements on the output screen if
there is no error let's execute so here
we have a result which shows all the
five elements of our nested table as you
can see we haven't used the PL sequel
collection method trim yet
so let's modify this code and use the
trim method here we have our collection
method trim like other collection
methods to use the trim method we use
the dot notation where we first write
the name of the collection object which
is NT underscore obj followed by the dot
and then the name of the method which
has trim we use the trim method before
the loop because in this way we can
easily see whether collection method
trim has done its work or not if this
procedure has trimmed the element from
the end of the collection then we will
see only four elements in the output
otherwise we will either have an error
or all five elements let's execute and
see the result here we are we only have
four elements in our output this shows
that PL sequel collection method trim
without parameter will remove one
element from the end of the collection
now let's move ahead and do the second
example
as I said above trim procedure called
bypassing one argument will remove the
number of elements from the end of the
collection as specified by the parameter
that argument must be a valid integer
number also it should not be greater
than the maximum number of elements that
your collection has let's see the time
and use the same code by modifying it
for the demonstration here we have
modified the collection method trims
procedure call and passed numeric three
as the argument which means on execution
this procedure call will remove the last
three elements from our collection
nested table let's execute and see the
result here is our result as you can see
this result set consists of only the
first two elements of our collection the
last three elements have been removed
successfully that is how we use PL
sequel collection method trim in Oracle
database before winding up this tutorial
let's learn one more thing
can you guess what will happen if we
pass the argument greater than the total
number of elements of the collection
let's try and see the total number of
elements that our collection nested
table is holding right now is 5 now
let's try to pass 6 as argument in the
collection method trim and see the
result
here we are that's for sure
that we are going to get an error but
the question here is that what will be
that error that's what we are going to
find out now let's execute and see this
is the result here we got an error which
is Aurra - zero six five double three
subscript beyond count I showed you this
because you can expect such questions in
your certification so I thought why not
show it to you right here you can find
out more such questions and their
answers on the blog whose link is in the
description we'd have you checked out
the video I upload it on my Facebook
page here it is hey guys as you know the
current series on PS equal collection
which we are doing on a youtube channel
is about to get finished when what
tutorial to go and do go ahead and watch
the full video and don't forget to
comment your suggestions link again is
in the description anyways with this
tutorial you have mastered the PL sequel
collection API I hope you have gone
through all the tutorials of this series
and if not then what are you waiting for
go ahead and do it right away that
tutorial on collection method trim is
the last one in the PL sequel collection
series hope you learned something new do
