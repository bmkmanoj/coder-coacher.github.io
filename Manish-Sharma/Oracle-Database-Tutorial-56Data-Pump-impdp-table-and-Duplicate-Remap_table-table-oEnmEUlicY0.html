I am Manish from RebellionRider.com.
Till so far we have learnt how to export tablespace,
full database, tables and schemas and in today’s
Oracle Database Tutorial we are going to learn
how to import tables using impdp Data Pump
import. In this tutorial you will also learn
how to rename a table during an impdp data
pump import operation which means how you
can make a copy of a table using impdp import.
So without further ado let’s start the tutorial.
Before moving ahead I would suggest you to
watch tutorial 55 on how to export tables
for the better understanding of the concept.
Ok
First I will connect to my database using
HR user. Here I am, Here in this HR schema
I have a table by the name of SUPERHEROS and
this table has rows of data also, let me quickly
show you, as you can see here.
To save the time I have already exported this
table. And here is the location of the dump
file and log file created by expdp data pump
export. We will use this superhero.dmp dumpfile
to perform the import of superheros table.
You can watch tutorial 55 if you want to learn
how to export tables.
Now to demonstrate how to import a table using
impdp data pump import let’s first drop
this table superheros. For that let’s come
back to our SQL Developer and now we will
drop the table superheros
SQL&amp;gt;DROP TABLE superheros;
Table superheros droped
Let’s execute this SELECT query to ensure
that table has been dropped. Error in result
proves that the table superheros is droped.
Now let’s come to the command prompt and
try to recover this superheros table by importing
it using impdp data pump import.
Here we are. Keep in mind that here you can
only execute impdp data pump import on command
prompt so if you are on SQL prompt then come
out of it first and then write your import
command. As you can see I am already on the
C prompt. Let’s write the impdp import command.
C:\&amp;gt; impdp hr/hr@ORCL DIRECTORY=exp_table
DUMPFILE=superhero.dmp LOGFILE=sh_imp.log
TABLES=superheros;
Let’s take a deep look at this command.
If you have watched my previous tutorial then
you must be aware of most of these parameters.
But still
Command starts with impdp which is a data
pump utility provided by oracle to load the
data from dump files created by expdp export
utility in the target system. Mind here impdp
data pump import utility can only import or
load the data from dump files not form any
other files.
Next is the login of the user who wants to
import the data. And here in our case it’s
HR
Next we have directory parameter. Using this
parameter you specify the default location
where impdp data pump import can find the
dump files to import the data.
As I have already explained in the previous
data pump export tutorials that the value
of this parameter is always a directory object
rather than the path of the directory. In
my case the value is exp_table which is a
directory object which I created in my tutorial
55 on how export tables.
Next parameter is Dumpfile. Using this parameter
you specify the name of the dumpfile from
which impdp can import the data you want.
In our case this data is the table superhero.
Similarly using logfile parameter you can
generate and specify the name of your log
file. Log files are created by impdp import
utility. I always recommend you to use this
parameter because if there is an error, then
you can track them using log files.
And the last parameter is Tables. Using this
parameter you can specify the names of tables
you want to import from the dumpfile. For
example here I have specified Superheros which
is the name of the table which we want to
import.
Ok let’s come back to our command prompt,
here we are , let’s execute this command.
Import is successful now let’s come back
to our SQL developer and see whether we got
our super hero tables with all its data or
not.
Let’s again execute our first query where
we are selecting everything from our table
suoerheros
As you can see we have successfully imported
our superhero table using impdp data pump
import. Ok
These are the simple steps explaining how
to import a table. Next I will show you, How
you can rename a table using IMPDP data pump
import.
Say you already have a table and you don’t
want to delete it and still want to import
the same table with a different name or in
simple words you want to make a copy of the
table.
In this case what you can do is that you can
use REMAP_TABLE parameter provided by impdp
data pump import utility of oracle database.
Let’s see how we can rename a table using
REMAP_TABLE parameter of impdp data pump import.
For the demonstration I will again perform
the import of the same table superhero with
the different name say superheros_copy.
For that we again have to use our command
prompt, here we are
Command for importing the table superhero
will remain the same. We just have to add
an additional parameter remap_table. Let’s
see how.
C:\&amp;gt; impdp hr/hr@ORCL DIRECTORY=exp_table DUMPFILE=superhero.dmp
LOGFILE=sh_imp.log TABLES=superheros REMAP_TABLE=hr.superheros:superheros_copy;
REMAP_TABLE parameter takes two values first
is the old name of the table along with the
schema and second is the new name of the table
which you want to give. Both the names are
separated using colons.
Let’s execute. Import is successful. Now
let’s jump over to SQL Developer and see
whether we have successfully imported the
superhero table with a new name or not.
DESC superheros_copy;
Here is the structure of the table which indicates
that we have imported the superhero table
with new name superhero copy.
Let’s check the data inside the table.
SELECT * FROM superheros_copy;
And here is the data that means we have successfully
imported the entire superheros table with
the data.

in this tutorial and in depth knowledge of
this concept you can visit my blog. Link is
