again i am manish from
rebellionrider.com this is the second
tutorial in AI trading statement series
this tutorial will help you in learning
the concepts of while loop in oracle PL
sequel i would suggest you to watch the
previous tutorial where we discussed the
intro of loops and learnt the concept of
simple loop with example in p and sequel
that said let's start to Reese tutorial
concept of why loop is not new to the
programming world and almost all the
programming languages support this
concept while loop is not the exception
to other loops it also executes block of
a statement several time but this loop
is best usable when number of iteration
to be performed are unknown let's first
take a look at the syntax of while loop
in PS equal and then we will do the
examples
unlike other complex programming
language the syntax of while loop in PL
sequel is comparatively easy the
keyboard while marks the beginning of
the loop followed by the world condition
which will serve your test condition
which will get evaluated either to be
true or to be false and at the end of
our first line we have another keyword
which is loop the statements 1 through n
are sequence of executable statements
which define the body of the loop and at
the end we have a result phrase and loop
which indicates the ending of the while
loop in order to execute the body of the
loop the test condition needs to be true
if this condition is evaluated to be
true then control will jump inside the
loop and execute whatever statements it
has this hydration will continue until
the test condition becomes false as soon
as the test condition is evaluated to be
false the control will come out of the
loop and executes the statement which
immediately followed the loop since the
while condition is evaluated before
entering the loop therefore it is
possibility that the loop body may not
execute at all hope this made the
concept of while loop clearer to you now
let's do some examples today we will do
two examples in the first example we
will print the multiplication table of
19 again using while loop and in the
second example we will see how to handle
boolean variable in test condition of a
while loop so let's start with our first
example
in the previous tutorial we did the same
example and required to write few extra
line of course to terminate the loop
using exit and exit when clause
however with while loop we do not need
that it will terminate as soon as the
test condition becomes false in this
example we have declared two variables
we underscore counter which will serve
as a counter and variable v underscore
result which will hold the result of
multiplication down in the execution
section we have our while loop the first
statement inside the loop body is an
arithmetic expression which will perform
the multiplication of our table and will
store the result in V underscore result
variable second statement is an output
statement which will print the result of
the multiplication in a formatted manner
and the third statement is an update
statement which will update the counter
with each iteration this while loop will
keep on iterating until the counter is
less than 10 or it becomes equal to 10
once the value of the counter becomes 10
the while loop will terminate and
execute the first statement immediately
outside the loop body this in our case
is our last DBMS underscore output
statement so let's execute and see the
result
and here is our multiplication table of
19 now let us do the second example and
see how to handle boolean expression as
the test condition for the demonstration
I will write a very simple code which
will print the counting from 1 to 10 but
before that let's close this script
output and clear the screen
again in this program I have declared
two variables we underscore test and we
enter score counter the variable V
underscore test is of boolean type and
we set its value to true this boolean
variable will serve as a test condition
in the while loop the second variable is
just a counter whose value we are going
to print down in the execution section
we have our while loop as you can see
the variable V underscore test is
working as a test condition here for
this loop as its value set to true does
it makes a loop I treat until its value
changes and set to false unfortunately
this isn't going to happen by itself as
we will have to write a code for that
otherwise it will become an infinity
loop anyways let's move ahead
the first statement of this loop is an
automatic expression which will
increment the counter by 1 on each
iteration of the loop in the second
statement we are simply printing the
value of RB underscore counter variable
then we have the N loop followed by
another output statement the thing about
boolean expression in loop is said we
have to write the code which will change
its value to false and terminate the
loop failing to do so can make your loop
an infinity loop in our program we
haven't written that code which means
that if we execute this program then the
execution will keep on printing till we
halt it manually so let's add that code
just add this if then block right before
the ending of the loop now as soon as
the counter will become equal to ten the
value of V underscore test will change
and set on false which will terminate
the loop so let's execute and here is
the counting from one to ten now I want
you to write a program which will print
the multiplication table of nineteen or
any other number using boolean
expression for hints you can refer to my
blog on the same topic hope you enjoyed
watching please give this video a thumbs
up also help your friend learning the
concept by sharing this video with them
or you can share this video on your
social more importantly don't forget to
subscribe thanks for watching we'll be
back soon with another tutorial till
then take care this is manish from
