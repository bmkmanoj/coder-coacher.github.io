rebellionrider.com where we make
learning SQL pl/sql and oracle database
one to this tutorial is about calling
notations for PL sequel subroutine since
in last couple of series we are learning
the concepts of PL sequel subroutines
such as functions and stored procedures
thus it becomes mandatory to talk about
their calling notations so what is a
calling notation calling notation is a
way of providing values to the
parameters of a subroutine such as PL
sequel function or a stored procedure in
Oracle PL sequel there are three types
of calling notations these are
positional notation named notation and
mixed calling notation we are going to
do all of the above mentioned calling
notations one by one let's start with
the first one which is positional
notation in positional notation you have
to specify the value for each formal
parameter in a sequential manner this
means that you have to provide the
values for the formal parameters in the
same order as they are declared in the
procedure or in the function this is the
same notation which we have used in the
previous tutorial where we learnt how to
create PL sequel functions and
procedures so what if we have already
seen the example of positional notation
does that mean I'm going to jump onto
the next calling notation definitely not
we don't do this here on this channel I
am going to do an example demonstrating
the positional notation right here right
now just for you but before that here I
have used the term formal parameter if
it confuses you then you must read this
blog on my website where I have
explained the concepts of formal and
actual parameter in detail you can find
the link on your screen as well as in
the description of the video that being
said let's move ahead and do the example
we have already seen this same example
in the previous PL sequel tutorial on
how to create a stored procedure with
parameters except that this time I have
added an extra DBMS output statement
anyways this particular procedure has
two parameters first is the EP
underscore ID and second is SEL
underscore raise in the positional
notation we have to supply the values to
these two parameters in the same manner
in which they are declared let's see how
first let's compile and create this
procedure procedure created successfully
let's write the procedure call statement
using the execute keyword but before
that let's close this script output
great here we are as you can see right
after the procedure name EMP underscore
cell I have specified two values these
two values are called actual parameters
the first value which is 40 is
corresponding to first formal parameter
which is DEP underscore ID and second
value is corresponding to the second
parameter which is SEL underscore reef
switching their positions will affect
the result and might lend you with an
error so avoid that now suppose you have
a subroutine with parameters some of
those parameters are mandatory but some
of them are optional and you want to
pass the values to only the mandatory
ones we cannot do this with positional
calling notation because in positional
calling notations we have to provide
values to all the parameters according
to their position so now in such a case
what are our options one is that we can
take advantage of named calling notation
so what is this named calling notation
named calling notation lets you pass
values to the formal parameters using
their name this will in turn let you
assign values to only required or save
mandatory parameters in order to assign
values to the formal parameters using
their names
we use Association operator it is a
combination of equal to sign and greater
than sign we write the name of the
formal parameter to the left-hand side
of the operator and the value which you
want to assign to the right-hand side of
the operator let's do an example and
learn how to use a named calling
notation for calling a subroutine let's
write a fresh code but for that we have
to clear the screen there we go
here we have a very simple function
which is taking three parameters and
returning there so among these three
parameters two are mandatory and one is
optional with a default value 0 in case
of positional notation when we call this
function it becomes mandatory for us to
pass values to all these parameters not
doing so will raise an error and an
error is at error
did you see that thing error terror no
nevermind let's move ahead in the
execution section we have three DBMS
output statements and a written class
these three DBMS output statements in
the execution section are to add more
clarity and show you how values are
getting assigned to the formal
parameters during the function call
let's try to call this function using
positional notation first let's do one
thing let's open a separate worksheet
and then write the function call
statement here we are
let's compile and error one more try
nope again error there is no way to omit
that optional parameter in positional
calling notation of a subroutine
now let's try to call this function
using named calling notation but first
let's close this script output and clear
the screen
okay great
to make function call using named
notation clearer I made some changes
into the anonymous blog here I have a
variable var underscore result in which
I am assigning the value returned by our
function ad now you can watch my PL
sequel tutorial 39 for in-depth
knowledge of how to create functions as
you can see in the function call I have
assigned numeric 5 to the third
parameter and 2 to the first parameter
and I have not assigned any value to the
second parameter which is var underscore
two so what do you guys think will it
work this time or give us an error like
the previous rise let's execute and find
out no problem this time function is
executed successfully and here is the
result in the result you can see that
numeric two is assigned to the first
parameter var underscore one and numeric
five is assigned to the third parameter
var underscore three and second
parameter uses the default value which
we have assigned during the creation of
the function and in the end we have the
result of all these values using the
same V you can call the stored procedure
to now that's how you can take advantage
of named calling notation especially
when you want to call a subroutine by
passing values to selectively
non-official parameters only you can
head over to my blog and learn about how
to call subroutines using mixed calling
notation in Oracle database along with
more in-depth knowledge of all the above
concepts which we have discussed in
today's video that's it for this video
