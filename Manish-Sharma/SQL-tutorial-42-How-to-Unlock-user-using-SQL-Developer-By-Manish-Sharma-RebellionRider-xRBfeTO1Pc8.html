Welcome back once again I am Manish from RebellionRider.com
In my previous tutorial I have shown you the
traditional way of unlocking a user using
ALTER USER command and today I will show you
how to unlock a user using SQL Developer tool.
So without further ado let’s jump onto today’s
SQL tutorial.
As I have already mentioned in my previous
tutorial that to unlock or to perform any
user management task in oracle database you
either need to have “Alter user system privilege”
or log on to your database using sys user
with sysdba privileges.
Like always I am going to log on to my database
using sys user with sysdba privileges.
And for that I have already created a connection
with sys user here in my SQL Developer by
the name of sys @localhost.
In my tutorial 38 I have explained how to
make connection using sys user.
You can watch that tutorial, link is in the
description box.
So let’s connect to our database using this
connection.
For that simply right click and select the
connection and choose connect.
After doing this just double click and expand
your Sys connection.
This will open up the tree structure of all
the database objects owned by our sys user.
From all these objects we have to choose the
“other users” which is the last one in
the list.
Now double click and expand this “other
users” folder.
Now you will be able to see the list of all
the users created in your database.
Some of them are created by database and some
of them are created by you.
In my case most of the users are from oracle
sample schemas.
By the way I have done a video series on how
to create a user where I explained different
ways of creating users.
If you want you can watch them.
Links are in the description box.
From this list, choose the user which you
want to unlock.
For the demonstration purpose I am going to
use user SH as I have never worked with this
user and have never unlocked it.
Using the steps which I am going to perform
to unlock the SH user you can unlock any users.
Steps are the same
Now right click the user which is SH in my
case and select EDIT USER.
This will open up an “Edit User” wizard.
Using this “Edit User” wizard you can
change any of the settings of the user, but
for this tutorial we will concentrate on how
to unlock this user.
If you can see here on the first tab of this
wizard, we have three checkboxes from which
second one is “account is locked” which
by default is checked which indicates that
the user is locked and not accessible.
To unlock the user you need to un-check this
box.
If you have forgotten the password or you
don’t know the default password or you are
unlocking sample user accounts for the first
time then I highly recommend you to set the
password here.
Otherwise you won’t be able to login.
So I am going to set the password for SH account
as it’s sample user accounts and I am unlocking
it for the first time and I have no idea what’s
its default password.
A quick tip for you,
If you are a DBA and your user informs you
that his or her account has expired and locked
then let this “password expired” checkbox
remain checked.
By doing so oracle engine will ask your user
to change the password on next login attempt
and this will let your user set his or her
desired password for the account.
In my case I am the only user of the account
and have already set the password so I don’t
think I need to set the password again thus
I will uncheck this password expired checkbox.
Now click apply
Successful processed SQL command.
Click close
Means our user is now unlocked.
Let’s try to login using this SH user.
For that I will again use the command prompt.
Let me show you the user.
Here we go.
Our account is unlocked and ready for use.
Using the same steps which I have shown you
in this tutorial you can unlock any user of
your database.
