again i am manish from
rebellionrider.com this is the third and
the last tutorial in alternative the
statement in PL sequel series it is
about for loop in PL sequel because of
its simplicity and easy to use behavior
this loop has warned the heart of
million and has become the most widely
used loop in programming in PL sequel we
have two types of for loops numeric for
loop and cursor for loop today we will
concentrate only on numeric for loop
cursor for loop will be discussed when
we will do the concepts of cursors in
future videos anyways let's come back to
our tutorial for loop unlike while loop
for loop allows you to execute the block
of statements repeatedly for a fixed
number of time whereas while loop is
better suited when the number of
iterations are unknown and here is the
syntax of numeric for loop the first
line of this Intex is the loop statement
where keyword 4 marks the beginning of
the loop followed by loop counter which
is an implicit index integer variable
this means you do not need to define
this variable in declaration section
also it will increment itself by one
implicitly on each iteration of your for
loop unlike the other loops where we
have to define the loop counter and have
to write the update statement to
increment that counter then again we
have keywords in and reverse keyword in
is mandatory and must be present every
time you define the for loop theme is
not true with keyword reverse that
keyword reverse is optional and is
always used in conjunction with keyword
in if keyword reverse is used and loop
will iterate in the reverse order how we
will see in the following example lower
limit and upper limit are the two
integer numbers or expressions these two
variables define the number of iteration
of the loop their value is evaluated
once in the beginning for the first
iteration and later it is defined how
many times the loop will iterate in
between these two integers we have two
dots these double dots serve as the
range operator followed by another
keyword loop then we have the body of
the loop which can either consists of
one statement or a group of complex
statements and at the end we have the
fries and loop which indicates the
ending of the loop now let's try some
examples which will help you in
understanding the concept more clearly
let's write
first example this is a very simple PL
sequel block where we only have the
execution section and inside that we
have our for loop which will print the
value of V and the score counter
variable from 1 to 10 have you noticed
that we didn't declare the V underscore
counter variable anywhere in the program
even we don't have the declaration
section here in this code this is
because variable V underscore counter is
an implicit index integer variable which
gets declared automatically with the
definition of for loop another statement
which is missing from this program is
the update statement remember update
statement which will increment the
counter by 1 in each iteration this is
again because the loop counter is
incremented implicitly by the for loop
itself as a matter of fact if you will
try to write the update statement in
your for loop then you will get an error
now let's execute this block and see
what we have in our result here is the
result value of your counter variable
from each iteration that is the counting
from 1 to 10 let's jump over our second
example now suppose you want to print
the same result but this time in reverse
order if you are walking with other
programming languages such as C Java or
any other language that you like then
first thing which comes in mind is that
we have to choose the loop definition
and loop must start from 10 and counter
must decrease by 1 with each iteration
right then my dear friend you are wrong
here in order to print the same result
in reverse order that is counting from
ten to one then the only thing which we
just have to write is a keyword reverse
nothing else let's add that keyword to
this code simply write the keyword
reverse immediately after the keyword in
that's it that's all you have to do
let's execute and here is the result
same result but in reverse order see how
easy it is to code using PL sequel
before winding up this tutorial let's do
one more example for the sake of
Internet in this example we will print
the multiplication
table of 19 using numeric for loop this
time by the way you can visit my blog
and read more about the same topic also
you can get all the course that we did
in this tutorial from there anyways
let's write the example oh I think we
should close this a script output and
clear this free okay great now let's
write the code
in this example we need one extra
variable to store the result of the
multiplication
thus we declare a variable V underscore
result with number data type in the
execution section we have our for loop
and this time inside the loop we have
only two statements first is an
arithmetic expression which will perform
the multiplication of our table and will
store the result in V underscore result
variable second is the output statement
which will display you the result in a
formatted manner let's execute and see
the result and here is the result our
multiplication table of 19 hope this
video helped you in learning the concept
of numeric for loop in Oracle PL sequel
if so then please give this video a
thumbs up also help your friend in
learning by sharing this video with them
you can also share this video on your
facebook or twitter for more regular
updates you can follow me on my social

description box thanks for watching I'll
be back soon with another interesting PL
sequel tutorial till then take care this
