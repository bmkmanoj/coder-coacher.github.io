rebellionrider.com and i am back again
with another quick and short SQL
tutorial this is second tutorial in
alter table series and twenty-second
tutorial in SQL tutorial series in the
last video we saw how to rename an
existing table and today in this SQL
tutorial we will see how to add a column
to an existing table using alter table
statement let us jump over to the SQL
Developer and start the fun if you
remember we have created a simple table
by the name of test which has only one
column test name in our last tutorial so
today we will add another column test ID
to this table test before writing and
executing the query we will first see
the syntax or DDL statement starts with
alter table where alter and table both
are key words which are followed by the
name of the table in which you want to
add a column then there is a add which
is again a keyword note here we simply
write add not add column a writing add
column raises a syntax error after add
we have our column definition which has
our new column name and data type along
with the column widths or say size now
let's create a query for adding column
test ID to our existing table test first
let me show you the structure of the
test table for that as you can see it
has only one column now let's add the
column
statements start with order table
followed by our existing table name
which is test then the keyword ad and
then our column definition we're test ID
is our column name which has number data
type and has column width 3 execute D
Kure okay table all turn let's check
again by describing our table test let
me clear so that you people can see
what's happening here okay let's check
again let me clear script output also
okay now execute now as you can see we
have two columns task name and test ID
similarly if you want to drop a column
from an existing table you can again use
alter table statement let's see how say
we want to drop column test name from
our table test let me clear this script
output alter table followed by our table
name which is test and then drop table
which is an action you want to perform
on the table and then the name of the
column which you want to draw that's it
execute table test all turn let me
describe our table test once again so
that you can see the structure of the
table as you can see now we have only
one column test ID you can visit my
website to read more such topic and you
can download this SQL script from my
website again link is in the description
box I share all the resources used in my
tutorial using copy cloud you can also
join copy cloud and get 15 GB lifetime
free cloud storage you can earn extra 5
GB by using my referral link which means

total 20 GB lifetime free cloud storage
you can find the referral link in the
description box as well as on my website
