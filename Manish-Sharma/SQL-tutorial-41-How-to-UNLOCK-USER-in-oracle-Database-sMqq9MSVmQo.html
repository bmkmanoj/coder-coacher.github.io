I am Manish from RebellionRider.com
And I am back once again with another SQL tutorial. 
This particular topic is on huge
public demand. Today we will learn how to
unlock a user in oracle database.
You can message, tweet or comment your feedback
and suggestions to me. For that you can follow
me on my social networking all the links are
in the description box.
So without further ado let’s start today’s
tutorial.
You can find yourself in many tricky situations.
For example a situation can arise when you
are just a beginner installing or creating
a database and you forget to unlock the sample
schema such as HR, OE or Scott. Another situation
that you can find yourself in is when you
are a DBA and your user informs you that his
or her account has expired and locked.
In this tutorial I will explain to you about
how to deal with these situations where the
user gets locked out of the database. So,
just sit back and enjoy!
First of all you will either need “Alter
user system privilege” or you will have
to log on to your database as sys user with
sysdba privileges to unlock a user in oracle
database.
I am going to use command prompt for the demonstration
of how to unlock a user in this video. Feel
free to use SQL Developer or Linux terminal.
Steps are the same.
And for the better understanding of this concept
I have locked my HR user and I will demonstrate
how you can unlock this HR user.
so let’s start
First we need to set the SID.
for that you can write
ohk let's check 
so SID set on ORCL
In my case sid is ORCL, in your case it can
be different.
But if you are on Linux machine then before
setting the SID you people need to EXPORT
the sid first.
Let me try to log on to my database using
the HR user
Sqlplus hr/hr;
As you can see I got an error saying “the
account is locked”.
So now we will try to unlock this HR account
For that I will log on to my database using
sys user with sysdba privileges
Sqlplus sys/oracle as sysdba
Let me show you the user.
Show user;
So we are successfully logged on using sys
user.
Next we will unlock the database for that
we need to write a very simple alter user
SQL command. Let me show you how.
ALTER USER
Just write alter user both are the Oracle
keywords and then write the name of the user
which you want to unlock. In our case its
HR
ALTER USER hr
If you want to reset the password then include
IDENTIFIED BY clause followed by the password.
This is optional. If you just want to unlock
the account without changing the password
then skip this identified by clause.
But I would recommend resetting the password
if you are unlocking the account for the first
time. For example if you are installing or
creating a database and you forget to unlock
the sample schema such as HR.
I am going to change my password of HR account
from hr to say manish.
ALTER USER hr IDENTIFIED BY password
Now the most important part of the alter user
query is the ACCOUNT clause.
ALTER USER hr IDENTIFIED BY password ACCOUNT
unlock;
ACCOUNT clause has two flags lock and unlock.
You can use both the flags accordingly. For
example in our case we wanted to unlock the
hr user thus we used unlock flag here if we
wanted to lock the account then we would have
used LOCK flag in place of UNLOCK.
Now execute the query;
User altered.
Similarly you can unlock any user in oracle
database. You can also follow the same steps
to change the password of any user account
of oracle database.
So our HR user has unlocked. For the demonstration
once again I’ll try to log on to database
using HR user.
As you can see now we are connected to our
database using HR user.
Let me show you the user once. So as you can
see the user from which we are connected to
our database right now is HR
