rebellionrider.com and i am back once
again with another PL sequel tutorial
this tutorial is all about PL sequel
collection method extent we have seen a
small and brief introduction to
procedure extend in PL sequel tutorial
55 but today we will learn about it in
detail so sit back and enjoy the video
you
before doing the example
what is connection procedure extend in
Oracle database collection method extent
is an overloaded PL sequel procedure
which is used for appending elements to
the collection as it is an overloaded
procedure
thus it can be called in three different
ways first extend procedure call without
any argument calling PL sequel
collection procedure extend without any
argument will append a single null
element to the collection second extend
procedure call with one argument calling
PL sequel procedure extend with one
argument will append the number of null
elements that you mentioned as the
argument of the extend procedure
remember that that argument must be a
valid integer value third extend
procedure call with two arguments in
this case the first argument indicates
in number of elements that will be
appended to the collection the second
argument is the index number whose value
will be copied and assigned to each of
the newly appended element of the
collection connection procedure extend
can only be used with the PL sequel
collections nested table and via raise
it cannot be used with the collection
associative array that is a brief
introduction to the PL sequel collection
matter extend now before writing the
example I just want to take a quick
second to ask you to smash that thumbs
up button and like this video also if we
are new here on this channel then go
ahead and subscribe that being said
let's write the example now
that is a very simple code in this PL
sequel block we have created a nasty
table then using the collection variable
and D underscore obj we have assigned a
numerical value to the first index of
this collection also using the output
statement we have displayed this store
value back to the user
this code seems perfect so now let's
execute and see the result and add a
subscript beyond count everything was
perfect then what went wrong we have
declared defined and initialized in
Esther table then what is missing take a
deep breath because there is nothing
wrong with this code it's just that we
have declared defined and initialized
our collection but memory for storing
data has not yet been allocated to the
collection in case if you haven't
initialized the collection then before
storing the elements into it you first
have to make slots into the memory for
holding the data to do that we use PL
sequel collection procedure xn so let's
try to solve this error by modifying the
above code we called the PL sequel
collection procedure extend right before
storing the value into the collection as
this is a simple extend procedure call
without argument thus it will append
only one null element to the collection
which means we will get the same error
if we try to add more than one element
to this collection now let's execute and
see the result here we have our desired
result now say we want to add three
elements in our collection in that case
we can use P
sequal collection procedure extent with
single parameter let's see how the first
statement of the execution block is the
procedure call with a single argument
and that argument is three this
indicates that we can append maximum up
to three elements to the collection in
the next three statements we assigned
values to the first three indexes of the
nested table and in the last three
statements we display those values back
to the user
although here we did everything
explicitly however if you want then you
can use loop to automate this work let's
execute and see the result here is our
result that's how we call a collection
procedure extent with no argument and
with one argument another way of calling
procedure is with two arguments let's
modify this code and see how to call PL
sequel collection method extent with two
arguments as you know the first argument
in the extend procedure call will be the
number of elements which will get
appended to the selection the second
argument is the index number whose value
will get copied and assigned to each of
those newly appended elements which
means we will need an index already
holding some value so that we can use
this index as our second argument so
let's start and modify the execution
section of this code
okay using the extent procedure call
without argument we just appended the
first element of the nested table also
we have stored a numeric value which is
28 to 8 now we will pass this index as a
second argument to the procedure call
let's do it
here we have our extend procedure call
with two arguments the first argument is
five which means five elements will be
appended to our nested table and the
second argument is one which means the
value assigned to the index one which is
28 will be copied and assigned to each
of those newly appended five elements to
check that we have an output statement
which will display the value stored at
the index four in our nested table let's
execute and see the result here is our
result as you can see the value is
stored at index 4 is 28 which is the
value stored at index 1 so these are all
the three ways of calling PL sequel
collection methods extend in Oracle
database you can read the blog on the
same topic for all the questions and
answers which you could face in your
certification exam or interview and if
