I am Manish from Rebellion Rider.com.
And I am back once again with another PL/SQL
tutorial.
In the previous video we learnt what are PL/SQL
Functions and the syntax for creating them.
Today in this tutorial we will learn how to
create a PL/SQL function in Oracle Database
with the help of a very simple example.
But before that I highly suggest you to check
out the previous video on the introduction
to the PL/SQL functions in the Oracle Database.
Find the link in the description.
So without further ado let’s start the tutorial
and learn how to create PL/SQL Functions.
In order to better understand the concepts
of PL/SQL functions let’s do a very simple
example where I will create a function which
will calculate the area of a circle.
Let’s start with creating the header of
the function.
--Function Header
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION circle_area (radius
NUMBER)
RETURN NUMBER IS
As I said before that in the header we define
the signature of our PL/SQL function and this
signature is pretty much self-explanatory.
So here I have created a function with the
name circle area that is taking a single parameter
of number datatype which is the radius of
the circle.
Also this PL/SQL function will return a value
of Number datatype.
Always remember that with PL/SQL function
it is mandatory to specify the return value.
And while creating the signature of the function
or the header of the PL/SQL function we only
write the datatype of the value which your
function will return.
In order to calculate the area of a circle
I will require 2 additional variables – First
one for holding the value of PI.
Since we know that PI has a universal value
which is going to be the same throughout our
PL/SQL program thus I will declare this variable
as a constant.
And the second variable will hold the calculated
value of the area.
So let’s declare these two variables.
--Declare a constatnt
pi CONSTANT NUMBER(7,3) :=3.141;
area NUMBER(7,2);
Great, so here we have a constant and a variable
declared.
You can watch my PL/SQL tutorial 5 for detailed
knowledge on Constant Declaration and Initialization.
And tutorial 2 on what are PL/SQL variables
and how to declare and initialize them.
Find all the links in the description.
So now let’s move ahead and write the execution
section of our PL/SQL function.
BEGIN
--Area of Circle pi*r*r;
area := pi * (radius * radius);
RETURN area;
END;
/
Execution section is very simple.
In the first line I have calculated the area
of the circle and assigned the value to the
variable area and in the second line, using
the RETURN keyword I have returned the value
stored into the variable area.
Always remember that whatever variable you
specify right after the RETURN keyword or
whatever value you returned from your PL/SQL
function in the execution section, must match
the datatype which you have specified into
the header of your function.
Here in my case, the variable area is of number
datatype which means my function is returning
a numeric value, and that is what I have specified
in the header of my function as well.
So let’s compile this function and check
whether we have any error or not.
FUNCTION circle area compiled which means
no error.
We are good to go.
Since now the function has been created so
we have to see how we can call it?
As the function is a named PL/SQL block and
stored into the database thus we can call
it in different sessions.
A function can be called either in a PL/SQL
block or in a SELECT statement.
However there are some restrictions on it,
which I have discussed in detail in my blog
on the same topic.
You can read it.
The Link is in the description.
So for the demonstration let’s write an
anonymous PL/SQL block and call the function
into it.
SET SERVEROUTPUT ON;
BEGIN
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE (circle_area(25));
END;
/
Let’s execute and see the result.
Here is the result.
In this anonymous PL/SQL block I directly
called our function circle area into the DBMS
OUTPUT statement.
If you want you can assign the value of this
function to a variable and then print that
value using DBMS OUTPUT statement.
Let me show you
Let me first close this script output and
clear the screen.
Great
DECLARE
vr_area NUMBER (7,3);
BEGIN
vr_area := circle_area(25);
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(vr_area);
END;
/
As you can see here in this anonymous PL/SQL
block, first I have declared a variable with
name vr_area and then assigned the value returned
by the function to this variable using assignment
operator and finally I have printed the value
of the variable vr_area using DBMS OUTPUT
statement.
Let’s execute and here is the result.
That’s it for this PL/SQL tutorial.
Hope you enjoyed watching and learnt something
new.
Do make sure to give this video a thumbs up.
You can also help others in learning as well
as support me and my channel by sharing this
video on your social media with your friends.
Most importantly.
Subscribe to my channel as we will be going
to explore new things about PL/SQL functions
in the next video.
This is the tutorial for beginners on how
to create PL/SQL function in Oracle Database.
