rebellionrider.com and i am back once
again with another SQL tutorial for you
all this is the territorial in null
function series and here we will discuss
yet another sequel function which is
called as AK either the correct
pronunciation call is a car I really
don't know
anyways so without further delay let's
get started call Zack is another
function which can help you in dealing
with null values in Oracle database here
is the syntax of the same as you can see
here unlike nvl and nvl2 functions which
we have discussed previously calls a
function can take n number of argument
and as a result it returns the first
parameter from the argument list which
is not null if in case all the arguments
are evaluated as now then this function
returns null as a result ok now let's
come to sequel developer and do some
practical queries that will help you in
understanding this concept more clearly
if it does so then please give this
video a thumbs up you can also comment
or to it and tell me how you like this
video
believe me positive comments always make
my d and bring a big smile on my face so
be shameless and write down what you
feel ok enough talking let's get back to
business I will start with a very
lightweight simple query
see I told you a simple query as we know
calls egg returns first not null
argument from the parameter list so on
execution a result should be one as one
is the first non null value in the
parameter list so let's execute and as
predicted the result is one that's
another version of calls egg function
here I'm using string as a parameter
unlike previous query where first
parameter was null here third parameter
is null on executing this query calls
egg function will return the first not
null values from the parameter list
which is a string rebellion so let's
execute and here we are these two
examples are just to make you understand
the working of this particular function
calls egg clearly now you must be
wondering what is the use of this
function in real life application so to
answer this question let's do another
example this time for the demonstration
I have created a table
and the name of this table is Avengers
yes you heard it right guys it's Avenger
and we are back again okay fine I'm
great now so let me show you the
structure of this table first and here
is the structure of this table as you
can see this table has four columns
first name last name mobile number and
landline number I also have some data in
this table let me show you that also and
here as you can see some Avengers have
both mobile and landline numbers while
some either have a mobile number or a
landline number now suppose you have to
write a query or say make a report to
list the name of all the Avengers along
with your contact number let's write a
Foursquare okay this is a correct query
but the only problem with it is that you
will not be able to get contact of all
the Avengers who doesn't have mobile
numbers as you can see here in the
result let me close this query result
now let's execute this one as you can
see similar result will be returned when
you retrieve data from column landline
there are two solution of this problem
first is to write a query which will
return the data from both landline and
mobile column let me show you how
this make your report look crappy don't
you think so the second and a neat
solution of this problem is that you can
use calls AG function on column landline
and mobile that will make your report
clearer let me show you how you can use
calls AG function with both the column
landline and mobile but before that let
me close this query result ok now let's
run the query now let's execute this
query don't you think that this result
looks better than the previous one like
this you can use this function on employ
stable or student tables while making
reports you know what you can help me in
learning more about this function for
that you just have to comment and tell
me what are the other uses of this
function how and where can we use it
also if you have any crazy query then
feel free to write that in comment box
or you can tweet me also at rebellion
right now that's it for today skies with
this I will take your leave we'll be
back soon with some more tutorials this
is your friend manish from
