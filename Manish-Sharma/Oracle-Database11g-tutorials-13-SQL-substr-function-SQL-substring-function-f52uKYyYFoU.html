is manish from rebellionrider.com today
in this Oracle database video we will
see second character manipulation
function which is SQL sub STR function
as the name suggests SQL celestia
function will return substring from the
given sources string less CD syntax as
we can see SQL service Jian function
takes three parameter first one is
sources shrink from which you want to
extract the segment second parameter is
a starting position of the substring
from the source string and the third
parameter is sub STR length which is the
length of the substring first two
parameters are mandatory to specify
while the third one is optional
so we can see SQL service tree our
function will return a substring of a
specified length from a source string
beginning at a given position first
parameter source string can be of any
data type care where care to and care
and where care to clog or end o'clock
whereas both start position and sub STR
length parameters must be number data
type the returning result of SQL service
your function is of same data type of
source string let's see some example ok
here we are on SQL Developer let's do
some example
here in this Puri URL of my website
www.drinklab.org Strack the name of my
website that is rebellion rider so if
you count the total length of the name
of the website it is 40 that's why I
have a specified 14 as my third
parameter of SQL service TR function
which is sub STR length also the name of
the website rebellion rider is starting
from the fifth position therefore I have
specified five at second parameter of
SQL sub STR function which is start pose
or starting position execute it here is
our result
rebellion rider there are few scenarios
related to SQL service TR function let's
check them first scenario when starting
position is larger than the length of
source string in this case SQL service
TR function will return null as a result
let's do an example
as you can see here I have a specified
point entry at starting position and the
total length of our source is string is
22 characters let's execute and result
is null second scene are you when this
of STR length is greater than the
sources strength in this case the
segment return is the substring from
starting position to the end of this
string for example our starting position
is at five means at the first are of
rebellion Rider and the length of
substring is set to 23 which is greater
than the length of sources string that
is 20 to execute as you can see we get a
substring from first R of rebellion
Rider till the end of sources string
third scenario when you supply numeric
or arithmetic expression or a date
instead of character s sources string to
SQL sub STR function in this scenario if
you have supplied a numeric string
instead of a character as source string
the Oracle engine cast them as a
character when they occur as a parameter
to SQL Sebastia function and if you have
supplied our semantics expression or a
date then the Oracle engine first solve
for evaluates the arithmetic expression
or the day then cause them as a
character means if you have our thematic
expression in your source string then
Oracle will first solve it and then
change or seek cast the value of its
result into character let's see some
examples
Oracle first evaluates the arithmetic
operation that is 50,000 minus seven
equals two forty nine thousand nine
hundred and ninety three and then Oracle
engine cost this result forty nine
thousand nine hundred and ninety three
into a character string means forty nine
thousand nine hundred ninety three will
be a five character string starting
position of substring is two that means
from the first nine of forty nine
thousand nine hundred and ninety three
we specified the length offs of the
string is four so we must get nine
thousand nine hundred and ninety three
as a result let's check execute here is
a result similarly if you give us this
date as your source string it first get
evaluated and then gets casted let's do
an example
I have a specified set date here without
any court so that you can see that says
date first get converted into date then
get casted into character string by SQL
server STR function let's execute here's
our result there are other scenarios
also such as what if starting position
is zero or if it's a negative number or
third parameter service TR length is
omitted for these scenarios please read
my blog I have explained everything
there you can find the link of this blog
in the video description below that's it
