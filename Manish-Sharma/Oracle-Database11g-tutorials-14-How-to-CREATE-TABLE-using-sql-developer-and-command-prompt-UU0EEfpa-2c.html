today in this oracle database tutorial
we will see how to create a table I am
doing this video on popular demands so
sorry for interrupting SQL function
series we will be continuing with SQL
function series after these SQL create
table videos okay let's start with a
brief intro bot SQL table and SQL create
table if we have to define a table in
layman language then we can say that
tables are just a collection of rows and
columns but in our DBMS tables our
database objects which helps in
organizing data into rows and columns we
can also say that SQL tables are kind of
data structure which are used by
database for efficient storage of data
to create a table in our database we use
SQL create table command SQL create
table is a type of data definition
language also known as DDL to create a
table in your schema you will require
create table a system privilege in our
future video we will see what our system
and object privileges and how to grant
them to per user today for this video
we will be using sample schema HR which
already has all the necessary privileges
okay let CD syntax create table is an
Oracle reserved word or say an Oracle
key word whereas table name and column
name are user defined so you can specify
whatever name you want to your table and
its columns every column should separate
from each other using commas Oracle has
maximum limit of thousand columns in a
table and no limits on rows there are
three different ways of creating a table
a Oracle database let's check them out
first creating a table using
command-line interface in Oracle
database for demonstrating how to create
a table in Oracle data
using CLI command line interface I will
be using command prompt if you are
working on a Linux machine then you can
use terminal steps are same in both okay
right now I am on my command prompt
first of all we have to set the s ID of
our database over which we want to walk
I have only one database with s ID orcl
so now an act to the schema in which you
want to create a table I will create a
table in HR sample schema so I am going
to connect it with HR so now we are in
our SQL prompt let's apply our creative
or syntax I am creating a table by the
name of table 1 this table has two
columns T 1 ID and first name you can
add as many column as you want
it is the keyword and our command also
evil one a user-defined name for the
table you can give whatever name you
want are the parenthesis now your first
column name I will give T 1 ID along
with a data type I will specify number
sorry
and this size with is optional if you
want to live you can expensive eyes its
size if you do not want to give then
it's okay then comma don't forget to put
this comma now second column name my
second column will be first name this is
the second and the last column for this
table we're at 2 and this time I will
give 15 as it's the last column for my
table so it's not mandatory to put the
comma OC parenthesis and terminator hit
enter that's how we create a table using
come on Punk you can check your table
structure by describe command for
just write de SC and your table name
like this PLC sorry additive name which
is table 130 table 1 head and as you can
see we created a table with column t 1
ID and first name here we have t 1 ID
and first name with the datatype number
and we're care to and this size 3 and 50
another way of creating a table is by
using graphic user interface GUI in
Oracle database to demonstrate how to
create a table using GUI we will use SQL
Developer let's open our SQL Developer I
am connected to HR schema if you do not
know how to create a connection to
database using SQL Developer please
watch my Oracle database tutorial for
that explained database connectivity
using SQL Developer and command prompt
link what this video is in the
description below so let's create a
table creating a table using SQL
Developer is very easy we do not have to
fire a single QE here let's start first
of all right click on the connection and
choose schema browser this will open a
separate schema browser pen or you can
expand your connection by clicking this
plus button and then right click on
table and choose new table however I
prefer working with the schema browser
so let's skip to schema browser pen here
from the first drop-down list you can
choose connection name and in the second
drop-down list you can choose what
database object you want to work with we
want to create a table thus I will
choose table and click this arrow
here and choose option for new table
okay we are in a create table wizard
first of all give a unique name to your
table and add some columns as well for
this click this green plus button now
give it a name I will give it t to ID
and specify data type I'll go with
number and you can give size here
I'll give three you can check this not
null column if in case you want to make
this our mandatory column you can also
specify default value and constraint if
you want to make this column a primary
key you can click here in my future
video I will show you what are these
constraints and different way of
applying them on a column in a table for
this video we will concentrate on create
table only so when you are done with all
these column let me add one more column
and this time I will give a name T to
name a where care okay and this time I
will give it a size 30
okay transfer here so when you are done
with all your column click okey that's
your table you can double click on your
table name here and can see it is the
structure this is our table that said in
my next video I will show you a third
way of creating table using Enterprise
Manager watch out for my soon to be
uploaded next video on how to create
table using Enterprise Manager you can
visit my website www.fawziacademy.com
on a little bit and here are the links
that's it for today thanks for watching
