this Oracle database video we will see
how to use concatenation operator for
combining the output of two or more
columns and how to use little character
string first of all open up your SQL
developer tool or you can use terminal
command prompt whatever you like in our
previous SQL tutorial we saw how to
retrieve data using SQL select statement
something like first name last name from
employees as you can see the result of
this query we got two independent column
values isn't it cool if we can change
this output in more user-friendly and
meaningful string don't worry in this
SQL tutorial we will see how to do this
now we are going to combine the value of
column first name and last name using
concatenation operator concatenation
operator is the binary operator provided
by Oracle X on two operands these
operands can be called up for a little
character string first people see how to
use concatenation operator for combining
column values let's see how first of all
write a select statement like select
our first column name
then concatenation operator followed by
our second column knee which is last
name from employees which is our table
name then Tom Anita execute this cutie
here is our result as you can see it's a
single column with a clumsy heading
don't worry I'll show you how to fix it
but before that there is a problem with
this result as you can see there is no
space between first and last name which
makes it clumsy too
let's fix it first to make it more
friendly just add a space between column
name as Kamiya just after concatenation
operator add a single quote and then
space and again a single quote followed
by another concatenation of return
that's it execute disk URI
here we go now it's fine
that's how we use concatenation operator
to combine column values let's see how
to use literal string say you want to
print the employee ID of mr. Douglas
round tears 199 here we are using two
string first one is the employee ID of
mr and the second one is is Douglas
Grant and 199 are the value from column
first name last name and employee ID of
database let's see how to do this write
a select statement as select single
quote and a first string which is the
employee ID of mr.
close the single good and now put
concatenation operator there our first
column name which is first name
again concatenation operator and single
quote headspace close the single quote
and put another concatenation of product
and our second column name
which is last name followed by one
another concatenation operator and a
second string single code is cross the
single quote followed by third column
name but before that another
concatenation operator and the third
column D which is employee ID from
employees which is our table and then
Terminator execute this Curie that's our
answer
okay just put a space here that's
perfect
here is our answer the employee ID of
mr. Douglas grant is 199 again as you
can see the heading of this column is
not what we want
let's fix is heading to fix the heading
of this collar you can give the alias to
this column for doing that
come here at the end of the string right
s start the double quote give whatever
heading you want like I want to give
detail close a double quote and execute
dqe effect as our answer
