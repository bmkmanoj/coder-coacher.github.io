I am Manish from RebellionRider.com.
Now is the time to move on to the next topic
in Record datatype variables in oracle database.
Thus today we will learn what cursor based
records in Oracle Database are and how to
create them?
Before jumping onto this tutorial I just want
to say that today’s PL/SQL tutorial will
require the knowledge of Database Cursors
and Record Data type variables.
Luckily, I have done videos on both the topics.
I would suggest you to check out those tutorials
first.
Find all the links in the description.
So without further ado, let’s start today’s
PL/SQL tutorial and learn “How to Create
Cursor Based Record Datatype Variables”
in Oracle Database.
So what are Cursor Based Record Datatype variables?
Cursor based records are those variables whose
structure is derived from the SELECT list
of an already created cursor.
As we know that record datatypes are composite
data structures made up of multiple fields
and in the case of Cursor based record these
fields are initialized by fetching the data
from the SELECT-LIST of the cursor that was
used to create this variable.
I know, at this point of time, this definition
sounds a little bit confusing.
But don’t worry move along and all your
confusions will disappear.
So let’s see how to create a cursor based
record variable?
The creation of cursor based record variable
involves.
• Declaration of Cursor based Record.
• Initialization of Cursor Based Record
and
• Accessing data stored into the cursor
based record variable.
Let’s start with the declaration of Cursor
based record.
In order to declare a cursor based record
first we need to have a cursor over which
we can design our record variable.
So first let’s create a cursor.
SET SERVEROUTPUT ON;
DECLARE
CURSOR cur_RebellionRider IS
SELECT first_name, salary FROM employees WHERE
employee_id = 100;
Here is our cursor.
This is the same simple explicit cursor which
we had discussed in PL/SQL tutorial 27.
So for more details on Simple Explicit Cursor
please watch that tutorial.
Now let’s use this cursor and declare our
“Cursor Based Record” variable.
var_fname cur_RebellionRider%ROWTYPE;
Here is how we declare a cursor based record.
The declaration starts with the name of the
record variable, which is completely user
defined followed by the name of an already
created cursor.
And at the end “%ROWTYPE” attribute which
indicates that we are declaring a Record Datatype
variable to the compiler.
As now we have declared our Cursor Based Record
Datatype variable, next we have to initialize
it.
So let’s see how to initialize a cursor
based record.
As we are initializing a record variable which
is based on a cursor thus we have to make
sure that we should follow the cursor lifecycle
properly.
This means that before fetching the values
from the cursor and storing them into our
Cursor Based Record variable we have to “Open”
the cursor that was used to create this variable.
Let’s see how.
BEGIN
OPEN cur_RebellionRider;
FETCH cur_RebellionRider INTO var_fname;
Here in this execution section we first opened
the cursor using which we created our record
variable, and in the next line we are initializing
it by fetching the data from the cursor.
To do so we used FETCH-INTO statement of the
cursor.
This statement is fetching the data from the
specified cursor which in our case is cur
_ Rebellion Rider and storing it into the
record variable.
So that is how we initialize a cursor based
record variable.
Now let’s move ahead and learn how to access
this stored data from our record variable.
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE (var_fname.first_name);
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE (var_fname.salary);
Here we have 2 output statements which are
displaying back the data stored into the record
variable.
As you can see the process of accessing the
data from cursor based record variable is
same as that of the table based record.
Here we also use the Dot (.) notation for
accessing the data.
In the dot notation we first write the name
of the record variable followed by a dot (.) and
then the name of the column.
In case of table based record we have to write
the name of the column of the table but in
case of cursor based record we can only write
the name of those columns of the table which
we specified in the SELECT-List of the cursor
that is used to create the variable.
These in our case are First name and salary.
So that is how we access data from the cursor
based record.
So now that we have declared and initialized
the cursor based record and have also fetched
and displayed the data back to the user.
It seems like the work of the cursor is done
here, which means we have to close this cur
_ rebellionrider cursor now.
CLOSE cur_RebellionRider;
END;
This PL/SQL block is complete.
Have you noticed that we declared only one
variable which is our “Record Based variable”
and used this single variable to display back
multiple values?
If we would have taken the traditional approach
then to do the same task we would have required
two separate variables.
Now you see!
How record variables make our lives easier.
Anyways
Let’s execute this anonymous PL/SQL block
and see the result.
Here is the output which is the first name
and salary of the employee whose employee
id is 100.
That’s it for today’s tutorial on how
to create a cursor based record data type
variable in oracle database.
Let’s wind up this tutorial with a question.
And the question is can we assign the value(s)
of one record variable to another record variable?
If you know the answer of this question then
leave a comment down below and tweet me @RebellionRider.
Stay tuned in the next tutorial we will learn
how to create a cursor record when the cursor
is returning values from multiple rows.
