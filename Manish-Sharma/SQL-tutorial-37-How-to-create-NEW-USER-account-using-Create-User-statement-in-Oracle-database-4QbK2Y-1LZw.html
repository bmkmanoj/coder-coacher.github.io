I am Manish from RebellionRider.com
And I am back once again with another SQL
tutorial and today we will learn How to create
a new user account in oracle database.
Have you guys watched my previous SQL tutorial
on How to create oracle database using DBCA?
If not then do watch it, link is in the description
box.
There are several ways of creating a new user
account in oracle database and I will show
you all of these ways one video at a time.
So today in this video tutorial we will learn
how to create new user account using CREATE
USER statement. This is the first way of creating
user account.
So let?s quickly take a look at CREATE USER
statement syntax.
CREATE USER username IDENTIFIED BY password
DEFAULT TABLESPACE tablespace TEMPERORY TABLESPACE
tablespace QUOTA size/unlimited ON tablespace_name
PROFILE profile_name PASSWORD expire ACCOUNT
lock/unlock;
In the first line we have 2 clauses Create
user and identified by, both these clauses
are mandatory.
As you can see here after CREATE USER you
have to specify the username, it totally depends
on you, whatever username you want to specify.
And then IDENTIFIED BY clause which helps
the oracle engine in authenticating the user.
There are three ways of authenticating a user
First is password: Password clause lets you
create a local user and indicates that the
user must specify password to log on to the
database. Remember here: passwords are case
sensitive.
Second is externally: By using externally
clause you can create an external user. The
authentication of these external users are
handled by external services for example your
operating system.
And third one is globally: Globally clause
lets you create a Global user. Global users
allow you to keep the authentication information
in the central Oracle Security Server, instead
of having passwords in each database to be
accessed.
And now our second line;
The first clause in the second line is Default
Tablespace. In the default tablespace you
have to specify the name of tablespace where
this user will create its object. By objects
I mean tables, indexes, synonyms etc. etc.
This is an optional clause, if you omit this
clause then all the objects created by this
user gets stored in the database default tablespace
which is ?users? tablespace in most cases.
After that we have our Temporary tablespace:
All the temporary segments created by this
user get stored here. Temporary segment such
as temporary tables; Similar to default tablespace
you have to specify the name of the temporary
table space here.
But make sure the table space you are going
to specify here must be temporary tablespace.
This is an optional clause if you omit this
clause then all the temporary objects created
by this user get stored in the database default
temporary tablespace which is ?temp? tablespace.
Don?t worry I will do the separate videos
on tablespace as soon as I complete this ?how
to create user? series
In the third line we have our QUOTA clause.
Using Quota clause you can specify the maximum
amount of space that the user is capable of
allocating in the tablespace.
In single create user statement you can have
multiple quota clause.
As you can see here our QUOTA keyword is followed
by size. You can either specify a limited
size such as 50M or 100M, M stands for Megabyte
here Or just write UNLIMITED for allocating
space without any bounds.
After the size you have to specify the name
of tablespace using ON clause.
Although it?s optional but it?s highly recommended.
*Note There will be an error if you try to
quota the space on temporary or undo tablespace.
In the 4th line
We have our profile clause. Using profile
clause you can specify the profile you want
to assign to the user. By Assigning profile
you can limit the amount of database resources
the user can use.
It?s also an optional clause hence if you
omit this clause database will assign a default
profile to your user.
In the 5th line we have PASSWORD EXPIRE Clause
This is the kind of settings which force your
user to change the password on the first login
attempt or say before the user can log in
to the database. This is also an optional
clause.
Now the 6th and the last line of the syntax
Using Account clause you can set the status
of your user account. If you set the status
on lock then oracle will create your user
account but disable its access.
Means you will have your user account but
you cannot use it.
If you set the status on UNLOCK then you are
all free to use it. Unlock means status will
be open.
By default its set on UNLOCK option.
It?s again optional if you omit this clause
then Oracle will set the status of your account
on UNLOCK which is a default state.
---~~@@@@@~~---
Hope syntax is clear to you guys. Now let?s
jump over to SQL Developer and start doing
some examples.
Before that if you want to read and have some
in-depth knowledge then you can visit my website
as well.
Ohk now we are on our SQL developer.
Now I gonna create a user with the name IRONMAN
and the password JARVIS.
Let?s write the query.
CREATE USER ironman IDENTIFIED BY jarvis DEFAULT
TABLESPACE users TEMPORARY TABLESPACE temp
QUOTA 20M ON USERS ACCOUNT UNLOCK;
Here as you can see our user name is ?ironman?
and in the IDENTIFIED BY clause we have user
authentication type as password and have set
the password as ?Jarvis?
And I have specified ?users? as the default
tablespace and ?temp? as a temporary tablespace
for our user ironman.
Users and Temp are two default tablespaces
which are created by oracle on the time of
database creation. There are total 6 default
tablespaces created by oracle on the time
of database creation.
Using QUOTA clause I have assigned maximum
20 Mega Byte on user tablespace.
And using Account clause I have set the status
of account on UNLOCK. Which means account
is Open to use.
Let?s execute
And here we go. USER is created.
You can verify whether your user is created
or not by executing a query on DBA_USER view.
SELECT username, account_status, default_tablespace,
temporary_tablespace, profile, authentication_type
FROM dba_users WHERE username='IRONMAN';
Here I am selecting username, account_status,
default_tablespace, temporary_tablespace,
profile, authentication_type from dba_user
view for our user account Ironman.
I have specified it in my WHERE clause, Just
make sure to write username in all caps and
enclosed in single quotas as I have done here.
Execute.
Here is our account.
We have our new user with the name Ironman
But a newly created user cannot connect to
the database until granted the CREATE SESSION
system privilege.
Let?s try
To show you this I am using command prompt.
You can also watch my video tutorial 4 for
different ways of connecting with database.
In that tutorial I have explained different
ways of connecting with the database. Link
is in the description box.
Connect sqlplus ironman/Jarvis;
As you can see, in the last line our user
Ironman doesn?t have create session privilege.
The solution to this error is very simple
you just have to grant ?Create session? privilege
to the user ironman.
For that first log on to your database using
sys user 
with sysdba privileges, and then write
GRANT create session to ironman;
Hit enter and grant is successful. Now let?s
try again to connect with database using our
user ironman.
Let me clear the screen first so that you
can see things clearly. Here we go
Let me show you the user
C:/&amp;gt; Show user
Its ironman
Similarly you need to grant other privileges
to your user if you want to create table.
To know more on that please read my blog.
That?s it for today.
Hope you enjoyed watching.
