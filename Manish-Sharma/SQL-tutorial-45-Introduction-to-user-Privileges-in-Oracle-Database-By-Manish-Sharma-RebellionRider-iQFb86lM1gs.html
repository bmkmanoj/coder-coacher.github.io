I am Manish from RebellionRider.com.
And I am back once again with another SQL
tutorial and today we will learn about user
privileges in oracle database which is a very
important topic.
As we know that every user in oracle database
needs some rights to perform any task.
These tasks can be anything for example to
execute any SQL statement or to access the
objects owned by any other user or to run
any PL/SQL package and many more.
So to define a user privilege in oracle database
we can say.
A user privilege is the right to run a particular
type of SQL statement, or the right to access
an object that belongs to another user, run
a PL/SQL package, and so on.
There are two types of user privileges in
Oracle Database.
1.
System Privilege and
2.
Object Privilege
System Privileges
System privileges are some powerful special
rights given to a user to perform standard
administrator tasks in the database.
These tasks can be any action on any schema
objects for example create and drop a user
or tablespace, flashback or lock any table
and export as well as import the database
and many more.
As I mentioned before that System privileges
are quite powerful set of rights therefore
when in wrong hands they could result in catastrophic
events.
Hence these should be granted very responsibly
and only when absolutely necessary.
As they say- “With great power comes great
responsibility”
Object Privileges
Object privileges are the rights given to
a user to access and perform some actions
on the database objects or the objects owned
by some other user in the database.
By objects I mean tables, views, sequences,
procedures etc. and by Action I mean Alter,
Delete, Execute, Select, Update, Reference,
Insert and Index.
Object privileges vary from object to object
and an owner of the object has all the privileges
on its object.
How to Grant and Revoke the user privileges
To assign and deny the user privilege we have
two Data control language (DCL) statements
in Oracle database.
These are:
1.
Grant and
2.
Revoke
Grant and revoke data control languages (DCL)
help you in granting any kind of privilege
to any role or user.
Incidentally with the use of REVOKE statement
you can revoke any privilege from a role or
a user.
I will be explaining you both these grant
and Revoke Data control language (DCL) statements
with all the tips and tricks in detail in
my next video so keep watching!
Now the next question is Who Can Grant or
Revoke System Privileges?
1.
The most powerful administrative user in the
database sys can grant and revoke any privilege
from any user in the database.
2.
A user with the system privilege GRANT ANY
PRIVILEGE and
3.
Any user who were granted a specific system
privilege with the ADMIN OPTION
Can grant and revoke any privilege
In oracle database we have three options which
we can use along with the Grant statement
and add some flexibility to this privilege
management.
These 3 options are:
1.
With Admin Option
2.
With Grant Option
3.
With Hierarchy Option
With Admin Option
With Admin Option enables the grantee to.
1.
Grant the privilege or role to another user
or role, unless the role is a GLOBAL role
2.
Revoke the privilege or role from another
user or role
3.
Alter the privilege or role to change the
authorization needed to access it
4.
Drop the privilege or role
You can use with admin option while granting
System privilege only.
With Grant Option
WITH GRANT OPTION enables the grantee the
power of granting object privileges to various
other users.
Tip: Also it is important to remember that
WITH GRANT OPTION only assists in granting
a privilege to PUBLIC or user and not to a
role.
With Hierarchy Option
WITH HIRARCHY OPTION enables the grantee to
grant particularly specified object privilege
on every sub-objects of an object for example
sub-views that are created within a view.
This particular clause works only when used
in combination with the SELECT object privilege.
For more in-depth knowledge of the concept
and for the security guide lines recommended
by oracle you can read my blog.
Link is in the description box.
This is the first video in the user privilege
in oracle database series.
I did this Introduction to user privilege
SQL Tutorial video for the better understanding
of the concept and the upcoming videos.
Hope you enjoyed watching.
In my next video I will explain you the system
privileges with tips and tricks in detail.
