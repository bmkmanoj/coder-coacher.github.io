rebellionrider.com and welcome back to
my channel where we make learning SQL
pl/sql and oracle database one before
starting today's tutorial i just want to
say thanks to you all as this YouTube
channel has crossed five million views
and thirty thousand subscribers thank
you so much guys without you this would
not have been possible so without
wasting much of your precious time let's
start our PL sequel tutorial today we
will learn how to create nested tables
using user-defined data type just for
the reminder we have already seen the
creation of nested table using PL sequel
primitive datatypes in the last tutorial
you can check it out link is in the
description so let's do the example
first we will create a user-defined data
type and then use it for creating the
nested table here I have created a
user-defined data type which is an
Oracle object objects require no
introduction if you have ever studied a
concept anyways let's come to the topic
here in Oracle like other programming
languages object type is a kind of a
data type which works in the same way as
other data types such as care where care
to number or others but with more
flexibility here for this demonstration
I have created an Oracle object with
named object underscore type to create
this object we used create type
statement which starts with the keyword
create followed by the keyword type in
between these two keywords you can use
an optional clause or replace which if
it finds then you will change the
definition of the Oracle object which
has the same name as the one you are
creating if it does not find one then
it will create a fresh object for you
followed by the name of the object is a
result freeze as object which indicates
to the compiler that you want to create
a top-level object type then we have a
parenthesis inside which we define
objects attributes methods or other
properties in our case the object object
underscore type has two attributes obj
underscore ID and obj underscore name
the first attribute is of number type
while the other one is of watcher to die
let's compile and create this object
object created successfully now using
this user-defined data type we will
create the nested table the process of
creating a nested table is same as the
one we saw in the last tutorial except
this time the element type will be the
user-defined data type let's create the
nested table type
as you can see this create type
statement using which we created the
nested table my underscore ante is same
as the one we did in the last tutorial
except that this time instead of
primitive data type we used user-defined
data type which is Oracle object that we
created above let's also compile this
statement and create this nested table
nested table created our nested table is
based on user-defined data type which is
an Oracle object this object has two
attributes obj underscore ID and obj
underscore name these two objects will
become the columns of the nested table
my underscore nd now you can put your
nested table to work for example you can
use it for defining a column of another
table so let's see how
here I have a demo table with the name
base underscore table which has two
columns tab underscore ID and tab
element which is tab underscore ele the
first column is of number data type
whereas the second column is of my
underscore nt type which is our nested
table that means the column tab
underscore ele consists of a table my
underscore ante into it as we discussed
in the last tutorial that whenever we
define a column of a table as nested
table type then we have to define a
storage table for it as well as inform
the compiler about it we do that using
store as a nested table Clause as we did
here after the closing parenthesis of
create table DDL we specify the Clause
nested table followed by the name of the
column which we defined as nested table
type followed by that we have stored as
crossed using which we specify the name
of a storage table for a nested table
type column this name could be any
user-defined name that fulfills the
norms for create table DTL naming
standards which in our case is store
underscore tab underscore one let's
compile table created successfully note
that all the above tables which we
created have no constraints index or
anything created on them those are
purely for explaining the concept please
head over to my blog on the same topic
and learn how to insert update and
retrieve data from the above created
tables link is in the description that
for today make sure to give this video a
big thumbs up and subscribe to my
channel as many such tutorial are yet to
come
you can also help others in learning and
also help me and my channel in growing
by sharing this video with your friends
on your social media that's all about
the PL signal tutorial on how to create
nested tables using user-defined data
type in Oracle database thanks for
watching this is Manish from rebellion
