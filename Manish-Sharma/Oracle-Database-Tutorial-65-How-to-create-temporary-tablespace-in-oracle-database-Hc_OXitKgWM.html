&amp;amp; Welcome back once again! This is the third
tutorial in the tablespace in oracle database
series. And today we will learn How to create
a temporary tablespace.
The process of temporary tablespace creation
is quite similar to that of the permanent
tablespace that we discussed in the previous
tutorial. So I suggest you to watch it if
you haven't already. You can find the link
for the same in the description box.
So without wasting much of your time let’s
start the tutorial.
Before moving ahead just wanna tell you that
all the create tablespace ddl which we have
done in the previous tutorial or which we
will be doing in today’s tutorial are Command
line compatible. This means that you can write
them on your command or shell prompt and they
will work fine. That said, let’s continue
First I will connect to my database using
the sys user with sysdba privileges. Ok Here
we are let me quickly confirm you the user.
SHOW USER; User is sys.
Next we will write our Create Tablespace statement
to create a temporary tablespace.
A temporary tablespace is used for temporary
segments, which are created, managed, and
dropped by the database as needed. These temporary
segments are commonly generated during sorting
operations such as ORDER BY, GROUP BY, and
CREATE INDEX. They are also generated during
other operations such as hash joins or inserts
into temporary tables.
Similar to the permanent tablespace you can
create temporary tablespace either as small
file or big file tablespace.
So let’s write the ddl and see how to create
a temporary tablespace.
CREATE TABLESPACE temp_RebellionRider
TEMPFILE 'C:\APP\TBSP_DEMO\temp_rebel.dbf'SIZE 100M 
EXTENT MANAGEMENT LOCAL UNIFORM SIZE 1M;
Ok let me first close this script output ok
now
Let’s quickly take a look at this create
tablespace ddl. Statement starts with CREATE
and TABLESPACE both of which are oracle reserved
keywords. In between these two keywords we
have another keyword which is smallfile, which
specifies that we want to create smallfile
tablespace. By the way this is an optional
keyword if you don’t write this, then oracle
is gonna create a small file tablespace by
default.
Next we have the name of the tablespace which
is temp_RebellionRider. This name is user
defined so you can give whatever name you
want to your tablespace.
Then there is a TEMPFILE clause, unlike permanent
tablespace where we have datafile clause here
we have TEMPFILE. Temporary tablespaces are
created using temp files instead of datafiles.
Temp files are allocated slightly differently
than datafiles. Whereas datafiles are completely
allocated and initialized at creation time,
the temp files are not always guaranteed to
allocate the disk space specified. This means
that on some UNIX systems a temp file will
not actually allocate disk space until a sorting
operation requires it. Although this delayed
allocation approach allows rapid file creation,
it can cause problems down the road if you
have not reserved the space that may be needed
at runtime.
Here I have only added one temp file to our
temporary tablespace which is temp_rebel.dbf
the size of which is 100MB.
Next is Extent management clause where I set
it on Uniform mode with size 1 Megabyte. Unlike
permanent tablespace, segment space management
clause is not available with temporary tablespace.
Execution of this query will create a small
file temporary tablespace so let’s execute
Ok here we got ORA-02180 oracle error this
is because in this command we haven’t specified
what kind of tablespace are we creating? Right
while creating a temporary tablespace we have
to tell the oracle engine that we are creating
a temporary tablespace and to do the same
we have to write a mandatory keyword which
is TEMPORARY right before the keyword tablespace.
So let’s write it
Let me also close this script output ok you
just have to write this temporary which is
a keyword right before the tablespace keyword.
Ok everything is set let’s try executing
this query once again as you can see
Smallfile temporary tablespace is created.
That’s the recipe for baking a small file
temporary tablespace. You see how easy it
is… Now, what if you want to create a big
file temporary tablespace. Let’s create
one.
Just to save time I will copy this whole create
tablespace ddl and will modify it accordingly.
By the way I will share this script with all
these statements and you can find the link
either on my blog or in the description box.
So let’s write it ok before that let me
close this script output ok now let’s go
ahead
Ok done now I will modify this.
As we are creating a bigfile tablespace thus
first we need to change this smallfile keyword
to bigfile keyword. Always remember to specify
the keyword - bigfile if you want to create
a bigfile tablespace. It's mandatory in case
of bigfile tablespace creation.
Next we have to change the name of our temporary
tablespace to let's say temp2_RebellionRider.ok
perfect similar to datafile a big file tablespace
can only have 1 tempfile as we have here.
If in case we have already added more than
one tempfile to our temporary tablespace then
we have to delete them.
Similar to the name of the tablespace we have
to change the name of temp file as we know
that no 2 temp files can have similar name
that’s why we have to change the name of
our temp file from temp_rebel.dbf to temp2_rebel.dbf
let’s do it perfect
Rests of the clauses are fine and we are all
set to execute this ddl and to create our
big file temporary tablespace. So let’s
execute
Big file temporary tablespace is created
See isn’t it simple???
