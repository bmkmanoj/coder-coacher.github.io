rebellionrider.com and i am back once
again with another sequel tutorial and
today in this tutorial we will learn
about sequences in Oracle database so
without further ado let's start the
tutorial a sequence is a database object
which generates integer sequence we
generally use it for populating numeric
primary key columns on this node let's
move ahead and see how we can create a
sequence in order to create a sequence
we use create sequence ddle statement
let's take a look of create sequence DDL
syntax create sequence DDL statement
starts with create and sequence both of
which are Oracle reserved keyword
followed by the name of the sequence
which is purely user-defined meaning you
can give any name of your choice to your
sequence next we have few attributes of
the sequence first attribute is start
with here you have to specify a numeric
value from which you want your sequence
to start whatever number you specify
will be the first number generated by
your sequence next attribute is
increment by this attribute also takes a
numeric value to increment the sequence
by the number that you specify here will
serve as the interval between sequence
numbers the value of incremented by
cannot be 0 but it can be any positive
or negative value if this value is
negative then the sequence Descent if
the value is positive then the sequence
are sent if you omit this class then the
interval defaults to 1 next attribute is
max value or no max value using these
attribute you can set the maximum upper
bound for your sequence always remember
max value must be equal to or greater
than start with and must be greater than
min value attribute in case you don't
want to set the max value for your
sequence then you can use no max value
attribute similar to max value we have
min value attribute to set the lower
bound of our sequence as a value this
attribute also accept the numeric value
and should be less than or equal to
start with as well as less than max
value in case you don't want to set the
lower bound for your sequence then you
can use no min value attribute instead
then we have cash or no cash attribute
as value of cash attribute you specify
the number of integers to keep in memory
the default number of integer to cash is
20 the minimum number of integers that
may be cashed is to the maximum integers
that may be cashed is determined by this
formula
specify no cash to indicate that values
of the sequence are not pre-allocated if
you
both cash and no cash then database
caches 20 sequence number by default
next we have cycle or no cycle Flags
cycle and no cycles are two flags which
you have to set if you set the flags on
cycle then your sequence continues to
generate its value after reaching either
its maximum or minimum value you specify
no cycle flag when you do not want your
sequence to generate more values after
reaching its maximum or minimum value if
in case you omit both these flags then
by default Oracle engine will set the
flag on no cycle at last we have two
more flags which are order and no order
order flag guarantees that sequence
number are generated in order of request
this Clause is useful if you are using
the sequence number as a timestamp
guaranteeing order is usually not
important for sequence that are used to
generate primary key set the flag or no
order if you do not want to guarantee
that sequence number are generated in
order of request no order is the default
flag in case you omit either of them
hope syntax is clear to you now let's
try some examples let's create a
sequence by the name of sq underscore
demo
this is a simple sequence with the name
of s Q underscore demo which is starting
with 1 and the interval between every
sequences to the max value for this
sequence is 10 and min value is 1 and
this sequence will cash 3 integers at a
time and will cycle after reaching the
maximum value which is 10 also I have
set order flag which means generation of
the number will generate in current in
order let's execute sequence sq
underscore demo created ok let me close
this script output ok there are few
things which you should know first
you can specify any of these attributes
and flag in any order means order of
these flags is not fixed second all
these attributes and flags are optional
if you omit all of them then Oracle in
general create a default sequence for
you let's see an example let's execute
sequence sq underscore demo 0 1 created
so now that you have learned how to
create a sequel next step is how you can
use a sequence to use a sequence we use
next well &amp;amp; kerrville both these are
pseudo columns of a sequence using which
we can retrieve next value and current
value of a sequence next well column
returns the next value of the sequence
as well as initialize the sequence
whereas Kerrville column will return the
current value of the sequence let's see
how let's try to retrieve the current
value from our sequence sq underscore
demo which we just created but before
that let me close this script output let
me also make some space so that you
people can see things clearly ok let's
write the query to retrieve current
value from our sequence sq underscore
demo let's execute and we got an error
this is because before using any
sequence it's mandatory to initialize it
first if you will try to retrieve
current value without initializing it
then it will give you an error and we
use next well pseudo column to
initialize a sequence as well as to
retrieve next value of the sequence let
me show you how you can initialize a
sequence by using next well pseudo
columns but before that let me close
this query raiser
let's execute as you can see the value
written from this query is the value
which you have assigned to your start
with attribute let me adjust my output
panel okay every time you execute this
select DML the sequence will generate
the next integer in the row which means
that if I will execute the same select
DML then next integer will be 3 because
we have specified the interval between
the sequence as 2 in increment by
attribute let's execute same select
statement once again value returned is 3
now once again try executing the carwell
query which give us an error last time
and see what happened this time as you
can see this query executed successfully
this time and returned the current value
of the sequence this means that after
creating a sequence first you have to
execute next well query to initialize it
and then you can use it next we will see
how we can populate a primary key column
using sequence for the demonstration I
have created a table by the name of demo
which has only two columns for says demo
ID which is our primary key column and
can hold numeric data as its data type
is number Nexus demo D which is capable
of holding variable character string as
its data type is varchar' 2 now we will
insert the rows into this table and
populate the primary key column using
the sequence which we just created let's
see how by the way you can refer my
tutorial 32 33 and 34 on how to insert
data into a table link 4 which are in
the description box let's write the
insert DML let's execute one row insert
it you can execute this insert DML as
many times as you want until sequence
reaches its highest value let's execute
same insert DML once again another row
inserted before winding up this tutorial
let's see how we can delete a sequence
from this schema to delete any sequence
we use drop DDL statement say you want
to delete the sequence sq underscore
demo which we just created for that the
statement will be let's execute sequence
sq underscore demo dropped you can read
my blog on the same topic for more
in-depth knowledge such as how we can
change the definition of a sequence
after creating it and many more

you soon with another sequel tutorial
till then take care this is manish from
