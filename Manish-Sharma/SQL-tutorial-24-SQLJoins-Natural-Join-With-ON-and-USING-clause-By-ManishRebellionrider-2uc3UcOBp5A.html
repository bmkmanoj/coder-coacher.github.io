rebellionrider.com and today in this SQL
slash oracle database tutorial we will
learn about natural join first why do we
have joins in SQL the answer is that
when you want to retrieve information
from two or more tables we share common
field we use joins there are several
kinds of join in SQL and I will be
explaining to you all of them one video
at a time and today we will start with
natural join but before jumping over a
natural join let me tell you a few
terminologies first so stable table
which comes after from clause in the
Select statement second target table all
the tables which come after join clause
in dqe when the join Kure is executed
then Oracle engine start matching data
from source table to the target table if
there is a hit for a matching source
table data in the target table then the
value is returned okay let's jump over
SQL Developer scenario one when there is
only one identical named column between
source and target table let's use
department table and location table for
the demonstration as you can see here
department table has four columns
department ID department name manager ID
and location ID
similarly location table has six column
location ID street address postal code
city state province and country ID upon
minutely observing you will notice that
location ID is the only common column
between our source and target table it
is the foreign key and does has the same
data type and column width let's write
the query for natural join
say you want to find this city for all
your departments
in this QE we are selecting department
name from departments table and city
from locations table you can select
other columns to department is our
source table as it's coming right after
from keyword and location is a target
table as it's coming after join Clause
the best part of using natural join is
that you do not need to specify the join
columns because column this same name in
source and target table are
automatically associated with each other
let's execute D Kure here is a result IT
department is in the South Lake City
shipping is in the South San Francisco
and so many departments are in Seattle
City on executing this query Oracle
returns all the rows from department
column of departments table and from
city column of location table where
location idea of departments table is
equal to location idea of location table
now scenario two what if when our source
and target table have more than one
identical name column let me clear the
output for you and let me make some
space to demonstrate this scenario I
will be using employees table and
departments table here as you can see
there are two columns Department ID and
manager ID which are common in both the
table so if we put natural join on these
two table then Oracle engine will use
these two column to return the result
don't get confused let's do a Curie and
try to understand what does that
statement means say we want to see the
name of employees and the name of
department in which he or she is working
for that we will select first name from
employees table which is our source
table and department name from
department's table
execute here is our result as I have
already mentioned that when we use
natural join there is no need to specify
join columns explicitly all the columns
which are common in both source and
target table get associated
automatically the Kure in which all the
common columns of source and target
table get associated automatically are
known as pure natural join which means
in this Kure oracle has automatically
associated our common column which are
department ID and manager ID to help you
understand more clearly let's write same
theory but this time using on clause
here is a slightly change in natural
join syntax else we are using on Clause
this time instead of writing natural
join
we will only write join therefore now we
have our own Clause in a above Kure
which was pure natural join oracle is
using both the common columns of our
source and target table which are
manager ID and department ID thus we
will also use both these column inner on
Clause
both these curie produce the same result
as both are same curie written in
different way let's execute as you can
see there is no difference between the
result of previous Curie and the latest
Curie in this curie we emphasize natural
join using on cloth as we are using on
claws does it become mandatory to
specify the column over which we want to
perform the join now scenario 3 natural
join with using claws here once again we
will use our natural join Curie but
before that let me clear the output here
so that you can see things clearly okay
to make you understand this concept
clearly once again we need our pure
natural join Curie and this one is our
pure natural join Curie to save the time
I'm going to select copy and paste this
Curie sorry as we can see here in this
Curie that when we have more than one
common column Oracle engine uses all of
them to produce the result now here in
this Curie we are using employees and
department table which have two common
columns Department ID and manager ID
what if you want to use only manager ID
in your natural join instead of both
manager and Department ID in this
situation we use natural join with using
Clause say we want to select all the
first name and Department name from
source table employees and target table
departments from where we have equal
values of manager ID in both employees
table and the department table let's
write the Curie
execute and here is our result hope it's
clear why we use using clause with
natural join so guys that's all for
today on natural join if you want to
read about this concept you can visit my
website and if you want to download this
script just scroll down a bit and here
is the link for this script keep
watching for more concept on various
other types of join
