rebellionrider.com and this time i am
back again with some short simple and
easy to understand bonus SQL tutorial
and today's quick and short SQL tutorial
is all about how to change the name of a
table using SQL alter table statement
okay let's jump over to SQL Developer
and start the form now let us first open
a new empty worksheet in SQL Developer
you can do this by pressing Alt key with
function f10 key which is fairly easy
after that select a connection here I am
going to select HR user you can also
create a new connection here by clicking
this green plus button or if you want to
edit the existing connection then click
pencil button that's what I like about
just - everything is so much handy now
hit OK there we go here we have our new
worksheet with HR user connection just
for the sake of demonstration I am going
to create a very simple table with just
one column by the name of test you can
watch my tutorial number 14 and 15 for
the correct process of how to create
table ok let's create the table named
test execute
and the table called test is created say
after creating table named test you
realize that you want to rename it as
example you can rename any table by
simple DDL alter table statement let's
see how to rename a table you just have
to write an alter table statement as
alter table then specify the name of
your table which you want to rename in
our case it's test as we want to change
its name from test to example now after
table name right rename to here rename
and to both our SQL keywords and now
write the new name for your table in our
case it's example now and this statement
by terminator and execute that's all you
have to do to rename a table using SQL
alter table statement you can also do
the same task using SQL Developer GUI
for that go to connection tab if you do
not have a connection tab then click
view and select connections now select
the user in which you have your table
and expand it in our case it's HR user
now among all these options select
tables and expand it now select the
table which you want to rename let's
select our example table and right-click
it and select edit select edit now in
the table and advisor here you have the
name of your table change it say we want
