rebellionrider.com and i am back once
again with another PL sequel tutorial so
far we have seen how to create table
based and cursor based record data type
variables the one that is left is the
user-defined record data type which we
are going to cover in today's tutorial
yes in to is PL sequel tutorial we will
learn what is user defined record
variable as well as how to create a
user-defined record data type variable
in Oracle database so without wasting
much of your time let's start the
tutorial
as the name suggests user defined
records are the record variables whose
structure is defined by the user which
is unlike the table based or cursor
based records whose structures are drive
from their respective tables a cursor
this means that with user defined
records you can have complete control
over the structure of the record
variable the creation process of user
defined record variable is divided into
two parts before defining the record we
first need to define the type for the
record variable this type will become
the piece for the user-defined record
variable and will help in driving its
structure once the type is successfully
declared then we can use it for creating
our user-defined record variable let's
quickly take a look at the syntax for
creating the user-defined record
variable in Oracle database that is the
syntax for creating the type for the
record variable which starts with the
keyword type followed by the type name
which is completely user-defined next to
that we have a result phrase is record
followed by that we have field names
along with their data types enclosed
into the parenthesis every field except
the last one is separated from each
other using comma once we have our type
declared we are all set to create a
record variable this variable will then
acquire all the properties of the type
using which it is created and here is
the syntax for creating the user-defined
record data type variable you simply
have to write the name of your record
variable which is again user-defined
which means you can give whatever name
you want to your record variable follow
by the type knee that's all you have to
do did you notice that unlike the table
based or cursor base record variable we
do not have to use percentage row type
attribute here for declaring the record
variable that is the syntax for creating
a user-defined record data type variable
so now as we have understood the syntax
for creating user-defined record data
type variable it's time to move ahead
and do an example which will help you in
understanding the concept more clearly
so let's do the example
here I have declared the type for the
record variable with name RV underscore
de PD this type has two wheels that are
F name and D name the field F name is of
one card to data type and this field
will hold the first name of the employee
the next field de leme will hold the
department name of the employee and it
is of anchored data type you can refer
to my PL sequel tutorial for for more
details on anchored data type find the
link in the description now let's create
the record variable using the type RV
and us OTE VD here we have a record
variable this is a record variable based
on type RV underscore d EP d which we
just declare next i will complete this
PL sequel block and write the execution
section in the execution section we will
have a select statement which will be
joining employees table and departments
table and returning the first name and
Department name of the specific employ
let's do it
so here we are the select statement
which we have here will return the first
name and the department name of the
employ whose employee ID is 100 the data
for both the columns are coming from
different tables that we used a join
here though the Select statement is very
simple but for the demonstration purpose
it does the work as there are two
different tables involved in the query
the since the situation use of table
based record variable is not possible
the viable solution is the user-defined
record variable so now let's try to
execute this PL sequel block and see
whether it works or not and here we have
the result so that is how we create
user-defined record data type variable
in Oracle database that's it for today's
tutorial on what are user-defined record
data type variables and how to create
them hope you enjoyed watching and learn
something if so then please give this
video a thumbs up and don't forget to

learning as well as support me and my
