Welcome back! I am Manish from RebellionRider.com
And I am back once again with another Short
and Crispy SQL tutorial and today’s SQL
tutorial is about DECODE function in oracle
database.
DECODE function is an old way to perform IF-THEN-ELSE
logic in oracle database. It’s old but still
supported by the latest versions of oracle
database but it is always recommended to use
CASE over DECODE for various reasons such
as:
1. CASE expression is easy to read in comparison
to DECODE function.
2. Using DECODE you can only perform equality
tests while using CASE you can perform various
logical tests. This means that in CASE expression
you can use logical operators while same is
not true with DECODE
3. CASE expression is supported by PL/SQL
While DECODE is only supported by SQL
4. CASE falls under ANSI SQL/92 standard where
DECODE is Oracle proprietary.
Let’s quickly take a look at DECODE function’s
syntax
DECODE is a function thus followed by DECODE
keyword we have parenthesis and within parenthesis
we have 4 parameters which are value, search
value, result and default value. DECODE function
compares the value with search value if they
match then DECODE function returns the result
otherwise default value is returned.
Let’s use this function in some queries
and try to better understand the concept of
DECODE in oracle Database.
First let me connect to my database using
my local HR user and like always let me quickly
show you the user. As you can see right now
I am connected to my database using my HR
user so let’s close this script output also
delete this query
First I will do a very simple query just to
make you understand the concept. So let’s
write the query.
 
This is just a dummy query to make you understand
the concept. The output of this query will
be the value returned from DECODE function.
And as we can see our DECODE function has
4 parameters. In which first two parameters
are strings which are exactly the same and
the third parameter is our result which will
get returned only when our first two parameters
match in case if they don’t then our 4th
parameter get returned.
Now what will happen on executing this query?
On executing this query oracle engine will
try to compare the first two parameters with
each other. In order to return the true result
these two strings need to be exactly the same
if in case these strings don’t match then
oracle engine will return the false result
which is our default or say else result.
Let’s execute this query. And here we got
the true result as expected. Now let’s change
the capital S of our searched string with
small S and let’s see what happens. Execute
As you can see this time our result is false
because though both the strings are the same
but they both have different case. Similarly
you can compare numbers too.
Now let’s move on to second query.
Query 2: Decode with Column of the table.
But before that let me close this query result.
There you go.
Now for the demonstration I have created a
table by the name of “GuessTheCapitals”
Let me show you. As you can see this table
has 2 columns country name and capital id.
Yes, instead of writing the names of the capital
I have put the capital IDs here. Now it’s
our task to guess the capital of the country
on the basis of capital ID using DECODE function.
I have also populated this table let me show
you. 5 rows of data first column have 5 different
countries name and 2nd column has some IDs.
Let’s write the query
But before that let’s close this query result
and this script output also. Ok let’s write
the query
Let’s move this query slightly up so that
you people can see things clearly ok here
we go
The output of this query will be of 3 columns
first will be the country name second will
be capital id and the 3rd one will be the
result returned from DECODE function. Let’s
take a look at the Decode function. In this
DECODE function we have few strings here,
Strings on the left side is our searched values
and strings on our right side is our output
results. On executing this query oracle engine
will compare these searched values with the
values stored in the capital id column of
our table “GuessTheCapitals”. If oracle
engine finds any match then it will return
the corresponding result otherwise it will
return the default result or say else result
which in our case is a string “Sorry”.
For a better understanding let’s execute
this query.
Here is our result. Capital of India is Delhi
and Capital of UK is London and So on.

A very hearty thanks for all your love and
support. I will be back with another short
and crispy SQL tutorial very soon. Till then
take care and See you soon I am your friend
Manish. Thanks for giving me your time.
