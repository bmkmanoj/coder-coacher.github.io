again i am manish from

in the last plc quest tutorial we learnt
that we can create nested table
collection either as a part of PL sequel
blog or as a database collection object
we did the example on format as well as
learnt how to create nested tables in PL
sequel blog along with the necessary
theory today in this tutorial we will
learn how to create PL sequel nested
table as database collection object in
Oracle database so without wasting your
precious time I will start right away as
database collection object you can base
your nested table either on primitive
data type or on user-defined data type
let's see how here after setting the
server output on we created our
collection type which is of course
unless a table the syntax of creating a
nested table as database object is very
similar to creating understa table with
PL sequel block to create this nested
table we use our old and trusty create
type TTL statement
it starts with the keyword green and is
followed by an optional or replace
clause in this statement this optional
Clause look for the type with the same
name that is my nested table if it finds
any then it changes its definition
according to this statement otherwise it
creates one for you next we have another
keyword type which indicates what kind
of database object we are creating
followed by the name of your type which
in our case is - tea table then we have
a result phrase is stable of using which
you indicate the data type of the
elements which your table will hold here
we use a primitive datatype for creating
our nested table which is wall chart 2
you can use user-defined data type as
well and
let's execute this create type statement
and create an STD ville type - tea table
compiled and created if you have watched
my last tutorial then you must have
noticed that it is the same Leslie table
we created in that tutorial except this
time we created it as a standalone
database object rather than a part of
any PL sequel block by standalone I mean
this object is stored inside your
database permanently that is you can
reuse it whenever you want so let's move
ahead and learn how to put this nested
table to some use let's first close this
script output okay the collection type
which we created about can be used to
specify the type of a column of a table
and that is exactly what we did here I
created a simple table with name my
subject
distel has three columns that are
subject ID which has data type number
subject name which data type one char
two and subjection duty this column is
of nested table type column it means
that this last column can hold multiple
values it could be two or three or maybe
more as nested table is an unbounded
type of collection in order to make any
column a nested table type you need to
tell your compiler two things first the
name of the column you want to use as a
nested table column and second the
storage table for your nested table type
column you do both these works using
nested tables and store as close let's
see how you specify both these Clause
right after the closing parenthesis of
create table DDL statement you first
write the Clause nested table followed
by the name of the column that you
declared as nested table which in our
case is sub underscore shedule
underscore
then you write Klaus store else followed
by stories Klaus you have to specify the
name of a storage table this is a
user-defined name and could be anything
let's call it nested tab space and then
you put the statement terminator
now this vdl is complete the successful
execution of this PDL will create a
table which has a column of nested table
type in which we can store multiple
value before moving ahead I want to ask
you one question remember the first form
of normalization which says there must
not be a column in any row of a table
with multiple values stored in it the
question is that if we should not see
multiple values in a column then why
nested tables what are the benefits of
nested tables go ahead and comment down
below to tell me your views on it
meanwhile let's execute this query and
create this table table created
successfully you can use the scribe
command and check the structure of the
table like this
here is the structure of our table now
let's try to insert some rules into this
table one row inserted let's insert one
more row another row inserted
successfully as you can see we inserted
two rules both of them have different
number of values for the last column sub
and a Scotia dual underscore take you
can check those values by executing
select statement on the table as the
last column is of nested table type the
Zips values are displayed in a certain
way note here the above tables which are
created have no constraint or index or
anything created on them I created them
just to explain the concept of how to
create nested tables type collection in
as easy as possible way to understand
above insert statements in greater
detail along with other DML statements
on nasty table type please visit my blog
on the same topic link is in the
description with that being said let's
wind up twist tutorial in today's
tutorial we learnt how to create nested
table type collection based on primitive
data type stay tuned as in the next
tutorial we will learn another way of
creating nested table but this time
using user-defined data type please do
make sure to give this video a thumbs up
also please share this video it will be
a huge help to me and my channel and if
you are new to my channel then please do
