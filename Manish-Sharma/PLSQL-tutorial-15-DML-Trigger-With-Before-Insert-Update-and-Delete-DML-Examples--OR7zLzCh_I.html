rebellionrider.com and welcome to the
second tutorial of triggers in oracle PL
sequel tutorial series
in today's tutorial we will be doing
some practical examples of first type of
trigger which is DML or data menu please
and language trigger so without further
ado let's start the tutorial all the
necessary theory regarding DML triggers
have been explained in the previous
tutorial thus today we will concentrate
on practical examples only--
you can watch that tutorial link is in
the show notes having said that let's
start today's tutorial in order to
demonstrate the creation process of DML
trigger we need to create a table so
let's quickly create a very simple table
table created I have created this table
with the name superheroes which has only
one column as such underscore name with
data type watch r2 and data width 50 now
I will write a DML trigger which will
work on this table I am going to write a
very simple trigger on this table which
will print a user-defined message every
time someone tries to insert a row in
this table this example is intended to
demonstrate you the proper process of
trigger creation but first let's close
this script output panel perfect always
set your server output on otherwise the
output message written from your trigger
will not be displayed back to you
here is our trigger the first four lines
of this trigger is the detail part as
these lines are telling you all about it
while the later six lines define the
working part of our trigger because
these lines are showing you what exactly
is this trigger doing let's discuss the
working part first here in the
declaration section I have declared a
variable of watch our two type which are
used in the execution section using
select into statement which we have
discussed in PL sequel tutorial 3 for
holding the username of the user who
perform the insert DML on the table
superheroes also by using DBMS output
statement I am printing I user defined
message this will get displayed after
every insert DML on the table now let's
come to the detail part of this trigger
here as you can see the name of this
trigger is bi underscore superheroes
where bi means before insert you can
name your trigger whatever you want this
trigger will get executed for each row
before every insert statement on the
superheroes table as we set it state as
enable has this trigger will come into
the action immediately after we execute
and compile it now let's execute and
compile this trigger here we are
trigger compiled now let's check whether
this trigger is working or not and to do
so we have to insert a row in the table
and before that let's close this script
output and make some space done let's
write the insert statement now execute
in the result you can see here is our
user defined message with the name of
the user which we use to insert a row
similarly you can create a trigger for
update DML you just have to change the
keyword insert with update in second
line of your trigger let me show you how
to save the time let's copy this whole
code and make some space okay and paste
it here now let's make some changes here
let's replace this insert keyword with
update done also modify the output
string a little bit okay
let's do one more thing rename this
trigger as BU underscore superheroes
where bu means before update now let's
execute and compile it here we are
trigger compiled successfully now it's
time to take this trigger on a test run
let's update the row which we inserted
earlier to see whether this trigger is
doing what we want it to do or not
let's close this script output and write
the update statement let's execute and
as you can see here is our result
similarly you can write a trigger for
delete DML operation like this you can
have three different triggers for three
different DML events on one table don't
you think that if we can cover all these
three events in just one trigger then it
will be a great relief if you think so
then my dear friend I have some good
news for you let me show you how we can
achieve this feat let's close this
script output and make some space great
now we will write our triggers code
here is our code as you can see in the
detail part of the trigger this time I
have included all three DML events in
just one line using or operator this
line indicates that this trigger will
fire before either insert or update or
delete DML event a rest of the detail
part is the same as that of previous
examples major changes can be seen in
the working part of the trigger where we
used if then else if a statement and
printed a user-defined message for all
three insert update and delete DML event
let me quickly brief you on this if then
else if statement for in-depth knowledge
you can watch the PL sequel tutorial 10
there I have explained this statement in
detail link is in the description let's
come to this statement in order to
target a particular DML operation in PL
sequel we have some predefined
predicates which we can use as valid
conditions such as an if condition we
have inserting for insert DML deleting
for delete and updating for update these
predicates will evaluate to be true when
their respective DML events occur for
example if a user executes an insert on
table superheroes then first if
condition will be executed and print the
underlying user-defined message back to
you similarly if delete DML is executed
then second condition will become true
and print the message and if an update
DML is executed then third statement
will print its message on your screen
let's compile this trigger trigger
compile now let's check this trigger
let's start with insert DML but before
that let's closes a script output and
make some space okay done now let's
insert a row in our superheroes table
let's execute here is our result which
is the user-defined string which we
specified in our trigger now let's check
for update DML
let's execute this updated statement
again the result is the string which we
specified in the trigger now let's check
the delete DML and see what happens
execute perfect
which means our trigger is working
perfectly hope this example has
successfully demonstrated you the
process of a trigger creation in Oracle
database you can visit my blog and find
all the codes which we performed and
talked about in this tutorial with
in-depth knowledge on the topic link is
in the description hope you learned
something and enjoyed watching if so
