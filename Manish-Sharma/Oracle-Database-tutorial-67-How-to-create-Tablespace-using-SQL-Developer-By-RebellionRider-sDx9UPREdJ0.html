As always, I am Manish from RebellionRider.com
and I am back with another oracle database
tutorial.
In this tutorial we will learn how to create
tablespace using SQL Developer tool.
Till so far we have seen the creation of permanent,
temporary and undo tablespaces using Create
Tablespace statement.
But today we will learn how to create all
these tablespaces by using SQL Developer.
I think you will find this process comparatively
easy.
So without further ado let’s get started.
Here I am already on my SQL Developer.
To create a tablespace using this tool first
you need a connection with your SYS user.
I have already created one and named it sys@ORCL,
as you can see here.
If you don’t know how to create a SQL Developer
Connection with sys user then you should definitely
read my blog or watch my tutorial number 4.
For your convenience, the links for both these
are in the description below.
Next go to View menu and choose DBA menu item.
Doing so will give you a DBA panel.
Ok let me adjust it first and let’s minimize
this connection panel and here is our DBA
panel
Here in this panel we have to add a connection.
To do so, click this green plus button and
from the Select Connection window choose the
connection which you have created with the
SYS user.
In my case the connection is sys@orcl.
Which is already selected now hit ok
Come back to DBA panel, we have our sys connection
successfully added here now double click and
expand it.
Now from the directory hierarchy select storage
and expand it.
Doing so will again give you a list directory.
Feel free to explore all of them, every directory
has important information but in this tutorial
we will only concentrate on a specific directory
by the name of Tablespaces.
Single click on this directory will show you
the brief information on all the tablespaces
in your system.
For detailed information you can expand this
and select individual tablespace.
However we want to create a new tablespace
so for that, right click on the Tablespace
directory and select Create New.
Doing so will open up a create tablespace
wizard for you.
Come to this Name text field and give your
tablespace an appropriate name, it’s completely
user defined which means you can give whatever
name you want.
Next is
Tablespace Type.
Here you have to choose what type of tablespace
you want to create.
Just click the drop down list.
Here you have 3 options Permanent, Temporary
and Undo, choose your option here.
Say I want to create a Permanent tablespace
so I will choose the first option.
Next we have few tabs here in which file specification
is the first one.
In this tab you add the data file to your
tablespace or temporary files in case of temporary
tablespace.
Using Name text field of file specification
in tab you can assign the name to your data
file.
By default it says file specification 1 let’s
change it to demo_dbfile1.dbf
Next text field is Directory.
Here you provide directory location in which
your data file or temporary file gets stored.
It’s an optional parameter so if you do
not give any location path then oracle will
place your data file at its default directory
location.
But I want to put my data file in a particular
directory which I have been using in all of
my tablespace tutorials.
Next text field is File Size.
It’s mandatory for you to specify the size
of your data file.
Say I want my data file to be of 100MB for
that I will write 100 here and choose M as
unit.
You can check this Reuse Checkbox if you want
oracle engine to use an existing data file.
If file already exists then oracle will use
that file and apply the new size (if you specify
SIZE) or retains the original size.
If the file does not exist, then Oracle ignores
this clause and creates the file.
Next we have another check box which is auto
extend.
Using this option you allow the oracle to
extend the data file when it is completely
filled.
On checking this check box you have to specify
the size from which you want to extend your
data file along with the maximum size to which
your data file will be extended.
Let me quickly set these values.
Similarly you can add more data files to your
tablespace just by clicking this green plus
button but before adding two or more data
files just make sure you are creating a small
file tablespace because big file tablespace
can only have 1 data file.
Ok let’s jump to the next tab which is properties.
The options of this tab is more Tablespace
Type specific.
This means if you change the type of tablespace
which you are creating then these options
will also change.
Let me show you let’s change the tablespace
type from permanent to temporary see things
are changing similar with undo tablespace
I think we are good at permanent tablespace
as here we have all the options which we can
easily discuss.
So let’s come back to our permanent tablespace
and here we are So let’s start with the
first one which is File Type
In this option you decide what type of tablespace
you want to create either big file tablespace
or small file tablespace.
Let it be on Small file.
Next is online status.
We have 5 options here I will set it on Online.
You can read my blog to know the difference
between them.
In the Block Size text field you can give
the size for one block; it’s optional.
So I am not putting any value here.
Doing so will set the block size to its default.
Next is logging I will set it on Logging.
Next we have segment management and extent
management options.
I will set my segment management to Auto and
Extent management to Local and let it be auto
allocate.
I have explained these clauses in detail in
my tutorial 64 so I suggest you to watch that
tutorial link is in the description box.
Let’s jump to the next tab which is Default
Parameter.
This tab is only visible to you when you are
creating Permanent tablespace.
This is because table compression is only
available in Permanent tablespace.
You can’t compress undo and temporary tablespace.
Ok clicking on this option will provide you
a list of all the compression algorithms which
you can apply to your tablespace to compress
its data.
I’ll set it on No compress.
Again it’s optional.
Now the last tab is DDL.
Here in this tab you can see CREATE TABLESPACE
DDL with all the settings which you have done
so far.
Isn’t it the same DDL we wrote in tutorial
64 on how to create permanent tablespace?
Yes it is the same but this time we do not
have to write it.
Instead we let SQL Developer Tool do all the
dirty work.
Now all the settings have been done so let’s
click Ok and Create the tablespace.
Tablespace Created
That’s all you have to do for creating a
Tablespace using SQL Developer.
