I am Manish from rebellionrider.com and I
am back once again with another Oracle database
tutorial.
Since I have done my last video on how to
unlock HR user in oracle database 12c it seems
like you people are having some problem in
making a HR connection using SQL Developer.
So I have decided to do a quick video tutorial
on how to connect Oracle Database 12c with
SQL Developer.
As this video is in the continuation of my
last tutorial thus I would request you to
watch the previous tutorial first for a better
understanding of the topic.
You can find the link in the description box.
Having said that let’s move ahead and start
the tutorial.
As I told you guys in my previous tutorial
that in Oracle Database 12c we have the concept
of Container database and pluggable database.
Every container database has one Root Container
which contains system metadata to manage all
the pluggable databases that belong to this
root container.
When we try to connect to the database either
using SID or without specifying the TNS service
name then by default Oracle 12c connects us
to this root container.
However since our HR user or any other sample
user is placed inside the PDB container rather
than the root container therefore in order
to make a successful HR user or any sample
user connection in SQL developer we have connect
to the PDB container instead of root container.
And to connect with the pluggable database
container we have to use the TNS Service.
If you remember in the previous tutorial we
edited the TNSNAME.ORA file and added the
TNS service entry by the name of PDBORCL.
Thus to connect with HR user we will use this
PDBORCL service name while making the new
connection in SQL Developer.
Let’s jump ahead and make a new connection
in SQL Developer using HR user.
Before making connection make sure your pluggable
database which contains HR user must be open
to perform Read and Write operations.
Sqlplus / as sysdba
SELECT name, open_mode FROM v$pdbs WHERE name=
‘PDBORCL’;
As you can see right now my pluggable database
is mounted so first I have to open it.
ALTER PLUGGABLE DATABASE pdborcl open;
Ok everything is set, Now let’s jump to
the SQL Developer and make a new connection.
To make a new connection first you need this
connection panel.
If you don’t have it then you can get it
from the view menu.
Now click this green plus button.
This will open “New Connection” Window.
Here in connection name field you can give
whatever connection name you want.
I will name my connection as HR-PDB12c, Next
is the user name which is obviously HR as
we are making an HR connection.
In the password field you have to give the
valid password of your HR user.
In my case the password is HR.
Next check this Save Password Box and if you
want you can designate color to your connection
here.
Next is ROLE as its HR user so let this role
be default.
Now there are two ways to make an HR connection
in SQL Developer.
First let this connection type be Basic and
enter hostname and port number accordingly.
In my case my Hostname is Localhost and I
am using default port 1521.
Next field is SID if we will enter our SID
in field and try to connect then we will get
an error.
Let me show you
Click test.
See I got this error this is because when
we use SID to make a connection the Oracle
database 12c tries to connect us with the
Root container and as I said HR user is not
in root container, besides root container
does not even contain any user data.
Thus to make a HR connection we have to connect
to the pluggable database which has our USER
for that we will use the TNS SERVICE which
we created by updating the TNSNAME.ORA file
in previous tutorial by the name of PDBORCL.
So click and select Service name box and enter
the name of your service.
Click test.
Connection is successful.
Next and relatively easy way is by using TNS
connection type.
Choose TNS in connection type and from the
Network alias drop down list choose the name
of pluggable database service/TNS service
which is PDBORCL in our case.
Now Test as you can see Connection is successful.
Hit save and connect.
And here we are.
Let’s check the container name.
SHOW con_name;
As you can see right now we are in the pluggable
database container PDBORCL.
Next I will make another connection just to
show you the difference between the connection
using TNS service and that using SID.
This time I will use SYS user and SID ORCL
to make the connection.
Again hit green plus button.
Now on new connection window I will name my
connection as SYS-CDB12c, and username will
be SYS and next will be the valid password.
Check save password box.
Connection type let it be on BASIC and in
the role choose SYSDBA as the user is sys
which is a highly privileged user.
Next you have to enter your hostname and port
number, enter them accordingly.
For valid hostname and port number you can
check your listener.ora file.
In my case I will let them be on default.
Next unlike the last time, this time I will
use my SID which is ORCL instead of service
name.
Though you can use your service name also
but that will again connect your sys user
to your pluggable database.
Let’s enter the SID
Check the connection hit Test, as you can
see connection is success now hit save and
then connect.
And here we are.
Let me quickly show you the user.
As you can see the user is sys now let’s
check the container name.
SHOW con_name.
As you can see unlike the last time, this
time we are connected to the root container.
Always remember only common user such as sys
or system can connect to the root container
as well as pluggable database container but
a normal user can only connect with the pluggable
container.
With this I will wind up today’s tutorial.
Hope you enjoyed watching and learnt something.
