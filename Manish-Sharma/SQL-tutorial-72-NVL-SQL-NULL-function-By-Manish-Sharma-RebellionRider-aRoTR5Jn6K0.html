Welcome back once again I am Manish from rebellion
rider .com.
Today we will talk about those SQL functions
that can help you in handling NULL values
in Oracle database.
Yes, today in this tutorial we will learn
the concepts of SQL NULL functions in Oracle
Database.
So, without wasting much of your time let’s
get started.
As we all know that unlike other programming
languages NULL in oracle database does not
signify zero or a blank space rather it is
a value that is unavailable, unassigned, unknown,
or inapplicable.
Thus NULL value can a problem and requires
intensive handling for driving an accurate
result.
Problems!!!
What kind of problems?
Glad you asked.
1: Result is always NULL
If you are performing any arithmetic expression
containing Null as an operand then oracle
will evaluate that expression as null.
As you can see here.
2: Hard to distinguish
Though some graphic user tools such as SQL
Developer will show you NULL value stored
in a column explicitly but in case you are
working on your database using command prompt,
Linux terminal or SQL*Plus interface then
in most of the cases these tools show nothing
in place of null.
Now the question arises here is how to overcome
these problems?
To handle NULL in oracle database we have
a few pre-defined functions which come as
freebies in the package.
These functions are NVL, NVL2, NULLIF, COALESCE
and many more.
So let’s dig in and see what are these functions
and what are they capable of.
We will start with the first function NVL.
NVL
Using NVL function you can substitute a value
at the place of NULL values.
The substituted value then temporarily replaces
the NULL values in your calculations or expression.
Remember that the substituted value only replaces
the NULL value temporarily for the session
and does not affect the value stored in the
table.
Here is the syntax of NVL function.
NVL (exp, replacement-exp)
As you can see NVL function takes two parameters
exp and replacement exp.
First parameter exp can be a column name of
a table or an arithmetic expression and the
second parameter replacement expression will
be the value which you want to substitute
when a NULL value is encountered.
Always remember the data type of both the
parameters must match otherwise the compiler
will raise an error.
Let’s do an example that might help you
in understanding the NVL function more clearly.
And here I am on my SQL developer.
Let’s do the example
Now I will rewrite the above query but this
time say I want to replace all the NULL values
from my result set with numeric 0 using NVL
null function.
Let me show you how.
SELECT NVL (commission_pct, 0) FROM employees
WHERE salary&amp;gt;13000;
Let’s execute
Now in the result set you can see first 3
rows consist numeric 0 instead of NULL.
Similarly we can use NVL null function while
performing arithmetic expression, again let’s
take the same arithmetic expression which
we used in the previous query where we added
100 to the values of commission pct column.
SELECT NVL(commission_pct,0), NVL(commission_pct,0)+100
FROM employees WHERE salary&amp;gt;13000;
Execute.
This time all the null values of commission
pct column first gets replaced by numeric
0 because of the NVL function we used here
and then 100 is added to the 0 which results
in 100 as shown in the result set here.
Hope this makes the concept of NVL null function
clear to you guys.
In the next tutorial we will see other NULL
functions till then stay tuned and don’t
forget to like, comment and share the video
and subscribe to my channel.
You can also connect with me on my social
media all the links are given either on the
right hand side corner of the screen or in
the description box.
Thanks will see you soon with another tutorial.
Till then take care this is Manish from Rebellion
