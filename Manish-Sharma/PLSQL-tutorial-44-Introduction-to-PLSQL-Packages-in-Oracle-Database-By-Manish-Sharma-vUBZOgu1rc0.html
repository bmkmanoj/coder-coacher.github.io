rebellionrider.com and i am back once
again with another highly demanded
tutorial on my channel today we will
learn what are PL sequel packages in
Oracle database I know that for some of
you PL sequel packages are quite a
confusing topic we have used them time
and again in almost all the tutorials
but never got a chance to talk about
them it does today through this PL
sequel video tutorial I will try to make
you understand packages in as easy as
possible language so without wasting
much of your time let's start the
tutorial and learn what PL sequel
packages in Oracle database are what are
PL sequel packages in Oracle database
packages are stored libraries in the
database which allow us to group related
PL sequel objects under one name or in
simple words packages are logical groups
of related PL sequel objects packages
are named PL sequel blocks which means
they are permanently stored into the
database schema and can be referenced or
reused by your program so what all can
we include in a package a package can
hold multiple database objects such as a
store procedure PL sequel functions
database cursors type declaration as
well as variables all the objects
included into a package are collectively
called package elements now let's take a
look at the architecture of the PL
sequel package PL sequel package is
divided into two parts the package
specification also known as the header
and the package body both these parts
are stored separately in the data
dictionary the package specification is
the required part whereas the package
body is optional but it is a good
practice to provide the body to the
package now let's see what are these two
parts package specification package
specification is also known as the
package header it is the section where
we put the Declaration of all the
package elements whatever elements
we declare here in this section are
publicly available and can be referenced
outside of the package always remember
in this section we only declare package
elements but we don't define them also
this is the mandatory section of the
package a well and neatly designed
package specification is suffice to give
a detailed knowledge of the package to
the developer and that do without taking
a look at the package body syntax of
package is specification here is the
syntax like other named PL sequel blocks
this syntax also start with the keyword
create followed by the keyword package
in between create and package we have an
optional clause or replace this clause
will replace the already created package
specification if there is any without
having it dropped then we have the
package name this could be anything
after all it is completely user defined
as long as it satisfies the Oracle
database naming norms then we have
another keyword is followed by which we
can specify the Declaration of all our
package elements then we have another
keyword n which marks the ending of the
package specification followed by
keyword and if you want you can again
specify the name of your package though
it's optional yet it could be helpful
that is the package specification now
let's jump over to package body in
package body we provide the actual
structure to all the package elements
which we have already declared in the
specification by programming them or we
can say that a package body contains the
implementation of the elements listed in
the package specification unlike package
specification a package body can contain
both
declaration of the variable as well as
the definition of all the package
elements any package elements such as PL
sequel function a cursor or a stored
procedure which is not in the package
specification but coded in the package
body is called private package elements
and thus they cannot be referenced
outside the package let's take a quick
look at the syntax of the package body
and here we are
syntax is self-explanatory the first
line is
similar to the first line of the package
specification except that here we have
added an extra keyword which is body
this helps you and the compiler
distinguish between the package body and
specification then we have the
declaration section where you can
declare your variable types or other
modules always remember unlike anonymous
blocks do not use declare keyword and
whatever you declare here in the body of
the package will remain private and
cannot be referenced outside the package
then we have the execution section
inside this section we can implement or
say define all the package elements
which we have declared in the package
specification as both the package
specification and package body are to
individual units and store separately
into the data dictionary thus they can
be compiled separately too you can head
over to my blog where I have explained
this same topic in more detail link is
in the description that's it for the
introduction to PL sequel packages in
Oracle database stay tuned as in the
next tutorial we will see the live
demonstration of the package with some
interesting examples before going make
sure to hit that thumbs up button and
smash that subscribe button too you can
also help me in this venture of sharing
knowledge by sharing the link of this PL
sequel tutorial on your social media
with your friends thanks for watching
