I am Manish from RebellionRider.com and 
I am back with another short and crispy SQL
tutorial. A little while ago someone from
you asked me about how to import tables in
a different schema than the one from which
the table was imported.
So today in this tutorial I am going to show
you how you can perform a table import in
a different schema.
But first a brief intro of Schema:
A schema is a collection of logical structures
of data and database objects such as tables,
indexes and synonyms etc. etc. Oracle comes
with some pre-installed sample schemas such
as HR and SCOTTS. And Schema has same name
as that of the user.
So if you find me using words SCHEMA and USER
interchangeably then please don’t get confused.
So let’s start the tutorial.
In the previous tutorial I demonstrated you
how to import tables into the schema from
which they were exported. For this demonstration
I used table Superheroes which belongs to
the schema HR or User HR and I imported this
table using the same user HR which means I
imported it into the same SCHEMA.
But today I have created a SCHEMA or say User
by the name Manish and I will import the table
Superheroes which belongs to schema HR into
this schema or user Manish.
First let’s log on to the database using
this schema Manish and see how many tables
does it have.
Sqlplus manish/manish
Ohk we are logged in now let’s check the
user
SHOW user;
User is Manish.
Let’s check whether this user Manish has
any tables or not.
SELECT * FROM tab;
“No rows selected” which indicates that
this user Manish does not have any tables
in it.
Now let’s import the table superheroes using
user Manish or say Schema Manish
But first we need to come out of the SQL prompt.
Let me also clear the screen first
Ok now let’s perform our import
C :\&amp;gt; impdp manish/manish@ORCL DIRECTORY=exp_table
DUMPFILE=superhero.dmp LOGFILE=sh_imp.log
TABLES=’HR.SUPERHEROS’ REMAP_SCHEMA=HR:MANSIH;
Let’s take a look at this command.
Till the parameter tables command is similar
to the command that we performed in the last
tutorial where we imported the table in the
same schema.
But here we have an extra parameter which
we have to specify when we import tables in
different schema which is REMAP_SCHEMA. This
parameter takes two values first is the old
schema or user of the table and second is
the new schema or user of the table both are
separated by colons.
Although there are several significance of
the remap schema parameter but here especially
it’s resolving the ownership of the table
which means this parameter is telling your
database that the table superheroes is imported
from user HR to user Manish thus adding user
Manish as its new owner and transferring all
its data and metadata to user Manish.
And also the user logins, as this time we
are importing superheroes table using user
Manish thus here we have specified the loging
credential of the user Manish.
There are a few things which must be taken
care of such as:
1. Specify the name of the table with the
schema name as I did here all in caps and
enclosed in single quotes.
2. Second always try to write the schema name
in all caps.
Although it’s not mandatory but sometime
not doing so may cause errors so it’s just
a small precaution in order to avoid unnecessary
errors.
Now let’s get back on our command prompt
and execute the command.
Import is successful
Let’s again log on to the database using
User Manish and see whether we have the table
superheroes in it or not.
Sqlplus mansih/manish
Let me clear the screen for you. Let me quickly
show you the user first
Show user;
User is Manish.
Now let’s check whether we have the table
superheroes in it or not.
SELECT * FROM tab;
Here is our table. Now let’s also check
the data of this table
SELECT * FROM superheros
Ok. Here is our data which means we have successfully
imported the table superheroes from user or
say schema HR to Schema Manish.
Please do visit my blog as there you can also
learn about how you can switch the tablespace
of the table. You can even find all the commands
which I have performed here along with the
in-depth knowledge of the concept.
