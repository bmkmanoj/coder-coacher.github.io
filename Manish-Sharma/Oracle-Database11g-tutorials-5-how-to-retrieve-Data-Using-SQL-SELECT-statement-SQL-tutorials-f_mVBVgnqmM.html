the code makers and today in this
database tutorial we will see how to
retrieve data using SQL select statement
SQL select statement when we want to
retrieve or extract data from database
table we use select statement there are
other use of select statement also we
will see them in future videos ok let's
start
open up SQL Developer to I am connected
to HR user which is a simple schema
provided by Oracle and I am going to
work with its employee table first see
the syntax keyword select followed by
expression again keyword from followed
by table name expression can be a column
name arts Matic expression a function
call or a simple string table name is a
name of table from which you want to
retrieve data ok let's see how to select
all the data from a table for doing that
write the SQL select statement as select
strict prompt give a limp and terminator
split refractory signifies that you want
to extract all the data from this
specified table now execute the query as
you can see our SQL select statement
returns everything from our employees
table like this we can extract or
retrieve all the information from any
table of our database now let's see how
to retrieve specified data using select
statement by specified data I mean one
or more specific column from a table of
a database for doing that we will use
column name instead of a strict sign
after select keyword you can either give
a single column name or you can specify
more than one column name separated by
commas let's see how for this example we
will use employee ID
first name last name column of employ
stable write SQL select query as when
you want to use only one color you would
select followed by column name see is
last name from equally enter minute is
acuity duty here answer is M regard only
one column last name which we specified
in a Curie you can also give a list of
column as select employee ID comma first
name comma last name from evil name
while specifying more than one column
always remember to separate them using
comma as we do the t v-- here is a
result we can also perform arithmetic
like addition subtraction multiplication
and division
in future video we will see how to do
complex arithmetic but for this SQL
tutorial we will see simple asthmatic
let's add thousand to our employee
salary select large name o salary
original salary of an employee come on
salary plus outer from a valium
some ploys in Terminator execute this
select statement okay as you can see in
this result of our SQL Curie the
original salary of a canal is 2600 and
after automatic operation we got 3,600
similarly you can perform subtraction
multiplication division and much more
that's it for today i will share this
script on my copy cloud you can download
it link is in the video description you
can also join copy cloud and get 15 GB
of free cloud storage and if you use my
referral link then we both will get
extra 5 GB storage means you can have
free 20 GB of cloud storage if you use
the referral link and if you like this
