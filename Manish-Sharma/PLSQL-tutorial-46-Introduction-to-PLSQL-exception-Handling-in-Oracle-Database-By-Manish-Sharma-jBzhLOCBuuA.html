rebellionrider.com with this PL sequel
tutorial I'm going to start a new series
on the topic which is astral enters and
one which you have demanded several
times on my social media as well as on
my youtube channel yes you guessed it
right it's PL sequel exception handling
or you can see error handling call it
whatever you want
today's tutorial is an introduction to
PL sequel exception handling so without
further ado let's begin the tutorial
with the question what is an exception
any abnormal condition or say event that
interrupts the normal flow of your
programs instructions at one time is an
exception or in simple words you can see
an exception is a runtime error there
are two types of exceptions in Oracle PL
sequel first system defined exceptions
and user-defined exceptions let's take a
quick look at both these exceptions but
you can always head over to my blog for
the detailed knowledge of the concept I
always try to put all the necessary
links in the description of the video in
case I forgot then you can remind me by
leaving a comment I always read all your
comments anyways let's move ahead system
define exception system defined
exceptions are defined and maintained
implicitly by the Oracle server these
exceptions are mainly defined in the
Oracle standard package whenever an
exception occurs inside the program
Oracle server matches and identifies the
appropriate exception from the available
set of exception from Oracle standard
package user define exception like all
other programming languages Oracle also
allows you to declare and implement your
own exceptions
unlike system defined exceptions these
exceptions are raised explicitly in the
PL sequel block don't worry I will
demonstrate to you different ways of
raising user-defined PL sequel
exceptions in Oracle database when we
will do the example for now let's move
ahead and see how to declare user
defined PL sequel exceptions in Oracle
database
and declare user-defined PL sequel
exception in three ways let's see what
these three ways are first using
variable of exception type you can
declare a user-defined exception by
declaring a variable of exception data
type in your code and raise it
explicitly in your program using raise
statement next using pragma exception
underscore init function using pragma
exception underscore init function you
can map a non predefined error number
with the variable of exception datatype
and the third way is using raise and the
score application underscore error
method using this method you can declare
a user-defined exception with your own
customized error number and message
these are the three ways of declaring
user-defined exceptions in Oracle PL
sequel we will do the examples
demonstrating each of these three ways
of declaring the user-defined exceptions
in the next PL sequel tutorial that's
the quick introduction to the exception
handling in Oracle database hope you
will find this tutorial helpful do make
sure to smash that thumbs up button you
can also help me and my channel in
reaching out to more people by sharing
this tutorial with your friends on your
social media and most importantly don't
forget to subscribe stay tuned and keep
watching I will be back soon with
another PL sequel tutorial till then
take care this is manish from
