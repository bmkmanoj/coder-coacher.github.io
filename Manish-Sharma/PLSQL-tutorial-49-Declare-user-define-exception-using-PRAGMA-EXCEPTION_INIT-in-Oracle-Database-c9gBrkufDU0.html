rebellionrider.com and do is PL sequel
tutorial is going to be about how to
declare user-defined exception using
plasma exception init function in oracle
database in the last PL sequel tutorial
we learnt the v of declaring
user-defined exception using a raise
application error procedure though this
is also a very good way of declaring
user-defined exception but there is a
problem with this method here we cannot
name the exception in pl/sql we handle
all the exceptions which has no name in
others exception handler and that causes
confusion especially when we are working
on a project which is huge and have
multiple user define exception we can
easily overcome this problem by using
pragma exception init function so what
is this pragma exception init function
using the pragma exception in it we can
associate an exception name with an
oracle error number and we can use that
name in designing the exception handler
for the error so let's do the example
and see how to declare user-defined
exception using pragma exception init
function in oracle database the
demonstrative example is going to remain
the same as the one which we did in the
last tutorial except for a few minor
changes so let's do it
this time in the declaration section we
have two variables in which first
variable is an exception variable this
exception variable e^x underscore is
will now serve as the user-defined
exception and become its name second
variable is a simple variable with
datatype number i also initialize this
variable with value 17 which is unlike
the previous tutorial where we
initialize it by accepting the input
value from the user using accept command
if we don't know what I'm talking about
then go ahead and watch the previous
tutorial but for now let's move ahead
after declaring all the variables in the
declaration section we will have the
pragma exception in it a statement here
we have the exception in it a statement
before explaining it let me quickly show
you its syntax here we are you first
write the keyword pragma followed by the
function name which is exception
underscore in it and then inside the
parentheses you pass two parameters in
which first one is the exception in
which will be the variable name of
exception datatype and second is the
error number you can put any number as
error number in parameter but if you
want to use pragma exception in it in
conjunction with raise application error
procedure then you have to make sure
that the number is in between minus
20,000 to minus 20 thousand 999 now
let's take a look at our statement here
as the first parameter I pass the name
of an exception variable and as error
number
I passed minus twenty thousand and eight
same as in the last tutorial
that completes our declaration section
now let's go ahead and write the
execution section
here we have the execution section as
you can see it is pretty much same as
the one decoded in the last tutorial for
example in the beginning we raise the
exception using reads application error
procedure as a parameter of this
procedure I first pass the number which
is 20,000 and a this number should match
the one you specified in the pragma
exception init function in the
declaration section though it is not
mandatory but for the sake of
consistency and to avoid any confusions
try to match this number with the one
you have passed in your exception init
function this way you can easily find
that section of your program which is
causing the error in your project second
parameter is the error string which will
be displayed back to the user along with
the error number try to make this error
string brief yet descriptive so that the
normal user can understand what the
error is all about and we put this
raises statement inside the if condition
this way we are making sure that the
exception of course only if the age of
the user is below 18 right after the
raise exception statement we have a
simple DBMS output statement you can put
any number of executable statements here
but for the demonstration and code with
the single statement this statement will
execute only when the age of the user is
18 or above otherwise the program
control will go to the exception handler
which is the next part of this execution
section have you noticed something
different here no not yet take another
look carefully right exactly
though the rest is same but unlike the
last tutorial today exception handler
has a name of exception which is
I X underscore age so what does that
mean as soon as compiler gets to know
that the age of the user is below 18 it
raises the exception when the exception
is raised the compiler starts looking
for a matching exception handler if the
exception does not have any name the
compiler looks for the exception handler
with the name others which is cities in
the last tutorial but if the exception
has a name then the compiler looks for
the handler with the matching name that
is exactly the case into this PL sequel
tutorial we're is an exception with the
number minus twenty thousand and eight
and then map ending e^x underscore eight
over that number there after using that
name pre-design an exception handler
which is printing the error stack on the
display screen isn't it simple let's
compile and see what happens as the user
age is 17 which is less than 18 does we
caught the error I will be dropping the
link of the blog on the same topic in
the description of the video
there I have explained the advantage of
naming an exception and answer the
question of why we use exception init
function with Ray's application errors
procedure and not with Restatement and
what is this pragma keyword all about
wheat video is not over here before
winding of this tutorial I have a task
for you here I hardwire the value of
user age which is 17 now you have to
write the same example except your
example should take the user agent put
from the user the input pop-up box must
have a customized message not the
default one also if you want to
introduce some other changes in the
example then go ahead and do that you
have to comment your source code in the
comment section down below you can also
send the screenshot of the pop-up input
box with customized message on my
Twitter at rebellion writer so many of
you guys have been asking what equipment
and software or devices I use to create
these videos if this video gets thousand
likes
then I will make a video explaining my
process of making YouTube videos along
with all the devices I use thanks for
watching this tutorial on how to declare
user-defined exception using pragma
exception init function in Oracle
database don't forget to Like share and
