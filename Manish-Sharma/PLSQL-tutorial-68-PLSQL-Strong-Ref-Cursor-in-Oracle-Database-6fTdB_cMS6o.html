Welcome to the second tutorial in PL/SQL Ref
Cursor series.
Today’s video will be about Strong Ref Cursor
in Oracle Database.
As we’ve learnt in the previous tutorial
the Ref Cursor which returns some value is
called a Strong Ref Cursor.
Or we can say that a Ref Cursor which has
fixed return type is called Strong Ref Cursor.
So without wasting much of your time let’s
move ahead and see what does it mean?
In order to keep the concept of creating strong
ref cursor simple and easy to understand we
will do a very basic example.
Let’s do that.
SET SERVEROUTPUT ON
DECLARE
TYPE my_RefCur IS REF CURSOR RETURN employees%ROWTYPE;
After setting the SERVEROUTPUT ON we started
the declaration section of our PL/SQL block.
Here we declared our Ref Cursor type with
the name my_RefCur.
The Return clause in the end of the statement
makes it a strong ref cursor.
One thing which you have to take care while
creating a Strong Ref Cursor in Oracle PL/SQL
is that, the return value of a strong ref
cursor must always be a Record Type.
It can either be a table based record or a
user defined record.
In our case the return value of my_RefCur
is a table based record, where we used employees
table of HR schema.
If you want to learn more about table based
record datatype then you can refer to the
PL/SQL tutorial 33.
After declaring the Ref Cursor next we have
to create a cursor variable which will be
used to refer to our cursor type.
Let’s create that variable.
cur_var my_RefCur;
You just have to write the name of your cursor
variable followed by the name of your Ref
Cursor.
The former could be anything.
After all it’s completely user defined.
As here in our case we created a cursor variable
with the name cur _ var.
Next we will create another variable for holding
the data which we will be fetching from our
Ref Cursor.
Let’s create that as well.
rec_var employees%ROWTYPE;
Here we have another table based record datatype
variable for holding the data from our Ref
Cursor.
Next we will write the execution section in
which we will put this strong ref cursor to
work.
Let’s do it.
BEGIN
OPEN cur_var FOR SELECT * FROM employees WHERE
employee_id = 100;
FETCH cur_var INTO rec_var;
CLOSE cur_var;
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE ('Employee '||rec_var.first_name||'
has salary '||rec_var.salary||'.');
END;
/
Here we have our execution section.
In this section we have 4 executable statements.
Let’s see what these are.
The first statement is an OPEN FOR statement.
It associates the SELECT statement with Cursors
variable and opens the cursor for the statement.
This statement also looks for all the resources
required for processing the SELECT statement.
In our case this OPEN FOR statement is opening
our Ref Cursor for the SELECT statement in
which we are selecting data from all the columns
of Employees table of HR Schema for the employee
whose employee id is 100.
Second statement is a FETCH statement.
As we discussed in PL/SQL tutorial 26.
The process of retrieving the data from the
cursor is called fetching.
Using this FETCH statement we are fetching
the data from our Strong Ref Cursor into the
variable REC_VAR.
Once we are done with our cursor then it is
advisable to close it so that our Oracle Engine
/ Server can relinquish all the resources
associated with it.
That’s exactly we have done in the third
statement.
In this statement using CLOSE keyword followed
by the cursor variable we closed our ref cursor.
And then there comes the last statement which
is the output statement.
In this statement we are displaying back the
first name and the salary of the employee.
You can refer to the PL/SQL tutorial 33 to
learn the workings of a table based record
variable.
There I have explained how to initialize a
record variable and access the data from it
using dot notation.
Anyways, these 4 statements wrap up our execution
section of this program.
Before finding out what will be the output
of this tutorial, I’ll take a quick second
to ask you to like this video.
Your love and support always keeps me motivated
for doing my work and producing more such
videos.
Also if you are new here on my channel then
my dear friend go ahead and subscribe as many
more such interesting tutorials are yet to
come.
That being said let’s get back to our tutorial
and execute our program to see the result.
On successful execution the output should
be the first name and salary with the formatted
string of the employee whose ID is 100.
Let’s execute and see.
But before that we have to make sure that
we are connected to the HR schema because
we are working with the EMPLOYEES table which
is stored onto it.
Now let’s execute.
Here is our result which is the first name
and the salary of the employee.
As we saw that this tutorial requires a working
knowledge of cursor life cycle and record
datatype.
If you are not aware of these two topics then
I suggest you to watch my tutorial on PL/SQL
cursors as well as Record datatypes.
Link is in the description as always.
So that is the tutorial on how to create strong
ref cursor.
This example demonstrated the case where we
retrieved everything from the table in our
cursor.
What if we want the data from some specific
column of the table?
Will this example still be suitable for that?
In order to find out the answer stay tuned
as in the next tutorial we will learn how
to create strong ref cursor with user defined
record variable.
Do make sure to share this video with your
friends on your social media.
That way you can help others in learning as
well as help me and my channel in growing.
This is the tutorial on how to create strong
Ref cursors in Oracle PL/SQL.
