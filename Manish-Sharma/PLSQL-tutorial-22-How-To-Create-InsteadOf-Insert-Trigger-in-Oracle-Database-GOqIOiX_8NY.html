Welcome back once again I am Manish from Rebellion
Rider.com.
And I am back with another PL/SQL tutorial.
Today we will learn how to create an Instead-of
Insert Trigger in Oracle Database.
With the previous tutorial we are finished
with learning about Database event triggers
and how to create different types of them.
Hope you enjoyed watching those tutorials.
Now it’s time to jump over to the next type
of triggers in Oracle database which are Instead-of
triggers.
So without further ado let’s get started.
Using Instead-of trigger you can control the
default behavior of Insert, Update, Delete
and Merge operations on Views but not on tables.
Yes you heard it right you can write an instead-of
trigger on Views only and not on tables in
Oracle database.
That is the restriction you have to comply
with.
God knows why!
But that’s how it works.
Anyways, let’s move ahead.
So now you must be wondering, what is the
use of Instead-of triggers in oracle database?
Since an Instead-of trigger can only be used
with views therefore we can use them to make
a non-updatable view updatable as well as
to override the default behavior of views
that are updatable.
I can understand your concern but don’t
be confused you will understand everything
when we will do the example for instead-of
trigger.
But before that let’s quickly see the syntax
of Instead-of triggers in oracle database.
CREATE [OR REPLACE] TRIGGER trigger_name
INSTEAD OF operation
ON view_name
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
---Your SQL Code—
END;
/
So here is the syntax which is pretty simple.
First line is similar to every other trigger
which we have seen so far – It starts with
keyword CREATE and an optional clause OR REPLACE
using which we can alter the definition of
already created trigger followed by keyword
Trigger which specifies to the compiler what
object we are going to create and then we
have the name of the trigger.
This concludes the first line of the syntax.
In the second line we have reserved phrase
Instead-Of followed by operation which could
be either one of Insert, Update, Delete or
Merge.
In the next line we have to supply the name
of the view using the keyword ON over which
you want your trigger to work.
Next we have FOR EACH ROW clause which makes
your trigger execute once for each row that
is Inserted, Updated or Deleted from the underlying
view.
Then we have the PL/SQL block.
So, this is the syntax for the Instead-of
trigger in oracle database.
As we have now understood the syntax so let’s
go ahead and do an example.
In this example I will demonstrate how to
create an Instead-Of Insert trigger in Oracle
Database.
As I said above that using Instead-of trigger
we can make a non-updatable view updatable.
Let’s see what does that mean.
So what will I do?
First I will create 2 tables and then I will
create a view over these tables.
So first let’s do that.
Step1: Create Table
CREATE TABLE trainer
(
full_name VARCHAR2(20)
);
CREATE TABLE subject
(
subject_name VARCHAR2(15)
);
Here we have two tables.
Both the tables have only 1 column.
It’s just for the sake of simplicity and
to make the process of Instead Of trigger
creation easy to understand.
Now let’s insert some values into these
two tables.
INSERT INTO trainer VALUES ('Manish Sharma');
INSERT INTO subject VALUES ('Oracle');
One row of data in each table, I guess, will
be enough for the demonstration.
Next I will create a view which will join
both these tables and will show you the combined
result.
In order to better understand the concepts
of SQL Views, I highly encourage you to watch
the SQL tutorial 60.
There I explained the concepts of views in
detail.
Link is in the description.
Before writing the view let’s close this
script output and clear the screen
CREATE VIEW vw_rebellionrider AS
SELECT full_name, subject_name FROM trainer,
subject;
So here we have our view.
This view is not updatable.
You can check that by inserting a row in this
view or into the underlying tables used in
this view.
Hmmm.
Let’s do one thing, let’s try to insert
a row into this view and see what happens.
INSERT INTO vw_rebellionrider VALUES('Manish','Java');
Execute.
As you can see we have an error here which
indicates that this view is not at all updatable.
But as I mentioned in the beginning of this
video that using Instead-Of trigger we can
make a non-updatable view updatable.
Now it’s time to check as to what extent
this statement holds true and for that we
will have to write an instead-of trigger on
this view.
Let’s do it.
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER tr_Io_Insert
INSTEAD OF INSERT ON vw_rebellionrider
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
INSERT INTO trainer (full_name) VALUES (:new.full_name);
INSERT INTO subject (subject_name) VALUES
(:new.subject_name);
END
Here we are
Trigger is fairly simple.
In the first line you can see that the name
of our trigger is tr_io_insert.
You can give whatever name you want to your
trigger.
Second line starts with the reserved phrase
Instead-Of followed by the operation on which
you want your trigger to work.
In our case the operation is Insert.
Then using ON keyword we specified the name
of the view which we just created.
Then we have For Each Row clause which makes
sure that this trigger will execute for every
single row which will be Inserted.
Followed by that we have our PL/SQL block
where we have 2 insert DMLs using which we
are inserting values into the tables.
These Insert DMLs will fetch the data from
the insert statement which will execute over
the view and insert the respective values
into the underlying tables from the mentioned
view.
Let’s execute and compile this trigger.
Trigger compiled successfully.
Now let’s try to execute the same insert
statement once again and see whether it works
this time or not.
One row inserted.
Both the values have been inserted into their
respective tables.
You can check
Let’s close this script output first now
let’s check
SELECT * FROM trainer;
Here is the entry Manish.
Let’s try the subject table
SELECT * FROM subject;
And here is Java.
That is how you can make a non-updatable view
updatable using Instead-of trigger.
In the next tutorial we will see how to create
Instead-of trigger on an Update statement.
~Wait I want to talk to you ~
Before winding up this tutorial.
I have something to say.
I received a lot of questions from you regarding
certification, programming, career, social
media, YouTube and on various other topics.
I am planning to answer them and for that
I have created a separate YouTube channel.
As you can see I have already uploaded a video
which is a Giveaway.
You can also win this giveaway but for that
you have to watch the video.
Meanwhile, if you have a question feel free
to send it to me.
All my contact details are in the description.
Also make sure to subscribe to my 2nd YouTube
channel.
That’s it for today.
Hope you learnt something and enjoyed watching.
Please make sure to give this video a thumbs-up
and help others in learning by sharing this
video on your social media or by any means
you find convenient.
Don’t forget to subscribe.
Thanks for watching.
