rebellionrider.com and i am back once
again with another SQL tutorial but
first of all a heartfelt thank to all my
viewers and subscribers you people are
really amazing since last two videos we
are concentrating over outer join and so
far we have done right and left outer
join the only one which is left now is
full outer join yes you guessed
correctly today's SQL tutorial is about
full outer join before moving ahead just
want to say in order to better
understand the concept of full outer
join please watch my last two SQL
tutorial over right and left outer join
for your convenience I will put the link
of both these tutorials in the
description box below be happy and enjoy
watching ok let's jump over SQL
Developer and start the tutorial ok once
again we will be using same table which
we have used so far in this outer join
series these are EMP and de PG tables
let's have a quick look of the structure
and the data of these two table our
table EMP has three column EMP ID EMP
name and EMP salary here column EMP ID
is a primary key table dipt also has
three column dep tid dep d name and EMP
ID here in this table column dep d ID is
a primary key where column EMP ID is a
foreign key reference from the EMP table
now let's have a look at the data of
these two table EMP table has five rows
where column one has EMP ID one two
three four and five and column 2 has EMP
name steve nancy guru ellen and julia
and column three consists the salary of
these employees now data of dep t table
table dep d also has five column column
one hold dep t ID again one two three
four and five where column two has dep
teary sales account
finance IT and marketing and column
three EMP ID which is the foreign key
has only three records corresponding to
department name sales account and
finance we can interpret this data
easily for example the employee with
employee ID one is named steve in our
EMP table and walks in department of
sales similarly employed with employee
ID to is Nancy who works in account
department and employed with employ ID
three is guru who works in finance also
we have not assigned any employee ID for
Department of IT and marketing which
signifies that no one works in these
department I think the table structure
and its data are clear now so now it's
time to jump over our topic full outer
join full outer join is kind of
combination of both right outer join and
left after join because it returns all
the rows from left as well as right side
table let's have a look of full outer
join syntax syntax is pretty similar to
a left or right outer join as you can
see we have our select statement where
you can specify the name of the columns
from both the participating tables
followed by from clause and our join
clause which is full outer join here you
can either write full outer join or just
foil join since both are permissible and
perform the same task and then we have
our join condition on and using followed
by where and order by clause
okay now without wasting much time let's
to our force QE okay once again we are
on our SQL Developer let's do a force QE
yes we are going to perform full outer
join with on clause let's write the
query
here in this security we are selecting
EMP name column from EMP table and de PD
name column from de bTW table in our
full outer join Clause we have EMP table
on left side
and de PT table on right side and then
we have our on clause where we are
comparing the value of EMP ID columns
from both the tables let's execute if
you will observe minutely then you can
see that the result till Row 5 is
similar to that of right outer join as
all the records from right side table is
here and only those record from left
side table which satisfy the join
condition are here in this result
followed by all the remaining record
from the table does the last row 6 &amp;amp; 7
contain the remaining EMP knee here in
this on join Clause we use column which
have saved name and data type now let's
use column which have different name and
same data type for example column de PT
ID let's copy this query and modify its
on Clause let's execute here is a result
perfect 5 cada now let's check out full
outer join with using Clause let me
clear this output panel we use using
join condition when the column in join
condition share the same name and same
data type and are compared only using
equal to comparison operator and no
other comparison operator such as
greater than less than etc so let's copy
our first query and modify it
as you can see in the joint condition of
this Curie we have used EMP ID column of
bode table this column share the same
name and same data type hence we can
easily replace this on clause with using
clause let's do it now let's execute
this query here is a result if you
compare this result with the result of
our first query then you will find them
as exactly the same you can also limit
the result by using where Clause see you
want to see the name of only those
employees and their departments who have
salary of less than 50000 for that just
add a where clause let's write another
curie here so let's use this curie to
demonstrate where clause copy this Curie
and paste it let's clear this output
panel let's add our where clause let's
execute this Curie that's the result
similarly you can sort the result using
order by clause see you want to sort
this result in ascending order according
to the employee name for that just add
the order by clause followed by the
column name let's once again do a fourth
Curie once again clear this output panel
and this time we will select this Curie
oh sorry
and we will use it here now here we will
add the clause order by and the column
name will be EMP knee if you execute
this query then by default the result
will be sorted in ascending order
let's execute as you can see here is the
result if you write de SC right after
the column your result will be sorted in
descending order for example here just
after the column name write de SC
descending now let's execute this query
as you can see our result is now sorted
in descending order that's it for
today's guys you can download this
script from my website link is in the
description box this is the last
tutorial in outer join series this means
outer join topic is now complete hope
you enjoyed watching if you like my
video please give me thumbs up your each
and every like motivates me a lot for
doing more such videos if you have any
query feel free to write and please help
me in gimme more subscriber by sharing
