rebellionrider.com welcome to the third
tutorial in database cards or series
today in this PL sequel tutorial we will
learn what our cursor parameters in
Oracle database or what our parametrize
cursor call it whatever you want
in Oracle PL sequel you can pass values
into a cursor using parameters same as
we do in functions here you specify a
list of parameters while declaring the
cursor in their declaration section of a
PL sequel block and supply the
corresponding arguments to each of those
parameters when you open the cursor so
let's move ahead and do an example of
cursor parameter
after setting the server output on in
the first line we have our declaration
section where we declare two things
first is the variable for holding the
values written by the cursor and second
is our parametrized cursor the
declaration of this parameter is cursor
is pretty similar to the one which we
created in the previous tutorial except
a few minor changes let's take a closer
look at the declaration of this
parameterised cursor as usual the
declaration of the cursor starts with
the keyword cursor then we have the name
of a cursor which is P underscore CU r
underscore rebellion writer in my case
followed by the name of the cursor we
have a parameter list enclosed into the
parentheses though I have specified only
one parameter here but you can put as
many parameter as you need always make
sure to separate the parameters using
comma in case of multiple parameters
also while specifying a parameter to the
cursor you just have to specify the data
type not the data width as you can see
here I have specified a parameter to
this cursor with the name var underscore
e underscore ID followed by the data
type not and nothing else followed by
the parameter we have given is and then
a select statement in this selected
statement this time we are passing the
value to the where clause using the
parameter instead of hard-coding it like
the last time now let's write the rest
of the code and complete this PL sequel
blog using the open statement I open the
cursor which we just declare but unlike
the simple cursor in parameterised
cursor we have to supply the argument
value for the corresponding parameter
while opening the cursor does here I
have specified the value 1:05 for the
parameter var underscore e underscore ID
followed by the open cursor statement we
have this simple loop which encloses
three statements first is the fetch
statement which will fetch the data from
the specified cursor which is P
underscore CU r underscore rebellion
writer into the variable V underscore
name second statement is an exit
statement which will terminate the loop
when there will be no data left to
return from the cursor and third
statement is an output statement which
will print the first name of the
employees written by the parametrized
cursor then we have the end loop
statement which indicates the ending of
the loop followed by n loop statement we
have closed cursor statement which will
close the specified cursor and free all
the occupied resources that is our
complete pl/sql block for cursor
parameter before executing this block
let me tell you one thing you can
specify as many parameters to your
cursor as you need but always make sure
that when you open the cursor you need
to include a corresponding argument
value in the parameter list for each
parameter that being said let's execute
this PL sequel block for parameterised
cursor and see the result
oops error which means I did something
wrong and here it is done let's try
executing once again okay here is the
result do make sure to check the blog on
the same topic on my website for more
pointers for cursor parameter link is in
the description that's it on cursor
parameter stay tuned as we will see
another interesting example in the next
video
also if you learn something new and form
this video interesting then give it a
big thumbs up you can also share this
video with your friends on your social
media don't forget to tag me so that I
can give you a shout out that's it for
today stay tuned
I will be back with another video soon
till then take care i am manish from
