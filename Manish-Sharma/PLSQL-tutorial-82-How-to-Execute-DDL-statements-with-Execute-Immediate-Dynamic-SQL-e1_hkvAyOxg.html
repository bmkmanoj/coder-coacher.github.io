rebellionrider.com and i am back once
again with another pl/sql tutorial in
this tutorial on native dynamic SQL we
will learn how to dynamically execute
DDL statements using execute immediate
DB l stands for data definition language
statements using them you can create or
modify the database objects as well as
the schemas these statements are create
drop and alter you must be thinking
manish what could be the trouble in
executing them right no trouble as long
as you are executing them with SQL but
when it comes to executing them with
pl/sql then it's kind of hard so is
executing Tyrael statement with pl/sql
that complicated let's do an example to
find out the answer in this
demonstration I will try to create a
table by executing create table DDL
inside a pl/sql block and we will see
whether the table is created or there is
an error
here is our pl/sql block what do you
guys say will it create the table or not
let's execute and see the output
oops an error do you know why we got
this error we caught it because pl/sql
does not directly support DDL statements
to execute DDL statement using pl/sql we
either need to take help of DBMS
underscore SQL package or the advanced
and improved way which is the native
dynamic SQL so now in this tutorial we
will learn how to execute DDL statement
inside a pl/sql block using execute
immediate statement of native dynamic
SQL in case you are curious I have
already done tutorials on all types of
Tyrael statements in SQL series if you
want to check I will leave the link in
the description that being said let's
move ahead and learn how to write a
create table TDL inside a pl/sql block
using execute immediate statement in
oracle database how about starting with
a new and fresh worksheet a quick tip
shortcut for opening a new worksheet in
SQL Developer is Alt + f10 let's connect
with HR schema here we go and let's
close this one we don't need it anymore
great to simplify this concept and make
it easy to understand let's first write
the create table TDL which we will be
executing inside our pl/sql block using
execute immediate statement
here we have a very simple create table
DDL statement using which we are
creating a table with the name T UT
underscore 82 which has two columns T UT
underscore num of number data type and T
UT
underscore name of watch are two data
type usually we and a DDL statement with
a semicolon like this but here we are
not doing there so let's delete it for
now you will learn the reason why and
when should we actually use a semicolon
further along in this tutorial so keep
watching so here we have our create
table DDL statement ready for our
demonstration now let's open another
worksheet where we will write our PL
sequel block here we are
here we have written the declaration
section of our pl/sql block in this
section we have declared only one thing
which is a variable with name TDL
underscore qry of watch our two data
type with data width 150 we will be
using this variable for holding our
create table DDL query which we just
prepared i have said the data width of
this variable to 150 which I think will
be enough for holding our create table
statement in case you think your
statement is bigger than 150 characters
then you should set the data width
accordingly now let's move ahead and
write our execution section in this
section we will store our create table
DDL statement which we just wrote into
this variable TDL underscore qry using
assignment operator then we will try to
execute that DDL with execute statement
let's do that here we started our
execution section now we will store our
create table DDL into the variable TDL
underscore qry for that we will first
write the name of the variable into
which we want to store our query which
is TDL underscore qry in our case
followed by the assignment operator
which in pl/sql is a combination of :
and equal to sign next we will copy the
create table DDL statement from the
previous worksheet and paste it here
there are a few small yet important
things which we have to do here first
always remember that execute immediate
treats DDL or DML or any other
supporting statements which you want to
execute dynamically as a string of
varchar2 data type and in pl/sql we
enclose any character or watch our to
string into a pair of single quotes
because of this reason we have to
include our create table statement into
a pair of single codes now let's come
back to the question of when should we
put the semicolon in case you are
writing a DDL DML or any SQL statement
for execute immediate then you must put
the semicolon right after the single
quote into which you enclosed your SQL
statement for example here if I have to
put the semicolon then I will put it
right after the single quotes here but
if you want to write a pl/sql block and
execute it dynamically using execute
immediate then you should put the
semicolon right before closing single
quotes like this we will learn about
this in detail when we will do the
dynamic pl/sql tutorial in our case we
are executing a DDL statement it does we
will put the semicolon outside of the
single quotes only so let's get rid of
this one and now it's a perfect deal for
our execute immediate statement you can
also read about ending a statement with
semicolon in detail in the introduction
of native dynamic SQL finding in the
description now that you have understood
the proper way of writing a query for
dynamic execution in oracle data
let's move ahead and write the execute
immediate statement and complete this
pl/sql block to execute your DDL
statement dynamically using the native
dynamic SQL you simply have to write the
result phrase execute immediate followed
by the name of the variable into which
you have stored your DDL statement in
our case that variable is DDL underscore
qry that's it here we have our execute
immediate statement using which we are
executing our create table dtl after
this statement we have the keyword and
which indicates the end of execution
section of the pl/sql block and then we
have a forward slash which tells the
compiler that the pl/sql block is
complete now let's execute this program
and see whether this time we will have
our table created or get the error again
before execution make sure you don't
have a table with the same name created
in this schema otherwise you will
definitely get an error in my case I
don't have any table created with the
name tu t underscore 82 in my schema
hopefully we should not have any errors
on execution let's check pl/sql
procedure successfully completed which
means the table is created let's confirm
it by checking the structure of the
table tu t underscore 82 using describe
command if it is created successfully
then we must have it's a structure to do
that we first need to close this output
panel here we go now let's write the
describe come on and check this
structure execute here is our table with
both its columns so that is how we
execute a DDL statement and create a
table using execute immediate statement
of native dynamic SQL in oracle database
so next time if somebody tries to act
smart and ask you if one can create a
table using pl/sql then go ahead and say
yeah
with confidence because now you know how
to do that okay that is one way of
creating a DDL statement for execute
immediate the other way which is more
convenient especially when your SQL
statement is complex is by dividing your
SQL statement into multiple parts and
joining it using concatenate operator I
will be explaining this way of building
a DDL statement for execute immediate in
the corresponding block you can find the
link in the description hope you enjoyed
the video and learn something new if so
then please give this video a thumbs up
and subscribe to the channel also please
follow me on my facebook and twitter you
know where to find all the link this is
the tutorial on how to dynamically
execute GDL SQL statement using execute
immediate in Oracle database thanks for
