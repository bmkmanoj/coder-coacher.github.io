I am Manish from RebellionRider.com and 
I am back once again with another Data pump
import tutorial. Today in this Oracle Database
Tutorial we will learn how to import a SCHEMA.
If you remember, in my tutorial number 54
I performed the export of schema SCOTT. Today
I will show you how you can import that schema
back into your database using impdp data pump
import. I would highly suggest you to watch
tutorial 54 first because I am going to use
various parameters’ value from that tutorial.
Ok let’s move ahead.
So only the user who has datapump_imp_full_database
role can perform the import of schemas. I
am not counting privileged users into this list
 as they already have all the roles and
they can do whatever they want.
Warnings: Only grant this role when it’s
absolutely necessary. As in the wrong hands
it could be highly catastrophic.
That being said, we use SCHEMAS parameter
of impdp data pump import to import the schema.
Let’s see how.
C:\&amp;gt;impdp system/oracle@ORCL DIRECTORY=exp_schema
LOGFILE=imp.log DUMPFILE=exp_schm.dmp SCHEMAS=scott
We will encounter an error if we try to execute
this query. Let’s see what will be the error.
As you can see it’s an ORA-31684 error which
saying that schema Scott already exists. This
is because I already have Scott schema in
my system. So to resolve this error I can
either drop the Scott schema or I can rename
the schema that I am going to import.
I think 2nd option is more viable so I will
rename the schema Scott that I am importing.
In order to do so we can use REMAP_SCHEMA
parameter. This is the second application
of REMAP_SCHEMA parameter. The first application
I have already explained in my previous tutorial.
So let’s add REMAP_SCHEMA parameter to our
impdp command.
But before that let’s clear the screen and
here is our impdp data pump command which
we just executed. Let’s add REMAP_SCHEMA
parameter to it
C:\&amp;gt;impdp system/oracle@ORCL DIRECTORY=exp_schema
DUMPFILE=exp_schm.dmp SCHEMAS=scott REMAP_SCHEMA=scott:scott_copy
Here as you can see remap_schema parameter
took 2 values. First was the real name of
the schema which we are importing which is
Scott in our case and second one is the new
name of the schema. You can give whatever
name you want. Here I have designated Scott_Copy
as the new name.
And I am importing the schema using my privileged
user system whose login credentials I have
specified here.
Also Exp_schema which is the value of directory
parameter is a directory object which I created
while performing the export of the Scott schema
in tutorial 54, similarly exp_schm.dmp is
the dump file created by expdp data pump export
during the same in tutorial 54.
Also using log-file parameter I am creating
a logfile by the name of imp.log. You can
give whatever name you want to your logfile.
Let’s execute this command
As you can see export is successful.
Now let’s see whether we have schema scott_copy
in our database or not.
For this you have to first log on to the database
using sys user. Let’s clear the screen first
Now let’s login to our database using our
sys user with sysdba privileges
Sqlplus / as sysdba
Let me quickly show you the user
SHOW user;
As you can see user is sys
Now you can query ALL_USERS view to list all
the available users in your database. Let’s
see how
SELECT username, created FROM all_users WHERE
username='SCOTT_COPY' ;
As you can see we have our user Scott copy
which is created on today’s date.
You can use Scott_copy user to log on to the
database using the same password as of the
user Scott. If you get any errors then use
alter user command and change the password.
In order to learn this you can refer to my
tutorial number 41 or 42. Links for both the
tutorials are in the description box. You
can visit my blog for in-depth knowledge of
the concept.
Hope you liked this quick Oracle tutorial.
