I am Manish from RebellionRider.com, and I
am back once again with another PL/SQL tutorial.
Today in this tutorial we will learn how to
do bulk data processing using FORALL statement
with VALUES OF bound clause in Oracle Database.
So far we have learnt how to use FORALL statement
with a dense collection using Lower &amp;amp; Upper
bound clause and a sparse collection using
INDICES OF bound clause.
What if we want to use FORALL statement only
with selected elements of the collection?
Can we do that?
Yes, we can easily do that using FORALL statement
with the third and last bound clause that
is ‘VALUES-OF’.
FORALL statement is all about binding the
collection elements with a single DML statement
in an optimized manner.
Using ‘Values-of’ bound clause of FORALL
statement we can bind the selected elements
of the collection with the DML statement.
Values-of bound clause will require two collections.
The first collection will be the source collection.
We will be doing DML operations such as insert,
delete or update on the data of this collection
using the FORALL statement.
The second collection will be the indexing
collection which will specify the index number
of selected elements from the first collection.
These selected elements will be those elements
over which you want to perform the DML operations.
This indexing collection must be a NESTED
TABLE or an ASSOCIATIVE ARRAY.
If it is an associative array then it must
be indexed by PLS_INTEGER or BINARY_INTEGER.
You can read more about the restrictions of
Values of bound clause on the blog.
Link is in the description.
Now let’s do the example and learn how to
properly use VALUES-OF bound clause with FORALL
statement in Oracle Database.
As we know that FORALL statement takes the
data from the collection and stores it into
a table.
So let’s first create the table.
CREATE TABLE tut_79 (
selected_data NUMBER(5)
);
Here we have our create table statement using
which we are creating a table with the name
tut_79 which has only one column selected_data
of number datatype.
Again we will try to keep the code as simple
as possible so that we can learn and understand
the concept clearly.
Let’s execute and create this table.
Table created.
Now that we have our table ready, let’s
jump ahead and write the PL/SQL block where
we will see how to use ‘VALUES-OF’ with
FORALL statement.
Let’s do this on a new worksheet.
Great.
DECLARE
TYPE My_NestedTable IS TABLE OF NUMBER;
source_col My_NestedTable := My_NestedTable
(9,18,27,36,45,54,63,72,81,90);
Let’ see what we just did here.
In the starting of the declaration section
of our PL/SQL block I have created a nested
table with the name My_NestedTable which can
hold data of NUMBER datatype.
Then in the second line, I have created its
collection variable with the name ‘source_col’.
Using this collection variable we have initialized
the first 10 indexes of our nested table.
This collection will act as the source collection
for our FORALL statement.
Ok, unlike the case which we have seen in
the last two tutorials this time I want to
insert only the 3rd, 7th, 8th and the 10th
element of this collection into the table
tut_79 which we just created.
So next we will create another collection
which will act as our indexing collection.
Using this collection we will limit our FORALL
statement to execute only for the 3rd, 7th,
8th and the 10th element.
Let’s do it.
TYPE My_Array IS TABLE OF PLS_INTEGER INDEX
BY pls_integer;
index_col My_Array;
Here is our indexing collection.
The data type of the element which it can
hold is PLS_INTEGER which is also the data
type of its indexing elements.
In the next line we have created its collection
variable with the name index_col.
Now, that we have declared both the required
collections; the source collection and the
indexing collection.
Next we will write the execution section.
Here we will first initialize our indexing
collection with those index numbers of source
collection whose data we want to fetch and
store into the table tut_79.
Let’s do it.
BEGIN
index_col (1):= 3;
index_col (5):= 7;
index_col (12):= 8;
index_col (28):= 10;
Here we have initialized our indexing collection
by storing 4 records into it.
Here it is clearly visible that our indexing
collection is a sparse collection because
we have not initialized it in a consecutive
manner.
We have stored the first record at index 1
while the second record at index 5 similarly
the third record at index 12 and the fourth
record at index 28.
But if you want you can store these records
in a sequential manner too.
It is completely your choice because number
of index where you store the data in your
indexing collection does not matter.
The data which you are storing into your indexing
collection matters.
If you remember, earlier we decided that we
want to execute our FORALL statement only
for fetching the data from index number 3,
7, 8 and 10 of our source collection.
Now take a look at the data we stored into
the indexing collection.
Yes, the data we stored into our indexing
collection are 3, 7, 8 and 10.
These are the number of indexes of our source
collection from which we want to fetch the
data.
Now we will use this collection in our FORALL
statement using VALUES OF bound clause.
Let’s do it then.
FORALL idx IN VALUES OF index_col
INSERT INTO tut_79 VALUES (source_col(idx));
Here is our FORALL statement.
Let’s see what we did here.
The statement starts with the keyword FORALL
followed by a variable idx.
This is an implicitly declared loop index.
Then we have another keyword IN using which
we are specifying our BOUND CLAUSE which is
VALUES OF.
After writing the reserved phrase VALUES-OF
we have specified the collection variable
of our indexing collection which is index_col.
Then we have our INSERT DML using which we
are inserting the records from our source
collection which is referenced here through
its collection variable source_col into the
table tut_79.
You just have to remember that we use the
source collection into our DML statement while
we use our indexing collection with the VALUES
OF Bound clause.
On execution this FORALL statement will fetch
the data from index 3, 7, 8 and 10 from the
source collection which is 27, 63, 72 and
90 and store it into the table tut_79.
Which means after execution we must find 27,
63, 72 and 90 stored into our table tut_79.
So let’s execute this program and check
the result.
But before that let’s quickly check, whether
the table tut_79 is empty or not.
Although it should be as we just created it,
but still.
Let’s do this in a new worksheet.
Here we go.
SELECT * FROM tut_79;
No row selected.
Which means the table is empty.
So now let’s get back to our program and
execute it.
Here is our program.
Let’s execute it.
We have an error.
Which means something is wrong somewhere.
Let’s see what is it?
Ohh, here we forgot to put the semi colon.
Now let’s try executing this program once
again.
But first let’s close this output panel.
Now let’s execute.
PL/SQL procedure successfully completed.
Which means if we check our table again then
we must find the above mentioned records there.
So let’s check it out.
Here is our desired data.
So that is how we work with values of bound
clause with FORALL statement in Oracle Database.
