I am Manish from RebellionRider.com
and I am back, yes I am back with another
PL/SQL tutorial. This will be the last tutorial
in Conditional Control statements series.
Here we will see the third and the last of
the IF statements which is called the IF THEN
ELSIF in Oracle PL/SQL.
So without wasting much of your time let’s
get started.
In the previous tutorial we saw that IF ELSE
condition gives us the provision of executing
statements not only when the condition is
evaluated to be true but also when the condition
is evaluated to be false. But using IF ELSE
statement we can only check one condition
at a time, there is no provision for checking
multiple conditions. This becomes its major
drawback.
To overcome this we have IF THEN ELSIF condition
in Oracle PL/SQL. Using this statement you
can check multiple conditions unlike the IF
conditions discussed in previous tutorials.
Let’s take a quick look at the syntax of
IF THEN ELSIF condition.
IF CONDITION 1 THEN
STATEMENT 1;
ELSIF CONDITION 2 THEN
STATEMENT 2;
ELSIF CONDITION 3 THEN
STATEMENT 3;
...
ELSE
STATEMENT N;
END IF;
Similar to the other IF conditions keyword
IF marks the beginning and reserved phrase
END IF marks the ending of the block. Make
sure to put a white space in between END and
IF of ending phrase. As you can see in this
ELSIF construct we have multiple conditions.
CONDITION 1 through CONDITION N are a sequence
of conditions that have to be evaluated to
TRUE or FALSE. These conditions are mutually
exclusive. This means that if condition 1
is evaluated to be TRUE then statement 1 is
executed and control will jump over the first
executable statement outside the ELSIF construct
and rest of the conditions will be ignored.
If condition 1 is evaluated to be false then
compiler will jump inside and check the rest
ELSIF condition and look for the one which
is true. If it finds any then it will execute
the corresponding statements otherwise it
will run the else statement.
In simple words the IF THEN ELSIF statement
is responsible for running the first statement for
which the condition is true. Once this is
done the rest of the conditions are not evaluated.
In case none of the condition is true, then
the else_statements run provided that they
exist; otherwise no action is taken by the IF THEN ELSIF statement.
So let’s jump over to our SQL Developer
and do some examples. So here we are let’s
write our first example
DECLARE
v_Place VARCHAR2(30) := '&amp;amp;Enter Place';
BEGIN
IF v_Place = 'Metropolis' THEN
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('This City Is Protected
By Superman');
ELSIF v_Place = 'Gotham' THEN
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('This City is Protected
By Batman');
ELSIF v_Place = 'Amazon' THEN
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('This City is protected
by Wonder Woman');
ELSE
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Please Call Avengers');
END IF;
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Thanks For Contacting
us');
END;
This is a very simple Example where I have
declared a variable v_place which has data
type varchar2 and we are taking input in this
variable from the user. As you can see here
I have used substitution operator. Don’t
forget to enclose this input string along
with ampersand operator inside single quotes
as variable is of varchar2 data type.
In the execution section we have our else
if construct. Where we have one IF condition
and 3 ELSIF conditions. Every condition is
accompanied with a DBMS_OUTPUT statement which
will get executed if the respective condition
is evaluated to be true. Otherwise the DBMS_OUTPUT
statement in ELSE section will run. Once this
block is executed then control will come out
and execute the first executable statement
outside the ELSIF construct which is our last
DBMS_OUTPUT statement. So let’s execute
this example and see the result.
Let’s give Amazon as our input. Here is
the result. Strings from both the DBMS_OUTPUT
statements are here. Let’s execute once
again but this time input will be something
which is not specified in any of the conditions
here.
Let’s say this time input will be Rio
As you can see this time string from else
section is returned as there is no condition
in our construct which will be true for our
input.
One thing I forgot to mention here is that
the spelling of ELSIF is not ELSEIF rather
it’s ELSIF. Yes there is no second E in
the spelling. So be careful while writing
the code.
Hope this made your concept of IF THEN ELSIF
clear. I have already explained the rest two
conditional statements CASE and DECODE, I
would suggest you to watch the respective
tutorials. Links are in the description below.
Also you can read about the same topic from
my website. You can even get this same program
which we did here from there.
With this I will wind up today’s tutorial.
Comment and tell me how you like this series
of Conditional statements in PL/SQL also you
