I Manish from rebellionrider.com
And today I am going to do the unboxing of
brand new Motorola Moto g2 or Motorola Moto g second
generation which is a budget smartphone recently
launched by Motorola. But before moving ahead
a hearty thanks to dear friend who let me
unbox and review this brand new Motorola moto
g2 on my YouTube channel.
This phone is exclusively available on Flipkart.
And costs only 12999 Indian Rupees which is
approx. 215 us dollars
So let’s start the unboxing.
Unlike other budget phones in the same category
Motorola keeps the box of moto g2 very minimal.
Let’s open the box and see what’s inside it?
First thing which comes in front of you as
soon as you open this box is the phone itself.
Motorola has launched Moto g2 in 2 different
colors white and black and we have a white
color variant here for the unboxing.
Ok apart from the phone you will also get
– a travel charger and head sets and some
manuals. This box doesn’t include any USB
connecting cables.
Though the price of the phone is very low
but the phone itself doesn’t feel cheap
at all.
When you hold the phone for the first time
in your hand you will feel that this phone
screams quality.
At the front of Moto g2 we have 5 inches IPS
LCD screen with Gorilla Glass 3 protection,
This is a 720p HD screen with 720 x 1280 pixels
resolution and approx. 294 Pixel density which
means good color depth on the display.
And we also get 2MP front camera along with
2 audio speakers.
You must have already seen this kind of front
speaker with Motorola Moto E.
At the back of the phone we have 8 mega Pixel
autofocus Camera with LED flash. This camera
is capable of recording 720p HD videos on
30frame per second with stereo sound. Moto
g2 has packed several interesting features
with this camera such as Auto Focus, Slow
Motion Video, Burst Mode, Auto HDR, Panorama
and Tap to Focus. The material of the back
cover of moto g2 is smooth when you touch
it and you don’t get any fingerprints.
And of course how can I forget to mention
the most talked about dimple with Motorola
logo on it.
On the right side of the phone we have power
button and the volume lockers whereas left
side of Moto G2 has nothing.
On the top of the phone we have 3.5 mm audio
jack for headset along with the noise cancellation
microphone.
At the bottom we have Micro-USB charging port.
Under the battery cover you will get a 2070mAH
un-detachable battery.
We also have 2 SIM card slots for micro SIMs
both of which support 3G GSM network. But
you can only use 3g Network on one SIM at
a time and not on both the SIMs together.
This phone comes with 16GB internal storage
and unlike the previous Motorola Moto G this
time with Moto G2 we have a Micro SD slot
using which you can extend your memory up
to 32 GBs.
This phone has Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 processor
with 1.2 GHz quad-core CPU along with Adreno
305 GPU and 1GB RAM.
Now let’s talk about the sensors in Motorola
moto g2. This phone comes with proximity,
ambient light and the accelerometer sensor.
Proximity sensor which turns off the display
when you are on a call, the accelerometer
controls the orientation of the phone and
helps with motion gaming. The ambient light
sensor adjusts the screen's brightness for
optimal viewing in different conditions
All together these high end specifications
give you a very smooth Moto G2 experience
in a pocket friendly price.
Verdicts
Though the phone will give a premium quality
feel yet the head phones which comes packed
with the phone seems quite minimal with below
average sound quality.
With the previous Moto G, users faced Muffled
voice speaker problem during call. But with
this second generation Moto G I haven’t
faced any such problem.
If you ask me about the review then I will
go with 9 out of 10 as the headphones put
a bit of a damper on the rest of the excellent
features. I would also like to give you all
a heads up for the charger – it has very
less juice of just 0.5 ampere which may lead
to your phone taking extensive time to get
charged. If you want quick charging then better
buy a universal charger of 1.5 ampere or more.
Apart from that, Motorola Moto G2 is a great
budget phone and worth buying. That’s all
guys. Hope you liked this unboxing and impromptu
review. Please hit the like button and do
subscribe for more interesting videos. Take
care &amp;amp; have a good day. This is Manish!</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
