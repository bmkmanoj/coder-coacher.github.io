rebellionrider.com and in this video we
will learn what RV arrays in oracle
database really is an important topic
because it is seen that generally there
is always a question on it in
certification exam in order to minimize
any confusion we will first take a brief
and quick look at intro of we Ares
collection so let's cut to the chase and
start the tutorial free arrays which is
an acronym of variable sized arrays were
introduced in Oracle a died back in 1998
as a modified format of nested table the
major modification can be seen in a
storage orientation there are no
noticeable changes in the implementation
but their storage orientation is
completely different than the nested
tables
unlike nested table which requires an
external table for its storage via
arrays are stored in line with their
parent record as row value in the parent
table it means no more need of store as
Clause hang on but I relieve no
unnecessary I use and on top of that
increase performance as I mentioned the
implementation of a V array is going to
be the same as nested table does I
highly suggest you to go through the
previous tutorial on how to create
nested table link is on your screen as
well as in the description that being
said let's move ahead and check out the
syntax of V Harris type collection in
Oracle database very similar to nested
tables are persistent type of collection
which means they can be created as
database object that can be saved for
later use or as a member of PL sequel
block first let's see the syntax for
creating V arrays as database object
apart from few changes the syntax is
similar to the nested table let's check
out those changes as we are creating a
type does we use create type statement
which has an optional clause or replace
in between these two keyword this Clause
looks for the type with the same name if
it finds any then it changes its
definition according to this statement
otherwise it creates one for you then
there is type name which can be anything
you want followed by another keyword is
then we have keyword theory or result
phrase varying Airy you can use
whichever you feel comfortable with I
personally like very short and simple
the purpose of writing the vieira is to
tell the compiler what type of
collection you are creating then we have
this size limit oh wait I think I forgot
to tell you that unlike nested table
where is our boundary form of collection
and that is why we have size limit here
which is something you will not find in
nasty table by bounded I mean you have
to decide how many elements you want to
store in your collection while declaring
it whereas in nasty table which is
unbounded type of collection there is no
upper cap on number of elements then we
have given off followed by that we have
to specify the type of elements which
you want your collection to hold this
could be primitive data type or
user-defined data type this is the
syntax for creating V arrays as database
object now let's take a look at another
syntax as you can see both the syntax
are same except this time we do not have
keyword create because here we are
declaring aviary as a member of PL
sequel block and not creating it as a
database object the scope of the VLE
which is declared inside the PL sequel
block is limited to the block in which
it is created also remember similar to
nested table we can declare V array only
in this declaration section of PL sequel
block that is the syntax for creating a
PL sequel V array type collection in
Oracle database now you will ask is it
possible to change the size limit of a V
array after its declaration the answer
to this question is of course it is
possible you can modify the size limit
of your very whenever you want by using
altered type TTL statement and here is
the syntax for modifying this size limit
of a VRE after writing the Clause
altered type you have to specify the
name of your
VRE which you want to modify there after
you have to write a clause modify limit
this clause informs the compiler that
user wants to modify the limit followed
by that you have to specify an integer
which will be the new size limit of your
V array try to make sure that this
integer is greater than the current
maximum number of elements in the V
array at the end we have two important
clauses invalidate and cascade these
clauses will help you in dealing with
the dependent objects such as if you
decide to go with the invalidate it will
invalidate all the dependent objects
without any checking mechanism and if
you decided to go with the Cascade then
the changes will propagate to dependent
types and table that is all about how
you can modify this size limit of PV
array what about if you want to delete
it completely from your database to find
out how to drop a VRE check out the
block this is a quick introduction of PL
sequel v area you can always head over
