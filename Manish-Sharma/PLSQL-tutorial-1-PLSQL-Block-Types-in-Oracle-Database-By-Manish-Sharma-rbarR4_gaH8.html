I am Manish from RebellionRider.com.
Today’s PL/SQL tutorial is about Blocks
in PL/SQL programs.
So without further ado let’s get started
with the quick intro of PL/SQL language.
PL/SQL stands for procedural language-standard
query language.
It is a significant member of Oracle programming
tool set which is extensively used to code
server side programming.
Similar to SQL language PL/SQL is also a case-insensitive
programming language.
Generally a program written in PL/SQL language
is divided into blocks.
We can say blocks are basic programming units
in PL/SQL programming language.
There are two types of blocks in PL/SQL
1.
Anonymous Block
2.
Named Block
Both type of PL/SQL blocks are further divided
into 3 different sections which are
1.
The Declaration Section
2.
The Execution Section and
3.
The Exception-handling Section
The Execution Section is the only mandatory
section of block whereas Declaration and Exception
Handling sections are optional.
And here is the basic prototypes of Anonymous
PL/SQL block
DECLARE
Declaration Statements
BEGIN
Executable statements
Exception
Exception handling statements
END;
Let’s quickly discuss each of these sections
in brief.
You can visit my blog for detailed explanation
and examples.
The link is in the description box below.
Declaration Section
This is the first section of PL/SQL block
which contains definition of PL/SQL identifiers
such as variables, Constants, cursors and
so on.
You can say this is the place where all local
variables used in the program are defined
and documented.
Also Declaration sections always start with
keyword DECLARE.
Execution Section
This section contains executable statements
that allow you to manipulate the variables
that have been declared in the declaration
section.
The execution Section of any PL/SQL block
always begins with the Keyword BEGIN and ends
with the Keyword END.
This is the only mandatory section in PL/SQL
block.
This section supports all DML commands and
SQL*PLUS built-in functions.
It also supports DDL commands using Native
Dynamic SQL (NDS) or DMBS_SQL built-in package.
Exception-Handling Section
This is the last section of PL/SQL block which
is optional just like the declaration section.
This section contains statements that are
executed when a runtime error occurs within
the block.
We can say all exception handling code goes
here.
You can visit my blog where I have explained
this tutorial in more detail covering all
the parts which will help you face Interview
questions or Oracle Certification exam.

With this I will wind up today’s tutorial.
