rebellionrider.com and i am back again
with another quickly short SQL tutorial
and today's SQL tutorial video is an
introduction to joins in SQL I know I
should have done this video before my
previous tutorial which was about
natural join I am really sorry for that
guys please don't yell at me but if you
want you can watch my previous tutorial
the link is in the description box below
let's start this tutorial so what is
join in SQL joins our SQL operations
which helps us in retrieving data from
one or more tables that shares common
columns note here in definition I said
one or more tables because self joins
requires only one table now the second
question is why do we need joins in SQL
many a time we need to work using
multiple tables at the same time
assuming them to be a single entity in
such case a single SQL statement
manipulates the data from the entire
table this function is achieved by using
join basically there are four types of
joins in SQL inner join outer join cross
join and cell showing where outer join
can further be divided into three more
categories right outer join left outer
join and full outer join
apart from types of joints we have to
join condition equi-join and known
equi-join to read what are equi and
nanak we joins and to have more in-depth
knowledge of joins in SQL visit this web
