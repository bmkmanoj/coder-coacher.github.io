I am Manish from Rebellion Rider.com.
And I am back once again with the most demanded
tutorial on my Social Media and YouTube that
is the PL/SQL Stored procedures.
Yes, in today’s PL/SQL tutorial we will
learn what are Stored Procedures in Oracle
Database?
So without further ado let’s start the tutorial
with a question which is.
What are stored procedures in Oracle Database?
Similar to PL/SQL Functions a stored Procedure
is a self-contained subprogram that is meant
to do some specific tasks.
Also similar to functions, procedures are
named PL/SQL blocks thus they can be reused
because they are stored into the database
as a database object.
But unlike PL/SQL functions a stored procedure
does not return any value.
Let’s quickly take a look at the syntax
for creating a PL/SQL Stored procedure in
Oracle Database.
CREATE [OR REPLACE] PROCEDURE pro_name (Parameter
– List)
IS
Declare statements
BEGIN
Executable statements
END procedure name;
/
Here is the syntax for creating a stored PL/SQL
procedure in Oracle Database.
Similar to the syntax of a PL/SQL function
this one is also divided into two parts.
First is the header of the stored procedure
which will consist of the signature or say
the definition of your procedure.
Next is the body of the procedure.
The body will comprise of all the declaration
and the execution statements.
Now let’s take a detailed look at this syntax.
The keyword CREATE marks the beginning of
the syntax followed by another keyword “Procedure”
which tells your compiler what kind of object
you want to create.
It also helps you in recognizing the stored
procedures among several other similar looking
objects.
In between keyword create and procedure we
have a clause “Or Replace” which is actually
an additional clause.
This additional clause will help you in modifying
the definition and declaration of your stored
procedure without having it dropped.
Then we have the name of the procedure.
This could be anything, after all it is completely
user defined as long as it satisfies the Oracle
Database naming norms followed by that we
have the parameter list.
A procedure can have zero, one or more than
one parameters.
In case you have a procedure which has more
than one parameter then do make sure to separate
each of these parameters using comma (,). Also
enclose each of these parameters inside the
parenthesis.
And then we have another keyword IS.
This keyword indicates the ending of the header
of a procedure.
Once you are done designing the signature
of your procedure in the header, you are all
set to take a step ahead and start writing
your declaration and executable statements.
If your code requires you to declare a variable,
constant, a cursor or anything else, then
you can do so right after the IS keyword and
that too without using the DECLARE keyword
just like we did in case of anonymous blocks
or named blocks such as triggers.
Then inside the body of the stored procedure
we have two keywords which are BEGIN and END.
The keyword BEGIN marks the starting of the
execution section of the stored procedure
and keyword END marks the ending of the same.
In between these 2 keywords you can write
your executable statements which will later
define the working of your PL/SQL procedure.
Lastly followed by the END keyword we again
have the procedure name.
It is the same name which you have specified
in the header of the procedure.
Putting the name of your procedure after the
END keyword is optional and it completely
depends on whether you want to write it or
not.
Though specifying the stored procedure name
in the ending is optional but it is a good
practice.
Sometimes it could prove really helpful, especially
when your procedure has huge number of line
of codes then putting the name in the ending
emphasizes the END that matches the CREATE
statement, and enables the PL/SQL compiler
to flag mismatched BEGIN-END pairs as early
as possible.
It also makes your code easy to read.
Apart from all the keyword and clauses discussed
in this syntax we have an extra clause which
is AUTHID.
I have explained this clause in detail in
my blog on the same topic.
You can also check out the same blog for more
in depth knowledge about PL/SQL Stored Procedures.

That’s it for this tutorial on Introduction
to PL/SQL procedures in Oracle database.
Do make sure to subscribe as I am going to
show you the live demonstration of how to
create PL/SQL Procedures in Oracle database
in the next PL/SQL tutorial with the help
of a very easy example.

thumbs up.
