I am Manish from RebelionRider.com.
Recently we have completed tutorials on CASE
and DECODE functions I hope you enjoyed them!
Today with this tutorial I am going to start
another series which will be on Data Pump
in Oracle Database.
So Without further ado let’s start todays
tutorial.
Data pump in oracle database is a server based
technology which enables very high speed movement
of data and metadata from one database to
another.
As we know using data pump we can export as
well as import the data to and from one database
to another database using expdp and impdp
command line clients provided by data pump.
Using export (expdp) and Import (impdp) command
line utilities we can either export or import
complete database or a subset of database
for example database schema, tablespace or
even individual tables.
So let’s start by learning how to export
complete database using expdp command line
utility of data pump.
Exporting complete database or subset of database
is a 3 step process.
Step 1: Make a Directory or Create a Folder
The first step is to make a directory or in
windows language create a folder.
Note here, this step must be performed by
privileged user such as sys or system and
directory must be created on server system
rather than client system
Just make a folder anywhere in your system
and give it some logical name.
If this export is a part of your backup strategy
then it’s advisable to avoid making the
folder on the same partition which also contains
your Oracle home directory or OS bootable
files.
So I am making a folder in my D drive by the
name of Data pump and inside the Data pump
we are going to create another directory by
the name of full export.
This folder full export will contain all the
files created by expdp utility of data pump.
Before moving ahead let me tell you if you
are using Mac or LINUX systems then don’t
worry steps for exporting data are the same.
Ok let’s move on to the 2nd step.
Step 2: Making Directory Object and Granting
Privileges
We just created a directory now in our second
step we will make a directory object and will
grant this directory object some mandatory
privileges.This step should also be done by
privileged user on server side thus I will
log on to my database using my sys user with
sysdba privileges and for this I will use
command prompt.
Let me quickly show you the user as you can
see right now I am connected to my database
using my sys user.
Now to create a directory object we use CREATE
DIRECTORY command.
Let see how
SQL&amp;gt; CREATE DIRECTORY orcl_full AS ‘D:\Data
Pump\full export’;
Here in this query ORCL_FULL is a directory
object which is just a name mapped over a
directory path.
Or you can say that it’s just a pointer
pointing over a directory which you want your
expdp utility to use when storing all exported
files.
Mind here CREATE DIRECTORY command will not
create any actual directory in your system
this command only helps you in creating a
directory object.
Let’s hit enter directory created
You can share this directory object with the
user who wants to perform the export.
In our case this user will be the HR user.
The next thing after creating a directory
object is to grant read and write privileges
on the directory to the user who wants to
perform the export of data.
Let’s see how.
This is just a simple grant statement and
the grant succeeded
SQL&amp;gt; GRANT read, write ON DIRECTORY orcl_full
TO hr;
Now the plot is all set, but still HR user
cannot perform the full database export because
HR user does not have required set of privileges.
Oracle has grouped these set of privileges
into a role and that role is DATAPUMP_EXP_FULL_DATABASE.
So now we have to grant this role to the user
HR.
By the way I have done a video on user roles
where I have explained what the roles are
and how you can create a role as well as grant
it to the users.
If you want then you can watch this video.
Link is in the description box.
Ok let’s grant this role to our user HR
SQL&amp;gt; GRANT DATAPUMP_EXP_FULL_DATABASE TO hr;
And grant succeeded Now everything is done.
Let’s move on to our step 3.
And the step 3 is exporting data
Step 3: Export Data
To perform the export we use expdp command
line utility of data pump and expdp is a command
prompt utility thus we cannot execute expdp
on SQL prompt thus we have to come out of
our SQL prompt for that simply write exit.
Now we are on our command prompt let’s clear
the screen first.
Now we will write our expdp command.
Let’s see how.
C:\&amp;gt;expdp hr/hr@ORCL DIRECTORY=orcl_full DUMPFILE=orclfull.dmp
LOGFILE=full_exp.log FULL=YES;
At the starting we have expdp which is a utility
for unloading the data and metadata into a
set of operating system files called dump
file sets.
After this we have our user login information
using this information expdp utility of data
pump will log into the database
And then we have DIRECTORY parameter which
is set on the directory object orcl_full which
we just created.
This parameter specifies the default location
to which export can write the set of dump
file and log files.
Followed by directory we have DUMPFILE parameter.
The dump file is made up of one or more disk
files that contain table data, database object’s
metadata and control information.
These files are written in binary format and
dump files can be imported only by data pump
impdp import utility.
As these files are written in binary format
by server using expdp export utility thus
they should not be tampered.
Changing information in these file might compromise
the data consistency which may cause an error
while importing.
You can supply multiple file names here separated
by comma.
Dot dmp is the default extension for dump
file if no extension is given then expdp export
utility will use this default extension.
Though you can specify whatever extension
you want but it’s always advisable to use
the oracle recommended extensions.
And then we have log file parameter using
log file parameter expdp export utility will
generate a human readable log file for you
which are very helpful in tracking the status
of your export.
And at the end we have parameter FULL which
is set on YES indicates that all the data
and metadata are to be exported.
At the back of the command prompt as you can
see is our directory which we have specified
as our default location and as you can see
it’s empty.
Now let’s execute our expdp command on command
prompt for that simple hit enter time taken
in exporting the data depends on the size
of your database.
As you can see this process gonna take some
time so what I am going to do I am going to
fast forward this process
As you can see export is successful and let’s
take a look of our default directory and here
is our dump and log file.
Let’s check the property of our dump file
and as you can see here the size of our dump
file is 169 MB and here is our log file let’s
take a look this log file also this log file
contains all the information of regarding
this export if there is any error then I would
have been listed her in this log file.
I suggest you to read my blog here on this
blog you’ll find lots of different things
on data pump export such as different components
of data pump, working of data pump, introduction
of expdp export utility, types of export in
data pump along with all the steps and commands
of exporting full data base which I just showed
you with more in-depth explanation such as
why directory object is required and restriction
with full database export.
