Josh light that's a tweet directly from
Oracle SQL Developer and the credit for
this goes to you my lovely audience as
without your support this would not have
been possible do check out the street on
your Twitter and don't forget to hit
that favourite button what's up Internet
i am manish from rebellionrider.com and
i am back once again with another short
and crispy pl/sql tutorial this tutorial
will be about first collection method
which is count I think calling this
tutorial short won't be right but
anyways I will try to keep it under 10
minutes before we start the tutorial let
me take a quick second to ask you to
subscribe if you haven't already also
make sure to smash that thumbs up button
and like the video let's aim for hundred
likes see if we can reach hundred likes
on this video in a week
that being said without taking much of
your time let's start the tutorial
collection method count returns the
number of elements in an initialized
collection if use with an initialize
collection with no elements it returns
zero in case of nested table collection
method count only returns the number of
non-empty elements as it is possible for
a nested table to have individual
elements that are empty let's write some
code and see how we can use this
collection method
that is the same nested table which we
created in PL sequel tutorial 51 on how
to create nested table in PL sequel
block as you can see here after creating
the nested table we initialized it and
inserted 10 elements into it which means
this nested table has 10 elements in it
now let's try to get this information
using the collection method count on
execution we will get the total number
of elements stored into our nest a table
let's execute and see here is the result
which is 10 similarly you can use the
count method with if condition let's see
how but before that let's close the
script output and delete this section
that is how you can use count method
with if condition but most commonly we
use count method with loop to cycle
through the collection like this here we
use collection method count in the loop
statement using the function count we
are making sure that our loop executes
from 1 to the total number of elements
we have in our collection which will be
returned by this function this
collection method count dynamically
assigns the total number of elements
that we have into the collection imagine
if we don't have this collection method
we will first have to count the total
number of elements manually and then
write them down into our code also keep
the cold updated every time someone
inserts or deletes an element from the
collection it is easy when the
collection is a small but what if we
have a huge collection of say several
thousand elements then this will become
a pain in the anyways these are few of
the ways of using count method now let
your creativity fly and find out various
other ways to use this function if you
find something new then comment down
below and let me know meanwhile give
this video a thumbs up also by sharing
this tutorial you can help others in
learning and our channel in going this
is the tutorial on collection method
count in Oracle database thanks for
watching this is manish from
