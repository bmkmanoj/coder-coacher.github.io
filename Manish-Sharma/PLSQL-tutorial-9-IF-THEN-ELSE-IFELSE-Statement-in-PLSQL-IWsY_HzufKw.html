Welcome back once again
I am Manish from RebellionRider.com. So the
previous tutorial was all about simple IF-THEN
statement in Oracle PL/SQL. There we learnt
that simple IF-THEN statement enables us to
specify the sequence of statements to be executed
only if the condition is evaluated to be true.
In case this condition is evaluated to be
false then no special action is to be taken
except to proceed with execution of the program.
To overcome this drawback in oracle PL/SQL
we have IF-THEN-ELSE statement widely pronounced
as IF-ELSE statement.
With IF-THEN-ELSE in PL/SQL we have two groups
of executable statements, one which gets executed
if the condition is evaluated to be true and
another group gets executed if the condition
is evaluated to be false. Once the IF-THEN-ELSE
construct gets completed the next statement
right after IF-THEN-ELSE block is executed.
Let’s take a quick look at the syntax of
IF-THEN-ELSE statement.
And here is the syntax as you can see IF-THEN-ELSE
construct starts with the keyword IF and ends
with the reserved phrase END IF. Which is
very similar to the simple IF THEN statement
which we saw in the previous tutorial.
Anyways followed by IF keyword we have to
specify a valid condition which will get evaluated.
If this condition is evaluated to be TRUE
then control is passed to the statement 1,
and if this condition is evaluated to be false
then control will jump over statement 2. Once
the construct is completed then statement
3 is executed.
Hope this made the concept of IF THEN ELSE
clear to you all. If you still have any question
or suggestions then feel free to leave a comment
down below.
So now it’s time to do some examples because
they are the best way to understand the concept.
I think you all will agree with me on this.
So let’s jump over SQL Developer and do
some examples
So we will start with a very simple example
Here in this example we will take a numeric
input from the user and will check whether
a user has entered an even number or an odd
number using IF THEN ELSE statement. This
is gonna be a very easy example.
SET SERVEROUTPUT ON;
DECLARE
v_num NUMBER := &amp;amp;enter_a_number;
BEGIN
IF MOD (v_num, 2) = 0 THEN
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE (v_num || ' Is Even');
ELSE
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE (v_num ||' is odd');
END IF;
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE ('IF THEN ELSE Construct
complete ');
END;
In the declaration section of this block I
have declared a variable v_num with data type
NUMBER and using substitution operator I am
taking values from the user.
Next in the execution section of the block
we have our IF THEN ELSE construct where we
are checking whether the number entered by
the user is even or odd. For this test I have
used MOD function of Oracle library as our
IF condition which will divide the first parameter
by the second parameter and return the remainder
or say Modulus. If this modulus is zero then
number will be even otherwise number will
be odd. Thus if the modulus comes as zero
then control will jump over first DBMS_OUTPUT
statement and will print the given string
but if modulus is not zero then control will
jump over the 2nd DBMS_OUTPUT statement and
display its string. Once this is complete
then control will come out from the IF THEN
ELSE construct and will print the third DBMS_OUTPUT
statement.
So let’s execute this PL/SQL block and check
the result. My first input will be 20 and
here is the result. Let’s execute once again
and this time let’s take 25 as an input
number. 25 is odd and that is our result.
You can visit my blog and copy this example
and try it by yourself. Link is in the description.
I am always willing to learn new things from
you guys. So if you have any better example
for IF THEN ELSE statement in PL/SQL demonstration
then please feel free to comment or you can
tweet me the screenshot of your code @RebellionRider.
With this I’ll take your leave. Thanks for
giving your time hope you enjoyed watching.
Please give this video a thumbs up and share
it on your social also don’t forget to subscribe.
Will see you soon with another tutorial till
then take care.
