I am Manish from RebellionRider.com and 
I am back once again with another Oracle Database
tutorial. Today in this tutorial we will learn
about SQLFILE parameter of IMPDP data pump
import. Most probably this will be the last
tutorial in Oracle Data pump import and export
series.
So let’s jump ahead and see what SQLFILE
parameter is and what is its use?
As the name suggests SQLFILE parameter generates
a SQL file or say SQL script based on the
other parameter in impdp data pump import.
This script contains all the DDL that would
have been executed by impdp data pump in back
ground to perform the import.
There are few things which you must know about
SQLFILE parameter
1. The SQL script created by this parameter
only contains the SQL DDL statements and no
other types of statements.
2. Whenever you use SQLFILE parameter in your
impdp data pump import command then impdp
utility does not actually perform an import
rather it just generates a SQL script and
your target system remains unchanged.
So let’s move on and do some examples
Example 1: In the first example we will see
the use of SQL file parameter with tablespace
import.
C:\&amp;gt;impd system/oracle@ORCL DIRECTORY= exp_tblsp
DUMPFILE=tablespace.dmp TABLESPACES=users
This is a simple import command which on execution
will import the user tablespace into target
system because I haven’t yet added the SQLFILE
parameter to it. If we will add the SQLFile
parameter to this command then this command
will only generate the SQL script rather than
actually performing the tablespace import.
So let’s add the SQLFILE parameter to this
command and then execute
SQLFILE= tblsp_script.sql
Now on executing this command impdp import
will generate a SQL script which will contain
all the SQL DDL statements which are executed
by the impdp data pump import in background
for importing the tablespace into target system.
Let’s execute the command. Import is successful.
So let’s checkout this SQL script which
we just created.
The location of the script will be the directory
that is pointed by the directory object exp_tblsp
which we used as a value of Directory parameter.
Hence in this case the location of the script
pointed by the directory object is D:\Data
Pump\Tablespace export.
Here we are and here is our SQL file. Let
me open it for you and as you can see. These
are all the SQL DDL statements executed by
the impdp data pump import.
So if you are a keen learner and want to see
how data pump import works then you can take
help of this SQLFILE parameter.
Ok let’s move ahead
As impdp data pump import does not actually
perform an import when SQLFILE parameter is
used therefore in some cases, you can use
this feature to your advantage. For example
suppose you have a dumpfile and no other information
such as what kind of data this dumpfile contains
or say what type of export made this dumpfile
then to find out all these information you
can use SQL file parameter of impdp data pump
import.
But remember to find out what kind of export
made the dumpfile requires high level understanding
of DDL statements as well as experience.
Let me demonstrate it for you
But first let’s clear the screen so that
we can see things properly. Ok here we go
C:\&amp;gt; impdp system/oracle@ORCL DIRECTORY= orcl_full
DUMPFILE=orclfull.dmp SQLFILE=check.sql
Here in this impdp command I used ORCLfull.dmp
dumpfile which is in the directory D:\Data
Pump\Full Export pointed by directory object
orcl_full.
On executing this command impdp data pump
import will create a SQL file named check.sql
in the directory pointed by orcl full directory
object
Let’s execute
Import successful let’s check the SQL file.
Here it is. Though I already know that the
dumpfile orclfull.dmp is created by full database
export but still if you go through this SQL
file you will find that this SQL script contains
DDL for creating tablespace, profiles, users,
tables, roles and many more which clearly
indicates that the dumpfile used is created
while exporting full database.
That’s it for today. I hope you learnt something
and enjoyed the tutorial.
