I am Manish from rebellionrider.com and
I am back once again with another SQL tutorial.
And Today�s SQL tutorial is about Cross
Join.
Till now we have seen Natural Join, Right
and Left outer Join, Full outer join and Inner
Join.
If you haven�t watched these tutorials then
I am putting the link in the description box.
I suggest you watch them to fully understand
the concept of join.
Let�s start todays tutorial over cross join.
And it�s probably the last tutorial in SQL
JOIN tutorial series.
Cross Join is also known by the name of Cartesian
join because it produces Cartesian product
of the tables which are participating in the
Join queries.
What I mean here is that each row in the first
table is paired with all the rows in the second
table.
Let�s have a look of syntax
SELECT column names FROM table 1 CROSS JOIN
table 2;
In comparison to other Joins cross join has
the simplest syntax.
In the first line we have our Select statement
where you can specify the list of columns
from both the participating tables.
In the second line we have our tables and
join clause which is CROSS JOIN.
You can write either Cross Join or just put
a comma in between the names of both tables.
Yes with the cross join we do not have any
ON or USING join condition.
But you may, however, specify a WHERE and
ORDER BY clause.
Note if you are using ORDER BY clause then
make sure it must the last statement of your
SQL query.
Hope the syntax is clear now.
Let�s jump over SQL developer.
Once again we will be using the same table
which we have used so far in the Outer Join
series.
These are the emp and dept tables.
Before that just want to tell you that you
can download this SQL script from my website.
Link is in the description box;
SELECT emp_name, dept_name FROM emp CROSS
JOIN dept;
Query is fairly simple; we are selecting emp
name and dept name from emp and dept table.
Let�s execute and check out the result.
Here in the result, the first record of emp
name column of emp table which is Steve gets
paired with all the rows of the second table
dept.
Similarly second record Nancy gets paired
with all the rows of dept table and so on.
As this cross join produces a Cartesian product
thus total number of rows in result will be
equal to total number of rows in table 1 multiplied
by total number of rows in table 2.
Since in our case we have total 5 rows in
each table thus total number of rows in our
result is 25.
As I told you guys while explaining syntax
that instead of writing CROSS JOIN in our
Join clause we can also put comma between
the names of both the tables.
Let�s check it out
Let�s copy our previous query and modify
it.
Now we will replace this cross join with a
comma.
Ok
Now let�s execute
See, both the queries produce the same result.
Before winding up today�s cross join tutorial
let�s quickly try WHERE clause with CROSS
JOIN,
Say you want to see only those records where
dept name is IT.
Let�s copy this query and save the time.
And now we will append this query with WHERE
clause.
Let�s execute.
Here is our result containing only those records
where dept name is IT only.
That�s it for today hope you enjoyed watching.
Please if you like this video then be generous
and give me a thumbs up this motivates me
to keep doing more such videos.
You can also share my videos on your social
networking and help me in getting more subscribers.
And Yes Don�t forget to subscribe.
Will see you soon with another SQL tutorial.
Till than take care.
And enjoy watching and keep SQLing�
