rebellionrider.com and i am back once
again with another PL sequel tutorial
can you recall how many PL sequel
collection functions and procedures do
we have in Oracle database yes you are
absolutely right we have seven
collection functions and three
collection procedures in Oracle database
in total we have 10 collection methods
and among these we have already
discussed these seven collection
functions so far now it's time to move
on to the remaining three collection
procedures the study in this tutorial we
will discuss the first PL sequel
collection procedure which is delete but
before moving ahead I just want to
remind you to hit that thumbs up button
and like the video let's see if we can
reach 100 likes in a week this time also
help others in learning as well as help
us and our channel in growing by sharing
this video on your social media with
your friend and in case if you are new
to our channel then don't wait go ahead
and subscribe that being said let's
start the tutorial as you have already
guessed from its name the PL sequel
collection procedure delete removes
elements from the collection this
collection method can be used with all
three types of collections that are
nested table we Ares and associative
arrays connection procedure delete is an
overloaded procedure which means you can
use the same procedure in three
different ways
these three different ways are simple
procedure call without any parameter if
the PL sequel collection procedure
delete is used without any parameter
then it will remove all the elements
from the collection procedure call with
single parameter this single parameter
is the valid index number or the
collection collection procedure delete
called by passing a valid index number
will remove the element of the specific
index procedure call with two parameters
this V of calling delete procedure is
termed as
range delete in this way of calling you
have to specify two indexes and the
procedure deletes the range of elements
which fall between start index and
ending index now let's write an example
and see the practical demonstration of
the above discussed theory this is just
a simple program to show you what value
is a stored at index 5 let's execute as
you can see this program returned the
value stored at index 5 which is 10 now
we will modify this same code for
demonstrating the all 3 overloaded call
of PL sequel collection method delete
let's start with the second V which is
procedure call with single argument
the first statement inside the execution
section is seen from the previous code
in the second statement we have the
collection procedure delete call with
single argument and that argument is
index number five this call will delete
the data stored at index five and the
third statement is an output statement
to confirm whether the procedure delete
has deleted the data or not let's
execute and see the result
so in the result we received no data
find error this is good you must be
wondering what is there to be happy
about in this error actually let's see
this error from the beggining initially
we have the output from our first
statement which is the value 10 this
shows that there was a value stored at
the index 5 before the procedure call
but after the procedure call we found no
data at index 5 which in turn causes the
error this means that our procedure call
did its work and deleted the data stored
at index 5 and that's exactly what we
want right what about this error then it
can easily be resolved with proper
exception handling or the right use of
if-then-else statement let me show you
now we have properly formatted the code
using the if-then-else a statement that
if part will execute only if the
procedure didn't delete the data from
the specific index otherwise the else
part will come into the action and show
the string data is deleted let's execute
the program once again and see the
result here is the desired result now
let's see the third V of the lead
procedure calling which is range delete
suppose you want to delete the data from
index 2 to index 6 let's modify this
code and see how we can achieve this
result
just a second I think yeah okay now
everything is good the first statement
in the execution section is the PL
sequel collection method delete calls
with two arguments which is the starting
and ending index here the starting index
is 2 and the ending index is 6
this means this procedure call will
delete all the elements from index 2 to
index 6 below this procedure call we
have a for loop which is displaying the
stored data from our collection this
loop will show you the data only from
those indexes which are not empty
because of this if condition let's
execute and see the result here we are
you can see in this result set that we
don't have rows returned from index 2 to
6 now that you have learned how to use
collection method le to remove elements
from a specific index or from range of
index let's move on to the only case
which is left that is the first one
which is PL sequel collection procedure
delete with no argument how about you
try this case all by yourself go ahead
and try it if you want me to review your
code then you can send me your program
on my Facebook or Twitter links are in
the description also you can pick help
from the blog on the same topic there
you can also find more in-depth
knowledge about the topic along with all
the possible questions that you may face
in an interview or your certification
exam that's the tutorial on PL sequel
connection method delete in Oracle
database hope you enjoyed watching and
known something new please do make sure
