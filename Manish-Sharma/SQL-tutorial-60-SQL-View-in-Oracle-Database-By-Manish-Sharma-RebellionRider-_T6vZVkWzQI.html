My Name is Manish and you can find me on RebellionRider.com
where we make learning SQL and Oracle Database
fun and today in this SQL tutorial we will
learn what is a View with respect to Oracle
Database?
Yes this tutorial is all about VIEW in Oracle
Database.
So without wasting further time let’s start
the tutorial.
A view is nothing but a logical table stored
in a database.
We can also define a VIEW as a SELECT Statement
with a name which is stored in a database
as though it were a table.
All the DML commands which you can perform
on a table can be performed on a view also.
Of course there are some restrictions which
we will discuss in this tutorial.
You can visit my blog on the same topic for
more in-depth knowledge.
So let’s create some views but before that
let’s take a look at the syntax.
CREATE VIEW view_name AS SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name WHERE condition;
This is a syntax of a very simple view which
starts with the CREATE and VIEW keyword followed
by the name of the View, you can assign any
name of your desire to your view.
Next we have “AS” which is again an oracle
reserved keyword, followed by AS keyword we
have our Select statement which is self-explanatory
I suppose.
But if you still have some confusion regarding
this SELECT statement, you can watch my tutorial
5.
There I have explained the concept of data
retrieval using SELECT DML in Detail.
Link is in the description box.
So now that you are familiar with the syntax
of the View in Oracle Database, therefore
let’s move ahead and do some examples.
But for that we have to jump over our SQL
Developer and here we are.
Now I will connect to my database using my
HR user.
Let me quickly show you the user SHOW USER:
As you can seeright now I am connected to
my hr user
I will create a view by the name of vw_rebellion
using employees table.
CREATE VIEW vw_rebellion AS SELECT first_name,
email, phone_number FROM employees;
This is a very simple view created on employees
table and has all the tuples from the first
name, email to the phone number columns from
the base table which is employees.
Execute, View created
Now, let’s try all the DML one by One on
this View.
You can see the definition of this view using
DESCRIBE command similar to the way we do
with tables in oracle database.
DESC vw_rebellion;
And here is the definition of our view vw
rebellion.
I know “Describe” is a DDL statement not
DML but I thought this tip is worth sharing.
So let’s start with the first DML command
which is SELECT.
But before that I will close this script output.
Now let’s write the query
SELECT * FROM vw_rebellion
Let’s execute and as you can see here we
have all the tuples from first name, email
and phone number column
You can also use WHERE as well as ORDER BY
clause in your select query if you want.
Let me show you how
SELECT * FROM vw_rebellion ORDER BY first_name;
As you can see the result of this query is
sorted lexicographically using first name
column.
Similarly you can use WHERE clause.
SELECT * FROM vw_rebellion WHERE first_name
= 'Nancy';
Here is the record of the employee named Nancy.
Ok next you can also execute UPDATE DML command.
Suppose you want to update the email address
of employee Nancy then query for this will
be… but first let me close this query result
ok now let’s write the query
UPDATE vw_rebellion SET email ='nancy@example.com'
WHERE first_name ='Nancy';
Let’s execute one Row updated let’s check
and here is the result.
See how easy it is.
Similarly you can also execute DELETE DML
command to delete one or more rows from the
table using VIEWS.
But first let me once again close all these
output windows ok
DELETE FROM vw_rebellion WHERE first_name
= Bruce';
Row Deleted.
Remember whatever DML you are executing on
your View will directly affect the underlying
table which means deleting and updating rows
in view will delete or update the rows in
the base table.
Ok let’s move ahead
Next let’s try the last DML command on views
in oracle database which in INSERT.
Let’s do the query
INSERT INTO vw_rebellion (first_name, email,
phone_number) VALUES ('Manish','abc@xyz.com',
'1234567');
Let’s execute this insert query.
Wait, what happened?
An error; Yes an error this is because every
view has to satisfy all the constraints on
any column of underlying table over which
it’s created.
And Insert DML is subject to several restrictions
when executed on a View in Oracle database
such as
1.
A view must contain all the Not Null column
from underlying table and
2.
If there is any column with referential key
constraint in underlying table then view must
contain that column and a proper value must
be provided to that column while performing
Insert on the View and many more.
Thus to perform an INSERT DML on our view
vw_rebellion we have to include all the columns
which either have NOT NULL constraint or Referential
constraint or any other mandatory constraint
from the base table employees.
So let’s move on to our next example.
For this example I have created a very simple
table by the name of “Superheroes” let
me show you but first let me make some space
so that you people can see things clearly
now let me show you my superhero table as
you can see This table has 5 columns first
name, last name real name phone number and
SSN which stands for social security number.
Now I will create a view on this table.
Suppose there is a user who wants data from
this table but as an owner of this table you
don’t want to reveal the confidential data
such as the real name or Social Security Number
of all the superheroes to that user.
In this case you can take advantage of “View”
in oracle database and mask the columns which
you don’t want to show.
Let’s see how.
CREATE VIEW vw_superheroes AS SELECT first_name,
last_name, phone_number FROM superheroes;
Let’s execute and create this view.
View created.
Let’s quickly fire a SELECT query and see
what data this view has.
Here we have all the first name and last name
along with the telephone number, No real name
of all these superheroes.
Which means their identity is still hidden
from this world.
Except the identity of Tony Stark, he is an
arrogant billionaire who revealed his secret
in front of the world himself, but that doesn’t
matter we all love Ironman.
Now you can share this view with that user
who wants to use data from this table as your
confidential data is safe and sound.
Moreover You can execute INSERT DML on this
view as the underlying table does not have
any constraints to satisfy.
Let me show you how
INSERT INTO vw_superheroes VALUES ('Steve',
'Rogers', 654765);
Execute, This time row inserted successfully.
Next I will show you how to change the definition
of a View in Oracle database.
In the view vw_superheroes which we just created,
you displayed the first and last name of the
superheroes along with the phone number and
now you realized that you don’t want anyone
to see their phone numbers also.
And you want to change the view definition.
So let’s see how you can do it.
To change the definition of a VIEW we use
REPLACE keyword along with the CREATE keyword
at the starting of the command.
I’ll show you how.
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW vw_superheroes AS SELECT
first_name, last_name FROM superheroes;
Apart from the REPLACE keyword everything
in this command is very similar to that of
last create view command which we executed
earlier.
Execution of this command will replace the
definition of the old vw_superheroes view
with the definition of new vw_superheroes
view.
Let’s execute.
View created let’s quickly check the definition
of the new vw_superheroes view.
DESC vw_superheroes;
As you can see no phone number column this
time
Hope the concept of Views in Oracle Database
is clear to you now.

joining tables.
