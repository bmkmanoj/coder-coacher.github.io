rebellionrider.com and i am back again
with another quick and short and easy to
understand SQL tutorial this is the
third tutorial in alter table series and
probably the last one and 23rd tutorial
in SQL tutorial series hope you are
enjoying my SQL tutorial feedbacks are
always welcome you can comment your
feedback anytime thanks ok let's move
ahead till now in previous tutorial we
have seen how to rename table in SQL
using alter table statement and how to
add or delete column from an existing
table using alter table and in today's
SQL tutorial we will see how to rename
and modify column in a table using SQL
alter table statement let's jump over
SQL Developer and start a tutorial
before starting this alter table
SQL tutorial let's create a simple table
this time by the name of demo this table
will gonna have only one column which is
called one with data type var char two
and column size let's say 30
execute okay here is our table let's use
describe command to describe it is a
structure as you can see our table demo
has only one column called one now we
will see how to rename a column of a
table say you want to rename the column
call one to demo ID for that we will
have to use order table statement let's
see how to change column name to rename
a column you just have to write a very
simple alter table statement let me
clear this script output so that you can
see next output clearly alter table
followed by the name of our table which
is demo and then the action which we
want to perform which is rename column
and after that the old name of our
column which is called one followed by
the keyword two and now the new name of
our column let's say demo ID execute
there we go let's describe the table
again to verify the changes as you can
see now our table demo has a column
which is demo ID means column has been
renamed but data type and column width
is still the same which is varchar' two
and 30 now let's see how to modify a
column modifying a column means changing
its data type and column width so we
just renamed our column called one to
demo ID now let's change data type from
varchar' to number and column widths
from 30 to three let me clear this
script output so that you can see the
next output clearly
as you can see that this statement
starts with auditable which is followed
by our table name which is demo and the
action which we want to perform that is
modified note here we just write modify
rather than modify column and then the
column name whose definition you want to
modify then the new data type and the
column width now execute that's it let's
verify the result by again describing
the table here you can see our column
demo ID has data type number and data
width 3 means column has been modified I
have done an article on this topic here
if you want you can read this article
and have more in-depth knowledge link is
in the description box you can also
download the SQL script from this page
