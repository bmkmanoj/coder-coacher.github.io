How you doing?
I am back once again with another SQL tutorial
and this tutorial is all about left outer
join.
I made the last tutorial in a real hurry so
please don�t be angry. If you found that
tutorial difficult to understand then comment
below and let me know. I�ll make that tutorial
again, after all whatever I am doing on this
YouTube channel is to help all you guys only.
But don�t dislike that tutorial please.
Ok so let�s start todays tutorial.
We will be using both the same tables i.e.
emp and dept which we created in the last
tutorial. And I will try to make this tutorial
as easy to understand as possible.
This time we will start with the Syntax of
Left outer join.
OUTER JOIN target_table
ON(expression) or USING(column_name)
WHERE(expression) ORDER BY column names;
First we have our Select statement where you
can specify column names from all those tables
which are participating in your join query
and these column names are followed by Keyword
FROM.
Then we have our Join clause which is the
Left Outer Join and on both the sides of our
join clause we have our tables which are the
source and the target table.
As we are talking about Left outer Join thus
the table which is on the left side of our
Join clause is the source table and the one
on the right side is the target table.
Followed by our join clause we have our Join
condition. Basically we have two types of
join condition that we can use one at a time
but never together. These two join conditions
are ON and USING.
Usage of each join condition depends on certain
conditional parameters. Don�t worry we will
discuss it as we go.
And at the end of syntax we have our WHERE
and ORDER BY clause.
Note here if you are using ORDER BY clause
then it must be the last statement of your
query.
Before jumping over SQL developer and start
writing the query, let�s once again take
a look at the second line of our syntax which
is our Join clause so that I can clear the
concept of the source and target table.
First of all, the designation of the source
table depends on the type of outer join you
are working with. Here we are working with
Left outer join thus the table which is on
the left side of our Join clause is the source
table and the one on the right side of the
join clause is the target table. This thing
will be opposite if we were using right outer
join.
Since we are working with Left outer Join
Condition hence all the records of all the
columns from the left side table or the source
table will be a part of the result whereas
only those records from the right side table
or the Target table that satisfy the Join
condition will be the part of the result.
In other words only the records of the target
table are checked against the Join condition
by SQL engine and source table is taken as
it is.
Now let�s jump over SQL developer and do
our first query.
SELECT emp_name, dept_name FROM
Dept 
LEFT OUTER JOIN emp
ON(emp.emp_id=dept.emp_id);
This query is really simple
In the first line we are selecting employee
name from emp table and department name from
dept table.
In second line we have our Join clause. You
can either write LEFT OUTER JOIN or just write
left join both are permissible and have the
same meaning as well as perform the same task.
Means this outer join is totally optional
you can delete it and simply write left join
And our Join condition here is in the third
line and is fairly simple as we are comparing
value of emp id colum of emp table with the
value of emp_id column in dept table.
Let�s execute the query.
Here is our result.
Let�s have an in-depth look of the result
for better understanding of the left outer
join concept.
Here as you can see these are the emp and
dept tables where dept is our source table
and emp is our target table. Now let�s come
to our result table. As you can see all the
column records from our source table is returned
in our result regardless of the fulfillment
of the Join condition. As for the target table,
you can see here that only those records that
fulfill the Join condition are being returned.
For example emp id 1 of the target table matches
the emp id 1 of the source table to return
the corresponding emp name � Steve. Similarly
emp id 2 match returns Nancy as the result
and so on. Since the last two records do not
fulfill the Join condition hence �null�
is returned.
This means that we will be having all the
records of dept_name column in our result
set but only those records from emp_name column
which will satisfy the join condition.
Hope things are clear now.
Let�s jump ahead and try the same query
with using clause.
Here in this query we used ON join condition
and in expression we supplied column which
share same name and same data type. Similarly
we can use ON join condition with the column
which doesn�t have same name but same data
type. You can use any column in the ON join
condition until they have same data type,
name of the column doesn�t matter here.
Let�s quickly modify this query. Let�s
use dept id column of dept table and emp id
of emp table although both have different
name yet have same data type which is numerical.
And 
here is our result.
Now let�s jump over USING Join condition.
For this once again we will require our first
query where we used ON join condition with
emp column of both table.
We use USING join condition when
1. Columns participating in Join query have
same name and same data type.
Here as you can see we are using emp column
of both the table since both have same name
and same data type.
2. Second when join query satisfy the equi
join condition.
Hope you remember that a Join query satisfies
the equi join condition only when we compare
columns in join condition using = comparison
operator.
Here as you can see we have used = operator
for comparing the value of emp id column of
emp table and dept table thus we can say this
is an equi join query.
In simple words when the column in join condition
share same name and same data type and are
compared only using = comparison operator
and no other comparison operator such as greater
than, less than etc. then we can use USING
JOIN CONDITION.
Thus here we have to remove this ON Join condition
in order to use USING join condition as we
can use only one join condition at a time
in a query. So here we will write our USING
join condition.
In using join condition unlike ON join condition
we just have to supply the column name which
is common in both the tables which here is
the emp id
That�s all we have to do.
Let�s execute, as you can see the result
of our query where we use ON condition with
emp id column and this query is the same.
Hope now the concept of Outer join is clear.
This time I tried to make this concept as
easy as possible but still if you have any
doubts you can contact me. For that you can
either email me your doubt or comment below.
