again i am manish from
rebellionrider.com todays sequel
tutorial is about how to insert data
into a table and doing this tutorial on
public demand I have got so many
requests for these tutorials so I
thought to do it now there are several
ways for inserting data into a table and
I am going to cover all of them one
video at a time we will start with the
simplest way of inserting data which is
using sequel developer GUI let's start
step one first thing is to make sure
that you are connected with the schema
in which you have created the table I
have created my table in HR schema by
the name of student and to connect with
that I will select my HR user connection
just right click on your connection name
and select connect now expand your
connection if it is not already expanded
but in my case it's already expanded but
if it is not expanded then either you
can click this plus button to expand it
or simply just double-click your
connection name after that select and
expand this table filter node from all
these schema object again you can either
click this plus button or just
double-click over it
step 3 now double-click on your table
name this will open up a new tab in your
worksheet area if you have noticed this
tab has its own menu column data
constraint etc etc before jumping over
data insertion let me show you the
structure and constraint of student
table as you can see here student table
has four column student ID first name
last name and contact
I have primary key constraint on student
ID column let me show you I have primary
key constant on student ID column and
one more constraint which is not null on
second column first name step 4 now to
insert the data click the data menu here
this will open up a data window now to
insert a new row either click this green
plus button with this document icon or
simply press ctrl + I if you are using
Windows machine or command + I if we are
on Macintosh machine this will give you
a new editable row where you can insert
the data note to make sure that while
entering a data you do not violate any
constraint otherwise compiler will give
you an A
for example in a student table column
one student ID is a primary key and
column two first name has not null
constraint that means these two are
mandatory column and you cannot skip
them in any case so let's enter some
data let's put the student ID 1
first-name iron lastname man contact
number 1 2 3 4 5 and just if you want
you can again click this button to
insert neuro or just simply hit tab
let's enter another room 2 and this time
let's enter first name super or sorry
and last name men and contact name 2 3 4
5 6
similarly let's insert another room
again you can either click this button
or ctrl + I or simply press tab now 3
this time that and 3 4 5 6 out now
after entering a data always remember to
commit otherwise your data will not be
saved in order to commit either press
this commit icon here this is the commit
icon or simply press function 11 key or
f11 key thus the message log as you can
see commit successful and we have
entered these three rows that's all you
have to do to insert data into a table
in case you violate any constraint and
compiler will give you an aura 0 1 4
double zero error
let's check this time we will enter a
new row so let's press ctrl I and enter
some data as you can see I didn't enter
anything into first column student ID
which is mandatory column because of
primary key let's commit the data now
you can see here that compiler gave you
an error here hope you can see it right
here it's just to show you that if you
violate any constraint then compiler
will give you an error and that will be
an ORAC row 1 4 double zero error
similarly you can also delete a row or
say
data for that just select the row which
you want to delete here let's select the
last one it is already selected
now either click this big red cross
button or simply press ctrl D if you are
on Windows machine or command + T if you
are on matching tox machine let's press
this red cross button after that you
just need to press this commit button
you can commit your transaction just by
pressing this button or simply press f11
key but just to demonstrate you I will
click this commit button our commit is
successful and the row is still lated
that's it for today's guys hope you
enjoyed watching in the next tutorial I
will show you another way of inserting
data into a table till then keep
watching and enjoy cycling we'll see you
soon this is Manish</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
