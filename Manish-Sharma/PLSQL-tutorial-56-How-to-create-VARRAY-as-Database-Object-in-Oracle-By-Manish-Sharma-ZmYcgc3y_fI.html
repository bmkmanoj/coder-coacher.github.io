v-ray inside a PL sequel block is that
its scope is limited only to the blog in
which it is created in this tutorial you
will learn how to overcome this
disadvantage of PL sequel Collection we
re voice of Internet
I am manish from rebellionrider.com and
today in this PL sequel tutorial we will
learn how to create a via ray as a
database object in Oracle database so
without wasting much of your time let's
start the tutorial but first I request
you to give this video unlike because it
keeps me motivated for making more such
videos and if you are new to the channel
then please to subscribe let's see if we
can reach 100 likes on this video
anyways that being said let's move ahead
we Ares creator s database object can be
saved onto this schema and can be reused
they have wider scope then those
theories which are created inside the
blocks you can use such veer is not only
inside the PL sequel blocks but also
with other schema objects so let's see
how to create V arrays as database
object start with creating Viviani after
setting the server output on next we
created our V array with named DB obj
underscore v ry using create type
statement this V array is capable of
holding up to 5 elements of number data
type I have discussed the syntax for
creating VRE as database object in
tutorial 54 you can find its link in the
description next we will create a table
and use our VRE to define the data type
of the column of the table but first
let's execute this query and create this
very very created now let's create the
table
here I have created a table and named it
calendar this table has two columns in
which the first one called day name is
of watch are two type whereas the second
one named day date is of Viera type now
you must be thinking what does defining
a column of a table as VAR a type means
good question
defining a column of a table as VRA type
means that it can hold n number of
values into it where n is equal to the
size limit of that V array in our case
the size limit of V array is 5 that
means the column D date of table
calendar can hold 5 values you will
better understand this when we will do
some practical demonstration so let's
move on one more thing have you noticed
that here we don't have any store as
clause as we used to have with nested
table collection to specify the external
storage table this is because unlike
nested table we are it does not require
any external table for its storage
rather we Ares are stored in line with
their parent record as raw value in the
parent table
anyways let's insert some data into our
table
this insert DML statement will insert a
row into the table calendar as you can
see here inserting data into the first
column teh name which is of one chart to
data type is easy you just have to write
the desired data and include it into
single quotes but same is not true with
the second column decade which is of VRA
type in order to insert data into the
column which is of vieira type you first
have to write the name of PV Airy and
then write the data which you want to
insert also you have to make sure three
things first the data that you are
supplying must be enclosed inside the
parentheses second the data type of the
data must match with the data type of
the elements of your V array which in
our case is number third the number of
elements you are inserting into the
column must either be less than or equal
to the size limit of the V array in our
case it is 5 and we are inserting four
elements into the column which is
completely ok but if suppose I insert
six elements into the column then there
will be an error let's execute this
insert statement but before that we have
to put a forward slash here so that
compiler can easily differentiate
between these two statements grid let's
execute now one row inserted that is how
we insert data into the VRE next we will
learn how to retrieve data from the VRE
we use our olden trusty to retrieve the
data from the table which is none other
than the Select statement such as let's
close this script output first yep
this will retrieve all the data from the
table calendar let's execute as you can
see in the result that data which is
retrieved is weirdly formatted if you
want to display the data especially the
data from the column which is of V array
type into relational format then you can
take help of the table expression let's
see how first closes very result and
make some space so that you guys can see
wait here we have our select statement
for those who haven't watched my
tutorial on select statements let me
tell you f1 and vry
are two aliases where tab one is alias
for our table calendar and vry is alias
for the table expression this means we
are retrieving the values of column Pini
from calendar table and values of column
DD from table expression that table
expression can open the collection
instance and represent the object rows
in relational format if you want me to
do a video on table expression then
leave a comment on this video and let me
know meanwhile let's execute the above
query and see the result
here is the result
head over to my blog for an in-depth
knowledge of VAR e as database object
and also to learn how to update our VRE
I think you know where you can find
Elaine that is the tutorial on how to
create a PL sequel Collection we re as
database object if you enjoyed watching
then keep this video on ly and if you
are new to my channel then subscribe and
don't forget to share this tutorial with
your friends on your social media
because that helps other in learning as
well as helped me and my channel in
growing thanks for watching this is
