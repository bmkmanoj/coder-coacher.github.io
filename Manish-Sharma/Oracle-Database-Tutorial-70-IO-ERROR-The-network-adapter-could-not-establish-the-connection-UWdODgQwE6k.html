rebellionrider.com and today in this
short and quick video I will show you
how you can solve DNS IO error which
state that network adapter could not
establish the connection I have received
several comments messages and emails
regarding this error so I thought why
not to make a short video which can help
you all in getting rid of this error so
without wasting much of your time let's
dive in step 1 double check the small
things yes
double check the small things such as
username password hostname and port
number make sure you have supplied the
valid values in all these fields for
valid hostname and port number you can
take help from listener or a file this
is helpful when you have access to your
server or you have installed the
database on your local machine as I did
here but if you don't have access to
listener or a file then just don't worry
you can use DNS names dot or a5 first
let's open the listener dot or a file
and see where you can get the hostname
and port number first go to your DB home
and here find the directory network and
inside the network directory go to the
admin folder here in this folder you can
find all your configuration files such
as less not aura and TNS names Dora
now open your listener or a file here
you can see that I have only one
listener configured by the name of
listener and here in the description of
this listener you will find what you are
looking for which is your valid host
name and port number so now you have
your valid host name and port numbers so
close this file and come back to our
admin directory and see the second way
of finding hostname and port number and
here we are now another way to find out
the valid port number and hostname is by
using DNS names dot or a file you can
find this in the same directory admin
let's open this DNS names dot or a file
and here we are this particular file
includes a list of service names of
network database map to connect
descriptor in my case the service
associated with my database over CL is
the ORCL generally database create
service with the same name as of the
database s ID here in the description
you can find the valid host name and
port number so these are the two ways to
for
now the valid hostname and port number
now you know the correct host name and
port number that you can enter in your
new connection window on sequel
developer as I did here let's test the
connection again in most of the cases
entering correct credentials solves the
error but if it is still there then you
have to check whether your listener is
sleeping or up and running for that run
your command prompt with administrative
privileges here we are now right
this command will show you the status of
your listener if the output of this
command is similar to mine then your
listener has a stop and not running now
you have to start the listener for that
simply right this will start your
listener and most probably solve your
problem okay so now let's come back to
our sequel developer and check the error
and here we are let's test it and as you
can see the error is gone do read my
blog to learn what to do if you face the
problem in starting the listener link is
in the description box thanks for
