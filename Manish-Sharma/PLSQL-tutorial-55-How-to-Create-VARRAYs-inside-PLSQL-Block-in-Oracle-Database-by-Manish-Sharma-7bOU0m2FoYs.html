and necessary theories in the last
tutorial so now we are free to do some
practical examples what's up Internet I
am manish from rebellionrider.com and
today in this tutorial we will learn how
to create a V array inside a PL sequel
block or to say as a member of PL sequel
block to make the understanding of the
concept easy we will try to keep the
example as simple as possible so if you
are new to programming don't worry I got
you let's cut to DG's and start the
tutorial here after setting the server
output on I started an anonymous PL
sequel block in which I first defined or
say created a vary with the name in
block underscore vry which can hold 5
elements of number data type this is the
first step where we define the VRE in
block underscore vry
next we have to initialize it to
initialize the V array we will first
define a collection variable and then
use that variable for initializing the
defining of a collection variable and
using it for initializing the VRE will
be done in a single step this
contraption can collectively be referred
to as defining an initializing the V
array also let me tell you some books
refer collection variable s collection
object so please don't get confused as
both are the same
so let's initialize our Bieri
in the above statement we declare the
collection variable vry underscore obg
and use that to initialize the VNA in
block underscore vry
note here I have not yet written
anything inside the parentheses just
move along the tutorial I will tell you
why I mentioned it here but for now
these two statements complete our
declaration section next we will start
the execution section of this PL sequel
block and wipe some executable
statements great here we have a very
simple execution section let me tell you
what exactly is happening here in this
execution section we have a for loop
I'll come to this loop statement later
first let's see what's inside it inside
this for loop we have two statements in
the first statement we are assigning
values which are multiples of 10 into
each cell of our V array using
collection variable and the second
statement which is obviously an output
statement is displaying the values
stored into the V Airy to the user now
let's come back to the loop statement
but before that let me tell you I have
done a detailed tutorial explaining the
concept of PL sequel for loop go ahead
and watch that to understand the working
of this loop link is in the description
meanwhile let's take a look at this loop
statement according to it our for loop
will I create from 1 to 5 now you must
be thinking why only up to 5 because we
have only 5 elements in our V array no
need to get confused let me explain it
to you in this loop statement we used a
method or a function called limit to set
the upper limit
limit is a collection method which
returns the maximum number of elements
which are allowed in the VRE here in our
case it is five which in turn because
the upper limit of this for loop hope
you understand now let's try to execute
this program but this execution will
return an error I'll explain why
but first let's execute and here is the
error subscript beyond count we have
created the V array we have initialized
it
we have even stored values into it and
dead - without any syntax error then
what is wrong here right you have
followed all these steps correctly and
there is no syntax error either in short
there is nothing wrong with this program
but there is a catch that is though we
have declared an initialize DVLA
but we haven't allocated the memory to
it so in this case memory is not yet
allocated to the VLA in block and the
score vry
so how we can allocate a memory to the V
array we can allocate memory either by
supplying arguments to the V array while
initializing it or by using extent
collection method let's see the first
way which is supplying arguments to DV
array in this method you supply argument
for each element of the V array inside
the parentheses
while initializing it let's do it first
closes on foot panel done
see here I have supplied five null
values as our VRE can hold maximum of
five elements in case your VRE is set
for not accepting null values then you
can replace these with some other values
that match the data type with those of
the VIS elements such as in our case V
array can hold elements of number data
type does I can replace these nulls with
any valid numbers let's execute and see
what happens here is the result to be
very honest this is not my personal
favorite way of allocation this way is
good but only when your V array is small
suppose if this V array is very large
say up to 100 elements so in that case
what are you going to do right nulls
null null 100 times when the VLA is
large this method makes the code
horribly unreadable which in turn causes
confusion to avoid such confusions we
have another way of a location which is
clearer and simpler this is by using a
procedure which is called extend extend
allocate some memory and appends an
element to the V array if used without
argument it appends single null element
and if used with argument then appends n
number of elements to the collection
where n is the integer you supplied as
argument to the procedure extent let's
do it but first let's close this output
panel and delete all those nulls from
here we cannot allocate by both ways at
once done now if you decide to allocate
memory using extent procedure with
parameter then you have to do it outside
the loop
first right the collection variable name
followed by dot and then the procedure
with parameters remember the number you
supply as the parameter must match with
the total number of elements allowed in
your V array in my case it's five
execute and here is the result now if we
decide to do it dynamically meaning
allocate memory when you insert the data
then you do it inside the loop without
parameters let me show you how but once
again first close this output window and
delete this extent procedure call from
here create you have to take care of two
things here first do not supply any
parameter with procedure extent and
second all the procedure before data
insertion into the collection otherwise
you will get an error let's execute and
here is the result once again that's
quite a tutorial anyways hope you
enjoyed watching and learn something new
please give this video a like you can
also help others in learning as well as
helped me and my channel in growing by
sharing this video with your friends and
