you've been you you're you are aware of
object-oriented programming everything
we've been doing has really been kind of
built on top of object-oriented
programming we write classes that are
templates to make these objects that
move around the screen the objects have
data and functionality that manage their
physics and how they're drawn on the
screen and we've been doing this over
and over again this is and that the
principle we've been kind of living by
is called encapsulation we are
encapsulating all the data and
functionality into this class and we're
making objects from it this has been
great I hope you've enjoyed it I've been
enjoying it but there is a missing piece
here there is another part of
object-oriented programming that we
haven't explored and I think it's worth
exploring in this thing that we're doing
whatever it may be and in making these
videos or watching these videos or
whatever it is we're doing and that is
this idea of inheritance and
polymorphism so so let's think about
this for a second
okay so right behind me over here we
have this Vanna White over here we have
this particle system right we have this
particle system and it has this kind of
generic particle we've made this generic
particle class I could kind of click
over here we could see it click to come
on and we could see sorry we have this
generic particle class edge location
velocity acceleration it's drawn as a
circle what if however we wanted to make
this particle system full of all
different kinds of particles star
particles and rainbow particles and
twirly particles and blue particles
that's they're all they look different
they act different but they're all
basically the same they're all in the
same system they all have a location
velocity and acceleration they all fall
with gravity how could we do this well
there's a bunch of different ways on the
one hand we could just start adding lots
more variables here and kind of have
boolean x' like to keep track of which
kind of particle should be drawn this
way and do this thing on the other hand
we could say let's make some more
classes let's for example make a star
particle class and and if that was our
instinct we would go over to our program
and we would say mm hmm hello program
and we would go over here and we'd say
new tab and we'd make type our new tab
and we call it star particle ah star
particle tab and we say ah my star
particle it's really basically the same
thing is my particle so let me go over
here to my particle tab and I'm just
gonna select all and hit copy and then
I'm gonna go over here to star particle
and I'm gonna hit paste then I'm gonna
rename this star particle and type star
particle here then I'm gonna start
modifying this code so let me just say
something here anytime that you
copy/paste huge amounts of code from one
section area gram to another you should
be suspicious and you should ask
yourself if there if could there be a
better way
is there another organ is there somebody
else that's somebody else you can
counter this situation before and is
there a better way that I could organize
my code and the answer to this is yes in
this scenario that we are talking
ourselves through we're gonna make a new
kind of particle that's essentially the
same with some slight modifications this
is where inheritance comes in we want to
say that our star particle inherits
everything that a particle ever wanted
to be in its life with a few slight
changes that we're gonna make to it and
let's look at so so before we can go and
add this to this particular program
let's kind of map this out how it works
over here over over there I'll be right
back okay we're back over here now
okay so let's forget about the particle
system for a second and let's just think
about the animal kingdom and let's say
we are writing a class called mammal a
class mammal curly bracket close curly
bracket now mammals they have generally
have fur they give live birth to their
young again I have no actual knowledge
of paleontology or science just you know
things that I read in children's books
but but but we could start making
something up we could say okay well this
is a program we're simulating a mammal
and one of the things we're gonna have
is a color which will be its fur color
and then another thing we might be able
use a boolean to describe its gender you
know true for female false for male
something like that and then we're going
to write some functions you know what do
mammals do
we need to have a function that we can
call when it's time for the mammal to go
to sleep it's gonna have some code in
there and we need to have a function
when it's time for the mammals to eat
and we'll put some code in there so you
know we've writing this class and we do
this all the time with our mover or
particle what but let's say now we're so
we have this generic mammal and now it's
time piqué a mammal out of a hat cat I
can't think of anything better the
internet loves cats so we're gonna maybe
we should make our classic kitten so I'm
just big our classic kitten it's a
little cuter so we're gonna write a
kitten class a class called kitten and a
kitten is also gonna have a fur color
and a kitten is also gonna have a gender
and the kittens gonna eat and a kitten
is gonna sleep and maybe a kittens gonna
you know purr and meow and have other
things that it does too
so how do i how do we deal with this we
could copy-paste all this code so we
start from the base mammal class or we
could use the principle of inheritance
and the way that we're going to use the
principle of inheritance is with some
new code that you well if you're
watching this video hopefully you
haven't seen it before if you have seen
it before turn it off and go you know
watch Star Wars or something okay class
kitten extends mammal this is pretty
important I hope it's not cut off
extends mammal this is the new syntax
for inheritance what we're saying is
kitten is a child class of mammal mammal
is a parent class of kitten we also used
the words superclass subclass
but but extends is the keyword we write
in our code to indicate that kitten
extends mammal and what this means is
that kitten inherits everything from
mammal
it's as if we wrote all the variables
from mammal over here we don't have to
type them or write them in they are
assumed now it's as if we wrote the
identical sleep function it's as if we
wrote the identical eat function over
here so these are all the things that
happen with inheritance automatically if
boom we're done we have basically a
kitten class is done so we have to ask
yourself why we do
this in the first place we're doing this
not because we want kitten to be an
exact replica of a mammal we want kitten
to inherit everything that a mammal has
but also have some of its own things so
for example we might add so I want to
make a list really wish this whiteboard
was bigger so someday we're gonna have
some kind of sliding door whiteboard
system but um what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna just carve out a little space over
here in the corner and I'm gonna make a
list of the things that you can do with
inheritance so number one is you can you
inherit everything so we now we see that
so a kitten has fur color agender it has
a function called sleep as a function
called eat if we remember that's what
these functions were called sleep and
eat okay
what's another thing that we can do we
can add data or functionality right so
we can add data or functionality the
kitten might have a integer which is the
number of whiskers for example so this
is not something that all mammals have I
don't think I'm a mammal right I don't
have whiskers not really anyway so but
kittens have whiskers so we can add
variables that are only for the kitten
we can also add functions so maybe we
might add a function called a meow and
meow is something that only kittens do
not all mammals do so we repeat function
we're going to add to the kitten class
great so we could one of the things we
can do with inheritance is we can
inherit everything and then add to it
the other thing we can do which will use
the term is we can override functions
what do we mean by override functions
well it might be that okay so we our
mammal class has a function called sleep
all mammal sleep cats and dogs and
porcupines and I don't know lots of
other interesting mammals that I wish I
could think of right
they all sleep so does a cat sleep yes a
cat does the kitten sleeps but what if a
kitten sleeps in its own special way
that's different than from how all that
sort of it's a parent class sleep so we
can override a function if I write the
function sleep here what this does is it
says well instead of when it when it
when I call kitten dot sleep instead of
doing the the functionality that was
inherited execute the functionality
that's now in my child class that's now
in my kitten class so you can override
you can inherit functions but you can
always rewrite it in the child class to
override that functionality so that's
one of the other things we can do with
inheritance the fourth thing which I'm
sort of making up I guess I think I
might be making all of this up because I
just live in a crazy world with green
screens and lights and whiteboards by
myself but this this thing that you can
do I'm gonna call is you can kind of
inherit you could just I don't know what
to call this you can you can override
plus and Herod you can modify you can
kind of do both you can you can you can
I'm just going to write the word super
this this fourth thing you can do is
really super what it is boy do i botch
this is that you could say if you wanted
to I want to modify the sleep function
but also call what the what the what the
what happens in the parents leave
function ah I can fix this problem we've
encountered let's be a little more
specific I am gonna write the mammal
sleep class and the mammal sleep class
sorry the man will sleep function just
has a print statement in it which says
right you print a bunch of ZZZ that's
what it means for a mammal to sleep
you bunch of Z's get printed out of the
screen now I'm gonna override it and I'm
gonna say sleep no no a kitten does not
when it sleeps what a kitten does is it
says purr okay so this is overriding
mammals kittens / what I'm really
turning into a crazy person so this is
number three overriding but if we want
we could both inherit and override so we
could sort of inherit the function but
add something to it and the way that we
do that is by saying super open cases
right dot sleep so what super dot sleep
does is it allows you to call what it
does is it calls the functionality
that's in the superclass the parent
class so now for a kitten to sleep
a kitten goes / / so without super dot
sleep it's just / without putting this
in at all it's just we inherit this this
is now we can do both if we wanted to we
can always call the parent sleep
function as well by using the keyword
super okay so uh I realized that this is
a lot of information here and you're
probably going to need to practice this
and you're gonna need a scenario for
which it makes sense to do this and I
who promised myself yesterday that I was
gonna make these videos shorter and this
one is already about 12 minutes long but
eventually the video okay I had a little
mishap but I just want to wrap up this
video so what we've done in this video
here is we've kind of mapped out what it
means to do to have inheritance so in
the next video what we're actually gonna
go do is start we're gonna we're going
to look at inheriting the particle class
and making a new particle object that
inherits everything but adds a little
bit of functionality to it so we're
gonna see how to do that in the next
video what I would suggest to you as an
exercise before you watch it is try to
do that yourself could you actually make
a star particle which is everything that
a particle was but draws itself as a
star maybe the star spins or something
like that see if you can do that
yourself and in the next video we're
gonna we will essentially that's exactly
what we're going to do so that's it for
this show</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
