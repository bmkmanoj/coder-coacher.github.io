planning to look at the set interval
function in JavaScript the set interval
function is a feature of native
JavaScript it exists for you in the
browser that you can just use it without
any other JavaScript library whatsoever
however I'm going to demonstrate set
interval in the context of using the
also the p5.js javascript framework so
let's review for a moment in my previous
video I looked at a function called set
timeout the function called set timeout
was one where you would you would give
the you would give you would want to
keep going sometimes I would start over
but it's good to keep guy you would give
that function two arguments one R the
first argument is the name of another
function in something like a function
called rainbow and the second argument
is a time the time at which you want
that first thing the rainbow function to
be executed so this would result in this
function rainbow happening 2,000
milliseconds or two seconds later so the
easy thing here is that okay well learn
set timeout so why don't you learn now
set interval set interval is actually
basically exactly the same thing the
difference is instead of executing
rainbow once and only once two thousand
milliseconds later sets interval will
execute the rainbow function over and
over again every two seconds every two
seconds
rainbow rainbow rainbow what that sort
of thing so let's think about a context
where that might be useful so for
example and I'm going to I'm going to
save this as I should have done this set
interval and I'm going to remove my code
that I had from the previous example
just to sort of start over from scratch
again and I'm going to run this code so
let's just say here's a scenario that
might be useful let's say you have some
sort of interactive experience you've
built for the web there's an animation
there's a canvas there might be a lot of
other stuff and you want to have
separately from that a Dom element a div
a paragraph something that has a timer
counting down or something that's
pulsing every few seconds with some with
a changing color or something like that
so this is a nice place so I feel like
set interval is useful if you want to
animate a Dom element now I'm feeling a
little I got a little pit in my stomach
here because there's also something
called request animation frame which in
a lot of contexts in particular in
animation context becomes an important
thing to know and look at and I will get
to that I will I will consider that as a
possibility but right now let's just
stay and assume that there's never a
problem with set interval and we can use
it for the kinds of things that I'm
gonna demonstrate to you in this video
so let's say for example that in I want
to create a I'm going to just call it a
timer for lack of a better idea and I'm
going to say timer equals create P and
I'm going to put just the text timer in
it and I'm going to run this and you can
see that now underneath my canvas I have
a paragraph element with the word timer
in it
now one thing you that you are probably
aware of is that remember draw is this
thing that's automatically looping all
over again over and over again and by
the way draw
I bet behind the scenes uses something
called requestanimationframe just a
suspicion I have so I could say timer
dot html' and one of the variables you
get for free this is a p5 ever ever set
interval as part of native JavaScript
frame count this variable that I'm using
right here is part of p5 if I add that
in there what I'm seeing in that
particular Dom element is the number of
times the draw has repeated the frame
count so you can see that there is this
element of set interval happening of
this repeating action that's the draw
loop but what if I want my program to do
other things based on time separate from
this 60 or 30 or whatever it is frames
per second animation this is where set
interval comes in and is useful so let's
say what I want to do is I want to say
set interval and I'm going to make up a
function called time it and I'm going to
say function time it and that is where
I'm going to say timer dot HTML what so
what is the content I want to put in
that HTML element I let's make up
another variable count counter equals
zero
let's update that Dom element to include
the counter variable and let's increase
counter by one so set interval and let's
do that every 500 milliseconds so half a
second so you can see now this even
though there are two things going on
there are sort of two looping threads
the actual canvas animation is just
managed by p5 and the draw function and
this particular Dom element is managed
by me and my own use of set interval so
there's a there's a there's a few roads
down here that I might like to go on
like first of all you might think okay
what happens if I want that Dom element
interacts going in the canvas I could
just reset the counter variable if I
click on something there's lots of
possibilities here but let's start with
something that I think is probably the
most useful which is what if I want to
start and stop this interval based on
something else so one thing that's
really important about working with set
interval is the function not only starts
this interval going but actually creates
a novice crypt object that stores a lot
of information related to the interval
so I'm going to add a variable called
interval and a global variable and in
setup I'm going to set interval equal to
set interval so now when this function
is executed I have a reference to that
interval so if I ever wanted to stop it
for example mousepressed I can say clear
interval interval so clear interval by
the way this is also a function part of
native JavaScript and what this function
allows you to do is clear the interval
meaning stop it so so here we go and you
can see that that interval is going one
to use very hard for you to see because
it's very tiny but I can zoom in and see
10 11 12 13 14 now when I click the
mouse I've cleared that interval and it
stopped at 19 so how would I click the
mouse again and have it keep going I
think this is the perfect exercise for
you to do if you're trying to practice
this
so what I might suggest let me get you a
few more up steps along the way there
I'm going to I'm going to create a
button and I'm going to say start timer
and I'm going to say button dot
mousepressed and I'll say dupe you know
start timer and in start timer I'm going
to say interval equals set interval and
maybe I'll make another function called
stop timer clear interval set into clear
interval the interval now you can sort
of see here now if I'm running this oh
it already I already started it right so
if I'm running this you can see now I've
made this extra button and that button
has a function attached to it when I
click on it that actually makes the
interval so when I click on it you can
see that that now the timer has started
and it's counting up so right so there's
there's like a bunch of callbacks
happening here because mousepressed when
you press on it triggers start timer
which trigger set interval which
triggers time it so when do we call stop
timer so the easiest thing for you to
probably do right now would be to create
a second button which is stop timer and
then the callback for that second
buttons mousepressed would be stop timer
but I think an interesting thing that
you might do is what if there was only
one button right what if there was only
one button I just called this do timer
do timer and what I'm going to do is I'm
going to say button dot html' is stop
timer so that what this is what's
happening here is now when I look at
this when I click start timer it's going
to go here click start timer is going to
go here start the interval and then
change the edge of HTML to stop timer so
you can see the timer's going and the
buttons text is actually now changed to
stop timer so the next time I press the
button I want to clear the interval and
change the timer back to start timer
that text so I need some sort
boolean variable or some sort of way of
checking if the interval is going or not
and if it is going I should clear it and
change the check text to stop start if
it wait if it is going I need to clear
it so that it stops and then change the
text to start if it isn't going I need
to start it and then change the text to
be stopped because that would be the
next thing so I'm going to leave that as
kind of an open question I will gladly
in the description of this video where I
link to the code that goes with this
video I will gladly put the solution in
there and if you're following along and
you go and you go follow the links and
it's not there write in the comments of
this video because that just means I
forgotten and will add it right in so
hopefully this gives you a sense of of
how set interval works and how it might
be useful to you but I thought of one
more thing
that was going to lead me to another
video that I don't know whether or not
we'll make it today but it's an
important question technical difficulty
but I'm back and the point that I wanted
to make is here we are with this very
simple scenario of a single Dom element
a sorry a single Dom element animating
with counting up every 500 milliseconds
so what if I wanted to make another what
if I wanted to make another Dom element
called timer 2 and what I want is I want
this one to also animate or also count
up but maybe add a different rate now
certainly I could then have to counter
variables and I could also have in
addition to to counter variables I could
have two functions I could have time at
one and time it too and then I could
call set interval time at one at 500 set
interval time at two at 1500 but there
must be a way to just generically say
this idea of having a Dom element change
over time based on set interval I should
be able to do that in a generic way by
calling a function like animate Dom
element with this value at this range
and to do that you need something called
a
javascript closures the topic i've been
threatening to cover at some point in a
video and i slowed and wrapping my head
around this like weird strange concept
that is actually quite elegant and
simple in the end but it's a bit
confusing to get used to this idea so
that's something that i will cover in
the next video i guess because i think
in my idea of making a video about using
set timeout to play a melody this idea
of a closure excuse me will also be
relevant in that okay so thanks for
watching and i'll catch you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
