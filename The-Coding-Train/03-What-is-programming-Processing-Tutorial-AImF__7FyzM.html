to get this out of the way what is
programming I mean really that answer
will come about the real answer that
question this reveals itself the more
you do programming but let's talk about
it kind of in general for a second the
thing we have to realize is okay I'd
like Google glasses on I could just like
show you what I'm looking at but that
computer there's a computer over there
it's not very smart it's incredibly
powerful it's kind of amazing that they
exist in that they can do all this stuff
but it doesn't know how to do anything
at all nothing
it needs human beings to write
instructions for it to do certain things
to crunch some numbers to draw certain
colors to the screen everything has to
be written as instructions for the
computer and this is really what it
means to program to write those
instructions to write an algorithm what
is an algorithm it's just a sequential
list of instructions that solve a
particular problem an algorithm for
example I can't believe I'm going to use
this as an example but you know you put
your right hand in you put your right
hand out you put your right hand in and
shake it all about you know hokey-pokey
here feels really ridiculous to do but
that's that's that's a program not for a
computer to follow perhaps but for a
toddler I as you may be painfully aware
these videos are not planned or
rehearsed might be a good idea to start
doing but I went off on a tangent about
the hokey-pokey
I don't edit them either but this is a
moment where we're editing so let's
let's just sort of think of another
example here okay so let's say that you
need to you're you've met somebody who
has very poor dental hygiene and they
never brush their teeth and you need to
explain to them how to brush your teeth
well how would you do that you might say
you know the toothbrush put toothpaste
on it and like brush it back and forth
right that that might be some
instructions but what we have to realize
with programming and one of the things
that makes programming hard is this fact
that the computer doesn't have any
intuition our ability to you know to
communicate but from human being to
another human being with instructions
there's body language there
to ition there's all sorts of ways that
we communicate without kind of detail
and specificity writing computer
programs you need that specificity and
that's one of the things that's going to
make it hard I guess is sort of
understanding the syntax and the fact
that if I say you know teeth your brush
you could probably figure out that
sounds a little weird that I mean that I
meant to say brush your teeth but a
computer you know if you just left out
one word one letter one semicolon one
piece of punctuation the whole thing's
not going to work at all and that's
going to make things kind of challenging
the other that's oh but let's return to
this brushing your teeth so let's let's
actually be even a little bit more
specific we might say you know the first
step is locate toothbrush right - the
next step is locate toothpaste I don't
know how absurd we need to get you know
pick you know you know we could say like
move finger one away from thumb you know
use the fingers to pick up the
toothbrush right we could get so crazy
specific but you know we need to say
like squeeze the toothpaste onto the
toothbrush right there's just a sequence
of steps here and and I you know I'm
rather than go through this myself you
might take this as a little exercise to
yourself you know really try to do this
and then you know find a very willing
and a kind friend to try to follow those
instructions literally and see like did
they perform the program correctly were
there bugs in your system right and you
know how how does that really work but I
want to mention a few other things about
this so let's say well let's just
consider let's consider the following
step what if I said even before this if
it's 9:00 a.m. do this right so if it is
9:00 and locate your toothbrush locate
your toothpaste start these steps so
these are the things that we are that
I'm just starting to point out this the
fact that programming it isn't just a
matter of saying do this do that do this
there are there's logic there's lot
there's there's a sort of sophisticated
logic that's possible here where we
start having conditions if
this condition is met perform these
steps that's one of the things that you
want to start thinking about right if
it's the morning brush your teeth if
it's a noon I don't know how stop making
this video and go eat some lunch for god
sakes but feeling a little like woozy
and uh but I think everything's going to
be fine don't worry um okay so that's
another thing the other thing I might
mention is you might say okay move you
might we might have a step which is
we're somewhere further along put
bristles on the front teeth the next
step is move bristles horizontally and
rapidly back and forth or something
right I'm just making up these steps
move the bristles horizontally and
rapidly back and forth I don't know is
this really am I'm really here talking
about how to brush your teeth oh my
goodness um so you might do this but but
but but one thing we might say here also
is repeat number six ten times so I'm
just showing you that as you start to
write out these steps think about are
there conditions are there things that
get repeated how would you really design
this algorithm that has a beginning a
middle and an end
that someone could follow and no detail
would be lost this is really the
beginning of writing a computer program
and if you think about making the game
pong you're really going to be doing the
same thing right you're going to be
saying draw a rectangle on the left side
of the screen draw a rectangle on the
right side of the screen
draw a rectangle or a circle in the
middle move the circle towards the
rectangle if the circle hits the
rectangle turn the circle around right
these set of steps if the circle goes
past the rectangle increase the score of
the other player by one right to try to
write out a list of instructions in
English for the game pong now there's a
couple things I want to mention about
this which is sort of exciting one is we
have just described this concept known
as I don't think I spelled it right
pseudocode EO pseudocode this is
something that you will want to do in
your future
life unless you've already turned this
off and you your bike riding and or I
don't know having a nice salad with a
little some nuts and cranberries is nice
but anyway uh but but pseudocode is
something that you want to get used to
doing right
the syntax of programming can be
challenging difficult and hard to do if
you can plan out your code in English or
whatever your language is whatever your
the language you think and write and
speak in then you can begin to sort of
design the steps of your program in
advance which will help you when you go
to sit down to actually write the actual
code but the other thing this brings up
which I think I don't know if this has a
real name anywhere other than in my mind
but I'm going to say this thing called
the philosophy of incremental
development here's the real reason why
programming is hard why everything we're
going to do is going to be challenging
and not going to believe just you're not
going to be able to do it instantly and
you're going to struggle you have a very
very incredibly powerful thing in your
head which is your brain and you could
think about all sorts of sophisticated
systems and ideas and design ideas and
come up with the steps the pseudocode
and understand how stuff works right
maybe you haven't played the game pong
before but but if you have you kind of
know how it works you could describe it
to me you could understand you could
probably without watching a single video
anymore you could sort of describe how
to write the computer program for pong
but actually putting that down into code
all at once is kind of impossible if
what this idea that you really need to
get used to is taking an idea like pong
let's say the project and you're going
to come up with hopefully much more
interesting and exciting creative ideas
the project pong I just realized I
forgot to mention all this stuff in the
introductory video but I'll figure out
how to fit it in somewhere the project
pong you want to break that down in your
head into lots and lots of mini programs
right here's a mini program for you one
that draws a rectangle on the screen one
that moves the rectangle up-and-down
just
with the keys right kids kick up and
down keys for example another program is
one that just draws a circle in the
middle of the screen that moves the
circle that turns the circle around when
it's you need lots and lots of little
pieces a program that you can have a
number up here on the screen that can go
up and down maybe randomly you need to
divide pong into lots and lots pong
wasn't the best example but you wanna
drive divided pong into lots and lots of
mini programs and make all those meeting
programs one at a time then you could
start to piece them together you can't
just sit down time write in code for an
hour or to finish dump run ahh I have
pong you need to make lots and lots of
mini steps and accomplish them one at a
time always run your program always make
sure it's still working other if you
know if you write a ton of code and then
run it and it doesn't work worry how
you're going to know what went wrong
right this idea of making little
incremental changes taking a larger
problem in breaking it down into smaller
pieces this is how you're going to make
stuff but this is going to feel wrong to
you because you understand how it all
works and it's going to seem almost very
kindergarten desk not a kindergarten is
a wonderful place by the way we should
all just live in perpetual kindergarten
I'll be much happier so I don't mean
that in a bad way but it's going to seem
like I should be able to move faster
than this I should be able to do this
more quickly with more agility but you
have to think about it this is a very
very flawed analogy here but you think
about learning a new language you know
you're not going to pick a new foreign
language not going to pick it up
immediately it's going to be a long
process and the same is true for
learning this new language of writing
code ok so that's really what is
programming kind of what is your first
program how we're thinking about and how
we're going to approach all these
problems as we begin to write actual
examples which we're getting to very
soon the nice thing about this is you
can always just stop and move right to
it I think the next video is going to
talk about different programming
languages and this language called
processing and why I'm using it in this
video series and what the pros and cons
of that are so that will be next pose
