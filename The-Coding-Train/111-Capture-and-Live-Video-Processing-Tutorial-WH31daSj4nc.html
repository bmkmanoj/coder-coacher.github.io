something pretty different and exciting
and what that is is looking at moving
images so we spent all this time saying
okay I could I could have a blank PM
edge and I could figure out some
interesting algorithmic way to set all
the pixels of that image or I could have
an image that's coming from a file like
frog jpg and I could load that image and
I have access to all the pixels and I
could draw in on the screen I could
manipulate it I can do all sorts of
stuff
what if however we could have a camera
this is my weird drawing of a camera and
what if I could pull in a live image
from a camera into my processing sketch
what could I do with that what if I had
a you know a movie file could I pull in
that movie and playback that movie in my
processing sketch speeding it up slowing
it down going in Reverse how could I how
do how does all this stuff work how do
we make this happen
so let's first just take the basic
transition from flat image file to
camera and the way that we're going to
do this is with Processing's capture
object so the capture object is part of
Processing's video package now I just
realized there's kind of a crucial
component to this if you are using and
again this part of the videos have those
going to be just become obsolete in a
little while but if you are using the
3.0 alpha series and hopefully it'll be
a beta soon are you a final version this
will be true for all of the 3.0 versions
a processing let's come over here and
look here if you if I go to import
library let me just zoom in here import
library add library and I pull this up
your you won't by default have the video
library so I'm going to search under
processing and this is what you're
looking for you want to find in the
contributions manager the video library
by the processing foundation so in order
to run any of these examples are to work
with live video or recorded movies in
processing you need this particular
video library in all the previous
versions of processing prior to 3.0 this
library came with processing but it's
quite a large a large library and also
it's maintained and updated on a
separate schedule so by pulling it in
separately all you need to do is hey
whoa I have actually amazing I uh I
forgot that I just did a fresh install
of frosting here so this is we're going
to test this out you just want to hit
this install button and while it's
downloading and should be ready to go
and now we're going to have this library
yeah and then it'll say remove so if you
don't have the video library make sure
you get it okay back over once you have
the video library you now have access to
the capture object you also have access
to the movie object so capture being
live video from some camera that's
connected to your computer movie object
you'll use for video files that you're
loading and playing back in processing
so here's the thing the thing that's the
most wonderful about this is that the
both of these things are p images
essentially all the functionality image
pixels width height copy any piece of
functionality you learned and practiced
and did with p image you could do
exactly the same functionality with
capture and movie the only thing that's
different is when you load a p image
like frog jpg those pixels are never
going to change unless you change them
right that's file that image is a flat
static image those pixels are the pixels
you can do all the same operations but
with a capture object or a movie object
those pixels might be changing according
to some schedule of course we have total
control over that schedule we could say
give me fresh pixels from the camera or
stop giving me fresh pixels from the
camera or advance the next frame of the
movie or don't advance the next frame in
the movie so this is an added piece of
the puzzle that we'll be able to work
with
you start using these classes so let's
let's sort of let's look and see how
this would work and there's a couple
little nuances here so I'm back over
here and I'm in a sketch so this is just
kind of a simple processing sketch that
that I think we did at some point in
earlier video I'm loading an image and
I'm drawing it on the screen I'm using a
couple things one you can see I can
dynamically resize the image as I draw
it using the mouse or I can also tint it
meaning change its color so what I want
to emphasize in this just first part of
this video is let's make this the
capture object from the camera I have a
laptop in front of me it's not all magic
let's get that image from that camera
and let's see that there and do all the
same stuff for it
so instead the first step is instead of
a P image I want to say capture and I'm
going to just say video now notice as
soon as I do that I get an error message
it says if I look at the errors you can
say the class capture does not exist now
this needs a little bit of work here but
it's actually giving me a suggestion
which is nice this is part capture and
movie are both part of that processing
video library that we just installed so
even though I've installed the library I
have to in my code make an explicit
reference that I'm going to use it so
I'm just going to it processing we'll
add this for you automatically in a
bunch of different ways but I'm just
going to do it manually so I just need
to have an import statement at the top
import processing duck video dot star
now I have my capture object now you
might think you would say something like
I said load image load capture or
something create capture connect video
start video the way that this works
however is there is no function like
that we need to use the sort of tools
and syntax of object-oriented
programming so let's come back over here
and if I have a video object the syntax
is to say I want to make a new capture
object and I need to figure out what
goes in there so what might be some
parameters that you need when you're
about to connect to a live camera maybe
you might say ah a camera over there I
would like a very high resolution image
or a very low resolution image so some
Braham
we're gonna put in there as the width
and height of our requested images that
we'll get from the camera another piece
of information that we might put over
here is a frame rate do I want to get
images from the camera at 30 frames 60
frames 120 frames 15 frames now with
both of these frames per second so with
both of these certain cameras are only
going to support certain resolutions and
certain frame rates so a lot of this
really depends on what you've got and
I'm going to show you a way to figure
out what your camera makes available to
you but you know generally speaking 640
by 480 30 frames per second those are
kind of good numbers to use and in fact
this is an optional parameter you're
just going to get the default frame rate
if you don't request a specific one
which is usually 30 frames per second
now there's another argument that needs
to go in here and this is one of those
tricky ones that appears when you're
using a lot of times when you're using a
processing library one of the things we
need to do is we need to say a capture
object camera you're going to have new
images available you're looking at the
room you're looking at me you know where
I want you to give those images I want
you to give those images to me who's me
this particular processing sketch this
sketch so the keyword this needs to go
in here now we could have a much longer
discussion about what the keywords this
means and Java then we could sit here
and complain for a while about how
confusing these like archaic concepts
and like old fashioned languages like
Java are but we don't really need to
worry about it too much to make all this
stuff work we just need to remember the
keyword this goes there and I think it's
useful to kind of think about the fact
that this is referring to this
processing sketch I don't want the
camera images to go to some other
program on the computer I want them to
go to this processing sketch and we're
telling the library that this happens a
lot of other ways behind the scenes in
processing but you don't always have to
use that keyword this capture and movie
are two instances where you do okay so
let's come back over here and let's say
okay video equals new capture and what
do we say when you say this we need to
give it some resolution and a frames per
second let's do this
and so we're making this argument that I
can now get rid of
we don't need the Frog but everything I
did with the Frog I can do with the
video so I should now instead of seeing
the Frog image I should see the video no
video but I didn't get any errors seems
things seem to be working so things are
good okay there's a couple things we
forgot what did we forget one thing we
forgot is that we have to explicitly
tell the video to begin so one thing we
need to add is video dot start there we
go coming over here I'm back let's add
that in and I'm going to go here video
dot start now let's run this again it's
not nothing
oh look you can't see this but I can see
it there's a green light I've got a Mac
laptop with a built-in web camera
there's a green light over there so the
camera is going but I don't see the
images why not there's another key
function that we've missed there's a key
function in the video library and it is
called Reed Reed we need to with with
with the loading a static image it's
sort of assumed and we get that static
image I've got it let me display it with
a video image we need to explicitly say
at this moment in time I want you to
give me the freshest pixels from the
camera possible and the function Reed
reads the current image that the camera
is seeing so one thing I could do just
as the court a quick and dirty solution
to this is just say video dot read in
draw so every time through draw and like
draws looping looping looping give me
fresh pixels give me fresh pixels let's
run this we're gonna have some weird
crazy video feedback thing probably
happening here uh oh wait wait cuz the
mouse there we go look look there I am
and look I'm actually here and I'm here
and there's all sorts of weird like
strange interference and there's green
behind me because through all secrets
were not revealed this is a green screen
but someday I'm gonna do this in a
different way and there's like all sorts
of crazy chittering going on I don't I
think a lot of weird stuff is happening
because of actually not necess
Sara Lee so what I've done is kind of a
bad idea because I guess I have the Tim
I don't know what's going on with this
jitter but I a lot of it has to do I
think with the way I have this recording
system going on but also let's just say
that there is a bad idea here which is
that which is that which is that there's
no reason for me to read from the camera
every time through draw in fact I only
want to read from the camera when the
camera like draw is actually running at
60 frames per second probably the camera
is going in 30 frames per second I only
want to read if there's an available
message if there is an actual actually a
new image available so one way I can do
that you can see I've added this if
statement if there is a new message
available from the camera and actually
let's we see the point that tint and the
image resizing is working so but let's
just take that out for right now just so
we have something a little bit simpler
to look at so we should see now the
image and you can see none of that weird
jittering and all that stuff is
happening and I can you'll see the
what's going on here so okay so this
works and in fact we saw that that was a
bad idea not to have this video
available but even this is not the best
we can do we can do better so how can we
do better one way that we can do better
is we can implement something called a
capture event and I'm going to take this
out here look at this now I've taken
video dot read out of draw and I've
placed it in the capture event and
placed it inside this function called
capture event so what is hopefully
familiar to you is a function like this
this function is an event callback when
the event happens I call back to that
function and trigger the code that's
inside it so when I click the mouse I
execute that code capture event is an
event that's triggered by the camera
itself whenever whenever there is a new
frame new image available from the
camera so this now is happen
off almost in a different place like
this is the code for like I just want to
continuously always read from the camera
no matter what's going on so it's always
reading the freshest image whenever
there's an event just just to kind of
demonstrate this if I took video dot
read out of here and put it in
mousepressed
when we run this sketch now there's no
image here but whenever I click the
mouse it's going to take a snapshot of
me right I'm only reading the image from
the camera when the mouse is pressed
this is like way too much fun right so
so this is something you can see you
have a lot of control here you can
choose when you want to read when you
want to stop reading I could now copy
those pixels into a different frame so
if you wanted to build say a photobooth
application where you're seeing yourself
you click the mouse you get a snapshot
it prints it out it changes the colors
it does stuff to it all of that image
processing stuff we learned you could do
all of this to this image so any single
one of those examples we can go back and
replace the image with the with a live
video let's just do one of them okay so
let me save this
oh I there's a couple there's a detail
that I forgot but since I'm on this
let's go open recent the particles one
so if you remember this particular
example where all of these things were
streaking out and coloring the frog
image let's remake that with capture
let's just see that this actually works
where we we're at 15 minutes that's not
terrible you're still watching
you're very kind okay so I'm going to
change to capture and I'm actually just
going to call it frog just keep the
variable name the same let's make the
window six four there's a let's and
let's say instead of load image now
we're going to say create capture this
640 480 and then we're going to say frog
got start and then all I also need is
capture event capture video video dot
read so you see how like in a matter of
ions I've said create capture new
create capture distance exist it's
that's the that's the function that we
we hope and dream for but we have to say
new capture so um all I did really
really quickly here was instead of
having a P image and loading from the
hard drive
I changed the variable frog from a PM
into a capture I instigated that capture
and I make sure I'm reading from the
camera continuously when I run this
sketch it should actually be identical
to what we had before only now right
it's painting me as I'm trying to like
stand still and you can see it's pulling
the pixels from me and I could add like
2500 of them so we could see this a
little bit more clearly this is really
like a weird strange like performance
art thing and you can see as I move it's
updating so this is like really where
you can start to play around and kind of
create this idea of a software mirror so
what is a system an independent drawing
system that you could make where you're
pulling colors from a live camera
actually this it's kind of a not sort of
like this example okay I'm gonna stop
dancing around from the camera having
too much fun here and okay so there's a
couple key pieces of here now let's say
oh I would I this is the most beautiful
visual artwork made by a computer that
anyone has ever made in the world that I
must make it bigger and put it on a
giant screen and everyone must
experience it so I'm going to make this
I don't know what the resolution of this
computer is right now I'm going to make
this 1200 by 700 and I'm going to run it
again and you can see now okay so
obviously I have this like giant window
but it didn't work because the image is
still like 640 by 480 even though I made
my processing window bigger and actually
the way to do this by the way in
processing while we're here is display
with display height well this is what I
want to demonstrate so I'm going to make
this giant fullscreen thing it's going
to open up it's taking over the screen
and but I don't see anything at some
point because my resolution everything
is all oh there are some of them and
they're coming over here but again
image is only this size so how do we
deal with this problem
well there's a couple and I'm just going
to go back to 640 by 480 for a second so
there's a couple ways to deal with this
problem number one is we need to figure
out well couldn't I capture a higher
resolution image from the camera why not
right let me if I can get a higher
resolution image from the camera so one
thing we want to look at is what are the
possibilities themselves so one thing
I'm going to do there's a function in
the video library called list capture
dot lists this is actually giving you a
string array so I'm going to just say
print array so I can see what's there
and we're going to come down and run
this and look in the console hopefully
I'm running this now right and you can
see it's you can see like oh there's all
these options oh look the camera will
actually give me a 1280 by 720 image and
look at all my frames per second options
so these are actually all the different
and if I had multiple cameras connected
to this computer then I would see like
oh I could pick the camera that I want
maybe I want this external webcam and
this other camera stores so this is
useful and you can actually pull you
could pull this string out of the array
and pass it into the capture constructor
and it'll so you know if if I were to
just say this capture list index you
know five what I'm actually doing is
using this configuration 640 by 360
frames per second one so you can pull
from that list the configuration you
want for the camera so that's sort of
like a bit of an aside note that I think
is useful for you to be aware of but I
think what is more relevant here is not
actually changing the resolution of what
I'm getting from the camera let's think
about it this way what if I were to say
let me make this 1280 by 960
what I just did is double the size of
the window relative to the size of the
video that I'm capturing if I run this
once again yet again as we've now seen
this many many times
takes a long start up this is very
Kord I'm only getting colors in the top
left-hand corner because I I doubled the
size of the window but the the capture
image is still less so what if however
though what these pixels are at an X Y
they're moving all throughout this much
larger space what if I said as the
pixels are moving around this larger
space sample down when you go to look up
a color how do i sample down I just
divide in this case I'm just going to
divide by two so now that I've done this
I should have a much higher resolution
processing window that's looking up
colors in a lower resolution image and
you can see here as I change the camera
I now have this ridiculous thing that
I've made at a higher resolution and I'm
waiting for those to come back in the
center at a higher resolution but my
capture is still at a lower resolution
the reason why this is so crucial is and
I'm sure it seems like I'm spending a
lot like way too much time on this and
kind of wasting a lot of times videos
already 20 minutes long but this is
going to come up again and again one of
the things I hope to show you in the
next video is using a computer vision
library like OpenCV to say find faces in
an image however that's a very expensive
process that can be very slow so you
want to find the faces in the lowest
resolution image possible but then use
that data that you found in maybe a
higher resolution display so this idea
of having a scale a variable and one of
the things that you'll see in a lot of
my examples if you go through them is a
variable like video scale in this case
equals 2 so I might say here in capture
you know with divided by video scale
height divided by video scale so I can
use that variable which is always
keeping track of what's the ratio from
my source imagery to my screen
resolution that's something that I think
you want to kind of keep an eye on as
you work on projects like this ok sorry
so I what I would suggest did you as an
exercise and I didn't get to loading
movies I'll make put that into a
separate video but what I would suggest
as an exercise is go and find something
you did with a static image where you
manipulated the pixels are looked up
colors in those pixels and try to remake
that exact processing sketch but with a
live capture and
and see how that goes and I will see you
in another video in another time in
another place okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
