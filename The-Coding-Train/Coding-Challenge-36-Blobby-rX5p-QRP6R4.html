which I'm going to call blobby coding
challenge I want to make something
that's a blob this is a this is sort of
loosely a part of the agario coding
challenges where there are these
circular things moving around the screen
but I'm in this coding challenge only
thinking about just that sort of
stationary circle which is a nice
perfectly round beautiful happy little
circle right there but I want it to be
wavy curvy and the edges and kind of
feel a little blobby so let's think
about men come over the whiteboard here
and draw some stuff right this is a
perfect circle which is drawn as an
ellipse but another way I could draw
this perfect circle is by using a call
to a function called begin shape and a
call to a function called end shape and
in between there I could make a lot of
calls to a function called vertex so if
I were to say put a vertex here put a
vertex here put a vertex here vertex
vertex vertex and connect them all then
I have what I started with a nice
perfect circle but what if I were to
make this vertex go out over here and
this one come in over here then I might
have something that appears kind of
curvy and what if these wiggle all
around and kind of blob around then I
have something that appears kind of
squishy and blobby now there are a
couple different ways I could do this
option number one I could do some kind
of physics simulation with a lot of
springy forces I have this like almost
as if these are all connected by Springs
and as you pull one it pulls the other
and kind of flips back and oscillates
and jiggles and that sort of thing come
and do that in another coding challenge
you can take a look at one of my toxic
libs kind of like cloth simulations to
get an idea of how you might do that
another way I could do this is with
Perlin noise and I think I'm going to
try that right now or I could use like a
sine wave in other words all I want to
do is alter this radius right each of
these points is calculated based on an
angle which I'll call theta and a radius
if I iterate over all the different
angles but change the radius and have
those rate radii move move up and down
randomly I can get something that seems
kind of squishing and blobby so let's
see if we can make that happen
the first thing I want to do is go into
the blob object and find this show
function which is right down here and
you can see what's happening here I'm
drawing an ellipse but I'm going to
change that now and I'm going to do a
couple things one is I'm going to say
push and pop because I'm going to also
use translate because I want to first
translate to the center of this object
and then once I've done that I can say
begin shape and I can say end shape and
then I can have a loop so what do I want
my loop to do I want an angle to start
at zero and I want to go all the way to
two how do you spell 2pi and i want to
go up by some amount I'm going to say
0.1 and I really should be more
thoughtful about this but I'm just going
to randomly do this and then I'm going
to say I have an X which is now this
object's radius times cosine of that
angle this is a polar to Cartesian
conversion which I would refer you to
another video where I go through this
math and a bit more detail but now I can
just set the vertex to that x and y
position so let's run this and see if we
get basically the same result I find it
hard to believe that that's really what
happened am I looking at the correct
code let me comment that out
okay it's not there shockingly that
looks way too similar I guess that'd
work
oh you can see that it actually changed
because it's not so perfect there on the
right let's let's just to see see how
this is actually working let's draw
little ellipses and take out the
vertices right you can see that's what
I've actually done I've drawn all these
little circles and connected them so
there we go
so this actually worked the thing is I
want this variable this R to be
something that changes so what if I said
R equals this dot R plus a random amount
between negative 5 and 5 and so on I
used R instead what would we get now
we would get something that looks like
this you can see those radii are
changing what if I did something where I
said I want to have an offset which
equals map sine of the angle which goes
with a negative and 1 and 1/2 negative 5
and 5 and what if I say angle plus frame
count times 0.01 or something so and so
this is now this dot R plus offset that
didn't do very much oh you know I just
realized uh yeah that's just moving all
the vertices together with the same
offset so they have to be offset from
each other anyway the point of what I
want to do is not that actually I want
to make this assign this sine wave thing
work ok what I want is for each one I
want to do I want to get this to work
let's make this actually work I want it
to do this I want you to just see what
it looks like when there's a sine wave
so I want to have this I need a separate
value that's that really should work or
I guess maybe these angles aren't are
changing by too much hold on let's let's
make this work right do I need to
multiply this by like some tiny amount
or something um I'm back whoops oh I'm
back so actually the the angles I've
just forgot are only between 0 and 2pi
so there's only one cycle of the sine
wave so I actually want to multiply the
angle by a lot if I want to see that
sort of oscillation so I I can get
something kind of like this and you know
I could play around with these you know
values anyway you could you could get
the idea of how I might not good off you
could get the idea of how I can do
various kinds of different offsets to
change the quality of that shape but
let's actually just use Perlin noise
which I think will produce some
interesting results so
what if I were to say noise and I want
to have an X offset which I'll say
equals zero noise of X offset which goes
between zero and one and I want to map
that between negative twenty five and
twenty five and I want that X offset to
increase by some amount for each one of
those so if we see that you can see now
I have this kind of blobby looking thing
and each time i refresh it looks a
little stranger now you'll notice I have
an issue where I'm not able to connect
the last point to the first point very
well and there's ways we can kind of
improve that but you can see I've got
like this kind of goofy-looking shape
now what I can actually do there's a
couple things I could do
number one is I could add a Y offset and
the y offset is kind of like a global
variable for this object it could start
it it could start at zero itself and and
the y offset is the thing that doesn't
change for each one but just changes
over time itself so if I use two
dimensional Perlin noise now you're
going to see this kind of like blobby of
shape now the Y offset is changing
rather fast so I might want to slow that
down quite a bit and you can see now
I've got some a more undulating like
type thing I could have also by the way
just not used to dimensional noise but I
could have just I could just say X
offset plus Y offset and you'll see this
is doing something this looks like it's
actually kind of like spinning because
the noise IDs are actually kind of
rotating around so that's another effect
that you can kind of get by just like
changing where the noise is beginning
and even this like this doesn't bother
me so much but you could consider using
something like this in agario to make it
kind of a little bit squishier and in
that sort of thing so this account gets
you the basic idea of having a bit of a
Perlin noise ball so to speak I think
what I'll do hopefully remind me in the
comments is when I publish this code I
might simplify this even further to just
have that kind of shape thing and you
can kind of tweak it let's think about
and about improvements that we could
make to to tie the last point
to the first point itself okay so thanks
for watching this right at some point
I'd like to show you how to add some
spring forces to this which would be
another another nice kind of quality to
it as well okay thanks for watching this
coding challenge and I'll see you again
in a future video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
