this video I want to look at pulling
data from an API and answer the question
what is an API how do you sign up to use
one and how do you get data from it and
how do you visualize something or use
that data in your own work so let's just
let's just start in a weird sort of way
from scratch obviously I kind of planned
this somewhat in advance but I'm gonna
open up my web browser here okay and I'm
gonna go to don't don't look at that
page let me go to Google and I'm gonna
say I'm looking for looking for I'm
looking forward to hearing from you
I really am by the way this is sort of
an interesting this is totally not I'm
not gonna get into a side about how they
did this predictive stuff I'm looking
for weather data hmm weather calm no
let's see I'm looking for open weather
data oh there we go
so here so in other words you're most
likely going to have to start searching
on the internet to find the data you
want or your friend will tell you about
some data this brand this is a nice API
to use to start weather data I think is
intuitive it's easy to understand like
we're most of us are familiar with the
weather and it's like group small chunks
and you can query it in different ways
whether for this city weather for this
day I'm not sort of thing historical
weather data current weather data so
there's a lot of like parameters and
ideas here just packages this simple
idea the same time it's a little bit of
a cliche to say like I'm gonna make a
project with weather data cuz it's kind
of everybody's first example that said
that's what I'm going to use so let's
say you found this thing called open
weather map and I'm going to click on
this and I'm going to see that hmm
clearly there's weather here data here
there's stuff being visualized and what
I'm looking for is something that says
API API stands for application
programming interface meaning I am
writing a program open weather map is a
program their programs running on their
server my program is ultimately running
on my server whether that's just my
laptop or some server that I'm going to
upload my project to and those two
servers need to talk to each other I
could draw a diagram with like two
circles and things talking each other
but you get the idea they need an
interface by which to talk to each other
what an API is it's a thing for
computers to talk to each other rather
than the really human beings the thing
that's me and you like we should really
spend time talking to each other - I
think that would be but hopefully
computers talking to another can help us
talk to each other I don't know think
about that and think about that as you
make projects that's that's too much of
an aside okay so um so look it's it is
fall you can see the nice changing
colors and leaves it's quite lovely so
how do you suddenly use this API so the
first thing you want to do is click on
it and you can see like okay well
there's some information here for
example what if I want to get let's say
I want to get current weather data let
me slide this over a little bit I'm
going to click on more and looking here
I could see ah there's like all this
stuff so here's the thing ultimately the
ease of using a particular API is as
good as its how easy is going to be is
how well-documented it is are there
examples is there a video somebody
telling you how to use it a lot of api's
I'm going to show you this we look at
the New York Times r-word Nick have an
online tool like a form that you can
like sort of play with and test out the
API which almost like writes the code
for you in a weird sort of way so these
are types of things that you might use
but for us right now I'm just going to
kind of say like oh look at this
examples of API calls API to open
weather map org slash data / 2.5 weather
Q equals London that's good enough for
me right now I'm happy to work with the
weather data in London so what I can do
is I can copy this URL I could actually
just click on it and I'm going to open a
new tab and I'm going to put it in there
and I'm going to hit enter and I'm going
to be excited about getting my weather
data ah shoot so this is going to happen
to you now it used to be open weather
map was actually one of the examples
that are used to demonstrate because it
actually didn't require an API key it
would give you the data anyway but this
is typically something that you're going
to find if a company or an organization
or just some person is opening up their
data they want you to identify yourself
when you're asking for the data so you
have to sign up for account and get a
special key that way they can track how
often are you accessing the data what
are using the data for and ultimately
this is a paid service so we can use
open weather map for free but if you
build I don't know what the thresholds
are but if you built an application
that's like as millions of users that
are querying weather data you're going
to have to pay a feed open weather map
to have all those queries so we could go
to this URL which would give us more
information about it but ultimately what
I'm going to do is go back to here and
I'm going to look for us sign up so
let's go to sign up and I'm already
signed in log out log out I'm going to
enter in an email Daniel I'll go signup
Schiffman net and I'm going to make up a
password should I tell you what my
password it wouldn't that be exciting
porcupine can all use my I never like
what happens to the internet if I just
say what my password is technical hiccup
I'm now going to log into my open
weather map account you're gonna have to
create an account I already had an
accounts trying to create account the
same email address so it's easier if I
just sign in to mine when I'm going to
hit submit here and once you create an
account you're going to see that you
have an API key an API key is like this
sort of secret thing that identifies you
that you can use in your code to make
the API query so now I've to ask myself
if I copy/paste this API key where do I
put it where do I put it this is the
path for for querying open weather map
how do I get the API key to be
associated with that path and this
brings up a topic I really do actually
need the white board which relates to
URL query strings so when you're working
with api's you typically need to not
just say give me all your weather you
need to say things like give me all your
weather in this city
on this day give me the high temperature
give me the low temperature and then you
also need to say with this API key how
do you do that so if you have some URL
like open weather you know map dot org a
query string is a thing that comes at
the end of the URL now there's different
ways of formatting query strings but the
most common or one of the more common
ones that at least you're going to see
with open weather map
we'll see some other scenarios of this
is excuse me starting with a question
mark
so the question mark indicates now I'm
going to give this URL some parameters
some parameters might be things like
City equals London so these are now as
almost everything system programming
name the value pairs city equals London
so this is saying give me open weather
map at City equals London you can see
that's actually already in there now
it's not City it's Q equals London
because that's what open weather mapped
expects Q that's kind of like for query
now we need to have a second one in
addition to the city I need to give it
the API key so multiple multiple queries
are strung together with an ampersand so
you can say something equals something
ampersand something else equals
something ampersand something else
equals something there's a few little
gotchas here like you can't use spaces
and certain characters that aren't valid
in new yours ways around that through
URL encoding and decoding and hopefully
I'll mention that or getting some more
specifics about that later
but this is essentially what we need to
practice forming an ageist formula now
to see that the API works but then
ultimately putting these kinds of query
strings together dynamically in our code
because what if the user types in the
city and then you get that from the user
and then you've got to insert what the
user put into your API query so over
here I can now add something I can say
and I happen to know this in advance app
ID whoops app ID equals and paste and
you can see now I have added into the
query string Q equals London and app ID
equals my special API key and I hit
enter and look at that I now have JSON
data look it worked
so this is data I can now load into my
sketch and visualize based on the API I
can I can draw something based on the
current weather in London and I'll do
that in a moment but first I want to
make something this is kind of now we're
getting this thing like this is like
JSON data and the computers could have
no problem reading it but to me this is
actually quite hard to dig
through looking at it and I would really
prefer if I had it nicely formatted with
some spaces and some line breaks and
some colors and so one thing I recommend
doing if you're going to work with data
and ap is is installing a Chrome
extension that will automatically format
the JSON data for you as your like
notice I haven't even written any code
static like ten minutes into this video
just like as I'm starting to figure out
how the API works you know I'm just
working in the browser so there's a
Chrome extension I'm into just Google
Chrome extension JSON format or there's
lots of them this is one that I
particularly like it's the first one
that came up I'm going to say add to
Chrome and say add extension that's been
added and I'm going to close that and
I'll get a link to that but now I'm
going to hit refresh and you can see now
this has actually been formatted and you
can see these buttons raw and parse so I
can see this is the raw data and this is
it parse to look nicely and what's
really nice about this is I can you know
sort of fold this up so for example I
can see that what's actually here this
is the sort of root object that has
these things in it it's an object that
has a coordinate a weather a base a main
a wind a cloud I don't you know I have
to read the documentation to see what
all these things are but for example
let's look under main like so by the way
these are values I think they're in
Kelvin so one thing I didn't specify is
the unit of measurement right maybe I
want to get these in you know Celsius or
in Fahrenheit so let's actually take a
minute that's another thing that I need
to add to this query string right I
probably need to say something like Q
equals London and a PI D equals my my
query string and units equals Imperial
or metric or something like that so if I
go back to the whoops if I go back to
the API come back come back and we look
through the documentation I probably ups
we can see here like I could kind of
like poke through this and it's probably
to give me some information like it's by
zip code I'm looking pause this video
okay actually let's just be better about
this parameters min max format look at
this format units format let's click on
this units equal there we go so I can
see here here's some exam you know this
is really this is your life welcome to
your life now if you want to do stuff
got to look through this stuff and
figure it out and I found that units
equals metric I assume that's going to
give me the information in Celsius let's
let's be metric today I feel like being
metric so I can add to this particular
URL I can say and and units equals
metric and I'm going to refresh the page
and you can see now I've got the
temperature is thirteen point five seven
Celsius so this is get doing it this is
working better for us so now now I'm
just back in that scenario like let's
say I want to draw something onto the
screen based on the current temperature
so all I need to do now I've now that
I've worked this out in the browser
I have grabbed I have this particular
URL I can go into my code I'm going to
open up my p5 sketch now and I can say
load JSON that long URL got data and now
I'm going to do that thing where I write
the function got data give it Dave and
then just say print line data just to
see that it works or to discover that
may be what I need is JSON P let's see
if it works it worked so this is a case
where I don't need JSON P if I didn't
see anything down there I'd probably add
JSON P and now I might say something
like VAR weather and say like when I get
the data weather equals data and then
here I might say if weather now I can
draw some stuff based on that weather so
let's pick something that I want to do
let's say I want to draw one circle
based on the temperature and one circle
based on the humidity it's my object
main temp or my object name Zumanity
so I could say ellipse
at 150 comma 100 and then whether main
temp as the piece of data that's going
to be the size of this particular lips
and then I'll draw another one that is
just humidity whether main humidity and
we can see now that oops and let me I
kind of over let me put that it let me
make that canvas a little bit bigger and
put this at 100 and put this at 300 and
we can run this again and we can see
look at this this particular circle is
being drawn with the temperature and
that second circle is being drawn with
the humidity so again I've done a
completely trivial result it's not
particularly interesting I'm only
getting the disk exact piece of data
from the weather in London so I'm going
to stop this video now because I would
in the next video I want to look at how
I might form a query string how I might
allow the user to type in a city and
then show the weather back for that city
or click on a link or something like
that that's what I'll do in the next
video
but for you for your exercise is sign up
for open weather map or another API try
to load that data try to see if you need
an API key try to draw something based
on that data and if you can make it a
bit more flexible like you could you
know maybe that the API call happens
multiple times or different sitting you
try that's a little that's a might be a
little bit tricky but see what else you
can sort of imagine and do with this
basic idea and hopefully this was
helpful to you with a sort of very
basics and beginning steps of starting
to work with api's so thanks for thanks
for watching and I've got a lot more
data and video a data API videos that I
intend to make with it I've made a bunch
today that you're seeing now and you're
watching for the future you'll see the
next ones but if you're actually
watching this right now the next ones
will be coming soon probably next week
ok thanks very much
and I'm going to hit stop on record
