programming from A to Z and the topic
for this session is generating text with
something called a context-free grammar
so what I want to do in this video is
just talk a little bit about the broader
topic of what a grammar is and then
specifically what a context-free grammar
is and look at some different and give
you an overview of what code libraries
and algorithms you might use to generate
text with a context-free grammar and as
soon as I'm done with that I'm gonna
just move into the next video and
actually start to implement a grammar to
generate stories and texts or poems or
whatever and you will see how you can do
it so if you want to just jump to the
code you can skip to the next video but
here I'll give you kind of an overview
so if you're interested in the topic
first of all so what is a grammar this
is a page about grammars buy at Matt
might on Twitter I find it a useful
overview of grammars I'll link to it in
this video's description and Matt might
makes the point which is grammar you
could think of it as the language of
languages right so we have language but
how do you describe the syntax and
structure of a language what's the
language for a language and that's what
a grammar is and if I were to scan
through this page there's you know diff
bacchus now form grammar and a buck is
now extended bacchus now there's all
these different syntax syntaxes how do
you say house what's the plural syntax
some people write in the comments for me
and a variety of ways of expressing
grammars for a language one thing I'll
point out to you whoops is this is a
grammar programming languages are made
actually with this thing called a
context-free grammar so I haven't
described what a context-free grammar is
but you can see here this is a
context-free grammar for C++ statements
so you can see what is a statement could
be if expression and statement or if
expression statement else statement what
is a statement a statement could be do
statement while expression so this idea
of fitting things in to a grammar a
defined structure so let's think of okay
and so there are a variety of kind of
now that sort of seminal work on
grammars you can real link to the paper
by Noam Chomsky where you can think of
grammars divided into four categories so
there's this kind of unrestricted
grammar type zero which is just
basically every
in English languages are like highly
sophisticated complex grammar but there
are also context-sensitive grammars
which I think will actually make a lot
more sense once I describe what a
context-free grammar is so there's a
bunch of different kinds of grammars and
I Accord you to explore this hierarchy
of grammars and think more deeply about
grammars beyond what I'm gonna do in
these videos but the classic grammar
that can be used to create generative
text is a context-free grammar so let me
talk up to you a little bit about in
general what a context-free grammar is
maybe we'll look and then I'll show you
some tools that allow you to generate
with context-free grammars and then I'll
just start writing code so context-free
grammar is made up by I'm gonna say you
could we can use different terms for
these things but there's an alphabet or
there's a set of valid elements in the
language like you can only say the cat
you know meow and puppy all right those
are that's the alphabet of the language
it only has four possible words right
the there are also in a grammar there
some of these are what are known as
terminal and some of these are known as
non terminal so the alphabet is terminal
and non terminal now this is probably a
bad idea
but I'm going to just use like sort of
generic characters for this alphabet so
let's pretend that we have an alphabet
which is a B and C and those are this is
the alphabet and these are non-terminal
characters I don't know what I put these
little quotes around them for for no
particular reason and then we also have
terminal characters and those will be D
E and F okay so these are terminal
characters now the grammar will also
have production rules a production rule
is a rule and these are also referred to
as like replacement rules so a
production rules are ruled by which if
you have a certain character
like eh what does that get replaced with
let's say egg gets replaced with B D E
and B gets replaced with a F and C gets
replaced with a so this now could make
up the entire grammar and I kind of hate
what I'm doing here and I'm doing it
anyway and I knew this morning when I
was having the same discussion that I
shouldn't do it this way because I think
this makes so much more sense if I have
content here right but let's look at it
let's just think about it in the
abstract sense and as I start to go
through code examples we'll get to well
I think it might if this is confusing to
you when we ask some actual content it
might click in for you okay so these are
the production rules so now what I need
is this is sometimes referred to as an
axiom or maybe a starting sentence but
what I'm gonna call it an axiom just to
be formal here what I need is an axiom
so what do I start with so let's say I
start with the axiom a C so what that
means is I start with a C and then I
start to go through my replacement rules
what am I doing here a becomes B D E so
this becomes b d e and c becomes a now
we do this again B becomes a F and D is
terminal so D stays as D E is terminal
so e stays as E and a becomes what B D E
so I could keep going now event I didn't
do this very smartly because my non term
might non-terminal characters all all
get replaced with something that is also
non terminal so this is kind of this
this way this this is known as an
expansion I'm expanding out the grammar
by iteratively running these replacement
rules over and over again and when we
write the code for this you'll see this
happens with this fancy thing called a
recursive algorithm but you can see here
that that that this is going to get go
until infinity
but if I were to do this in a slightly
different way for example I'm going to
show you a grammar created by Alison
Parrish for a class that she teaches
called reading and writing electronic
text I encourage you to check out those
examples a lot of my code is ported from
her code in Python and you can see here
here are here are the sets of production
rules sentence becomes noun phrase noun
phrase verb phrase or a sentence becomes
interjection noun phrase verb phrase a
noun phrase becomes determined or noun
or determiner noun that verb phrase so
you can see these are all the possible
and these are all non-terminal
non-terminal elements of the grammar and
then here you can see um here are some
terminal elements for example
interjection could be O or my or Wow or
Dan sort of like a cursed on my youtube
stream I just call it my YouTube stream
that's also a little bit weird
determiner is this that are the so if I
were to just go to the example I'm going
to not bother looking at the code but we
can see here if I go to week eight a
context-free grammar reader this example
generates is this the right one that I
was looking at yes this example
generates sentences based on that
grammarly move this a little bit over
and zoom in here and you can see Wow the
bald restaurant sneezes my the smug
corsage computes that overstaffed
corsage this corsage inter inter
interprets the blue restaurant so
there's a lot of course notches in this
particular generative system so it's
interestingly enough typically what you
might use a grammar for I'm over here
now and I kinda want to leave this but I
think I want to refer to this later what
you might worth you use a grammar for is
you have an existing sentence maybe you
have a bit of code like for example what
if I go to a code editor I'm jumping
around like a crazy person here let's
see if this works with code pen I'm
gonna go to code pen and we make a new
pen and I'm gonna say something like if
for VAR I equals zero let's make this
bigger
I is less than I plus plus now where's
my JavaScript linter to God here we go
here look at this unexpected token so
look at this how does the code
environment understand that this
semicolon is unexpected it should be
there so normally not normally but one
way of using a grammar and in this case
a context-free grammar is to look at an
existing sentence like this block of
code and see if it fits
right the reverse see if it fits the
structure of the grammar going in
Reverse and if it doesn't right then
there's an error like oh there's got to
be something here like let's look at it
without the parentheses we can see here
right unexpected token so it's a lot
expected tell you it's getting some new
thing that doesn't fit doesn't fit the
grammar so this is one way that grammars
are used to evaluate text and that might
be something you explore but what I'm
exploring is the reverse which is saying
here is the grammar start with a
sentence start with an S turn that in to
either noun phrase verb phrase or
interjection noun phrase verb phrase and
let's see what we get again now we I
showed this to you already but let me
make a new one and we can see that
seagull right that is a noun phrase
determiner noun that seagull
so that can see that that fits that
computes this corsage is a verb phrase
right which is I probably ended up
getting oh you know it that it actually
made the noun phrase determiner now that
so you can see how this gets complicated
right I'm trying to I could diagram and
run backwards
but the point is I don't need to do that
I allow you to do is write the grammar
and then if I have a system that
generates text it habit so one of the
nice things about working with this and
it's say you're gonna do a exercise or
try some playful experiment based on
these videos that I'm making is you
could just write your grammar you don't
need to write any code potentially
because there are a lot of existing
systems that will read a grammar file
and generate text based on it and so let
me give you an overview so I'm going to
show you three things um the first thing
I'm going to use is a grammar called
tracery a grouse are a grammar story
grammar generation system
called race tracery for JavaScript
written by Kate Compton at galaxy Kate
here on github and you can see there's a
syntax to it which I'll go over and talk
about in the next video there's some
nice examples I'll just pull up this is
one of my favorite ones I don't know if
this is going to if this is called
interruption Junction so I don't I
encouraged so this is you know I don't
know if you guys can hear that but but
you know you can't cuz I haven't I
haven't piped the sound of this laptop
in through the stream but I need to
click and need to click so you can see
this is one of the things that's
interesting about working with these
generative systems whether you're doing
the Markov chain or context-free grammar
or combining them in some way is really
not just the algorithm and what it
generates but the context where you
display those results and I think
thinking about dialogue or interactive
animated story system there's a lot of
interesting possibilities there and if
you look through tracer e's the github
repository for tracer you'll find a lot
of links to a lot of fun and interesting
projects made with these kind of crazy
grammars so tracery is the number it's
the first video that I'm gonna make
after this one will be showing you how
to build and generate text with a
tracery grammar another JavaScript
library read a digest that I have
mentioned before has a limb grammar
object right it's called RI grammar you
can add rules to it you can expand those
grammars you can check if there's a rule
you can load text into it you can remove
a role reset so you can see that there
this is essentially a JavaScript library
that it allows you to generate those
grammars I'm sorry that allows you to
generate text based on an existing
grammar from a file potentially so I'd
encourage you to look at tracery and the
reader library
finally I think for educational purposes
and ultimately if you really want to
play around with this idea of grammars
and context-free grammar that is and
customize it highly you might want to
write your own code or at least play
around with my example code and modify
it for example what if while the text is
being generated you're querying an API
to grab words from say word Nick or
something like that you might be limited
with using some of these existing
libraries or frameworks but if you've
written all the code yourself you can
kind of add in sort of features that are
more procedurally based inside of the
algorithm itself as it's running so in
that sense the last thing that I'll do
besides tracery and Rita is I will show
you how to write your own sorry how to
write your own grammar object and so I
have an example that makes a
context-free grammar object and that you
can add you can simply just add rules to
it whether it's coming from a file or
whether it's just directly in the code
so those are the things I'm going to
show you I'm gonna make up probably two
or three or four little video tutorials
all about context-free grammars
somewhere in there I'll try to make sure
I mention the whole idea of a
context-sensitive grammar but I think
it'll be it'll make more sense once we
start looking at their nitty gritty okay
so I hope you enjoyed this brief
overview check some of the links in this
video's description for more reading and
materials about the background in theory
of using grammars with text and
hopefully I'll see you in some of the
actual coding tutorial videos next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
