fractals what is a fractal okay let's
for a moment think about though think
about packing time sometime in your life
where you were sitting at a chair with a
little desk in front of it and you were
studying geometry middle school high
school last week who knows you were
learning about circles and polygons and
rectangles and lines and the
relationships between angles and
triangles and sides of shapes all this
stuff very important very interesting
but now let's think about and so let's
think about those shapes that you learn
to jump dream and how they might
describe things we find in our world
okay over here I have the top of a cup
of tea
and maybe your would say to yourself
that looks I mean you can't really look
it disappears with the white bedding but
right here it looks just like a circle
and over here I have this eraser and if
I look at this eraser it's rectangular
so to some extent these idealized forms
these Euclidian geometrical shapes can
describe the world we live in
I'm just staring at this camera it's
also very circular and rectangular but
think about nature and I have this but
think about nature look at these clouds
and I don't know look at these crazy
coastlines and these this seashell thing
and the waves or the water look at these
trees look at a lightning and all this
stuff and this man is talking about
fractals this is by the way is from PBS
hunting the hidden dimension I highly
recommend you watch that if you want to
kind of dive deeper into Franklin stuff
think about all that stuff that worked
perfectly
just the way I imagine these are not
shapes that we can describe with you
click idealized Euclidean forms we can't
describe a lightning bolt I mean maybe
it's a series of connected lines of the
overall quality of the shape mountains
coastlines lightning bolts these are
things we need a new type of geometry to
describe and it's not so new but it was
new in 1975 not actually it wasn't
really new in 1970 fractals have been
around for a very very long time but the
term fractal came about in 1975 with the
publication of this book I mean you know
condensing history there
sure there would the term came before
the book but the fractal geometry of
nature by Benoit Benoit Mandelbrot who
coined the term fractal and I'm sure
many of you have seen the Mandelbrot set
which is a very very famous fractal
shape I don't have a prepared image to
show you but so what what I'm talking in
circles here what we want to do today is
look at what is this thing called a
fractal that describes somehow the these
shapes that appear in nature and if we
can understand what a fractal is then
could we write code to implement
algorithms behind that would generate
fractal patterns that's what we're gonna
do today it's very exciting so well
let's think so let's say I want to
define the term fractal a little bit
more formally perhaps so a fractal is a
shape that when broken into parts right
fractal from the Latin fractus meaning
broken a shape that when broken into
parts the parts look like a copy of the
whole shape now what does that mean
exactly so a very common scenario which
will actually make a processing example
that implements in a later video is a
tree so let's say I draw a line here and
then I connect that line with two other
lines in each of those two lines I
connect with two other lines each of
those two lines that connect with other
two other lines I'm making all these
lines a little bit shorter every time I
do and I sit here all day and that would
be a very happy person actually just but
I think I'm taking up to attend this
video so I'll stop but you can see here
you know I've barely scratched the
surface of how many times I can keep
connecting these lines if I grab this
particular branch and bring it down here
and kind of rotate it so it faces up
what do I have here
I have this shape which is essentially
the same as the bigger shape we started
with this is the concept of self
similarity very the sort of key quality
of fractals fractals are self-similar
meaning the parts of the shape look like
the whole shape and here we have an
exact copy of the whole shape inside the
part which is an important distinction
this is a proof exact fractal one thing
I should point out though that self
similarity isn't just enough to make a
fractal there is a self-similar shape if
I take a part of that shape this little
line segment and zoom in on it looks
like the original line but this shape
doesn't have I would say which is a sort
of important thing a kind of fine
structure at small scales so this is an
important principle of fractals that
self similarity isn't just enough but I
would have returned back to this idea
that this was an exact fractal let's
take another scenario now this isn't a
shape in nature exactly but let me let
me let me pose this scenario
okay I'm gonna draw for you because I
have this I I was I've been checking the
stock market a lot recently not at all
but let's say we pick a company Apple
and we're gonna draw the price of Apple
stock this is what's been happening to
Apple stock and it's been going down
recently there we go this is a graph of
Apple stock now let me ask the question
over what type or what time period have
I grabbed you is this a week a month ten
years a day a minute a second
you know trades happened very quickly we
don't know the answer to that because
let's just say for a second I said this
was one year what if I were to go and
grab this section which is maybe let's
say one month and zoom in on it maybe we
might have something that looks like
this the parts at at any level of zoom
the shape has the same quality to it now
this though is not exact right the
pattern that's zoomed in on this part of
this time period of the Apple stock is
not be exactly the one one month shape
is not exactly one year but it has the
same quality and this is often referred
to as a stochastic
fractal and the quality of the shape is
kind of has a random or probable
probability component to it so this is
an important distinction as we look at
different algorithms for generating
fractals and making things look natural
to what extent we want a kind of exact
copies or copies that approximate the
whole with some kind of range of
probability so okay so these are the
these are two important aspects of a
fractal but the key thing the
key element that I have not mentioned
which will lead us to this path of
making all these processing examples
that are going to be wonderful is the
concept of recursion fractals have are
generated from a recursive definition
now the idea of recursion is a beautiful
and elegant thing when we implemented it
makes our code so short than it's so
elegant looking and it creates this
beautiful pattern but it's a weird thing
and it's the thing that doesn't
immediately make sense to us and I want
to look first at a kind of just pure
mathematical scenario where a
mathematical concept is defined through
recursion recursion means a function of
recursive function is a function that
uses itself in its own definition it's
like saying hi it's like very warm under
these lights and people ask well what
does it mean for it to be warm and I say
oh the definition of warm is the feeling
you have when you feel warm I've had
probably a terrible example for all
sorts of linguistic reasons but I'm
using the term warm in my definition of
the of the term warm warm which seems
like a crazy thing that you shouldn't be
able to do but in math and in
programming this is actually something
you you should be doing it's wonderful
okay so what let's look at the classic
scenario is factorial and I think we're
going to look at this we're going to end
this video and start to look at
recursion in code next okay so let's
look at factorial so if you don't
remember what factorial is let's just
say for a moment write 5 factorial 5
factorial equals 5 times 4 times 3 times
2 times 1 we multiply the number five
times every number that come that is
that that is less than 5 all the way
down to 1 right ok so now let's look at
what 4 factorial is 4 times 3 times 2
times 1
Oh interesting look this is the same as
this right those match so I could
actually say 5 factorial equals 5 times
4 factorial interesting which actually
means I could say
the factorial of any number n equals n
times the number n minus 1 factorial
look at this this is definition of
factorial the definition of factorial is
n factorial equals the number n minus 1
factorial
have we really said what factorial is
here I mean it looks kind of like we
have it but we have actually because if
we play this out lore then we're saying
ah well you know what this really means
5 factorial goes 5 times 4 times 3
factorial which means 5 Pictou is 5
times 4 times 3 times 2 factorial which
is 5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1
factorial and actually we need to add
something to this definition 1 factorial
equals 1 and in a way this is our exit
condition now
I mean exit condition I'm using the term
exit condition because we're about to
program this stuff and one of the things
we're going to see with a recursive
definition is it's something like a loop
right you could imagine write the code
this is your exercise write the code to
define the function factorial int
factorial int n oh and kind of ran out
of space there you need to return the
answer well you could probably do this
fairly easily with a loop a for loop
right
let me 5-inch 4 times 3 times 2 times 1
and you know I equals 5 I is greater
than 0
I minus minus the result equals the
result times I right you could imagine
some loop where you say 5 times 5 minus
1 times 5 minus 2 times 5 plus 3 right
you have this loop that's doing that try
to do it recursion a loop has an exit
condition when I gets down to 1 stop
looping the recursive definition where
factorial is defined according to itself
right you call it self which calls
itself which calls itself which calls
itself that has to stop at some point
not in theoretical Fantasyland where we
make fractals that go on for infinity
which is an important question
but in real-life programming world where
we have discrete finite things we have
to have an exit condition so this is
what this is the principle by which we
are going to generate fractal patterns
instead of thinking in terms of numbers
which is probably if somebody would
probably tell me I can't believe you
started without visual imagery and
people need to learn visually so I don't
know but this is a nice scenario with
numbers we're going to look what does it
mean when we have a function which draws
something which is defined according to
drawing something so that's what we're
gonna do in the next video I had to open
the window is very hot I don't know if
you hear the sounds of the streets but
but before we get to that video try I'm
doing this try writing the code for
factorial and see how far you get and
obviously there's an answer in there
repository and I'll link to that below
as well okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
