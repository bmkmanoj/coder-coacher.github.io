within a loop but it is not the previous
video which was about a loop within a
loop this is really the video about a
loop within a loop that you imagined it
was going to be we're going to talk
about nested loops here so first of all
when do we need a nested loop well let's
first look at something we did a little
bit earlier over here we had a program
that we wrote when we were learning
about while and for loops which drew
this grid pattern on the screen we drew
a bunch of lines horizontally and we
drew a bunch of lines vertically we used
a while loop to horizontally a for loop
to do it vertically just to demonstrate
those two different kinds of loops so
that's one thing and it gives us this
pattern over here essentially we have
this pattern over here but what if
instead of these lines going across on
lines coming down we actually want these
to be rectangles and rectangles that we
could fill in perhaps each one is going
to get a random brightness value between
0 and 255 how are we going to do that
well let's first see why the structure
we have over there which is over there I
guess doesn't work ok so first thing
first let's actually just make both of
these for loops because I think that'll
be easier to look at so now we have a
for loop into x equals 0 X is less than
width and then x equals x x equals x
equals x plus 20 and now we have both
these loops and look what we've got
we've got two for loops one for the
horizontal lines one for the vertical
lines we have our grid pattern but
remember we need to fill in those
rectangles so we need to make each
element that we're drawing rectangle
rectangle rectangle rectangle rectangle
up and rectangles down all over in a
grid pattern on the screen so this
shouldn't be too hard right all we've to
do is change this to rectangle the
rectangle is at X comma Z
zero and its width is going to be I
don't know 20 and its height will be 20
and this one will be 0 comma Y and its
width will be 20 and title be 20 and
it's also a rectangle and we don't let's
just do a fill now of 127 just so we
give it will worry about random later oh
we're close but we all we have a loop to
draw rectangles across and a loop to
draw rectangles down how do we get the
ones in the middle well let's think
about that what are we really saying
here we're actually we could be saying
one thing right we have this idea of
columns which we're thinking of as X and
rows which we're thinking of as Y these
are the rows these are the columns we
are saying for every column draw a
rectangle we also are saying for every
row draw a rectangle well that's what we
did for every column draw a rectangle
for every row draw a rectangle
well actually what we want to say is for
every row draw all the columns of
rectangles for row zero draw all the
rectangles cross column 4 Row 1 draw all
the rectangles what does that mean
exactly we actually want to say not to
separate for statements we want to say
this for every row for every Y value for
every column draw a rectangle right
we're in row 0 draw all the rectangles
we're in row 1 draw all the rectangles
so this is what we're talking about a
nested loop we're going to do a loop
each time through every we're going to
look through all the rows and E for each
row we're going to loop through all the
columns so how does that work what if I
just took this loop and put it right
inside here
and what if I drew the rectangle then at
X comma Y let's look at this now we have
this grid pattern for every row for
every Y loop all the way through we have
a loop within a loop
this might sound confusing it might be
causing you some confusion you might
need to just take a break lie down for a
few minutes look at this again have a
snack look at it again but if you really
think about if you really can get
yourself to walk through this code
what's happening well first Y is equal
to 0 then what happens okay well then X
is equal to 0 then X is equal to 20 then
X is equal to 40 and X is equal to 60
etc etc etc what happens next okay we're
done with that we're in the outside loop
Y is equal to 20 then what's next Y X is
equal to 0 and X is equal to 20 so for
each Y that we're looping there's
another loop that happens inside and we
can see this because the X loop is
inside the outer while loop while loop
so I encourage you to sort of like walk
yourself through this on your own how do
we make them all random color
well easy I can just take this fill
right here and say hey fill random 255
and there we go now we have this pattern
where each one of those gets a random
color this is essentially a like a
checkerboard or chessboard I should have
had an exercise prepared for you so if
you're looking for an exercise well
there's there's lots of interesting
things you could try for example what if
you one of the things that you could try
is what if you were to do this nested
loop but instead of having every color
be random have the color actually be
organized on some along some principle
like for example what if the colors were
all darkest in the center and lightest
in the outside and the outside I think I
you need a clue for this there is a
function in processing called distance
the distance function takes four
arguments how where are we oh I didn't
start the timer who knows how long I've
been going but it takes four arguments
it takes an XY of one point and an XY
and another point and it gives you
the distance so you could use you could
actually even color these according to
how far away they are from the mouse
kind of an interesting problem but you
give that a try
and I might try to if I ever rerecord
this video of the note to self I might
try to think of a better exercise that's
to do with nested loops I'm sure one of
you will have a suggestion
somebody will and will send it to me
okay so I think this actually concludes
all of the videos the initial videos at
least about loops probably fill in some
more and add some more as we as I sort
of come up or people ask questions or
there's other things okay so that's the
end of this one thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
