poets tutorial I'm going to talk about
github issues how to file an issue and
then also how to refer to that
particular issue as you are working on
particular commits now what is what our
github issues for now this is one of the
few things that I'm showing you that's
actually not necessarily a git concept
this is purely something that exists as
a layer on the github website so one at
some point when you take your repository
and put it locally onto your laptop
picture I'll show you I think in the
next video those issues won't come the
issues just are for the purpose of
collaborating through the github website
itself but they do play a vital role and
I find them incredibly useful in
managing complex software collaborative
github project thingamabobs okay so any
repository here I have the rainbow poem
repository you never know when a pull
request is going to come in while I'm
making this video by the way I hit
refresh and hope I see a pull request no
okay whatever there's one that's an old
one oh I'm off the track here okay so
let's look here there is a button here a
link here up here called issues issues
is a place to leave a comment about a
project you know this can be a variety
of things it can be I found a bug when I
try to prep when I press this button on
this app the whole thing crashes or it
can be you know you missed I noticed
that this word was misspelled or this it
could also you can use issues to have
feature requests or to ask questions in
general an issue you get up issues are
not really meant for the types of things
you might find on a programming help
forum they're more specific questions
and issues and bugs and feature feature
topic discussions around a particular
project that said all projects that
github repositories probably treat and
use issues in different ways you can use
labels you can organize them so many
possibilities what I will say to you is
that in particular if you're watching
these videos and you're interested in
processing or p5.js if the sometimes can
feel very scary and intimidating like
I'm going to file I found what I think
is a bug but I'm going to file an issue
I'm gonna write something in everyone's
and yell at me and tell me I did it
wrong and I will say to you that this is
not the way the world should work or
github or get should work or in
particular please if you're not sure
file the issue anyway in processing or
p5.js projects at right at Schiffman and
you're in your description to say that
and say that i said you should don't
worry there's no way you could do it
wrong it's a point of the communities to
be open and welcoming and to help
everybody figure out how to do all this
stuff nobody really knows how to do it
anyway the people who say that they do
probably don't really any I definitely
don't so anyway so please I'm also just
making this video to encourage you to
file github issues and participate in
the open-source community now let's say
I go over here and click on issues there
aren't any issues because there aren't
any but I'm going to write a new issue
so I click here and write a new issue is
you should get a title like today is
Earth Day today is Earth Day and I think
the poem should reflect that now another
thing you could do which is really
useful this is a little bit of an aside
but let's say you you're trying to let's
say you're trying to reference something
that's visual you can quickly take a
screenshot of something I just took a
screenshot and I can actually just write
down here that screenshot should be
right here on the desktop you can see
that image file I can drag that
screenshot right into here and it's
going to upload it to the issue I can go
here under preview and I can see this is
what my issue looks like now it has an
image in it and also the other thing
that I should point out is this whole
this entire issue thread you can use
something called markdown which is a
special kind of markup for writing
things for example this is a link you
know so this is the syntax for having a
link to something you can see and I sit
and this is bold I think or maybe that's
italic that's bold so there's a lot of
markup that you can learn and if you
want to learn about that you can
somewhere on here there's a styling
marked out with markdown is supported
if I click on that it's it's get taking
me to a whole page which gives me all
the stuff about mark Don but that's a
little bit of an aside so you can see
now I am writing my issue and I'm going
to now click Submit now I could add
labels like I could say it's a bug a
Help Wanted there's a sort of standard
labels I could create my own labels I
could add it to a milestone I could just
sign it to somebody saying like this is
the thing you should work on I'm going
to sign it to myself
rainbow coder and then I'm going to now
submit this issue and you can see now
the issue is submitted and if I click
back on issues here is a list of all the
issues now notice a very important thing
here I have one open issue and zero
closed issue an issue is open until it
is resolved when it is resolved it is
closed
I only the person who submitted the
issue or the owner of the repository can
close an issue so you should know by the
way that what I'm doing even though I'm
the owner of this repository and I'm
submitting the issue to this repository
I never I have a tie for going to figure
out how long these videos are and I
never hit start on the TIFR I'd start
now I probably talking for about five
minutes but um so I was saying it's not
going to go that I am the owner of this
repository and I'm submitting issues but
you as somebody else could come you can
submit issues to any repository now
let's say I want to resolve this issue
so pretending it was it means submitted
it or doesn't matter even it was being
submitted I now want to make a change in
my poem to acknowledge this particular
issue and I want to refer back to that
issue so let's do that I'm going to go
to I'm actually going to just open a new
tab so I can come back to that tab and
I'm going to go here I'm gonna go back
to the poem and I'm going to click edit
I'm going to zoom in here and and I'm
going to right at the top
today is earth earth day that's probably
as capitols Earth Day it's like a
holiday Day special thing so I'm going
to write today is Earth Day and I'm
going to say adding Earth Day as per now
how do we
refer to a particular issue all issues
have an ID number and I'm going to go
back to this tab and see what is this
issues ID number it's actually number 10
which is surprising I would have thought
it was started with number 1 but that's
fine we could be sure about that but if
I click on that link you can see up here
in the URL it's issues slash 10 that's
important too so I can actually just say
in my change as perd number 10 so I am
now making commit relevant to that
particular issue I'm going to now click
commit and if I go back to this issue
page and hit refresh you can see here
the camera is about to go off it took a
second for it to appear you can see that
this page now automatically has a little
entry that said that rainbow coder added
a commit that referenced this issue just
now this is very useful because it's
some day later I want to revisit this
discussion about this particular issue I
could now click click directly on this
and I could see oh this was the change
and I can look directly at that
particular change associated with that
issue now if I felt that that was done I
could click this closed issue and then
the issue would be closed and would go
into the close category however I can do
something else there are certain
keywords that will automatically close
an issue with the particular commit so
for example I go back to the poem and
hit edit again today is Earth Day
I love Earth Day as the second line of
the poem I'm adding I love Earth Day I
could say this fixes number 10 adding
that I love Earth Day so now if I use
the word fixes inside my particular
commit message it's going to recognize
that whoa I don't want to close to stop
the broadcast it's going to recognize
that as a commit that fixes oh I messed
the camera up a little bit that's fine
everything's okay it's gonna recognize
that sorry it's going to recognize that
as a commit that resolves that issue and
closes it automatically so let's see if
that happens I'm going to say commit and
now if I go back to
uh this particular issue and hit refresh
like it's already closed so you can see
rainbow coder closed this in four five
three five five f5 what's that remember
oops
every single Here I am every single
commit on the tree of your dip
repository changes thing above AAB this
light is casting a terrible shadow it's
not supposed to do that every single
commit has a particular unique
identifier known as a hash code with it
and that's what you're seeing here so
incidentally you can also reference what
we could also reference commits in an
issues so sorry
um so I'm gonna go back and then this is
a little a little bit of a frantic video
but try to think more about rainbows and
the earth and be a little more calm but
I'm gonna go to my history here and I'm
going to see first of all we can see
look at all these people contributing to
this repository please file your pull
requests and I'm going to go and I'm
going to look this particular issue of
this particular commit I'm going to
click on it and I'm going to what I'm
going to do is I'm going to grab in the
URL this full hash code I'm gonna and
I'm gonna do command C so I now have
copied that and I am going to create an
issue that says I'm not I'm not so sure
about this change I propose that we
consider doing something slightly
different though I do love the thinking
I don't know him right and then if I
paste that value in here see how I paste
that hash code into the text of this
particular issue and then I hit submit
you can see how that resolves itself
automatically to a link that goes
directly to that particular change today
is Earth Day so there's lots of things
you can do on github by referencing
issue numbers and referencing commit
hash codes to in your commit messages or
in your issue descriptions so here's
what I would like you to do I would like
you to do a couple things if you're
watching this video one file an issue on
my rainbow poem repository say something
about what you think the poem should
have then I would suggest that you make
a pull request that references that
issue that resolves it see if you could
do that I'm going to accept all of your
issues and pull requests and close them
on will be exciting to see how that
works for you and once you've done that
you're well on your way to contributing
to other open source github repositories
okay great so unless wraps up this part
for if it goes in part four about git
and github thanks very much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
