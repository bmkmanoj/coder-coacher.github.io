of videos about arrays and what I would
like to look at in this video
oh yes I'm in the right place is this
particular piece of code and augmenting
it a little bit so let's look at this
for a second and I've got this sketch
here that's drawing two circles so
before I was demonstrating here's a
single variable I can just use that
single variable directly and draw a
circle with that the value of that
variable is the width or I can access an
individual element in the array via its
index 0 1 2 so this ellipse has a
diameter of 46 pixels so what I would
like to do is I'm going to get rid of
this which was just for showing the
difference between a variable and array
and what I'm going to do is say ok well
let's actually draw all these ellipses
I'll use all the values in the array so
I'm going to start at 100 and use oops
scuse me the zero element then I'll go
to 200 and use the index 1 element then
I'll go to 300 using it next - yeah a
little bit of copy pasting and we can
see here 200 300 400 I should probably
make the canvas 500 pixels wide and run
this and look at that wonderful I have 4
ellipses each with a diameter using a
value from the array the first value is
100 the second one's 25 the second one's
for third ones 46 and the fourth one 72
and those ellipses look like they're
right so you can see here that I can use
every element of the array and repeat
the same thing over and over and over
again with the elements of the array and
with a little copy pasting it works just
fine everybody's happy you do a little
dance like a little like my code works
dance and there you go but there's a
problem here this works is 4 but if you
had 400 you won't be happy dancing
you'll be copying pasting you'll have
carpal tunnel syndrome and things will
be very uncomfortable in your life
however there is a solution to this
problem and you might remember it from I
remember me from a previous video the
for-loop video so we could use a loop
right a loop is a method for counting
and repeating a task and you can see
here that this line of code is repeated
it's really the same line of code every
time the only things are different or
the X location and the index into the
array so let's let's come over here and
let's look at what let's remind
ourselves whoever we are what I'm going
to remind myself and maybe you're
watching what a for loop is so I could
write for and then I could say VAR i
equals 0 i could say i is less than 4
i plus plus now i should mention there's
no actual requirement that you use the
variable named i it's just sort of a
convention you could say j or n or cat
or apple it doesn't matter this is a
variable name that you're making up and
the way a for loop works ok everyone off
it could fix that the way the for loop
works is if you start with 0 then you
check to see if 0 is less than 4 you
execute a task go up by 1 check to see
if it's still less than 4 execute a task
go up by 1 check to see if it's still
less than 4 execute a task go up by 1
check to see the Celestin form you know
by the way if it's not less than 4
you're done and stop executing that task
so if I were to say something like print
Ln I right here I would start at 0 I is
less than 4 so I would see 0 printed out
you know if this is the console I would
see 0 up here in the console then I
would go up by 1 I would be 101 is less
than 4 it would get printed out I would
go up by 1 2 is less than 4 then would
go up by 1 3 is less than 4 then it
would go about by 1 4 AHA 4 is not less
than 4 the loop would exit so this is
the result that I see this line of code
executes four times first with the value
0 then with the value 1 then with the
value 2 then with the value 3 in I look
at oh look at this over here I'm coming
back to you over here this line of code
executes four times first with value 0
then with the value 1 then with the
value 2 then with the value 3 right
exactly what we did here so there's no
reason why I couldn't
instead say for VAR i equals 0 i is less
than 4 i plus plus and then take this
line of code and say i and I remember
the
index into an array can be a variable so
let me comment this out and you can see
I'm making the case to you that this is
100% except for one thing that I forgot
which will fix in a second equivalent to
this this I wrote each line of code out
manually manually typing in the index 0
1 2 3 here this line of code is being
repeated four times and the index is
dynamic it's zero it's one it's two it's
three so I should see four ellipsis in
the window just like we had before right
I see kind of like a couple and I don't
really know what's going on there let's
let me add something here let me say
stroke 255 and no fill let's try to look
at what's going on okay so this really
did work well I really size those in
such a like lovely way but there are 4
circles there and there the one is 100
pixels wide one is 25 pixels wide one is
46 one and 72 the issue is they're all
in the same location so here notice how
X change 100 200 300 400 but X doesn't
change here it's 100 for each one how do
we deal with that well interestingly
enough if I come back over here these
values I had 0 1 2 3
what if I were to multiply each one of
these values by 100 what would I get and
let me give myself a little more space
here this I would get 0 times 100 is 0 1
times 100 is say it with me
even though you're we're not together
but just do it equals 100 200 300 so
that's close 0 100 200 300 what did I
have 100 200 300 400 hmm ah I know let's
add 100 to each of these if I add 100 to
each of these that means I have 100 200
300 400 so by multiplying by what by
taking that index value multiplying it
by 100 adding 100 I have the values that
I want so I even though I'm using it to
count through the indices of an array
it's just this like counting number I
can use it for 4 good for other purposes
so here we go I could say in
of drawing them at 100 i could say i
times 100 plus 100 and now if we run
this you know i kind of want to have
them have a little more weight to them
i'll make them kind of grayish inside
you can see there are my five circles
this worked this is a way of using an
array to have many elements but applying
the same action to all of those elements
and if you remembered this is kind of
where i began if these things were
objects not single numbers and i had a
thousand of them
I could just say display all of them
move all of them run all of them and
that's the topic that I will explore in
the next video for now I might say just
make that array of strings perhaps see
if you can display like five different
words in some pattern on the screen you
have make a color palette right you have
six colors and all the things you're
drawing you always pick a random color
for for a bunch of those like I said
that's why I said before loop through
and draw
I know make another array with colors
for each one of these and use the color
for it although I you know in that sense
I always would rather use an object for
that but you get the idea like make a
little riff off of this to act as an
exercise but really I think the goal
that you might have in your mind is as
you start to have multiple parameters
for things you're drawing on the screen
maybe those should be inside objects
because object is the collection of
properties okay that's the end of this
video which is eight minutes long which
is I feel like is a victory in some way
okay thanks very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
