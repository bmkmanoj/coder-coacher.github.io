two functions that are part of the p5.js
Dom library they are called select and
select all and the nice thing that we're
going to get you and me here in this
time and space that we're in the nice
thing that we're going to get from this
topic is not just those two functions
but more about CSS selectors if you
recall in this there's this idea in CSS
where you have a selector select or I
don't know in the year 2050 we'll be
saying select or but for now I'll just
say selector where you have this
selector an open curly bracket a close
curly bracket and then some name value
pairs that assign style information so I
don't like this panel switching so let's
say for example you have an HTML file
and inside that HTML file you have a
body and inside the body maybe you have
a paragraph and another paragraph and
maybe you have a button so there are
three elements here so in the previous
video I made about CSS the only selector
I talked about if I recall correctly is
that you could select a tag so if I put
P here then any style information that I
put here like font size you know
12-point any style information that I
put there gets applied to all paragraphs
however here's a question for you what
if what you want to do is this I'm very
little room here by the way it seems
like I might be in a big space very
crowded the thing you're I'm banging
into um what if what if what you wanted
to do was apply this font size only to
this paragraph well in that case there's
a concept known as an ID so okay so
let's make a list here over here
I'm gonna make a little box here what
are the kinds of selectors now I'm sure
there's a much longer more in-depth
explanation of this that involves lots
of like sub detail ideas of how you
combine selectors and subcategory
selectors but at its core there are
three main kinds of selectors there is
the tag itself so all members of a tag
type so button would apply to all
buttons on the page P would apply to all
paragraphs on the page and you know you
can extend from there the other types of
Dom element now there's a new kind
called an ID which is a single Dom
element so you can give a Dom element an
ID as follows P ID equals unicorn
so by this is called an attribute so
this is an attribute for this particular
Dom element it gets an ID in addition
there's a space there I'll type this out
in the computer which will make it more
clear but there's a space between the P
and then you say ID equals unicorn so
now if you wanted to apply style to just
this you might think what you would
write is just the term unicorn this is
not exactly correct though now this is
conceptually the right idea but IDs are
indicated by this pound symbol or as you
people who live in today's age would
call it a hash symbol so the same thing
you use for a hash tag this pounds a
pound but you know I like I think of the
old phones I mean new phones have this
do the pound symbol
anyway it's not important but I like
going off to the page here so if I say
this pound unicorn that indicates I'm
looking for an HTML element with the ID
unicorn now you could do weird things
like add the ID unicorn to this one but
you should not because the third kind of
tag
sorry tag is the wrong word that's a tag
pair paragraph tag
third kind of selector is called as a
class so class is a way of creating a
group of elements your own group
grouping a bunch together so let's say
you have a hundred paragraph elements on
the page but you want a way of selecting
or applying a style to just those ten
you could make those all the members of
a certain class you could add a class
could go across multiple kinds of Dom
element so you could have a bunch of
paragraphs and a bunch of image tags and
a bunch of div tags and they could all
be members of the same class so there
and and incidentally the class is
indicated by a dot so a tag is just the
tag itself P if IMG div an ID is a sign
via this hash symbol and a class via the
dot and if I wanted to make this
paragraph a member of a class you know
class equals rainbow okay so this is I
said I'm just gonna talk about the
Select and select all functions work but
I'm sure starting from this place of CSS
which i think is actually maybe a nicer
place to start so I want to look I'm
gonna open make an example that looks at
how you apply a particular style to an
ID to attach to a tag to an ID and to a
class and once we have that I will also
show you how to then access elements on
the page via those same ideas select all
the paragraphs select all the buttons or
select this single button with a given
ID okay so coming back over here I am at
6 minutes here let's make an example now
to make this example what I want to
actually do is and the volume still
working I want to actually do is I want
to start adding some HTML so let's do
this p ID equals unicorn and can you see
this class equals rainbow unicorns and
then I'll make another one that has
class equals rainbow
and this is unicorns and rainbows I need
more space here for my weird so you know
it's actually a unicorn it's a single
unit a unicorn and this is rainbows this
is more rainbows and this is you know
just a plain paragraph just a plain
paragraph so what I'm showing you here
is that I now have four paragraphs if I
select by paragraph I'll get all four if
i select by unicorn ID I'll just get the
first if i select by the rainbow class I
will get all three so let's look at this
if I hit run you can see there all of
the paragraphs now let's add some style
and let's say unicorn right this is is
font size 16 point rainbow is I'm not
just do font size just to be font size
is 12 point and P font size now
something really strange is going to
happen here 8 point and let's actually
let's make these quite a bit bigger 48
24 12 so let's look at what's happening
now
so something strange is going on here
which I didn't even really anticipate
when starting this video but I think
this is kind of an important way of
looking at it what I probably should
have done to be more clear is done
something entirely different to all
three kinds but notice all of those are
paragraphs so they should all be
12-point right but some of them are
members of the rainbow class those are
24 points and one of those that's a
member of the rainbow class is actually
has the ID unicorn so it's a 48 point so
one thing you'll notice is there's a
kind of a hierarchy here an ID the more
specific you are the more important that
style information is assigned so in
other words the font size 48.4 an ID
overrides what it was given for the
class or tag but we could do some things
here too so that's one thing that's
important to see class overrides tag ID
overrides class cuz you're getting more
specific tag is very general like all
the paragraphs class is like well a
group of those paragraphs an ID is like
no no no no not all of them not even a
group of them this exact specific one so
that takes greatest precedence it's not
the you could think it's the order that
I wrote it there but I'm almost certain
that if I move this from here to the
bottom it's the same so it's not the
order it's the it's the order of
precedence is not the order you type
them it's actually goes from tag class
to ID but let's let's make this a little
bit more clear let's do something like
padding a 16-point background color you
know F 0 F and then rainbow is the ones
that are rainbow actually so let's and
then we'll split the background color
here and then the font size for unicorn
is 48 points so this I think makes a bit
more sense where you can see that all of
the paragraphs get 16 point of padding
all of the paragraphs that are members
of the rainbow class get a purple
background and only the one that has the
unicorn ID gets a font size of 48 point
so this is a way of looking at how
selecting by tag or selecting by class
or selecting by ID will allow you to
address
elements and their style in print more
or less specific ways now this video is
about 10 minutes long that's it at the
beginning I'm going to talk about the
Select and select all function and then
kind of to lead up to that I wanted to
look at the different ways of selecting
things which are come back over here
which are which are by tag by ID or by
class so actually I think now what I
would suggest to you is create for
yourself a page which has a whole bunch
of Dom elements in it use different tags
paragraph image button etc give some of
things IDs give group things by class
and see if you can assign them all
different styles and how that works and
what what overrides what just play
around with that for a little bit
because in the next video what I will
show you how to do is what I said I was
going to do at the beginning of this one
is then start to select them into you
bring them into your code so that you
could dynamically assign behaviors or
events or callbacks or dynamic styles
via this idea of IDs and classes and
that sort of thing so that's what I'll
actually do in the next video but I'm
going to say like stop prepare yourself
the page and then in the next video
we're gonna look at the JavaScript
aspect of that ok so thank you for
coming and listening to unicorn and you
the unicorn and rainbows show which
apparently is what this is and I'm going
to hit come Mouse come I'm gonna stop
this video and start the</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
