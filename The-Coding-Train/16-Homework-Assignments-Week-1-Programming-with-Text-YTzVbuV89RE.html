to kind of follow this programming from
A to Z playlist as a course that you're
doing over some period of time I'm going
to talk you through homework assignment
or exercise that I think is useful to do
before you move on to the next set of
videos and if you're interested in
participating in a slack channel where
you can share and discuss these
assignments please check this video's
description for a link to the patreon a
crowdfunding system that I'm using for
that particular slack channel but of
course you could just do it and share it
with me on Twitter or in the YouTube
comments and I'd love to see the things
you guys are making so here's what I
think you should do number one is I
think okay so I you know in the previous
coding challenge where I implemented
Jack's liquid blows die astok technique
one of the things that you can try to do
for this homework assignment is invent
your own constrained writing technique
so constrained writing is a sort of form
of writing based on an algorithm or some
sets of constraints there's a French
collective of writers known as repo um
who pioneered a bunch of different
techniques
one of them is known as the n plus 7
technique this is a nice website which
I'll also include which implements this
particular technique in French is
actually referred to as s plus seven and
the way that this work n plus seven you
look at a body of text you look for
every single noun in that text you find
then the noun for every noun in a body
of text you look up that noun in the
dictionary find the 7/7 noun after that
one and replace it back into the text
and now you have a new text sort of with
randomly generated new nouns based on
the order of appearance in a dictionary
so you could try it one thing you might
do is just implement one of these
algorithms like make your own n plus
seven webpage you can see this webpage
works very similarly to a lot of the
examples that I've demonstrated for you
another kind of famous example is this
is one of my example so you can find in
a tizzy github repository this is using
William Burroughs cut-up method which is
actually a physical method of cutting up
text and folding text and matching it up
you can see that I have a slider which
were determines how much of the original
to keep you can drag a file in use a
text sample so one thing I'll mention is
this frame of reference is a good
reference for you to use where it's kind
of giving the user a lot of options
enter some text drag a file in use a
pre-loaded text sample an erasure
machine erase your poetry not to be
confused with the banned erasure queue
erasure music now is a technique I'm
gonna load just you load a text ample in
right now which is a spam email that I
received at one point and you can see
I'm using Dom manipulation to click on
all these words and actually erase them
but I could come up with another system
like erase every seventh word erase
every verb or erase every word that
starts with E so and you know I can also
by the way based on how I'm doing this
keep the spacing or remove the spacing
and what types of regenerative poetry
could you create out of the eraser
algorithm so but even though I'm showing
you these digital versions of it you
might want to wait until next time after
you've watched the regular expression
videos to actually implement your
interactive web-based version of it as a
constraint on yourself invent your own
algorithm to do by hand get a newspaper
get a magazine get a book invent your
algorithm write the instructions for the
algorithm and if execute those
instructions and get your new text and
then present those instructions and
present the result on a webpage so think
about one of the things I'm asking
people to think about is how do you have
a self documenting web page so instead
of presenting kind of the result and
then having a blog post that explains it
could you have a web page that kind of
has the instructions has the result to
have documents itself and you and
something you might consider using is
github pages to host it so get yourself
set up figure out github pages get
yourself an account review HTML CSS for
yourself
think about creative constrained writing
techniques and generate generate the
content and release it online yeah so
give that a try
share it with me however you might find
it useful to share and I encourage you
if you want to ask questions or discuss
your work with me and a group of peers
you know consider joining the patreon
stock channel as well
you're enjoying what you're kind of
watching so far and I'll be back in the
next set of videos they might be there
by now if you're watching this much
later than when I recorded it but
otherwise we'll be back about a week
from now okay and enjoy and I will see
you sometime soon thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
