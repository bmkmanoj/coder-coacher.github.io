just speaking in single words okay this
is a video where I really the topic that
I want to look it's probably be a couple
videos as variables but I've got to ease
our way into it well let's let's before
we even know about what variable is
let's think about why what what's what's
missing from the program's that you are
writing in the pre the previous video I
showed you how to draw a static thing to
the screen you could could make a
rectangle a circle color it and in order
to do that before you could do that we
had to add two things blocks of code
I'll call them a block of code is
something that begins with a open curly
bracket and ends with a close curly
bracket a setup block and a draw block
each of these blocks by the way is a
function functions are this fundamental
primary element of just about how
everything works in JavaScript so it's
going to be a key topic throughout all
the videos that I make and on a function
is essentially a way of organizing a set
up a block of code a bunch of lines of
instructions all together there's a
bunch of set up instructions and a bunch
of draw instructions I said last last
week or a couple days ago or whenever I
made the last video that setup is a
place where you put create canvas create
canvas and create canvas requires two
arguments a width and height and you get
this nice rectangle on the screen a
canvas for you to draw to and when it's
time to draw to that canvas you add some
instructions in the draw function like
background background zero will give you
a black background and then perhaps you
might add something like ellipse 50 50
75 20 it's a weird looking ellipse which
would then draw it would be it was
looking for but like this
anyway something like this right so this
is what we've got so far there's a setup
block and a draw block both of those
things are functions there's a bit more
to it than just this idea of like oh
great canvas isn't set up and this stuff
is in draw there's a reason why we're
putting some things and set up in some
things and draw and it has to do with
the flow of a program recording again a
flow of a program over time if you've
ever used any piece of software you know
there's an element of time there you've
launched the software you do some stuff
some more things happen you do some more
stuff it doesn't just like start draw a
picture and end so a p5 sketch a browser
session so to speak it happens over time
and these functions are controlling that
flow how do they control that flow setup
happens once at the beginning setup when
the program runs the first thing that
happens is setup and it happens once
which makes sense you don't want to
create a canvas more than once at the
beginning and create the canvas once
draw however does something kind of
interesting it runs it runs through
these instructions after setup finishes
these instructions get executed and when
it gets to the end it goes right back to
the beginning
background ellipse to the end right back
to the meeting background ellipse to the
end right back to the beginning this is
known as a loop and it essentially
happens forever
it happens forever until a user closes
the window you know there's obviously a
lot more to this you could stop it
started you can have lots of other
things happen but this is our basic
beginning flow of the program setup
happens once draw loops over and over
and over again look at how many times
I've talked about set up a draw in my
life probably like 250 but I enjoy it
just as much this time than any other
time by gosh ok let's go over and prove
this point here so here is a p5 sketch
and you can see that it is exactly the
same format that I looked at at the
board there is a setup function at the
top with create canvas and they're a
bunch of drawing things this is a nice
example that Lauren McCarthy prepared
unknowingly for me and if I run it you
can see I love these colors I love the
pink circle and I love the
square now it doesn't look like
anything's happening over time because
it's just like a static picture it's
it's beautiful but it doesn't move and
maybe that's okay maybe in life all we
want to do is make static pictures but
assuming you want to make things move
when if draw it's drawing the same thing
over and over again what do we need to
do we need to vary what happens every
time draw executes draw executes once
twice third time fourth time fifth time
what if something different happened
what if the first time the circle
appears up there then the second time it
appears down here the third time it
appears down here you'll get you'll have
the illusion of it moving down or even
better yet what if you could just say
every time through draw draw the circle
where the mouse is so I could do
something like ellipse where the mouse
is
right that should be fine I'm sure
that's going to work I'm being facetious
I guess but now if I were you can see
that I have an area so this is obviously
hints like expected parentheses this is
obviously not correct syntax p5
JavaScript it's not going to understand
you're just regular old English language
speak thing however this is such a
common problem that p5 has as a part of
its library of variable a variable
called Mouse X so I'm going to put mouse
X in here you can see that it's a nice
purple color right because the p5 editor
recognized that as a built-in keyword a
variable and what this means is Mouse X
is a word that stands for something 100
is a number that stands for the number
100 and can only ever be the number 100
but Mouse X is actually referring to
something stored in the computer's
memory that's changes based on how the
user moves the mouse so if I run this
program again we can see mouse X is 100
maybe it's 200 me 300 so now we can see
that no matter what I do draw is
happening over and over again and it's
always drawing the ellipse where the
mouse is wow this is really I mean if
you haven't done this before hopefully
this is kind of
okay so let's think that there's a
couple more things this is another thing
we could look at here which is kind of
amazing
now what happens then if I take some
other things and put them in setup like
this background function let me put this
in setup remember
setup happens just once draw loops over
and over again
I haven't rerun it yet this is what
happened this is when's background was
in draw right the background is always
being filled and then the ellipse is
drawn background is filled then the
ellipse is drawn what happens if the
background is drawn only once in setup
you know think about that for a second
I'm thinking about it now I'm going to
run this again look at this every single
ellipse from the history of moving cup
every time I moved it is now visible
this is because we only drew that yellow
background once and everything is drawn
sequentially so this illusion of
something moving around the screen only
exists if you erase the background each
time through draw before you draw the
next thing so this is something you can
play with and in fact this is a pretty
quick path if I get rid of this
rectangle and I say like no stroke and I
also add mouse Y here and I run this now
you can see I've made a painting program
which is pretty nice like maybe I give
it a little alpha whoops which is the
fourth argument maybe I make that a
little bit smaller and I run it again
you can see here's a little program that
I can use to kind of paint something
with my mouse so this is actually a
great stopping point for this video I
want to look in the next video at how
you make your own variables oh actually
no I have one more thing I can try to
keep my videos at 10 minutes there's a
minute and a half but but so there's in
this painting program there's one more
thing that I want to show you which I
think is really really key okay
so let's go back to the board over here
and we have setup that is a function
runs once at the beginning we have draw
that's a function that happens over and
over again let's add one more function
and I don't have a lot of room on the
whiteboard so I'm just going to erase
draw for a second to put it here and I'm
going to say what if I haven't done so
so pretend draw is still there and it
has a background and an ellipse I'm
going to add another function and I'm
going to call it Mouse pressed so I have
now complicated the flow of the program
even more in an interesting way setup
happens once and only once at the
beginning draw loops over and over again
it's just draws just like a crazy person
like I'm gonna draw drama drunk I'm
never gonna stop drawing it cats up and
driving driving driving right mouse
pressed is a very patient person quietly
sitting aside just waiting and waiting
in fact Mouse press might never ever
happen program could run and that code
there will never occur so this is what's
known and this is also a key concept in
JavaScript there's gonna be so much more
to this as an event when the user clicks
the mouse the code here is executed so
draws just drawing and drawing a drawing
and drawing your drawing the user click
the mouse we take a break from draw for
a second we run the code in Mouse
pressed and then draw loops loops we I
don't know why I'm saying we the
computer is doing this the browser is
executing all these instructions so now
you have a bit more sophistication here
you have setup you have draw and you can
always interrupt draw with mouse pressed
so let's go back to our program comes
like you have any questions but there's
no way for you to talk to me and I want
you to talk to me somehow some way so
now over here what I'm going to do to
this program is I'm going to add mouse
pressed and what should we put in
mousepressed how about we take this
background function
and we duplicate it in mousepressed
so you can see when the program first
starts we make the canvas we draw the
background then always continuously we
just draw a circle wherever the mouse is
so let the user paint and then what can
the user do now there's a new feature
here the user is moving the mouse moving
the mouse moving the mouse and the user
might say who's me I might say that
drawings not so good I want to erase it
clicking the mouse will then execute
background and it's gone and now I could
then you know try to draw a D and do
something where I sort of draw an A and
I'm like trying to make my name and I
don't know why I'm doing this so this is
pretty interesting and you've got some
tools now you're missing a lot of things
but with color with a bit more what I
would say now as an exercise is use
setup use draw use Mouse pressed you can
draw more than just a circle see what
kind of painting program you can make
that allows the user interactively just
kind of create a drawing on the screen
which is a nice constraint for an
assignment and in the next video what I
will show you is how to create your own
variables beyond just what p5 offers for
you like where the mouse is so you can
have something move autonomously on the
screen I'm gonna make that video right
now collie here with notes like after
this very long day of like fighting with
technology that is nothing that you need
to worry yourself about it's kind of a
last thing I wanna do but I'm gonna do
it
ok I have to hit stop</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
