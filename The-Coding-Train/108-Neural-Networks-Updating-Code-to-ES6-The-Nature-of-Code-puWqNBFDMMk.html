that neural network playlist which left
off in May and I'm continuing it now you
might be watching again you might be
watching it in the future when it's all
been completed but you can as you could
see some time passed and Here I am again
now the last video in this playlist
looked at vector math and I believe I
looked at adding oh I can actually look
it up here the last thing I did was this
function multiply which was simply
multiplying a matrix by a scalar so
taking each element of a matrix and
multiplying it by a single number
now you also might notice here matrix
prototype multiply what is that well
since I last did these videos I have
started adopting yes six classes class
is a template for creating an object
that's part of ECMAScript version six
yadda-yadda-yadda
I have a whole playlist about that stuff
if you don't know about classes you can
go and look at those tutorials but
before I move on and finish the vector
the matrix math that we need to build
this neural network I want to rewrite
all of these when I have so far with es6
so that's all I'm gonna do in this video
okay so let's actually do that first
let's wander over I was first building a
neural network object the idea of a
neural network is having input nodes a
hidden layer and output nodes so let me
first change this to be a class class
neural network and then once I have a
class this constructor function actually
can now become constructor called
constructor and you know what what the
method that I'm kind of adopting is when
I pass arguments in I actually give
those arguments and parameters I guess
in this case in the constructor
definition I give those parameters the
same name as the properties attached to
the object and they are differentiated
by say with me this dot that's right
okay so so there we go so now that
converted the neural network class it
wasn't a class before but the
constructor function into an es6 class
now I've got to do the same thing with
the matrix constructor function so this
was the matrix constructor function and
I now want this to be a class called
matrix and I'm gonna put this around
everything and I don't know what Adam
wants me to do but okay and then this
constructor function is now called
constructor this is what happens to the
constructor and this is just the
randomize function all these functions
that are attached to the prototype can
just be written by their name inside of
the class
this is add and this is multiply that's
what we're gonna be working on the next
video all right so so in a moment I want
to check let me let me check to make
sure this is like still working so if I
go to the browser refresh the page I
should be able to say things like let
and equal a new matrix 3 3 by 3 I should
be able say console dot table M and I
can see oops nope I think this mistake
in my previous console dot table M
matrix and you can see there it is so
this seems to be and I could say m dot
add the number 5 and then I could look
at it so it still seems to be working
I have a matrix that's 3 by 3 it gets it
by default it's filled with zeros if I
add 5 to it it looks like 5 if I say m
dot randomized now I can look at it
again it has random numbers so it's
still working
that's good now here's the other aspect
of this one thing you might notice is
that I'm doing a lot of loops and array
operations like I'm saying hey for every
element of this array at index I didn't
XJ do this thing except there are
actually you probably know this already
I'm a bit slow to catch up with these
things there are a bunch of useful array
functions I often think of them as es6
like this video is about converting it
to es6 but really they've been around
before es6 and these are those these
functions called like map
reduces one fill is one and I filter I
actually don't remember what filter does
I know what these do and I think having
access to using some of these array
functions will make this matrix lot will
be useful in the development of this
matrix library however for simplicity
sake as I go on into the next video I am
still going to do all of the matrix math
operations in the sort of longest long
winded astray it's not actually a word
but in a very long-winded way then at
the end I'll try to come back and and
and use some of these and I and I should
mention that where am I going with this
eventually this I want to learn and
understand all of these matrix
operations and write the code for them
to kind of get my hands in there and
figure it out but in the end I'm gonna
actually take out all of this stuff and
replace all of the matrix operations
with a library from Google called deep
learn so stay tuned there's gonna be a
lot more about this library and a helper
library where deep learn can use with p5
in future videos alright so I think
that's pretty much it for this video I'm
now ready to kind of like get back up to
speed and the things that I need to do
are finish this matrix class with more
useful matrix math operations I need to
be able to multiply two matrices
together and understand what it means to
do that
and then also uh and then finish this to
add the rest of the functionality for
the neural network that uses that stores
all the pieces of the neural network in
these matrices and implements the
algorithms I'll be getting to all that
stuff so see you in the next video wait
this video is not over yet
I forgot that I should also replace var
with less
replace all
