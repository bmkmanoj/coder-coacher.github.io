entirely new section of videos about a
topic I really don't know anything about
I'd have no business making this video
but I'm going to make an attempt and you
the internet will I don't know why I'm
pointing and I like aggressive manner I
welcome you with a hug but you the
Internet
will hopefully leave comments and let me
know what I've got wrong and what I'm
missing here because the honestly this
is stuff which has been sort of new to
me as well so and the topic is it
probably says it's somewhere on this
webpage that I'm sitting in but HTML
HTML what is that CSS what is that
Dom what is that how do you write
JavaScript to control this stuff and
make you know magic happen on a webpage
so there's a and all of this in the
context of a JavaScript framework known
as p5.js so in this first video all I
want to talk about is HTML and I want to
open a p5 sketch if you've been watching
the previous videos have been we've been
writing code in this function setup and
draw and making things happen on the
screen and making objects and snow and
particle system and rainbows and all
sorts of wonderful things but now I want
to take a step heel back some layers to
say what's actually happening before the
JavaScript even executes and what's
happening is this thing known as HTML so
actually there wasn't oh I didn't even
see that but that's okay there was a
moment in time in a previous video Here
I am this is my list by the way to make
a whole bunch of these videos there was
a moment in time I got to close the
screen which has me on it there was a
moment in time in a previous video where
I went to that Settings icon and I
clicked on the Settings icon and then I
clicked on this show sidebar button and
we saw here look at that there's this
file called index.html and if you recall
oh I'm a camera shut off stuff everybody
wait back after a moment of technical
difficulties what I was referring to
here is in this HTML file this
gobbledygook there is this line that
refers to the JavaScript file the
JavaScript file being in our in our
world in the world that we lived in
previous to this video this is all that
existed set up and draw but the only
real
and setup runs and draw runs there's two
reasons one reason is up here that p5.js
is a library that's referred to in a
script tag and sketch guess which is our
code is referred to in a script tag so
this is actually the file that matters
this HTML file is the file that matters
what goes in that file how does that
file work and what might you be able to
do with that file to make certain things
happen so now let me come back over here
videos a disaster and talk about HTML
for a second so HTML stands for
hypertext markup language it's a markup
language meaning I don't know what that
means
somebody somebody write the comments
what that means but the idea here is
that it is based on this concept of a
tag so um so if you have some characters
in between a less-than and a greater
than symbol this is a tag the HTML tag
begins and it ends with a backslash HTML
so I have now created this a body this -
I should use the word body because
that's going to be something more
specific in a moment but I have created
this area where I'm going to start to
put some content all in between these
tags now some things that might exist
here is I'm going to say another tag
maybe a tag known as body and inside
that body I might put some other things
I might put a tag with a P for paragraph
this is a paragraph and I might put
another tag like above that h1 which is
a header like title of page then I might
put another tag which is like image
source equals apple JPEG so there are
all these things that can go in an HTML
page this is the markup the source code
the behind-the-scenes information and
structure behind what you will actually
see on the page this
renders I come zapad pen this renders to
on the page title of page this is a
paragraph and then a picture of an apple
assuming I have that file so the idea
here is that you can create both content
and layout by by this sort of system of
nested tags I have an HTML page in that
page there's a body in that pottery
there's oh and I wrote something wrong
here that close tag should be a header
there's a header a paragraph in an image
so one of the things that can go in here
also is a canvas and p5 inserts the
canvas on that page which the function
create canvas so there's this kind of
question here it's like well what what
what is it why if I hear what's going
out of my life and what am I trying to
do if you just want to present some
content some content that you want to
type you have an essay you wrote or a
story you wrote and it has a title and
has some pictures in it and it's sort of
like static or you might say flat just
from existing content you can put that
all into an HTML document open that HTML
content in a browser and you will see it
there if you want this page to be
interactive or dynamic have behaviors
change over time change when a user
clicks animate whatever it's strange
experimental thing you can think of
that's where you need JavaScript so this
the purpose of my set of videos here is
to look at we you know hopefully you
know a little bit about JavaScript down
you can program and make these little
animations
what's the page behind that that sort of
hold what's what is the page where that
javascript is acting on how do you put
stuff in the page how do you put stuff
in the javascript build javascript and
how do those two things talk to each
other okay so here's some sort of basic
idea of HTML now let's walk over slowly
here over to this computer and I'm going
to do something crazy which is I'm just
going to say like never mind you p5
editor and whatever HTML you made for me
automatically I'm going to take all of
this out I'm going to close this
preferences and I'm going to say I'm
going to say I want to have a body
and I want to have a header I am making
a video and I want to have a paragraph
this is my essay about how I love to
make videos they are my favorite I'm
just like lost the train of thought
battery I'm Steve we've got just
favorite thing to do rainbow rainbow
rainbow which is my thing that I always
just use rainbow okay so you can see I'm
starting to just put content in this
HTML page and I'm going to run it and
look at this I now look it's like I
wrote a program that made this but I
didn't I just manually added some
content to the HTML page what the what
p5 actually loads in this window in this
like little browser window is the HTML
file and so you could say like well
what's in the JavaScript file
nothing but I could add create canvas
200 200 and I could add a background
zero fill to 5500 I'm also now lost in
my train of thought of programming
rectangles zeroes you know 100 150 50
I've got some JavaScript I've got some
HTML and now lips now let me run this
again or load this page again and we can
see here huh where is the canvas it
doesn't exist
so nothing actually happens on the page
unless it's included in the HTML file
and when I wiped the HTML file that the
editor made for me automatically I took
out all the references to that
javascript file so if I want to have
both the HTML content and the JavaScript
stuff happening at the same time I need
to put I need to have both of those
things so nobody Madusa in a little way
I'm just going to make a new project I'm
going to look at its HTML file and I'm
going to grab this header area so I'm
going to grab this close that so what's
missing from this document HTML body is
a head tag and a head tag is where I
might reference other files like
JavaScript files and other things that
you might see later on if I ever get to
making some videos that make any sense
so I'm going to paste that back in here
you can see in this you can see now this
page both and I'm going to I'm going to
take out this stuff here some extra
stuff now this page and I don't actually
I'm not using these libraries well I'll
leave it there this now you can see this
page is referring to the p5 libraries
some other libraries that I'll mention
in a second our JavaScript code and the
HTML stuff that I added and now if I run
this or load this page again you can see
look at this
we now have other content around the
canvas so this is the first step right
how do you make content written to the
HTML file how do you use p5.js in
JavaScript to make a canvas how do both
those things exist in the same p5.js
project and the next step is what's the
interplay between those two things what
if I want this header text to change
when I click the mouse what if I want
the font to change at when the rectangle
moving across the canvas gets to the
other side of the screen these are the
kinds of questions I hope to answer and
make more clear in the next set of
videos there's a couple things that I
missed here so that I think are
important before I finish so one thing I
want to mention about this you know what
I could come back to this later you know
because I I what I wanted to mention is
how this is a tree structure I'll come
back to it later but now that I said I
have to talk about it so this is a tree
structure and this is something that's
important to think about the root node
of this tree is HTML inside of HTML
there's a body right open tag close tag
inside of the body there's a header a
paragraph and an image header a
paragraph and an image because our
paragraphs could have things inside the
paragraph as we saw in in the HTML file
there was actually a head tag which
included some scripts JavaScript scripts
and other things so this is an important
also way of thinking and I think I think
nobody's been watching know if you're
still watching this video let me know
because I don't know been going on for a
long time but um this I think is a clue
to this idea of something known as the
Dom document object model this I don't
actually know what the DOM is but I
think I have an idea just by talking
this through this is a document these
are objects inside the document the
model is this tree structure of how a
page is structured there's an HTML
element an object inside of it there's a
body object inside of it there's a head
h1 object a paragraph object and image
object this whole document has a model
of structure for how it's organized of
objects document object model and how do
you manipulate that document Dom
manipulation means how to use JavaScript
to manipulate this on the fly in real
time this is the subject I hope to
continue to cover and make more and more
examples of now one thing I should admit
here is this is like the most pathetic
or like tiniest like a explanation of
HTML ever like it looked at like a few
things so I'm really hoping to get to
more about JavaScript and programming
and manipulation in real time if you're
interested in HTML
right on anyway anyway who knows we'll
talk about HTML right in the comments
sometimes some links I might include but
I'll try to refer you to them other
sources like what are all the possible
tags how are these tags organized how
are they different you know what does it
mean to have this source equals Apple
dot jpg this is an attribute we'll get
to some of these things as I get further
along through these videos as well so
for you if you're kind of following
along in the sort of like watch a video
do a quick exercise what I would say is
see if you can make this happen make now
take one of your p5 sketches and add
some other stuff around it around the
page we're going to be able to do a lot
more mixing it soon but oh this has only
been about 10 minutes this video I feel
like I've been talking for like 45
minutes and that I think will be a good
start and the next video I am going to
look at my list here the next video I'm
going to look at making
Dom elements making HTML elements on the
fly from JavaScript adding them to the
page just like create canvas add or 1 to
the page okay I'm going to hit stop on
recording and go on to the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
