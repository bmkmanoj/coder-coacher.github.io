I'm trying to use wave dreaming I don't
even have a mic in or anything let's see
here live dashboard
is anyone watching this cheerful people
come on somebody tell me if this is
working
okay test test
slam the door sorry that was very loud
I'm testing a new streaming way of
streaming oh I'm hearing myself
somewhere anywhere no maybe I'm just
echoing to myself hello hello hello
hello echo echo okay great
I see great thank you all right so you
hear me look so actually I'm using a new
version of Wirecast which I have here
and that's why I have this like infinite
zoom thing but I'm trying to see how far
behind how far behind the stream is so
I'm going to make a funny expression in
face and then count see how long till I
see it in the actual Zealand glass so
here we go one one thousand two one
thousand three one thousand four one
thousand five one thousand six one
thousand seven one thousand eight 1,009
1,010 1,011 1,012 1030 1041 so about
fourteen or fifteen seconds it's the lag
between when I do something and you see
it okay
I have only thirty five minutes I swear
I'm hearing myself back audio somewhere
hello but I don't know where that's
coming from I got like three different
machines and you're all doing different
things so one of the things I need to do
here is I need to actually also set up
my recording output okay that's fine if
the quality may be affected for a second
record to disk okay and then
now ProRes 7 2016 by 9 I don't know
let's just see what that does more
options no sorry I'm like live so
configuring my wire test here so
apologies for that
should I should have done this in
advance I shoot cord to disk more let me
try and cord to disc mp4 let's try that
okay
H yeah this is what I want perfect
I want to compress it here we go
so I don't want this one I want this one
I wanted to go to the desktop and I want
it to be called ICM 2015 save and ok so
oops no no no don't close this close
this ok hi everybody
Google I could I'm smaller than I
usually am I made myself a little
smaller and the green screening isn't
perfect I should fix that and I swear
I'm hearing myself feedback coming out
of somewhere which computer is that
maybe it's this one
hold on I think I know which one it is
it's though it's the Wirecast it's it's
the ok I need to log back into Wirecast
and I need to go to this computer and
turn the volume off and that should do
the trick
I no longer hear myself echoing
excellent there are two people who
watching which is good because I'm not
doing anything
and I've got all sorts of analytics I've
got a permanent URL stream options I
could play an ad look see what happened
did I play an ad you guys could tolerate
this for a second all too
you are watching the base of some
complex criteria some of your viewers
will see an ad keep streaming anybody
seeing an ad is the volume okay all
right okay
I so actually I'm gonna come back to
what I was doing so I was making some
videos before and I was trying to get
something to work and my problem is I
didn't update p5.js
I thought I did but I didn't okay hold
on fixing something today copy it over
here
no that's the wrong one hold on
everybody and the volume is cool
Valvoline well thank you for watching
the Valvoline a dyke maybe I made about
a quarter of a cent or something okay
it's what's good about this though is it
I know not very many people are gonna
tune into this but I often take these
like short little breaks just click the
play Add button sorry I'm trying to what
I'm trying to do right now is fix an
issue I had with the previous videos I
was making I don't know where why I've
got sublime text open I need to go and
get the newest p5.js and I actually just
want this single file and I want to
close the editor and I want to find the
example I'm making which was under Dom
under slider other events and I want
this p5.js file in there and I want this
one to go away and then I want to launch
the editor again you know quick chrome
close all these things and launch the
editor again and there we go
I have a feeling this is gonna work now
no error well what did I do
oh oh I did her crash editor crash
technology okay I thought Lauren
McCarthy are you there
maybe she's in the hallway
oh no she's teaching class so there's a
trying to make a certain feature work at
p5.js that was recently added but there
was also a bug in a recent version of
p5.js which caused the editor to break I
don't even know if I have the most
recent version of the editor this is
great to do this live well I could
definitely use another editor I'm just
trying to use let me let me see here if
I have the most recent version of the
editor oh you know I know what it is
that I can fix manually aha
so editor crashing with this version the
line of code where it's crashing was
comment this line out this dot events
device motion equals null so let me get
the editor again open and let me go into
here find
let's just comment that out oops no no I
need to open the actual thing that I
want to open other events and go to
libraries p5.js and I'll move this over
here if anyone wants to watch him doing
it define this there we go and that
should do the trick
doesn't crash and this snow wasn't there
we go
success no deosn't yeah nobody cares
right I recorded a video earlier today
which was like 20 minutes long ten
minutes of it was trying to debug this
problem uh and oh three people somebody
else joined I can see exactly the number
but I love this new YouTube live
streaming thing who are you third person
who's not sharing Delacruz or Jay David
Ison Berg oh you left there's only two
people watching or one of you left when
when you have such a small audience like
me I can't pinpoint exactly who's there
who's not there alright it is 2:30 p.m.
I am going to see I'm gonna see if I can
make another video and a hide sidebar
actually show sidebar I'm gonna close
the browser here so this is where I am
these are this is my list of videos I'm
gonna see if I can do with CSS video so
this video number six here is the one
that was a total sort of failure and I
should go back and rerecord it or do it
in a different way or leave it as it is
and record an actual section that fixes
it but in the but in the in the brief
amount of time that I have I think I'm
gonna do the CSS and style video so a
couple things I need to do one is I just
need to test that my recording system is
actually working so I'm going to do that
for a second and I'm gonna hit record
and then I'm going to dance around and
sing
what's the song that I've there's
usually a song that I say
nevermind no singing go singing aloud
I'm gonna go over here Freyja rather
Jacques Frere Jacques over here there we
go you can see that the cameras slightly
the wrong position there we go that
maybe helps us to focus okay can you
read this I'm gonna come back over here
and test this and I'm gonna hit stop
recording and then I should see on the
desktop a file that I just recently
recorded and it says today 234 p.m. I
see em 0:41 megabytes I'm going to open
up this video file and play it I have to
turn the volume on to see if they're
sound check I want to check
looks like losing my mind I shouldn't
live stream when I'm just like doing
testing but I have to test that this new
way works show movie inspector 30 frames
per second 1280 by 720 data size data
rate all right
I'm happy with this close this turn the
volume back off
close close so who would like who is
there interested in the topic of more
comments below
only one everybody left one person who
are you one person who we have the left
their left their browser open by
accident okay let's see here okay let's
see maybe I should work on the green
screening you guys want to this is gonna
wonder if I can do this alive while I'm
streaming so if I hit edit shot and I go
to the green screen and I go to the
chroma key and I check the teeth are you
seeing now though I should go back to
the live dashboard you should see me
right now in front of a green wall oh
you could see the like shadow here which
is really because of the lighting
let's see if I can fix it a little bit
better worse oh you know what it is
it's this table here I don't really care
so much but I really should probably
make that better
I have a light that I think just needs
to point up more so if I put something
under it like a book now I'll do
anything to not have to record a video
about CSS apparently this is an empty
box let's do that
oh that created a strange new shadow
probably just need to put it over here
and now I'm gonna trip on myself I also
look at this like weird extra shadows
I'll work on this later good enough for
now that's a little bit a little bit
better a little bit better a little bit
worse who knows
let's go back to use chroma key and I
see and now I could I do this okay no
defaults I pick color key with the mouse
oh I think that'll just be good enough
yeah seeing from the text not pure green
okay let's see so I have time 239 I have
20 minutes
should I make this happen
yeah okay I'm gonna do something about
CSS CSS style so I'm I just want to make
an example a little bit from scratch
I'll leave the button get rid of the
slider in the input field I'll leave the
background color variable I will get rid
of this canvas event stuff
and
I definitely need to create PE I need
and I'm going to get rid of all these
events and
and let me make this
like this
and oh yeah it doesn't look so great the
green screening and we run this and see
change color is not to find the problem
see you can't fart can I get away with
this okay change colors not defined
that's alright I don't need an event
right now oh right
and there we go okay I have this webpage
I have the editor I have the HTML file
I want to do here is
this
indented correctly
okay now getting ready here to make this
video ah green screen got a little
better I think it has to do with how
much sunlight is coming in here I it
works working so much better this
morning because I had the Sun and this
shadow here which is really where's the
shadow what's over here but this is a
this is a table oh you know what I can
do is I can just make myself I know what
to do you don't need to see so much of
me myself down a little bit there you go
that's gonna help did that not change
anything riveting I'm sure you guys are
just can't stop watching this if I do
that it's not updating maybe it can't
update live
oh it is working it's like behind no it
stops me create button is something
built into p5.js I'm a tiny person I
shouldn't be I hope I can delete this
I'm gonna probably have to delete this
one we just get it exactly where I want
it and didn't hope it works I use my
hands up to there over there
okay this'll just have to do yeah the
shadow keeps coming and going it's
getting better and worse depending on
the light that's coming in from outside
2:43 okay I'm gonna try to make
something happen
let me look at my list
and okay wait wait I need this CSS
reference page open
we were like background-color
I don't know that I love this background
color blue color color units I'm like
this is not my okay hold on
Zilla CSS reference let's try this this
is good background color I click here
yeah there we go this is better okay
great
I'm gonna use this particular reference
okay so I have 15 minutes I'm going to
mute myself
I'm gonna record a video in two minutes
I'm gonna mute myself and be ready
you
okay I'm back I don't know if anyone's
still there
four people are there perhaps if you're
there say something say hello and tell
me if the audio and the picture is fine
can you see this I'm gonna erase all
this and I'm about to take ten minutes
to make a short video lesson about CSS
and the style function in p5 Jess okay
and it is 247 p.m.
oops it's 247 p.m. Eastern Time
I have office hours appointments at 3:00
p.m. so I meant to do this from 2:00 to
3:00 but I I set up an entirely new
streaming system
I'm very small here and it took me 45
minutes to do that so I sort of lost all
my time but I'm gonna try to at least
get one more video out I did a whole
bunch this morning and Mark Abbey is in
the chat mark Abbey is in the chat he
has done a ton of work on the Dom
library over the summer and he as part
of Google Summer of Code a lot of the
new features are thanks to him and if
you have actual questions about how it
works or what it does you can ask it to
chat he knows more about it than I do
am i shrinking I feel so tiny
okay I just gonna leave it ok here we go
oh look at this I swear every time I
look over I'm getting smaller I'm gonna
just set check these settings one time
one more time on this shot there we go
I see I have to click in and out okay I
should be I've got a lot of shadow and a
lot of issues going on but it's such as
life I need to the lighting somehow in
here just totally changed but here we go
I only have ten minutes now if I keep
talking I'm gonna lose all my time all
right so this video is about a giant
topic one I know very little about and
that topic is CSS and so you know
there's been a bunch of videos here that
I made about the Dom the document object
model web pages HTML pages JavaScript
how they control HTML pages let's just
take a step back for a moment and and
look at the pieces we know about and
what's this third piece that I'm adding
so this web page this thing that you're
seeing in the browser or in this or
browser window of the p5.js editor where
I'm writing all of the code there the
thing that this page loads is a file
called index.html okay so and this is
not a good pen I'm switching pens in
this file there is some content written
into that file for example there is a
header that's at the top of the page
there's a paragraph this file is also
referring to some JavaScript code it's
referring to a bunch of different things
like the p5.js library file our own code
which is in a file called sketch chess
and in those files we're doing some
JavaScript stuff like making a canvas
drawing a circle to that canvas and
perhaps even as we've seen in previous
videos making other dumb elements like
more paragraphs and affecting those and
changing those elements so you can think
of these pieces as HTML this is really
the structure and you could also say
like initial content in a way like
what's on the page when it first loads
of that webpage javascript is logic code
things that can handle events store
information make
all sorts of magic happen this is what
you can think of as the behavior of the
page so this is where you or an eye and
everybody else who's doing this stuff is
writing code to control what's happening
on that page over time based on user
interaction based on some mathematical
algorithm based on whatever you might
fancy you'd like to draw rainbows into
canvas
unicorns do that with JavaScript via a
tag unicorns to my repertoire here oh is
that rainbows okay so a bit in the last
piece here that I want to talk about is
this idea of CSS and CSS stands for
cascading style sheets I don't know why
they're cascading probably has to do
with some sort of like nesting and
whatever somebody on the internet who
really knows this stuff will hopefully
write in the comments why it's cascading
but the key word there is style so if
you want to affect various aspects of
the layout of this page you want the
canvas to actually float on the right
side of the page rather than the left
side of the page you want to change the
font that's in the paragraphs you want
to change the background color of a
paragraph you want to and just about
anything that you can imagine that has
to do with the visual look and feel of
that page can be controlled with this
idea of CSS now once again we're in the
same place as we were with HTML you
could write HTML into that index dot
HTML file or you could dynamically sort
of insert HTML elements into the page
using javascript you can write you can
sort in give some initial content you
can also control those elements using
javascript the same thing is true with
CSS there is a kind of file to care
enough there is a kind another kind of
file you could write I've disappeared
from the world but I am still here you
cannot see me but I am still here I will
never leave it still everyone last
person on earth actually most people on
earth don't really need to know about
CSS or maybe they should I don't really
know I that was a terrible idea but
you're here watching this video maybe
CSS is useful to you
keep going the HTML file the JavaScript
file now you can also add information
about styles to another kind of file
named maybe style name whatever you want
dot CSS dot js4 JavaScript dot HTML for
HTML dot CSS now we're in what I meant
by saying we're in the same situation is
I want to talk about how do you add that
style stuff to style that CSS and then
or and or how much you add style
dynamically on the fly based on user
interaction based on some sub behaviors
in JavaScript this is the bigger picture
here and then there's lots of details to
fill in it boy am i rambling about this
but hopefully it's making some sense
okay so how does CSS work CSS works on
assessing a couple different principles
one is this idea of a selector so you
need to have a selector meaning what are
the things that you want to select to
style do you want to select all the
paragraphs on the page do you want to
select just this one particular
paragraph do you want to select the
canvas do what what Dom elements do you
want to select in order to style after
you say after you specify that selector
so for example let's say you want to
style all the paragraph elements on the
page your selector would be P then you
need some open and close curly brackets
much like you always do when you're
doing these kinds of things to denote
the beginning and end of the stuff that
will the style information that will be
applied to that paragraph once you have
that all you need are a series of name
value pairs looks kind of like a
JavaScript object but the syntax is a
little bit different these name value
pairs are like what's the property you
want to style and what's the value for
that style for example I want to style
the background color and I want the
background color to be black or white
that's what I want it to be like pinkish
f0f so you could be asking your question
like oh my god what well what is that
that looks terrifying to me there's like
a pound symbol and then
letter and then a number so there's a
lot of things to learn this is a certain
kind of special way of writing a color
information you know I think maybe this
would have been a little bit simpler if
I just wrote the word pink here or
purple here that would also work there a
variety of different ways so now the
question is what are the kinds of things
that can go here you know font size is
one of them I think so if I want to like
change the font size there's so much
that could go here how do you know what
the possibilities are
how do you add that to your CSS and then
how do you do that with JavaScript how
much time do we have
I'm gonna I'm gonna let's go to the code
and look at how that some of this works
okay now I've disappeared but I'm gonna
come back to life sunshine rain down
upon me and give me some light and I
shall appear now in front of the camera
okay I have to turn this down okay so
here I am with a p5 GS project in the
p5.js editor I'm going to run this and
you can see there again or back here I
have this h1 element this paragraph
element this canvas another paragraph
element a button some of these elements
are written here into the HTML body
right in advance these are HTML elements
that appear on the page as soon as it
loads some of these elements are created
with JavaScript made dynamically when
the program runs create a paragraph
create a button okay this is where we
are how do I start to style it style
that paragraph okay so actually um what
I'm gonna do even though I said over
here back even though I said it over
here you can create I'm just gonna
create a separate CSS file I'll do that
in a later video what actually is button
to the hey little hyperactive what
actually I think I would like to do is
show you how you can actually add CSS
style information directly into the HTML
page so inside of this head tag where
I'm refering to JavaScript files I could
also potentially refer to some style
information so what's that syntax
paragraph I want to select all the
Raph's on the page and assign them a
background color which is purple I wish
I could take rainbow there do you think
it works if I type rainbow there I doubt
it
okay so now if I save and I run this
again we can see look this paragraph
element has a purple background this
paragraph elements has a purple
background you know it's very hard for
me to see the text so I think if I say
this color it refers to the color of the
text inside the paragraph I think and
now you can see I have white text with a
purple background it looks a little
crowded in there so something that I
might add to this is some padding and
how much padding how about 8 pixels px
4 pixel so I'm gonna do this look haha
look at this I've got some nice padding
now so this is the basic idea of CSS I
need to select something on the page and
then give it some properties what's the
property what's the value what's the
property what's the value how do you
know what all these possible properties
are well you need to look this stuff up
you can get books you watch other videos
that where someone really knows about
CSS it's talking about this but but and
this is worried so let's look for this
briefly in a moment and I have a couple
more minutes left I am going to so I am
on here developer dot Mozilla of you so
this is one place I'll put some links in
the description for this video but here
is a URL of where I could find some
information about CSS I'm gonna remove
this part here this is a CSS reference
there's a tutorial there's demos I want
to look at the ref and exhaustive I'm
exhausted already
an exhaustive reference I'm going to
look at the exhaustive reference and I'm
gonna see like look these are all of the
possible things I could add there's so
much I can just keep scrolling and
scrolling and scrolling and scrolling
but we can look under I can look for
like background color and you can see
background color is right over here I
can click on it and what do I see now I
see here are some examples of of
different ways that I can call
background color I could say red I could
RGB I could say Karanga all sorts of
ways so this is a topic for another time
another video for you to look on your
own there's another CSS reference that I
like to use if I could find it in my
history here I think it's this one right
so I'll include a link to this this is a
nice reference of all sorts of possible
parameters in CSS the things that I want
to focus on in in my videos is less
about the full encompassing of all of
the CSS reference and more about two
things one is this how do these
selectors work what are other ways that
I could specifically address a single
paragraph or only some paragraph and
there's a lot of ways you can use these
selectors so I want to get to that and
the other thing I want to get to is how
do you do
style dynamically in JavaScript so with
p5.js specifically so let's take at
least another video I'm one of my future
videos I'm going to talk more about
selectors but in this particular video I
want to look at the style function so
here if I come back if I quit Chrome for
a second and I come back to this we can
see that these particular elements now
these paragraph elements are all styled
based on the hard-coded style
information that's in the HTML file
inside of the style tags but another
thing I can do is right over here
I can for any HTM any element that I
create with p5 and later them to show
you any element that I access mp5
whether it was created or not I can call
a function called style which then
requires just two arguments what are
those arguments the name of the style
property the value of the style property
so if I were to put right here in quotes
background - color and then I were to
say in here in quotes pink you can see
look at this this particular element is
still getting the style from the HTML
page this particular element woop I'm
not there
this particular element down here is
getting a style from my code so when I
apply a piece of styling dynamically in
code it's going to overwrite the style
that was originally set up in the HTML
page so there's a lot of pieces here and
for you essentially if you're following
these videos along what I would suggest
you do is try adding some style to the
HTML file in the same way that I did
here try adding some Styles this way
what other tags might you reference try
adding some Styles this way what happens
if you add styles to other kinds of
elements that aren't just paragraph
elements and lastly and I'll do this for
you really quickly set something style
with an event okay let's think about
this for example what if I say what if I
were to say button dot mousepressed
change style right so now I am attaching
the change style event to the press of
this button and what is that change
style event it's a function that I need
to write write the code inside this
function right here will execute when I
click the mouse on that button and maybe
I'll change the text style to pink and
maybe I'll give it a lot more padding
because who doesn't love padding I feel
like that's gonna be the death
JavaScript that musical that's my first
song who doesn't love padding you with
me on that okay so now if we look at
this everything's got its default style
I'm gonna trigger that event I got some
more padding and a pink background so
and you know maybe what I want to do I
just got to do a little bit more say
text mouse over change style whoops and
then I'll say button I'll say text Mouse
out revert style and what I can do here
and I'm gonna I'm just showing you some
other things revert
style and background purple padding 8
pixels so let's take out the button
event for a second I'm using Mouse out
and mouse over and mouse over Mouse out
I mouse over I mouse out I mouse over
that's a very rhythmic so you can see
here that you can start to highlight
things make things happen based on
button presses based on mouse over a
bounce out based on the movement of a
slider as we saw in the previous video
so many possibilities so now you have
something to work with try adding some
style to the HTML page try adding some
style using the style function see what
types of elements what types of designs
you can make and I'm gonna come back and
look at this again and again and again
in several videos looking at other
different types of scenarios with more
events and more ways of selecting
elements which classes and ID's is the
topic for that and just as a reminder go
and look in those references that will
be linked below as to where you can find
all this stuff so I'm 5 minutes over
time not that that is relevant to you
especially if you're watching this
sometime in the future like in the year
2000 that was awhile ago I guess but in
my my childhood the year 2000 seems like
far away the year 3000 is ain't watching
this if you're watching this is a year
3000 please go get my brain out of that
cryogenic thing that it's in I don't
know do something with it talk to me

you in a future video I have to stop man
ok live stream I don't know if that came
across and worked anybody there's some
discussion here so thanks for I've got
to go unfortunately I'm gonna try to do
some more live streams as soon as I have
some more time I've got a whole long
list of Dom manipulation videos to make
and also I I have a whole bunch from
this morning that I need to upload and
