that's kind of exciting that I really
should have known about when I made this
video but it's new to me and it's now
gonna be new to you or maybe you know
about it already but I'm gonna show you
this new loop in java script called for
of I think that's what I'm gonna call it
for of so very very often the previous
example that I just made right this
happens all the time
all the time in programming hey I've got
an array of things let me count through
the whole array to act on everything in
the array and this can happen with
arrays of objects like I want to move
and show all these objects it could
happen with arrays of numbers like ah
let me double all the numbers in this
array or let me add up all the numbers
in this array and there's actually other
ways of doing that too that I'm gonna
get to in other videos but what I want
to show you here is the for of loop so
really what this is saying here is for
every bubble in the bubbles array the
problem is I think in already meant
something else in JavaScript or each
always meet some there is a for each
thing so so I'm speculating here but
imagine that the when this feature came
into JavaScript we the developers needed
a word to pick and that word is of so
what I'm actually going to say is like
this bubbles index I stands in for every
element of the array bubbles so I can
actually do the exact same loop by
saying for let every bubble of bubbles
and then bubble dot move whoops not
bubbles and bubble show now one thing so
this is what I want to emphasize here
these are exactly and I'm gonna step to
the side here these are exactly the same
no it must look perfect on the screen
here right this is me counting with an
index to address every element to the
array and moving and showing them this
is me just saying hey JavaScript I don't
feel like counting today could you take
care of this for me just give me every
single bubble in order in the array
bubbles and move and show them now I'm
gonna do things in later videos where I
start deleting things out of the array
or maybe I only want to use half the
array then those are cases where I
really need that counter there are often
cases where the counter plays a role but
if the counter doesn't play a role and
they just want to do something to every
element this is what I could do now what
I don't love about this and this is I do
this all the time and lots of
programmers do this is I have a class
called bubble that's capital B down here
I have an array called bubbles lowercase
B with an S on the end plural because as
many and then I have bubble which is
like an individual bubble in the that's
every bubble of the array so I just want
to emphasize that this could just be
called you know if the bubbles names
were unicorn this is just a made-up
variable name it is the word that stands
in for every element of the array and so
like I could say let element of bubbles
for example you know and so but this is
kind of a convention that I could adopt
the class the type of thing is capital B
bubble when I have an array of them I'm
gonna call it bubbles with an S when I
have an individual one I'm gonna call it
bubble but there's no reason why you
have to call things that way I could
call this bubble class single bubble
bubble array that kind of thing so
that's really it
I'm gonna use this I'm gonna use this
kind of loop in other videos and then I
guess I can reference back to this one
when I do
hopefully this made sense I'm looking
around to see if anybody has any
questions but you are in the future I
don't even know who you are watching
this video but you are there someday
watching this video I'm probably not
standing here anymore I'm somewhere else
