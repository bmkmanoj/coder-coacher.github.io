video now in this video I'm going to
look at a comment that came in on
YouTube from quack-quack
which says I think you could obtain a
better result which a much lower
threshold and a different way to
calculate the distance between a pixel
and a blob you need to calculate the
shortest distance between any pixel of
the blob and the given pixel this way if
the red area is big you won't get a lot
of small blobs next to one another even
if you don't exclude small bumps so what
does this comment mean so let me run the
example which I believe is actually
already running over here and what I'm
going to do is I'm going to hold up this
so you can see here I'm doing blob
detection on this red cup now I could
add a second red cup now I have to look
at this as I bring them closer now
strangely enough I kind of like how this
works because these are two different
objects I want them to be two separate
blobs but they really shouldn't be
separate blobs once they're together
should really recognize them as one blob
but look out picks it up as a second one
as soon as I move it a little bit apart
this is why is this happening this is
happening because I mean there is a
distance threshold so when I find a
pixel this is a new pixel that is red I
have found a new red pixel is it part of
that blob or not so the first thing I do
is I test its distance from where the
center of the blob so I get that value
of sub distance and I check that
distance is it greater than or less than
some threshold so let's say the
threshold is 80 and my blob is now this
big blob that's like 160 by 8 you know
90 pixels so even if I find a pixel over
here it's distance from the center is
going to be greater than 80 by
definition it's going to be 81 so it'll
actually my algorithm will actually make
a new little blob right here which in a
lot of cases isn't what you want you
just want this blob to be a little bit
bigger now I'm sure and I'm sure I will
get a youtube comment explaining what
the optimal way of doing this is but I'm
just kind of showing you the basic idea
in the end you know you might I'm going
to show you in a future video using like
OpenCV or a blob detection library a lot
of libraries will have sort of optimized
code and maybe I'll get to that at some
point but a way of doing this would
actually just be to find
you know this blob has kind of
accumulated a whole lot of pixels let's
find the shortest distance between this
new pixel and any single other member of
the blob and see if it's within a given
threshold so let's come back over here
and let's add that loop there here I am
I'm giant don't eat me
I'm let's add that to the code and this
is by the way exactly what quack-quack
suggests you need to calculate the
shortest distance between any pixel on
the blob and the given pixel so if I go
back to where my my code I have this
blob object and this blob object keeps
track of really only a few pieces of
data of the blob it keeps track of the
XY over here and the XY over here it
doesn't keep track of the interior
pixels you know one thing I might do I
kind of have an idea of making this a
little bit more optimal to just like see
if it's if it's within the Y how far
away it is from the X but anyway I'm
going to do it by looking at all the
pixels of the block I saw there's a
couple different ways I could approach
this but you can see the blob doesn't
keep track of the pixels but there's no
reason why I couldn't make an ArrayList
of P vector objects a P vector being uh
I could use as a position vector or an
XY coordinate as a single object and I'm
going to call this like points and when
I make a blob I make a new ArrayList of
P vector objects and then and then
whenever I add a point I want to also
make a P vector and add it so what I'm
doing now is not just creating the
rectangle but storing every single point
that's part of that blog now the
question is how do I determine where it
in the code do I determine whether it's
part of that blob well I do that here
and so what I want to do now is I need
so you know let's just make sure this is
working by the way and
we could see that this is working but
what might be interesting here by the
way is to just when I display the blob
right now just to have a sense of things
I'm going to go look at all the vectors
and I'm gonna say stroke let's make
something let's make a blue are GEB by
the way here are gee we should have an
RGB song RG p RG p PG r gb g RGB a
sometimes okay somebody will compose
that stock and then i'm going to make a
point so this should also in addition to
simply drawing the rectangle the sort of
bounding box that blob these are all the
actual pixels associated with the blob
as well as blue so now what i want to do
is here when i'm up I want to write a
function that's going to return true or
false and I'm going to call that
function close enough our maple call it
is close so what I want to do here is
start and I need to I'm going to return
true just by default for a second so
what I want to do here is say let me
find the shortest distance between any
point in the blob and this new point so
the thing that I want to check is some
given X Y and what I want to do is say
the record distance the record distance
starts out as something like super big
100,000 right and then what I want to do
is look at every single vector in all of
the points and I want to I want to give
I want to get that distance so I want to
say distance squared between point X
point dot y and a given X dot given X Y
and sorry V X V dot y then I want to say
if that distance is less than the record
distance then the record distance is now
that distance
and let's let's actually just do this
let's have this return a float get
shortest D so I'm actually going to make
the function return that shortest
distance and I'll do the threshold
checking out in the other I'll do the
threshold checking out in the main loop
and then at the end here all I need to
do is return the record distance so in
other words what I want to do here now
is instead of just looking oh that's by
the way
oh I haven't is near function haha I
already have is near function I'm
confused because I have to is very
confused because there's two different
thresholds there's the color threshold
like is this pixel within the color
threshold once it is what's its distance
so I actually all I need to do is do
this this is very silly of me
this algorithm this whole algorithm that
I worked on I don't need another
function I just need to find this is
near function right is this distance
less I don't want the distance from the
center anymore comment that out what I
want is I want to bail by the way when I
ding whenever I like have this like
epiphany moment where as I did something
wrong then get a bell um a physical Bell
uh and then so now I want to check this
record distance if the record distance
is within that distance threshold so I'm
going to look at all the points and find
that shortest distance now normally I
would be a hundred percent sure that
this large number for record distance is
totally reasonable but because I'm doing
distance squared you know The Blob could
be quite far away pixels wise and pic
squared so I'm going to do something
like with times wish I probably
shouldn't have it do that math let's
just um let's just make it a really big
number how about ten million let's just
be safe here so now I'm going to run
this code and let's see how this goes I
have a blob whoops I don't have a blob
look by what all kachunk kachunk kachunk
snow slow horrible slowness so this was
already this is just too much back after
some testing and debugging and I think
this particular algorithm of checking
every point it's just going to be way
too slow so let's do it a different way
so well another way we could do it is if
this is if this is the blob and this is
the given point and I don't want to test
its distance to the center the other
thing I could do is actually just test
its in distance to the closest edge so
if it's down here I'm essentially
testing the distance to here if it's
here I'm testing the distance to here if
it's over here I'm testing to here so
I'm going to test the distance to the
closest edge of this rectangle now how
do I find the closest closest edge now
there is a technique known as clamping
not to be confused with glamping which
from what I understand is like glamour
camping or something I've never done
that before but this is called clamping
which is being take the point and kind
of clamp it to the side of the rectangle
so there's a way that we can do that
actually by let's say the point is over
here I can kind of look first for the
minimum between this points X this if
this is pxpy I can look for the minimum
like if we're over here right I would
get what the minimum would be here if
it's these two points the minimum would
be here so I can look for the minimum
and the right of the rectangle which in
my program was called max X and once I
get that whether it's now either here or
here I can do the sort of maximum of the
result of this the result of this and
now this side of the rectangle min X
right because and the maximum if it
clamped it to over here this would still
be the maximum but if this was still the
minimum then suddenly I'm going to now
have this side of the rectangle so this
is a little bit confusing but this is a
nice technique for being able to find
which side of the rectangle is the point
on by the way if it's in the center what
am I going to get I'm going to get the
the minimum between these two points is
going to be here and then the maximum is
also going to be here I'm going to get
itself
if I get itself it's already in the
rectangle the distance will ultimately
be zero so that's very very useful okay
so let's come back over here and I'm
going to implement this so I'm going to
get rid of my other idea and in fact I
don't no longer need to have this
ArrayList a point that was an
interesting idea I guess it will stay in
this video forever as my misguided
attempt and probably another way of
doing that I'm going to get rid of this
all this stuff that I added
I had this counter thing I was
experimenting with something and now
over here what I just want to do now is
say first I want to find the this point
CX which is not the center of the
rectangle anymore I want to test the
maximum sorry sorry I mean the minimum
of X and the right side of the rectangle
and then I want to say CX the result of
that is the maximum of itself and the
minimum of the rectangle and actually I
could write this in one line of code the
maximum of the result of this and the
minimum of the rectangle it's a little
bit awkward to write it that way but you
know it's kind of what you'll probably
see I might prefer it and I could do the
same thing with y I think I got that
right and then instead of the center I
can now just calculate the distance
between this new clamped point the point
that's kind of clamped around the edge
of the rectangle itself so now when I
run this to death that's my singing
that's my singing for when I'm waiting
for the processing sketch to start and I
bring these blobs up look at this
ah look at that notice how it's now one
blob that's because my distance
threshold is 75 so now I could change
the act I could change that distance
threshold I got to change the color
threshold ah I got a guess now come on
give me a look over here I clicked on
the no no nope get out oh don't stand in
front wait can I do this no okay like I
just rerun the sketch this is a problem
don't click in the window it sets the
color of what I'm tracking so I
I want to do is change that distance
threshold you can see I have some
keystrokes which are allowing me to
change it very slowly and ah the window
lost focus and if I look at it I got a
major problem of you there we go
I should have to change by five anyway
you can see that distance threshold is
now thirty nine and if I step aside and
you can see now there's separate blobs
until they get within thirty nine pixels
then there one blob but this is going to
be much more accurate now I can at least
kind of really tune Wow when do I want
to be separate blobs versus one blob and
have a lot more control oh I like this
better but this is probably way too long
of a video for you just get this like
simple awesome station but I had to
discover it um somebody I don't know I'm
sorry I I'm just enjoying the fact I
want to like wear a hat with these
things on them so many Possible's okay
so now that you've seen this this is a
one optimization I could do of this not
only optimization doesn't make it run
faster optimization is the wrong word
but to gain a bit more control over the
algorithm and improvement in terms of
how I'm checking for distance from the
edges so this code will be published
link to it in the description I'm glad
that this is now working and I'll see
you in the next video back for a quick
addendum I had tried remember to make it
work where you find the shortest
distance to any pixel as part of the
blob and that didn't work well I had
made a silly error of course the
Internet's saved me from my own failings
and so I'm going to quickly add this
back in and so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to make an ArrayList of P
vectors called points boy I didn't I
already have this I'm going to say
points is a new ArrayList of P vector
objects uh okay and then and then what
did I do every time there's a new point
I would say points dot add new P vector
X comma Y whoops don't-don't-don't and
then in a show what I also want to do
it's a 4 into I equals 0 I is less than
oh no no no no no no no no I can use my
AP vector look at all of the p-vector x'
and just say make it blue and then type
in a point dr. the dude did the VIX beat
out why there it is and I don't know
what is going on whether things are
working or not working so we can see
here now that I'm seeing all the points
that are part of the blob in addition to
that bounding rectangle okay so one way
that I could do to find multiple blobs
right instead of and I could instead of
simply finding that bounding rectangle I
can now find the shortest point to any
point ah but what was the mistake that I
made here was the mistake that I made
look in the add function every time
there's a new point I added to that list
but guess what I forgot
when I first make the blob I make it I
make it with an X Y so what I forgot was
to say points add new P vector X comma Y
so now I should be able to go back and
add that code so I'm going to comment
this out which is an excellent method
and I'm going to do another method which
says that a d is I'm going to start it
with like a really high distance and
then I'm going to look through all of
the vectors and I'm going to do the
temporary distance is the distance
between that X distance square between
that x and y and the vac that particular
point and then if that temporary
distance is less than the distance then
distance equals that temporary distance
so this distance this D is like a record
I want to find the shortest
distance between the new point and any
point that's inside the blob and if it's
less than the threshold go right ahead
so now I'm going to run this and this
should actually work if it does so and
it works and it's perfectly fast so the
only reason it wasn't working before and
you can see how this threshold that
distance threshold works beautifully as
well right it combines the blobs when
they're in within a certain threshold
and I can change that right by making it
higher so what's high are going to do I
should make it lower right oh I I really
should change this so that it okay so it
changed us make this lower I should just
have it change by five or something okay
and so now we can see here there's their
separate blobs until they get quite
quite close let me just change that
right now because this is driving me
crazy I want to change here I whenever I
press the key to change those threshold
values I want to change it by like five
so that I don't have to so that I don't
have to be pressing it so many times so
here they are right here are two blobs
and you can see them whoops no the color
threshold now distance threshold they're
separate blobs right when that distance
threshold is five we get lots of extra
little blobs they really don't become
the same blob until they're literally
touching each other but if that distance
threshold is more like sixty than when
they're within 60 pixels they become so
this is another way of doing it that's
perhaps a little bit more accurate than
the other way but it works okay so I
fixed that problem thank you very much I
did both now this video now contains
both solutions one solution being
the clamping to a rectangle right
finding the distance of the new point to
the edges of the blob versus another
just finding the shortest the shortest
distance of the point to the rectangle
itself the short set is a point to any
points within the rectangle okay that's
the end of this video now for sure until
I record another addendum goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
