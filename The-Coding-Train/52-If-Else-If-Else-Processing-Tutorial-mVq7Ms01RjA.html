at the beginning of something what's
happening here is if you recall we are
talking about how to have a program
choose a path essentially how do we have
the program execute some code sometimes
and other code of other times okay so
we're doing that with a conditional
statement a conditional statement
involves saying if this condition is met
then execute the lines of code in
between the open and curly closed
brackets we can you see an example of
that running over here which we built in
the last video I dress it up with a
little bit there's now a white line over
here to show us where if the mouse is if
the mouse is over here it's less than
100 pixels and it is not executing that
code which draws a red background but as
soon as I move the mouse over whoa up
students I click in the window and have
it in focus I move the mouse over we can
see we now get a red background no red
background red background no red
background red background our program is
doing something different
each time through draw based on a
condition this is how everything works
you're programming pong if the ball hits
the paddle then change the ball's
direction if the palm goes past the
battle change the score etc etc this is
what we're doing we just want to be able
to set conditions and execute different
code based on those conditions
everything you do is going to be sort of
thinking through and designing that
logic so that's the beginning of this
there are a few more pieces that we want
to get through for example what if we
were to say okay well I want to draw
another line I want to draw a line
that's a little bit further over and it
is at 200 pixels let me run this now and
so okay 200 and that's a little bit
stake there I want also the top of the
line to be at 200 pixels so here we have
black background here we have red
background here we have red background
what if I want a third option black to
red to say blue so I know I could say
hmm if mouse X is greater than 200 draw
a red background blue background yeah so
I think we're going to have that program
working out black red blue depending on
where the mouse is black red blue here's
the thing what is going on here there
are two different cases if the mouse is
greater than 100 execute this code if
the mouse is greater than 200 execute
this code but we're actually testing
both of these we're actually drawing a
red background and we're drawing a blue
background what if we had something
different where instead of drawing a
background we want to draw some
rectangle so let's just say make a red
rectangle and we'll put it somewhere on
the screen and we will here we will draw
a we will draw a green rectangle and we
will put it a little bit lower down and
that's going to be way off the screen
okay so what's going on here no
rectangle red rectangle add the green
rectangle no green rectangle green
rectangle no rectangles but what if I
want the green one to appear here and
the red one to disappear in this case
here what think the mouse is at 400 if
the mouse is at 400 is greater than 100
and it's greater than 200 so we're going
to see the red rectangle and the green
rectangle there is another way we could
start to make this code work slightly
differently what if we want to
exclusively only execute one of these
what if we want to say this
else if Mouse X is greater than 200 now
this looks similar if the mouse is
greater than 100 if the mouse is greater
than 200 if the mouse is greater than
100 else if the mouse is greater than
200 we can think of this as if as the
word otherwise if hate this video that
I'm making right back have to just keep
coke a little tired today what's gonna
blow up looks just this is gonna be fine
gonna remake all these anyway okay come
on we can do this okay if the mouse is
greater than 100 otherwise if the mouse
is greater than 200 this thing what's
important here there's something
important here that we're totally
missing on this I'm saying the thing
that's important here is with this
structure else if with this structure if
both of these can happen with the
structure else if only one of these can
ever be executed the interesting thing
is this is a huge mistake we made here
pause the video and deposit yet wait
take a look at this something is
horribly wrong
syntax is fine you'll run the proximal
gives error but we're gonna have a
problem pause the video and think about
that and then come back okay you're back
let's go over here and put that code in
so I'm going to say else if the mouse X
is greater than 200
so I've revised this code so okay the
mouse is about fifty pixels it's not
greater than 100 it's not greater than
200 it's just we're not seeing any
rectangles okay the mouse is now greater
than 100 we're seeing a red rectangle
that's what we expected to see I think
I'm supposed to stand here supposed to
stand here it looks better when I stand
here actually this should be a little
bit over and there should be little over
but whatever it's fine umm now the mouse
is red right now over here
what's happening the mouse is greater
than 200 but there's no green
oh well why is that all right well let's
think about it let's say for the moment
what happens if mouse X is 150 if now
650 this is true so we execute this code
we don't execute this code with it else
if we get the first thing we find to be
true we leave if mouse X is 250 let's
set week 2 or 50 is greater than 100
execute this code we leave we're done I
don't like this down here should we up
here the factor that matters
okay let's what happens if I make this
200 and I make this one all this weird
logic stuff that you're stuck thinking
about all the time let's make this 200
on this like 7 minutes already this is a
disaster this would be like a
three-minute video just going over what
else if it else is what oh well this is
my life right now ok here we go ok
Mouse X is here now I've got a green
rectangle now I've got a red rectangle
green rectangle red rectangle why
because when it's 250 we're executing
this code and skipping out when it's 150
this becomes false if this is false we
can check the next one and the next one
is true and then we skip out with else
if when you have an escape and join them
in else if you only ever do one of these
and we can even go so far as to say else
if Mouse X is greater than 50 right we
can join as many of these as we want so
let's go over here and add that in so
we're going to say let's start with like
500 400 just keep adding more of these
in to see we can have a whole bunch of
these 300 300 200 and we can have
different colored rectangles at
different locations all arbitrarily with
different sizes and oh well let's see
what happens now
so oh and you know what this was nice
having these lines there so let's keep
let's add all the line so we can see
where all this stuff is that align it
301 400 and 100 uh zijn do anything
anymore or maybe it does what we need a
line of 500 Oh this video is a disaster
actor remake these you know I haven't
really thought this through yet I should
do these after something or whatever oh
it's very tired today it's not going
right these are all like a mess and it's
all in the wrong everything's wrong
everything's wrong that should line
should do that the x-value should all be
the same so they're spaced out well
what's going on here this pixel that
makes no sense this weird streams like
blinking rectangular design that we've
made what's going on the point that
we're emphasizing here is that what
we're doing is with this if statement we
are creating a set of possibilities only
one of which can be executed so first we
see if we're greater than 500 if that's
not true we see four graded 400 that's
not true 300 etcetera etc this is
essentially the kind of logic you want
to start programming if you want to
create rollovers essentially we've
created these regions that when the
mouse is over them something happened
something you might try to do as an
exercise right now because this video so
clearly explain all this perfectly and
it also missed a whole important part
which is like what else is because
there's an else I should just start this
over but I'm not going to start it over
I'm just doing this tripping on things I
think I thought oh yeah there's a door
here I could just leave the language
because I really AM is just like totally
insane okay work this fine it's going to
be a long video later these are going to
be shorter would be redoing all this
anyway everything's okay we're calm
we're fine you're listening probably
turn this off by now if you haven't you
really lost your mind
watching this okay what are we talking
about the exercise for you okay here's
your exercise
here's your processing window divide it
into four quadrants and have the
quadrants highlight whenever you move
the mouse over them so the mouse I guess
is my drawing the mouth should be here
that's a mouse and this is showing that
it's highlighted as you move the mouse
over create these regions of roller it's
very similar to what we've done over
here the only difference is instead of
these sort of horrid of horizontal
regions these vertical lines section
them up we've got a section the screen
off they degrade now here's what we kind
of didn't say with any if statement we
can also have an else</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
