and I'm going to save this and I'm going
to do while grid call this wild grid and
we're we're going to make this very
simple
we're going to give up a white stroke
let's make the stroke weight two pixels
so they're a little bit easier to see
and then we know we want to draw a line
from X 0 to X comma height and if we
just set X for the moment at 50 let's
see where that line is we have our 1
vertical line so now we were saying okay
if I have one vertical line I could do x
equals x plus 50 and draw that line
again and now I would have two vertical
lines so why not this is the code that
needs to happen over and over again so
why not say let's just do that code
let's just do that code as long as X is
less than the width let's run that and
now we've got that you can see all of
our lines going nicely across the screen
and hey if we did this with X why not
just do it with Y and while Y is less
than height we want to draw a line from
what 0 comma Y to width comma Y and
increment Y by 50 ah what's wrong the
field component dot y is not visible
that's what it says down at the bottom
Oy Vey what's happening I have forgotten
I'm using a variable but I forgot to
declare and initialize it so I just need
to make sure I add my variable Y up top
and then we come down here and I'm going
to just scroll down so we can see the
draw function and run it and what do we
see we have X going across Y going down
we have our beautiful grid interestingly
enough what is this there's all these
numbers x equals 50 well let's start x 0
Y at 0 why there's this number 50 here
well that should give us an idea why
don't I have a
variable called spacing and have that be
equal to 50 x equals x plus spacing and
then y equals y plus spacing this should
give us the same result
it does but now I have something
exciting I can do what if I were to say
spacing equals spacing plus random
negative to some random number between
negative 2 and 2 now we can see the
spacing in between the lines is changing
randomly so I I hesitate to offer that
this is any sort of interesting or
exciting visual effect but it's showing
you how we can use a loop to draw many
lines across the screen and then we can
vary how we're doing that by using
random using the mouse you hopefully
will come up with something creative you
could change the colors</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
