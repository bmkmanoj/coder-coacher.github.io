video is two other elements that you can
add to a page for additional
interactivity so the previous video I
started talking about this idea of a
callback you have a button and you
attach a function to that button and the
code is executed only when you click on
the button via the mouse pressed event
callback so let's look at two other
pieces of two other interactive elements
you can add to the page and how what
other events might be associated with
those elements and some other things you
might be able to do that'll just make
things more interesting for you so
hopefully I'm not gonna like knock this
light over and start a fire and there
was a siren earlier and you know the
fire department will come everything but
everything's okay stuff right now okay
so the two elements are let's start with
a slider so a slider is something that
looks like this my beautiful drawing of
a slider you can slide this value slide
this little dot back and forth and
hopefully control something on the page
making something larger making something
smaller making something more blue less
blue how does that work so the p5
function for adding a slider to a page
this is create slider now there's a few
things to mention about this number one
this is the default HTML slider element
so it's what you get for free in the
browser a sliders just there if you want
to have your own kind of slider that
looks custom if you want to make your
slider along the sine-wave
there's all sorts of crazy things you
can do in canvas and drawing and we sort
of seen it but right now we're just
going to work with the default slider
you get for free
the other thing I want to mention is you
can of course add the slider by writing
the HTML tags into the HTML source
itself and there might be good reasons
for doing that but for simplicity right
now I'm kind of focusing on JavaScript
and I want to just add the slider using
Create slider just like I said create
button now what does a slider need a
slider needs three values to start it
needs a minimum what is the value that
the slider should output when its luck
when you slide all the way to the left
what is the maximum when you slide all
the way to the right
and what is what I would say the
starting value so let's say that I want
to use the slider to control the size of
a circle and I want the circle size to
be between 10 and 100 and I want it to
start at 47 so create slider with a
minimum with a maximum and with a
starting value so let's add that to the
page I'm going to come over here and we
can see I already have a button and now
I'm going to add a slider create slider
with a minimum a maximum and a starting
value so we should see now that there is
also a slider on the page by the way one
thing I did which is kind of silly is it
was bothering me that the button was
showing up to the right of the canvas
later I will show you all sorts of other
ways through CSS and styling to control
the layout of the page but right now as
a quick sort of trick is I just added a
pair of an empty paragraph between the
canvas and the button and you can see
how I did that in the code right here so
I made the canvas I made an empty
paragraph and then I put the button you
can see the slider is showing up to the
right of the button if I added another
empty paragraph it would show up below
you know whether there was that's a good
idea or a bad idea I'm sure lots of
people will tell me that that was a
terrible idea but you know what it works
it's fine okay so now the slider is
there I can move it around nothing is
happening
but you notice also I could change this
like if I say the starting value is 5
you can see look the slider position
started over here if I say the starting
value is 86 the slider position starts
over here so you can control that
starting value by changing the number
hard-coded in the code so how do you get
the value out of the slider and the way
that you get the value out of the slider
is a function called value so this is
another function that we're adding that
I that I there's another function that
I'm telling you about that is part of
HTML elements so far we've only seen
position which absolute positions an
element on the page I've shown you HTML
the HTML
function which changes the content of
the element what's the text in the
element and now you're seeing another
one value which pulls out the value now
value is not necessarily relevant for a
lot of other for all elements but serve
value is relevant for slider because you
need to know the current value of the
slider so let's say where might I use
this ah so first of all what did I
forget I just made the slider but if I
want to pull the value if I want to
position it change its content pull out
the value I need a variable to call that
function on so I need to add a variable
slider here then I can say slide or
equals create slider and now anywhere in
the code I could access its value so I
want to change this to a circle and you
can see there's a circle and I'm going
to say slider dot value in here and
slider dot value now you might ask the
question is don't I want an event like I
want to have an event fire I want to
handle the event anytime the user moves
the slider and this is something you
actually can do and I'll show that to
you hopefully if this video a little bit
later but I've done a little bit of a
trick here remember draw this animation
loop is just cycling over and over again
draw draw draw loop loop loop so what I
can do instead of handling the event I
can just say while I'm drawing that
circle every time I draw the circle
access this value of the slider for the
size of the circle and you can see here
now that I move the slider you can see
the the size of that circle is changing
so this is yet another thing you can add
to your code you can have a button here
now I have a button that handles that
event I have a slider where I'm pulling
the value continuously in draw and so I
essentially building a little interface
to control the canvas so this is kind of
what I think you can start doing now if
you've learned a bit about programming
and you're making these little pictures
the animations what might you get out of
building a simple interface controlling
things in the code with a button
controlling things in the code with a
slider and even more so let's look at
one more element a text input field
and this is where I'm going to get to
some other events which I think are
useful to see I'm erasing all this so a
text input field is a box where a user
can type in text like their name so you
might say like name : an empty field so
how would you how do you get this on the
page create input the create input
function creates a text input field on
the page so let's add that over here I'm
going to add that under slider and you
know what I'm going to just be smarter
about this and just add a variable input
equals create input let's put something
in here in the quotes your name type
your name let's run that and see what
happens
now notice interestingly enough I can
populate that text input field in
advance by passing an argument to the
create input function so whatever right
and this is this is sort of a key piece
of information here I'm having trouble
with my layout of my window here but you
can see that creating different elements
requires different arguments a button
the text goes inside the button a slider
needs a minimum maximum starting value a
text input field needs text to start in
that input field if I wanted it to be
blank I could just take this out and
start it with an empty string and you
can see that text input field is blank
but I'll give it like you know I'm going
to write test Nate you know I'll put
that type your name back in here and you
can see there it is so now how do I get
what the current text is in that box how
do I get that into how do I access that
well guess what I raced it but I wrote
down here before the value function the
value function pulls out the current
value of the slider the numeric value of
where the slider is the value function
pulls out the current value also of
inputbox so this is a sort of important
function if I have an element a text
input field a slider and I want to know
its current value this p5 Dom library
function value will give me access to
that so I could do something like here
in canvas there is a text function I'm
going to say text let's just test that
this works hello 10 comma 20 and I'm
going to run this and you can see there
it is the word hello is on the canvas
but now what if I were to say instead
input dot value so just like I'm using
the sliders value to draw a site to set
the size of a circle let me use the text
input value to set text that I'm drawing
on the canvas so look at this look at it
says type your name and now here and
y'all shift men wow this is amazing
whatever I type so this is pretty great
so you can dynamically access what's in
the box through the value function and
control the canvas now I think we better
I think we should do something different
here so this is great you can see how
the all three of these elements work a
button click on the button make an event
happen click on the slider use the
variable use the value the slider in a
variable to control sewing in the code
type some stuff here change what appears
on this in the canvas but I want to do
something different what I want to do
now is I'm going to go back to this
paragraph element and I'm going to say
don't your name now look at this what I
want to see is when I'm typing here when
I hit enter I want to see that these
sorry this paragraph changed to my name
ok so what I want to do is not just
control something in the canvas I want
to control another HTML element from and
I've kind of gone to mass by 10-minute
mark here but maybe you're still
watching
I want to control another element from
from that text input field so let's
think about how that works
so
a quick way that I could do it I'm sorry
we thought we've already sort of seen
this so let me just come back here and
say name P and I'm going to say this is
name P and in draw I could say name P
dot HTML input value so this is right
here right this text function draws text
to the canvas this HTML function changes
the text of an HTML element to that
value so now if I run this you can see
here that you know whatever I type here
changes in this element but I'm actually
only using the the fact that draw is
looping so actually I think I'm going to
stop this and doing it I'm going to just
continue this discussion in the next
video because I think we could look at
the difference between how some of these
other events are handled would look at a
selection of other events and so I'm
going to do that in the next video but
if so if you're if you're watching this
video it stopping here right now what I
might suggest that you do is try adding
a slider a bunch of sliders try adding a
text field see can you make the can you
make the this text update in the canvas
only when you click like a submit button
so how what kind of interplay can you
have between buttons sliders text fields
and Dom elements and in the next video I
want to look at other events besides
just mouse press that might be
associated with these elements okay I'm
going to hit stop</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
