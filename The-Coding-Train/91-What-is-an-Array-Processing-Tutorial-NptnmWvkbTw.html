video about an array this video is only
going to answer two questions what is an
array and why do we need an array this
is quite an exciting moment I hope it is
for me I hope it is for you because
where are we in our journey through
programming we are now at the very end
of the fundamentals of programming we
have done variables we have done
conditionals we have done loops objects
functions I should set functions objects
but whatever functions objects and now
we are at this last piece of the puzzle
the array once we get through this last
piece of the puzzle we can move on and
start to explore all sorts of
interesting and exciting applications of
these ideas in different directions and
and I hope to make more videos and point
you towards more videos and content and
exciting adventures that you pay or may
not choose to have and so but all I want
to do here is talk about an array now
I'm going to say if you remember where
we last left off truth of the matter is
I left this off like a year ago I'm kind
of filling in a video that the audio had
some problems in so I'm trying to keep
continuity as best as possible I do have
more gray hair and I forgot to trim this
beard so anyway wearing a different
shirt but you know whatever you will
figure it out if it's a problem for you
you will email me and a slip a note
somewhere handwritten in some box
somewhere okay so here we are this is
where you last left off if you were
watching videos this is where I last
left off my memory serves me we had this
beautiful lovely little nice program
what did it have it has two bubble
objects those two bubble objects are
initialized here and set up some
functions are called with them and
they're floating up to the top of the
screen they're lovely I love them they
make me feel happy but and you know what
this could be our world we could say you
know what we live in this wonderful
little world of two bubbles and there
never needs to be any more bubbles but
some sometime in your life you might
choose to dream a little bit bigger you
might move forward and say I don't want
two bubbles I won three I won ten I want
100 I won a thousand I want to have no
bubbles when the program starts and then
after a while a couple bubbles appear
then a few more we need to suddenly have
the option of having many many more
bubbles so let's
let's just say for a moment here's our
first approach our first approach of
this problem is to say well I had two
bubbles and the way that I had two
bubbles was I said bubble b1 and then I
said bubble b-two
perfect now I would like three bubbles
so I will say bubble b3 and now what
would I like for bubbles don't worry I
will keep doing this forever
bubble b4 and we can see that this is a
reasonable solution and it is
sustainable to about I don't know maybe
five bubbles maybe by the time we get to
five balls would be like eye and forget
it I that six bubble is just never going
to happen I'm done so we need a better
solution it's quite obvious to you in
your mind probably what that solution is
even though we haven't done it yet but
the solution is an array what is an
array what do we want we want to have a
list of bubbles I want to just say in
one statement I want to have a list of
100 bubbles or 1,000 bubbles or 1
million bubbles right so I wouldn't be
able to have as many bubbles as I want
and I want to be able to say that it
come in one line of code that's a list
of something a list of data is an array
an array is a data structure just like
this is a data structure for a single
bubble object b1 an array is a data
structure that allows us say I want to
have a list of X number of n number of
bubbles so we're almost kind of done
with this kind of introduction of the
idea of an array we see why we need one
that's pretty obvious a little bit of
how we have what it means conceptually
but let's take that one little step
further and kind of get a peek at the
syntax and then in the next video it's
going to carry forth and continue this
journey forward and forward and forward
okay so if you remember there was a time
sometime in your life or my life or in a
past video that existed somewhere where
we wanted to have a number and we would
say int I could say int Val equals 5 for
example I want to have a number I'm
going to call it Val it's an integer and
I'm gonna give it the value 5 what
actually happens on the computer well we
have this thing called RAM the
computer's memory the brain of the
computer where all this data is stored
we open up a spot in the computer's
memory we name it
Val it's named Val and then what do we
do we store the number five there this
works now let's take the following
scenario what if we have the computer's
memory and what we want to do is we want
to say I don't want to open up spot for
a single number what I want to do is
open up enough spots for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1
2 3 4 5 6 7 numbers and I want to name
that values I'm going to name it values
and what I want values to be is a list
of all these numbers to negative 5 107
491 333 right so values is a list of all
those numbers how does this work this is
hopefully this makes this gives it this
gives us a nice conceptually this makes
sense to us this word is is is an at is
is pointing to a single number this word
is pointing to a continuous list of
numbers we declared vow as an integer
set it equal to 5 what we need to do is
declare values as a list of integers
open square bracket close square bracket
let me write that again over here a
little bit bigger open square bracket
close square bracket this is how we note
an array in a declaration and int a
single integer Val and array a list of
integers an array open square bracket
close square bracket that syntax is
going to come up more and more we're
going to start using square brackets if
you're like never got to use those keys
on your keyboard here you go here's your
chance so once we have this list we can
actually initialize it by saying curly
bracket to negative 5 107 comma 4 comma
9 T 1 comma 3 comma 33 so this syntax
I'm less concerned about we're going to
get into the details of the syntax of
opening up the list filling the list
using the values in the list what does
it need to say like I want to take all
these numbers and double them I want to
take all these numbers and divide them
by 2 I want to sort these numbers so
that the so that the lowest ones are at
the beginning of the list these are all
the kinds of things you can do with an
array for you the thing that you want to
start thinking about there's no real
exercise here they'll be an exercise
after the next video I guess but find
that five-year bubble right
what was that program that you wrote
that
had thing one thing two thing three
thing for find that piece of code look
at it think about what an array would
give you what possibilities would that
open up and and and like have that ready
to go because that's the piece of code
you're going to start to adjust as we go
through the next videos and go over the
syntax more and more and more okay that
was about seven minutes that you watched
or if you're still here or maybe you
just start at the middle I don't know if
whatever and this is done now hopefully
the audio work because I did this video
earlier in the audio was terrible and I
hope this is better okay bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
