should you learn to program the computer
and really but you know we first have to
admit that the answer for my question
might be hello no I don't need to do
this I'm interested in lots of stuff and
this does not interest me and that's
pretty reasonable I mean first of all
you should make sure you go outside run
around physical exercise is very
important food is delicious talking to
people is wonderful
I don't know hobbies I like playing
cards I like musical theater I
understood you programming for those
things so you you can go and have a very
full life and just stop these videos and
really be a happy person at the same
time let's just make let's just let's
just admit something you probably use
the computer a lot you probably it's
probably a tool for a work family social
what you use it all right and how do you
use it let's say you've never written a
line of code before in your life you
probably do things like you use Chrome
or you use Photoshop or you use a word
or Y ie we could keep making a long list
of stuff there what are all these things
software who made these things not you
right so you know they're great
Photoshop is really good and an amazing
piece of software I made by a very large
company and lots of people and you need
Photoshop you have an image you want to
get rid of the redeye you want to make
it brighter you want to do some kind of
I don't know filter on it to make it
look like it was taking 30 years ago
I don't know Photoshop does that you use
Photoshop but there are limits to what
Photoshop can do it is a tool with a set
of features that are provided to you in
via an interface and you can't make it
do more than it does and in fact if you
want to be creative if you want to
develop your own ideas whether they're
art or commercial product or some just
weird strange exploration you don't want
to you don't want to be limited by the
tools that are provided for you you want
to start with able
slate you know if you want to create a
new image processing filter that doesn't
exist you could do that in this video
series you will learn to do that and
it's not very hard I mean there are
aspects of programming that are
incredibly hard this won't be easy don't
get me wrong but this is really what
we're talking about here everything that
you do whether it's working with images
working with animation writing checking
your email interfacing with hardware
robotics there's everything that you do
digitally starts from somewhere somebody
wrote the software to make this stuff
work why couldn't that person be you
what types of things could you invent
what types of ideas could you come up
with if you weren't limited to the list
of tools that you can download purchase
and get from you know other individuals
who might have releases open source or
big companies let's get let's break all
those bonds let's write your own
software it sounds very grand ridiculous
and then we're going to be like and now
what you're going to learn is there's a
red circle on the screen and it moves
back and forth so don't don't get me
wrong this is going to be a slow process
this is really just the beginning I'm
going to show you some basic stuff
you're gonna have to take it much
farther but this will get you started in
that direction if you that's the and
hopefully will be great
now there's also the question this is
maybe why you should learn how you
should learn that's a more complicated
one prepared it's a great I'm just going
to try as best I can to communicate to
you and provide resources but again I
this just brings up the question there
are so many resources online that are
terrific there are online courses you
could take there's code Academy there's
the Khan Academy there's Udacity there's
schools you can go to there's a new
experimental school called the school
for for poetic computation that's
opening there's lots of stuff out there
so this is just a little resource
through video I'll try to supplement it
with code examples online with links
below the video I might hopefully create
a site with some other tools at some
point but right now me talking examples
you can tell
with diagrams and that but there isn't
something that I think is important to
mention here which is a lot of the tools
that you might first of all you know
it's a nice way to learn find a friend
find a someone you don't even know sit
in a room with other people try to
program with them ask them questions
look at what they're doing try to
explain your program to a friend be with
people right we can all try to design
the most fancy best whatever online tool
that will like show you the steps and
give you immediate feedback and step you
through and give you this exercise and
give you all this right but being with
people and talking to people and talking
through your ideas that is probably the
best way to learn now that's not what's
happening here I'm by myself which is a
little bit weird but I'm getting used to
it a lot more used to it than I thought
I when I was before but one thing that I
will say also that's a little bit
different here is a lot of the tools and
courses you know that you might take
whether it's a high school class a
college class an online class first of
all they might have the word computer
science in them that's an it computer
science is a really great field of
research and study of the science of
computing this is not that we are just
learning about computation how to write
programming how to write code how to
program and applying it to whatever you
might be interested in are you
interested in biology and could the
tools of computation help you there are
you interested in music and could the
tools of computation I'll be something
you could use with music and this is the
other thing that I don't have a test for
you to take I don't have an out I don't
have something to say like and you will
make this when you're finished with
these videos the point of these videos
is for you to have a creative idea and
you don't have to have that now you
might get inspired or try experiments
and it doesn't have to have any
practical value now you you might want
to get a job which i think is important
in a lot of ways you but you might also
just be like I like sorbet and I like a
bugs particularly spiders and I'm going
to create a simulation of spiders eating
sorbet which actually now that makes no
sense whatsoever but that's the point
you might have some idea that apparently
doesn't have any practical value that
makes any sense but you just want to
explore it could be a visual
idea a it could be a musical idea it
could be a website and app you know this
isn't really going to be about prop
making products and apps and stuff for
the web as you're going to see as much
but you disappoint is you should you
will develop your own ideas and make
them and hopefully share them with
others in some way so this is not going
to I will try to give little exercises
and little questions and push in
particular directions but how you will
learn in this particular context will be
about coming up with your own creative
project ideas and using the tools of
computation to realize those ideas and
hopefully that will be a nice thing if
anybody has success with that and finds
it useful I'd be thrilled to know okay
so that's the end of this introductory
this particular introductory video and I
think the next one is I'm going to talk
about actually what is programming what
does it mean to write what is
programming what is an algorithm what
does it mean to program the computer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
