cellular automata the singular of
cellular automata by the way is a
cellular automaton so we're going to
look at a cellular automaton but we're
going to discuss cellular automata now
why first of all what is a cellular
automaton and why are we looking at this
okay so first of all you know you might
be just arriving here from nowhere which
is totally fine but if you had just
watched the previous video the last
thing we talked about is right here
behind me a flocking system a complex
system a system of many simple agents
that when they work together exhibit
this exhibit this complex intelligent
behavior so that there's a lot going on
in this system
there's physics there's there's physics
there's motion there's all sorts of
stuff distant the neighborhoods are
changing as these things move about the
space one of the reasons to look at
cellular automata is to say okay now
that we achieved this complex system
let's boil that down and try to create
the simplest possible complex system
ever what would that be what is the
simplest possible agent which would have
the simplest possible neighbors and the
simplest possible set of rules as to how
it interacts with its neighbors if we
could design that system could we still
achieve complexity so that's the
question we want to answer when looking
at cellular automata now what is one
okay first of all so this videos we're
going to we're basically going to talk
through the get the two classic examples
and we're going to do them in reverse
chronological order but our order is
going to have some logic to it so I'm
just going to move so we're going to go
through to a kind of classic cellular
automatons automata this one is
scrolling here by this is the wolfram
elementary CA and this is rule 30 30 it
is in fact this is rule 30 which we're
going to get to what's rule 30 even mean
this is oh so I'm going to talk about
Wolfram in a little bit
over here we have something called the
game of life which is perhaps the most
famous certainly the the first most
famous cellular automata that that that
sort of arrived into popular culture
with it with a well-known article in
1970 in Scientific American so we're
going to look at these two systems
understand how they work understand how
to write the code for them and then ask
the question you know great we could
just implement these and change the
colors and we have some interesting
patterns but really we need to ask the
question how does this way of thinking
apply to the type of work we're doing in
interactive media computer graphics
computational design all that sort of
stuff so openly this video is going to
kind of introduce the concepts behind
these two systems and the next couple
videos we'll walk through the code for
them and the last video will kind of
talk about other other possibilities in
this realm okay if you feel good about
that I feel good about that that yes so
let's talk about let's define let's just
say CA let's define a Co okay let's
define a cellular automaton a cellular
automaton is a grid of cells we're going
to look at one dimensional grids two
dimensional grids one dimensional grid
for example just looks like this you're
a whole bunch of cells sitting next to
each other in one dimension which
incidentally looks quite a bit like the
diagram for an array so we can see how
this is going to fit nicely in terms of
programming these types of things okay
now if a CA is a grid of cells each cell
is defined but as a entity that has a
state and we're going to look at a
variety of possible States
the simplest being a 0 or a 1 right a
binary state it's on or off alive or
dead 0 1 black or white and each cell
also has a neighborhood this is very
important because how a state a cell
state changes over time is going to be
determined by the the some the the by
analyzing its neighbor States so this is
really the third aspect of defining a CA
which is that the state of a cell a cell
state at any moment in time T is equal
to
function of the neighborhood states at
time t minus one so we have this idea of
generations generations over time the ca
has a whole bunch of states if there's
zero or ones and then we say hey at the
next moment in time this state cell is
somehow going to be calculated based on
a neighborhood of states adding them
together average you can say what is the
pattern that type of thing so this is
how we define a CA great so I think this
actually strangely I'm trying different
things wraps up this video and I'll
guess I'll give you an exercise which is
kind of a bit of an insane one but you
know men many of you watching this or
might be familiar with this already many
of you watching this might have never
heard of a CA before if you haven't
tried to design for yourself a set of
rules for how cell states would change
over time for a one-dimensional CA with
zeros and ones now this is of course
what we're going to look at in the next
video the next video we're going to look
at the Wolfram Elementary CA which is
precisely this a one-dimensional CA
where the states are zeros and ones and
we're going to look at what are what's a
possible set of rules for how those
states change from generation to
generation how do we implement that in
code and what results do we get but you
know it's a little exercise to yourself
you might try imagining this okay so I'm
gonna pause here and I'm just gonna keep
plowing through them but the next stuff
will be in another video how do you feel
about that great ok thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
