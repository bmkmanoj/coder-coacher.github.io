tutorial about working with git and
github and in this tutorial i'm gonna
talk about remotes so I I was I'm in the
middle of live streaming and I'm working
on this project that has to do with this
flappy bird clone and I'm in a train and
a bot using a genetic algorithm in a
neural network to play flappy bird and I
have a wonderful pull request from
github user Keegan M who has added this
particular image to be the flappy bird
and this particular background to be the
background of the flappy bird game and I
really want to accept this pull request
but what I want to do and I can examine
it through the github interface I can
see uh this was deleted and this was
added because now it's gonna have an
image and there's there's an icon
variable which loads the image those are
some things that those are some
wonderful things like that that I want
to accept but I don't have any unit
testing and I um this isn't like hosted
anywhere so I want to actually look at
it locally on my computer to to run the
code and sort of like see before I merge
it and so there's a variety of ways that
this can be done more efficiently than
what I'm going to show you right now but
this is a good excuse to talk about
remotes so what is a remote so right now
the my terminal window which I want to
make a little bit bigger is in the
directory of this project I'm on the
desktop flappy bird clone if I say git
remote that remote escape and - V - V
for verbose like I want to know as much
as possible I put UB very verbose about
the remote it's gonna say oh look you
have a remote that is named origin that
is tied to this URL and that makes sense
that's my github URL coding train slash
flappy bird clone that's the github
repository and this remote was
automatically created because at some
point in time I said get clone and I put
and I put this in so when I did this
this default remote was created so the
remote being another location where this
git repository exists now the word or
is kind of a default convention for the
original remote but you know the sort of
canonical remote B github in this case
but it's just a made-up thing like I can
say get room and I do this actually with
a lot of projects I could say git remote
delete
I think origin nope get remote remove
origin yes
and now if I say git remote dash V
there's no more remotes but I could say
git remote add and instead of calling it
origin why not call it github for
unicorn I could call it anything I want
let's call it github and then I can
paste in flappy bird clone I'm just
gonna grab this URL here and I can paste
this in here and now I am adding this
remote and I could say git remote - B
again and we can see there it is back
but it's now called github so if I were
ever to say get put pull origin master
to grab some changes master by the way
is this name of the like core branch is
also just a completely made-up thing I
could have source branch or release
branch or development branch or
experimental branch that's a separate
video about branches that you can go and
watch but if I say this it'll say ah
origin doesn't appear to be positive
because it's not there but I can now say
git pull github master and there we go
now I'm already up to date so don't have
to worry about it now here's the thing I
want let's go back to this pull request
which is once again from keegan m so
where is keegan m's
and we can see here ah keegan m :
graphics so keegan m made these code
changes in a branch called graphics in
their github repository so one thing I'm
gonna do is I'm just gonna copy paste
this right here it's probably way it
could link to it and I'm gonna go up to
the URL and I'm gonna change coding
trained to Keegan M and I'm gonna get
rid of the poor grishnak I just want to
go over there and see that this is the
Fork of the repository and so there we
can see this is Keegan M's Fork we can
see branch man
we can see branch graphics I could start
looking around now i'm gonna do is i'm
going to go to clone and i'm gonna grab
this so i'm now gonna grab Teagan ends a
fork of my flappy bird clone i'm gonna
grab that and I'm going to say git
remote add keygen I can make up anything
here but I'm just gonna say Keegan's I
think I can remember that and I'm going
to then paste in that particular URL for
Keegan yep now one thing you might
notice I these are else they get at
github comm you might actually and this
is because I have set up this very fancy
way for my computer to be auto logged in
using an SSH key and a passphrase but if
you don't have that set up and I should
do a video tutorial that explains how to
do that you might want to use HTTPS this
is also a way that you can this is just
the sort of standard URL without having
the sort of secret keys that log you in
automatically but that's a little bit of
an aside here I'm going to add this
remote and now I would say git remote -
V and we can see look at this I have
github remote which is tied to me coding
train
I have Keegan's remote which is tied to
keygen M which is tied to that get over
how Zack you get em now I'm gonna say
there's a lot of different things that I
can do but what I'm gonna do is I'm just
gonna say git branch graphics I'm gonna
make a branch locally called graphics
and I'm gonna quickly go into that
branch again you should probably watch
my branches tutorial about how this
works and I'm gonna go into that branch
by using checkout then what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna say git pull and usually
I've almost reflectively just get pull
origin/master git pull origin master git
pull origin master git pull origin
master git pull origin master but I
don't want to pull from origin I want to
pull from Keegan and I don't want to
pull for a master I want to pull from
graphics git pull Keegan graphics ah ooh
interesting hmm
so something has happened here in that I
am now been launched into a text editor
known as VI whoa this has been like way
off the screen that's what's going on
here that's crazy and so there are some
sort of merge
that needs to happen for Keegan M's
branch graphics to come into my branch
graphics because I actually have made
some other changes it would've been nice
if this didn't happen but this is
actually quite normal
this is a regular thing and I have to
deal with this so what I would I what I
want to do is say that I'm gonna say
what do i type in VI so I think I'd say
:
insert no I for insert I for insert so
again you can link a different text
editor to your get work on your computer
but this is and so now but I've been
launching this text editor in in command
I just want to say like I'm I'm making a
tutorial video so I don't have a lot of
time but this is here to merge Keegan's
graphics with with some recent changes I
made and and then I'm gonna say : oops
oh no I got to get rid of insert escape
maybe escape : QW which I think will
then quit and write this out I don't
really know how to use vim or whatever I
know what to call it : q w oh and I'm
gonna just do that now not an editor
command : WQ write and then quit there
we go and now it's fine it didn't commit
it that's fine so now this is good I
just really wanted to look at it all I
want to do is look at it I don't need to
commit this right now because I'm not
really worrying about merging and so now
I should if I come over here this is me
like looking at my code in the browser
before I checked out and pulled from
that other remote and there we go
look at this and now we have the coding
train the flappy bird flap be coding
train game with our little unicorn train
and a scrolling background okay
wonderful so this is good so now I feel
I'm like oh this looks great
I'm done
so interestingly enough if I wanted to I
could actually merge everything right
now from the command line so normally I
would just go to the pull request and I
would scroll down here and I would just
click on merge because and this would
merge that pull cross in fact i've read
a comment thank you so much i am going
to merge merge this and what's wonderful
about using github as a service which is
very different than the get software
itself the version control software is
that it provides a visual interface to a
lot of the common things that you might
want to do like merging and looking at
the differences between two files and
that sort of thing but I think while I'm
here if you can tolerate continue to
watch this video however I am going to
demonstrate demonstrate merging from the
command line for fun so stay tuned I'm
gonna add that comment so I added that
comment and now I'm gonna return to the
command line now I should say that I
something about the way I really need to
make a video about setting up terminal
or whatever you use as your terminal
application to work with get more
effectively because there's no reason
why I couldn't see things being syntax
highlighted or showing me what branch
I'm currently on and there's also like
other terminal software like I term that
I could use so I've got to come back for
that but right now I'm just gonna say I
got I got it I don't even remember where
I am so I'm gonna say git status and I'm
gonna say okay all conflicts fixed but
you were still merging so um because I
didn't actually ultimately commit that
merge that I did so I'm gonna say git
commit now here's the thing I have
learned recently that you know you
really that using - M is not as
thoughtful or so I'm gonna do a video
about how do not use - M and write more
thoughtful longer commit messages but
for lack of the time right now I'm just
gonna say commit - M
and I'm gonna say merging changes from
and I'm gonna want to remember keygen em
from keygen em ok I'm gonna do that so
now I'm going to say get status again
okay on branch graphics so now I'm going
to go to master and what I'm gonna do is
I'm going to say git merge graphics and
what that will do is we'll take the
graphics branch and merge it into master
it's exactly the same thing that would
happen if I press this button here which
would merge Kegan em graphics into
master I'm just gonna do that from the
command line git merge graphics okay
here we go I'm getting some good
feedback in the chat of other things to
mention yeah okay it's merged and now I
can say get status I'm gonna say get
status again I type git status all the
time I'm on branch master nothing to
commit working directory clean alright
so now let me put these changes back
right there here on master but they are
not here if I go here we'll see like
what's the latest commit it's still
something else that I was working on so
I'm gonna now say git push I'm not gonna
say which and I'm not going to say weird
you know not to say origin because I
renamed it to github master and if I do
that now I have sent that up I'm going
to hit refresh here and I'm going to see
look all of those changes from keygen em
are now here we can see they're here
background version 3 this was me merging
this was gonna be correcting the mistake
this was some other stuff some other
stuff we can see all of that is here now
the real question is by going to pull
requests look at this where does that
pull request it's not there anymore
github was smart enough to realize that
I mer
this I merge this via the command line
so the merge button is gone and it is
now enclosed wonderful so hopefully you
learned something a little bit about get
remotes and about merging in this video
tutorial thanks for watching and I will
come back and make many more of these
working with git and github open source
tutorial thingies thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
