what I did previously which is drawing a
kind of graph of the volume of song and
instead of drawing the volume of the
song the amplitude of the song across
all frequencies I'm going to use an
object in p5 called the FFT object to
analyze the sound in a way that I can
get the amplitude for low frequency
sound for high frequency sound in that
sense I might see a different graph
based on a different graph if it were
somebody whistling and there were high
pitch sounds versus somebody speaking in
a very deep voice or something like that
so we'll see what happens once I start
to use that let me pause the music for a
second now so in p5 the object that I'm
interested is this p5 FFT object so we
used p5 dot amplitude to get the current
volume of a sound p5 FFT analyzes the
sound returned the results from the
frequency spectrum or time domain what
are those things the frequency spectrum
the time to paint anyway so the issue is
here there's raw data coming in from an
mp3 file a microphone whatever and that
raw data has to be processed and
analyzed through an algorithm to pull
things that we care about out of it one
methodology for doing this is called FFT
so if I go to the Wikipedia page you can
read a lot more about it fast Fourier
transform I'm not going to write this
algorithm from scratch or create the
engine that does the FFT analysis
luckily for us p5 sound made by Jason
Segel which is built on top of the Web
Audio API has this built into it and so
the idea is that what it does is it
takes the sound and chops it up well
that's not really right but let me let
me come over here for a second to see if
we can think about this so if this is me
analyzing the sound the amplitude
amplitude object gives me a single value
volume
and I might be able to get I probably
with the attitude object I could get
sort of like left and right channel like
if it was stereo sound what's the
amplitude of the left versus the right
channel so maybe I could get two but
with FFT what I can actually get is
something that looks we can and will
make this like a graphic equalizer in
other words what is the amplitude at
different frequency levels and I can
request the FFT algorithm to give me the
aquarius resolution so to speak so I can
ask for 256 bands so frequencies with a
level of detail of 256 or 512 or
whatever generally the sort of standard
here are these powers of 2 so to speak
but I encourage you to try to put some
resources in the in this video's
description with more about FFT stuff
and how it works but for right now let's
actually just try to make it work so
what one thing I want to do is I want to
change this amplitude object to be an
FFT object and then I want to say
instead of making a new p5 amplitude
object I want to make a new PV p5 FFT
object let's go to the reference and
click on FFT and let's look at what's
what the functions are so I can wave for
but look at waveform later but analyze
computes the amplitude values along the
frequency domain the array indices gives
me an array and those indices correspond
to specific frequencies lowest to
highest okay so let's just say we can
look here actually one of the things
that I think I need to do or maybe it
does it by default let's just see okay
so I'm going to say analyze so what I'm
going to do here in draw now let's let's
let's get rid of the circular stuff
maybe we can come back to that in a
second I'm going to simplify a lot here
I want to instead of asking an amplitude
object to give me a level I'm going to
call this variable spectrum and I'm
going to say amplitude analyze and sorry
FFT analyze and now I'm just going to
say console.log spectrum so let's take a
look at what we're getting in the
but cannot read property analyze of
undefined so I've got it issue here bar
FFT oops
FFT equals new p5 FFT and now analyze ok
let's try that again so we can see here
that what I'm getting is this array now
how big is that array that array is
spectrum oops let's look at this length
of that array it is 1024 so by default I
get 1024 frequency bands I believe if I
give it an argument like 512 no
smoothing bins ah so as smoothing is so
it takes two arguments the length of
this first argument these are optional
is a smoothing amount so we'll play with
that later
I guess let's try doing it oh and I can
do set input analyze get energy let's
see get centroid smooth smooth FFT
analysis by averaging with the last
analysis frame wow that's so wonderful
it it does that for you so let's try
saying zero smoothing and 512 bands and
let's go here great so now you can see
I'm getting 512 the reason why I wanted
to do that is because let's get 256 you
know I just want to kind of I'm going to
make my canvass 256 by 256 now so what I
want is to have a one pixel per band
which is going to be a quick way of kind
of drawing the result here so what I'm
going to do now and pause that music is
I'm going to loop through that array I
goes from 0 to the length of the array
and a given amplitude at any given time
is spectrum index I and now the Y value
I want to map that which goes between 0
and 1 from height to 0 so I can now say
a once again I can draw a line from the
bottom of the window
oh I comma height to I comma Y and now
what we have here and if I say stroke
255 right I want to draw a line for each
one of these bands and we should see now
hmm so I didn't do something very well
here so what are not interesting let's
look at what are the values what is
there so I'm wrong about the range the
range is not between 0 and 1 clearly
let's look at that spectrum array again
so it looks like the range that it's
actually giving me back is maybe between
0 and 255 that's just kind of a guess
it's probably in the documentation so
let me fix that range and we can say 256
kind of as the top there we go so now
what we're seeing here is this kind of
frequency analysis and you can see the
lower frequency sounds are much higher
than the high frequency sounds let's
change the song to a this dot and we can
see if there's like a pretty different
quality as always I always forget the
dis stop this stop this stop yeah you
can see there's many more with these
with the percussion in the background
and you can start to see how you could
do more sophisticated analysis because
if you can measure the amplitude of say
a certain high frequency sound you might
be able to do some beat detection to
kind of determine when are those kind of
high frequency drum beats happening and
in that sense the the noise from my
voice or whatever is singing or
something else won't affect that ok so
this is the basics of graphic FFT
analysis let's just make it let's reduce
the number of let's make it look a
little more like a graphic equalizer
we'll give it some rainbow colors and
kind of reduce the number of bands ok so
what I'm going to do here is I'm going
to change it to give it a 64 and so I
also
want to have a variable now which I'm
going to call W which is what's the
width of each band and that that W
whoops that W would be equal to the
width of the window divided by the total
number of bands or 64 and I could
probably make that in a variable so now
what I want to do is have I in oh I want
to draw the bands at so now if I do this
right there's only that many bands only
64 so what I want to do is draw it at I
times W and you can see now these lines
are spaced out and I could also now make
this a rectangle instead so the
rectangle starts at I x wy and I times W
and and it's it's height is whatever
height minus y then I would think as
always I always forget the dis stock
this stuff okay its width is W sorry
that's kind of an interesting effect so
you can see I'm drawing them as
rectangular bands and now certainly I
could give them a fill and I could say
fill you know I 255 255 and I could make
the color mode HSB and now you can see
you know and I could obviously expand
and map the colors differently but you
can see the idea here now I could I
could make W you know - tulips I could
have W equal that you know minus 2 or
something so there's a little spacing in
between them as always I always forget
to dis whoops no no no the dub W should
remain the same but when I actually go
to draw the rectangle its width should
be a little bit less and maybe what I
want to say is no stroke but I should
never get into like visually doing
anything because I have no visual talent
so you get the idea oh let's add the
smoothing so let's see what happens if
we add the smoothing so remember that
you can do this thing you can give you
can actually smooth these values let's
give it point five see what that looks
like always I always forget this stop it
stop it stop this duck I can't tell
what's going on here let's make that one
as always I always forget to do this
stuff let's dock is 0.9 as always I
always forget yeah okay so you can see
this smoothing now what it's doing is
it's taking each frequency and averaging
it with the value before so you get this
quality of sorts smoother values and as
a set as an amplitude gets higher
instead of jumping the wrestling of that
value it's kind of interpolating to that
value we could have programmed this
ourself using similar function what's
interesting about this is another idea I
have going back and find I've got this
like Perlin noise terrain video what if
you were to take FFT values and map
those to the sort of terrain and the
sort of three-dimensional space some
type of landscape that could be an
optional thing to try okay um people in
the chat are requesting the circle so
why not write let's do the circle you
could stop watching this video if you
don't want to see it anymore so what I'm
going to do is first of all let me just
ask for 360 bands let's make the canvas
360 yeah so one thing it will not the
value provided is not a power of two so
this is going to make doing the this is
going to make the circular thing a
little bit trickier but not really that
much not that tricky so let's let's make
this happen
let's so let's first
I always forget okay so the first thing
I need to do here is translate to the
center we saw this translate to the
center now I want to have a radius R
equal to map that amplitude which goes
from 0 to 256 to something like 0 to R
let's let's give it a minute 40 to 200
ok so then I'm going to use a line here
I'm going to say I let's actually just
begin shape in n shape the same way we
did that before could there's going to
be there's some things I could do that
OB let's let's get it working the way I
had before and I'll show you some other
things you could do in a slightly
different way so what I'm going to do
now say VAR x equals R times cosine of
that angle bar y equals R times sine of
that angle being I at this point let's
angle mode is already set to degrees and
then I'm going to say vertex X comma Y
so let's see what we get
now line 58 unexpected token so I think
I have somehow I haven't astray bracket
there we can get rid of this stuff is
unnecessary now and I'm going to run it
again oh I did something crazy huh well
this is an interesting effect so let's
go look what's wrong here oh let's I
don't need this W thing anymore what am
I missing here I don't evolve so much
extra stuff there we go ok I don't know
what I had wrong so you can see ah so I
just don't have the full 360 degrees yet
so how do I deal with that so if I'm
getting say 256 bands but there's 360
degrees what I actually want this angle
to be angle equals map I which goes from
0 to spectrum dot length from 0 to 360
pretty easy enough and then instead of I
I can use angle here and
now we can do this again as always I
always forget that this stop this stuff
okay
angles as always I always forget that
this stock this stock it's not oh oh
yeah so there's just not a lot of
high-frequency sounds and the
low-frequency sound is really loud so my
mapping is a little bit off that's
always there now you can sort of see
what's going on here and we can uh we
can kind of mess with this a little bit
remember I had that fill in there why
not just add that here let's see if it
if I fill per vertex I should be able to
fill it per vertex I don't have a stroke
but anyway I'll let you guys kind of
mess around with that you know I could
rotate lines around it let's let me make
it different colors also say every
height has a certain color and you can
map the song two dimensionally so I
really should stop this but I can't help
myself so one thing I want to do is
actually what I want to do is draw a
line I'm going to instead of saying the
ginn shape and shape I could use rotate
but since I've already done the
calculation I'm going to draw a line
from the center to that X Y and what
I'll do is I'll say a stroke I 255 255
and now as always yes it's really much
slower so you can see um it's slow
because that's a lot of lines to draw am
getting a nice um so I guess what I
probably want to do is reduce the number
of bands as always everyone forget you
can see it's running more smoothly now
anyway I could play with the color in a
different way I could use rotate and
have these be rectangles
I could think about the mappings I could
have it spin I could connect it there's
all sorts of possibilities here but I'm
kind of showing you a range
so hopefully you enjoyed this and got
something out of it you know obviously I
would hope that you watching this could
come up with sort of more creep I won't
say more creative ideas or your own take
on what it means to visualize the FFT
spectrum array from a sound file okay
and I'll see you in a future video I'm
gonna do a few more videos that'll be
next to this playlist and I don't know
what it's going to be of them yet but
yeah if you're watching this now and the
videos already there that you know you
know before I do although because you're
in the future or I'm in the present past
something like that goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
