watching that I have a new audio thing
going on so I have no idea if the audio
is good media hooker terrible excellent
so I don't know if anyone joins and this
thing starts did I actually start I
think that I started I can see myself
over here I have a new separate screen
to watch the chat there's nobody
watching so I have to wait to see oh I
can see the audio level going super high
so one thing I might do is bring it down
a little bit sensitivity test test test
test that might be better I'm gonna keep
an eye on the chat here I can actually
listen to my own audio but that's gonna
it's not terrible okay
there's nobody watching but this will
get recorded I am here to look at the
processing 3 debugger I am going to make
a video about all the new features in
processing 3 eventually but right now I
just want to focus on the debugger so
and actually I'm gonna record this video
I mean it's work this is recording but
I'm sort of getting ready and then I'm
gonna hit record a certain point that'll
be kind of the archived version ok I see
that somebody one person is watching
tell me if the audio sounds ok if you're
actually there so let's take a look at
what I've got here I'm trying to make a
sketch that I think might be a good one
to demonstrate the debugger let me
let's look let me add a Y variable let
me make this little shrink this a little
bit have X start at 100 maybe I should
actually just make this a little bit
wider and a little taller x equals x and
let's just have y equals y plus speed
and then I'm going to add
boy what am i what's going on here
because I have all these I'm gonna take
out the comments I'm gonna have of
gravity variable and I'm gonna say speed
equals speed plus gravity so I'm just
creating a very and I'm just gonna test
the bottom if Y is greater than height
speed equals speed times negative one
and draw the circle XY so I just want to
create a very simple bouncing ball
because I think this might be a good way
to demonstrate the debugger so it's
working
okay well all right so I think let me
just sort of like work this out a little
bit and then I'll start recording I have
a little bit of time how's the audio
anybody there listening how's the audio
okay I did okay so um let me see now
okay so the processing debugger this is
new look at this this little icon right
here will enable the debugger and let's
let me create the problem first so let
me make gravity a little bit more
extreme I'll have Y start at 50 and one
of the things oh an X can be in the
middle so one of the things that you
want to do with a bouncing ball
sometimes is have have the ball the
circle when it reaches the bottom lose a
little bit of speed so if it loses a
little bit of speed it'll appear more
like an elastic thing that loses some
you know speed each time it hits it'll
slowly down up up up up up up so let's
look at this and I'm gonna change this
to zero point eight and see what happens
oh look see it immediately got stuck and
it's like flickering over there
yes that's the problem that I want to
demonstrate so have the chat open okay
so this is what I'm gonna do I'm gonna
start over at a certain point okay so
that's it's stuck so how do we figure
out what's going on so one thing that we
can do with the debugger
is look at variable values so if I
enable the debugger first of all you'll
see a new pane comes up this is I would
say the variable inspector pane so
normally what I might do without the
debugger and I'm gonna disable the
debuggers I might say something like
print line Y and if I run this I can see
like okay well there's some stuff going
on here that's what's happening with Y
maybe that's gonna help me deduce the
problem you know what I think maybe I'm
just gonna actually start recording this
video I'm gonna go back I feel like
unknown we keep going through this so
that's so let me cuz I need to figure
out where I'm gonna add a breakpoint so
but I don't want to the debugger is
going to allow me to have a more
sophisticated way of looking at variable
values and actually pausing the sketch
while it's running looking at some
variable values telling it to continue
telling it to advance line by line so
what I'm going to do here is I'm going
to add a breakpoint right here let's see
if that works so first I have to enable
the debugger I have my variable
inspector let me see let me stop this
let me make this shrink this close this
put the variable inspector down here I
just don't see if I can fit everything
onto the screen run the sketch all right
let's make the let's make this very fun
Specter a little bit smaller and move it
down here okay so it's stuck okay all
right I think I'm a little bit closer
now to what I'm attempting to do so
let's see if I add the breakpoint here
then I hit debug it stops there and I
can see X is 200 and Y is 51 and it
hasn't drawn the ellipse yet so what I
want to do is do continue and you're
gonna have to hit continue a whole lot
of times and okay this is gonna work
when it gets to the bottom you can see
it's stuck so I can do is try step now
step so I think this is gonna help me
deduce the problem okay so okay so I'm
just sort of working out some things I
got an example a thing gets stuck we're
gonna like fix the problem we're gonna
look at the debugger so I'm going to
close these panes Oh women hit stop I'm
gonna change this back to negative one
I'm gonna hit run whoops I'm gonna take
out that debugger I'm gonna hope so I'm
gonna enable the debugger I'm going to
take out this breakpoint stop take out
this breakpoint save get rid of the
debugger okay and here we go okay I am
ready to make this video about the
debugger anybody have any questions
comments feedback well two of you
watching it I had like 15 I was very
exciting okay so I'm gonna practice or
I'm just gonna make this video now about
the debugger and hopefully it's gonna go
well I'm just coming over here to have
some water I've got like 20 minutes
I really hope and somebody tell me if
the audio is okay I'm just gonna have to
assume it's okay it looks like the
levels are reasonable over there they're
coming up kind of high maybe I should
move it up a little bit sensitivity test
test test test test okay I think it's
good okay
okay so now I'm gonna start actually
recording I mean this is a YouTube will
archive this whole mess but I'm going to
actually record now and I'm gonna I'm
gonna move this plugged here and I'll be
ready to go okay
hello this is the first in what I hope
to be several different kinds of videos
about some of the new features in
processing 3 I'm working on a kind of
overview video that will go through kind
of a list of everything new and and
things that have changed in processing 3
but in this video I want to look in
particular at the processing 3 debugger
which is a brand new feature in
processing 3 it's very exciting I have
really actually to be honest I've never
really used a debugger I'm kind of a
print line kind of guy which will talk
about what the difference in how you
sort of debug so well howdee bugging and
all of that is a tremendously large
topic and I will I have some ideas for
some resources that maybe I can link in
the description in this video too but
here I want to just look at how the
processing 3 debugger works let me start
this video over because I rambled for
too much ok here we go again
oh it's audio ok somebody somebody new
there's a chat here if you're watching
those ok hello my name is Dan Shipman
and I am here to talk about the
processing 3 debugger now there's a lot
of things that are new in processing 3
and I'll be making another video at some
point very soon that gives an overview
of all the new things but here I just
want to look at the debugger so what is
it debugger for this is not an unusual
thing you're writing some code it's not
working properly you can't figure out
what's wrong
you've got to diagnose that problem
there's lots of different strategies in
fact a good strategy is just take a
break for a while or go talk to somebody
else about a different subject and let
your mind rest a little bit but if you
need to dig into the code itself the
debugger is a nice tool to help you see
what's going on and has several
different kinds of features that I want
to demonstrate now so first let's I have
a prepared sketch here I'm gonna run it
this is the kind of classic bouncing
ball sketch there's
a single ellipse on the screen and as an
x and y variable has a speed variable
and gravity is changing speed speed is
changing the y location so this is
working fine but I have this I have this
fake pretend idea for this sketch where
I'm gonna go down and say you know what
I would like to happen is when this ball
reaches the bottom instead of
multiplying speed by negative one I want
to lose a bit of speed I want to
multiply it by point nine five nine
seven point nine point eight let's make
it point eight right now so the effect
that I'm looking for is bounce bounce
bounce
lose a little bit of balance each time
and settle down onto the ground like a
real elastic ball might do so let's
quickly run this sketch we can see the
results it's immediately stuck at the
bottom so why did it get stuck at the
bottom okay so I already know the answer
look through this a minute to go but
this is kind of a classic problem and
you might you might already be aware of
the internet what I want to look at is
how can the processing debugger help you
solve this problem
so without the debugger one of the
things that you might do is say okay
well clearly the Y position is doing
something weird let me add a print line
statement right here and I can see every
cycle through draw I can see what the
y-value is and this comes out in the
console and we can sort of maybe see
what's going on now this might be enough
because I can kind of see what's going
on already we got this number that's 300
and then sort of getting stuck like
what's going on here so let's take a
look more closely at the debugger that's
what I'm here for the debugger so the
core feature first of all okay so to
enable the debugger there's two ways
there's the debug menu here enable
debugger you could just click right
there another nicer way that I really
enjoy is this nice beautiful little
insect icon so if you click that icon
you'll notice a couple things one the
menu changes up here there are four
different buttons or used to just be to
play run stop run stop now there are
four I have to go through what those are
there is a variable inspector right here
another pane that shows you what are the
current variables of the sketch X wide
speed gravity and what are their current
values now it's actually I just realized
it's showing some historical values for
the last time and the debugger because I
was
just testing this before we started if
you use the debugger for the first time
of the sketch this will be blank until
you actually pause the sketch at a
breakpoint which is the next sort of
thing that I want to talk about so the
core feature of the debugger is it's all
about setting breakpoints breakpoints
our lines are set at lines of code where
you want to pause the sketch and
investigate what's going on so for
example let's say right here at this
line of code I want to pause the sketch
right before I do this test is y greater
than height so what up to set a
breakpoint I can there's I can select
this toggle breakpoint option I can also
I believe right-click or no I can click
on the line number yep so I can actually
click on the line number and you can see
very very closely there that the icon
changes from the line number to this
kind of greater than less than a
sequence so that is setting a breakpoint
and of course another way to set a
breakpoint is just with the command B
shortcut so all of those will work so
I've now set a breakpoint there when you
set a breakpoint and hit run which is no
longer run by the way you can see that
this is this button is now debug if I
hit debug the sketch goes and it pauses
right there at the breakpoint the sketch
is actually stopped and I can see what
are the current values of the variables
and this makes sense X is 200 Y is 51
speed is 1.3 and gravity is 0.3 this
makes a lot of sense because this is the
first time through draw so Y has gone up
by 150 plus 1 speed has gone up by point
3 1 plus 0.3 so these variable values
make sense I can also go into this
folder here this folder is going to show
me all of the built-in variables of
processing where is the mouse previous
Mouse key key code framerate so you can
see there's a lot of things here that
you can look at and just through this
interface which is often easier than
just printing out like gobbledygook on
the console here ok so now that we've
looked at what it means to be able to
inspect those variable values what are
what are what what could I do next
the code is paused right here at this
breakpoint so there are a couple options
and you can see these options here
they're two the two core options and
I'll talk about some of the other ones
are step and continues step and continue
what continue we'll do we'll keep
running the code all the way until the
next breakpoint what step we'll do is
we'll just advance line by line through
the code so you can walk through the
code line by line and watch in the
variable inspector how those variables
change which can help you diagnose what
a problem is so what I'm gonna do first
however is the problem hasn't really
occurred yet is I'm just gonna hit
continue I'm gonna hit continue a whole
bunch of times
it's pausing every time through draw and
you can see I'm getting close to the
bottom and once I get to the bottom here
as I hit continue you can see it's kind
of stuck so what's going on let's look
at this variable let's look at the
inspector more closely 303 and speed is
negative 0.9 so oops I I need to hit
continue sorry which is over here then
set 304 303 304 so I can see that it's
actually above 300 why is it above 300
it went off the screen greater than
height it turned around but it never
made it back less than 300 so then speed
inverts again right that speed look at
that speed variable as I hit continue I
probably should have figure out a way to
make this let me move this up here so I
can zoom in here look at that speed
variable it's going back from negative
to positive negative positive getting
slow smaller and smaller and Y is still
greater than 300 so what's the problem
it's stuck off the window so this is my
slightly awkward way of trying to
diagnose this problem using the debugger
I can now see that the solution is if I
just Reece much it back up to height
before I reverse its speed it won't get
stuck and I can off the screen I can
remove the debugger I can run it again
and I'm done there's no more problems
okay so let's look at some of the other
features while we're here I'm gonna
re-enabled a debugger we we saw that
when I hit debug it runs and pauses when
I hit continue
it's just advancing until the next
breakpoint which happens to be just this
one singular breakpoint so if I were to
add
to break points add another one and I
hit stop and I'm gonna debug again we're
at the first breakpoint continue goes to
the next breakpoint so you can see I'm
jumping back and forth between these two
breakpoints now if I want instead of
continue going to the next breakpoint I
can use this step function what the step
function will do is watch this go to the
next line of the code go to the next
line of code go to the next line of code
or the next line of code so this is
actually advanced like line by line by
line which can be incredibly useful to
look at and watch what the variables are
doing and keep the sketch pause and then
at some other point you can just hit
continue again to go back to let it run
run again so there are the if so this is
these are the core features of the
debugger the if you look in the debug
menu you'll see that in addition to
continue in step
there's step into and step out now these
are much more rarely needed but they are
there and they do provide a certain kind
of purpose one thing you'll notice here
is that I'm kind of just looking at
everything inside of the draw functions
just a linear list of code there's no
objects there's no classes I'm not
calling other functions so one thing
that the this step function does is the
step function just steps line by line
through the current scope the current
function that you're at so if I were to
write a function like void you know
print I'm just gonna say void like a
crazy thing and in this function I'm
just gonna say print line hi right if I
put if I call that function here and I
stop and re hit debug again and then I
you do step step step step
see how I step right past that crazy
thing I didn't start stepping through
the lines of code that are in this
function so if I want to go into that
function and continue to step and I'm
gonna hit continue I think I can do this
step step and then now I want to do step
into which you can see now where's the
debugger it's into this function if I
want
go back to that calling area debug and
step out so now I'm back up here so it's
a little bit tricky once you have
function calls to other functions
whether you want to step over them
step into the hem or step out of them so
step by default will always just step
through the current function scope and
step into will go into the function that
you're calling but it has to be a
function that you wrote right if the
function is ellipse you can't step into
that function because that's part of the
processing core library it's not in your
code to step into so I I'm sure I've
left some things out hopefully this is a
basic introduction it's about 10 minutes
long let's see let's give this put this
video out there give it a try and I can
always rerecord it with a better example
or some other answer some questions or
making like follow-up video to this if I
need to okay thanks very much and enjoy
processing 3 oh here's where I stopped
the video good bye okay was there
anybody watching hi for those of you who
are watching was the how is the audio is
that okay oh did the stream stop oh no
this computer just went offline okay
shoot
uh-huh Wi-Fi is terrible here so I'm
gonna pull up here sorry everybody
I don't know if anyone's still there
watching this stream if I go to YouTube
hold on YouTube live dashboard maybe
this will get me to where I'm going this
stream is offline oops
no it's there Oh hold on how do I get my
event live control room if you want to
watch page okay hi okay oh good the
sound was good good everybody so I think
that I don't have any questions about
the debugger that kind of concludes my
discussion of it I just did it in one
try I'm sure
been better thanks for commenting and
yes I'm gonna turn this off unless
anybody has any last questions or
comments I'm kind of keeping an eye on
the chat all four of you you can see
your chat messages there oh sure go
ahead ask the question doesn't have to
be about the debugger that's what this
is for
I mean I'm happy to hang out here for
another half an hour answer questions
about processing you need to get this
machine back on the internet while I
wait for the question
network
it's terrible how the Wotton nyu Wi-Fi
doesn't work I had a whole plan for this
second screen where I could have the
chat on the second screen not on this
screen which is a screen you're seeing
but NYU Wi-Fi just keeps cutting out so
I think I need both of these machines
that gets plugged into the Ethernet
network yeah it's a little bit insane
okay frame rate so the question is asked
frame rate how does it affect drawing
and changing a variable numbers that is
the one thing that has never been fully
clear to me okay so let's take a look at
this question and then I'll come back
and so this is a great question I'm
gonna turn the debugger off and I'm
gonna run this code again this is now
working it's this bouncing ball so let's
say you're looking at this and you feel
like okay it's it's going too fast
that's bouncing up and down it's is this
is no good
I wanted you want it to run slower so
you P weights think okay well I can
control the framerate that'll that'll
make it run slower and by the way I just
want to change this to like 0.95 let's
run it again so we can see it's nice
fluid seamless animation you want it to
run slower you could say okay I'm gonna
change the frame rate to ten and by the
way we don't need this print line
anymore so changing the frame rate from
it's the default processing by default
attempts to run at 60 frames per second
changing the frame rate you can see okay
it's moving slower but there's a couple
of issues number one is you can see I
don't know how much you can see this on
this video recording but there's a bit
of a staccato to it it's sort of
stepping through and the sort of
fluidness of the animation is lost so
that's problem number one problem number
two is what if you had two of these and
you want one to be moving more slowly
and one to be moving more quickly so
affecting the global frame rate is
generally never a particularly great
idea and what you want to do is let
processing try to let processing run as
fast as it can at 60 frames per second
and control the speed of things through
math so in this case when easy way I
could control the you know the speed is
starting at 1 but what's really
affecting how fast the thing is moving
is this gravity variable that's
accumulating in speed so so if I wanted
it to kind of
go more slowly one thing I could do is
change this from point 3 to point 1 for
example and you can see now there's a
slightly slower bounce to it and if I
had another one I could have different
variables and there's a lot more to this
I could you know have a dampening effect
and add other variables but this is the
basic essential idea I don't know if I
answered the question let me this is why
I need to chat up so you can let me know
if I answered that question or ask any
other questions I'm gonna try to get
this computer also back oh I think I'm
back on the Internet
oh yeah I am on the internet I think
ridiculous goes on it goes off I should
just log into when I do this I should
love and why you guessed never you did
thank you yeah there's a delay for 30
seconds this is something I would like
to really work out I wish that wasn't
the case any last questions before I
shut this off for the day I'm gonna try
I'm enjoying doing these live streams
and there's very few people tuning in
wait I don't know just behind him but
spread the word or or connect to me on
like I guess Twitter or whatever maybe
there's certain times of day we can get
people on just asking questions yes and
I'm going to be doing more videos on
both processing and p5.js and they're
all - here I put them on Vimeo and
YouTube which I sort of like a weird
thing to do but I put ads here on
YouTube to see if that generates
anything but it doesn't really it's very
little so you can watch it on Vimeo
without the ass before okay I'm gonna
wait the 30 seconds now to see if there
any last questions
so I will come back and do more of these
and I'm gonna post the video they're
sort of edited it's not edited but it's
just sort of a section of this which is
actually about the debugger okay oh wait
where do I hit stop so to hit stop they
go to the live control room and I'm
gonna click this button stop streaming
goodbye and yeah I think you'd still
leave comments on this video it'll be
there yes I do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
