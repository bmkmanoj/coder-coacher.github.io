a last piece of the puzzle for doing it
for making a word counting application
in processing and and then kind of talk
about some ideas and some directions to
go in applying this ability this
newfound ability to count words in a
body of text and what types of things we
might do with that so just to start like
this is a you know this is I could
probably stand here for like the next
three hours and show you example after
example extra after example of
visualizations word frequencies in
documents this is a project from 2003 by
Jonathan Harris called word count which
is just looking at the frequency of
words in the English language and we can
see here number one the the most common
word the number two of number three and
and I could scroll through and and look
at different words and I could find a
word like hello and see where that word
ranks the the reason why I'm looking at
this though a this might be the type of
thing as an exercise you find yourself
sorry I mean just get back to the
beginning here the this might be an
something you take as an exercise to
build a visualization of word
frequencies and I'll show you a couple
examples of processing that do this for
you the other thing that I want to point
out here though is in a lot of in text
analysis there's a concept known as stop
words junk words common words these
words that seem meaningless that if
we're trying to figure out you know is
this a positive text a negative text is
this a text by a very conservative
author or a very liberal author what
what might be a by up by what gender is
the author of this text word counting
can unlock a lot of clues to these types
of questions or mysteries in fact and
often there's this concept known as stop
words okay well I need to count all the
words in a text and then these words
that are like really common in
everything these pronouns these junk
words I should just throw them away
because what I want are them the meet
the content words what words like happy
or sad or words that have a look a lot
of meaning to them what's interesting is
that there's been a lot of
recent research and on appoint you to
this book called the secret life of
pronouns the author James Pennebaker
goes through and discussed and discovers
the the the power of actually just
counting the junk words themselves and
there's also if you link here there's a
lot of exercises that you can try and
show you a picture and types of texts
about it and it will count your words
and give you some clue into what you
were feeling or thinking about or what
some personality traits based on what
you wrote so I just want to encourage
you to take a look through some of these
scenarios I'll try to have some more
examples of different visualizations and
different analysis topics this might be
the kind of thing that you think about
doing an experiment around in processing
but before you could do any of this
stuff before you can do some type of
analysis or some sort of visualization
you need to figure out how do I pair a
string of text with a number it's count
okay to start this patent start down
this path let's go back and think about
a data structure a way of storing
information that that hopefully that you
that I that all of us are somewhat
familiar with by the way I'm very
self-conscious about what pronouns don't
read that book if you ever want to just
talk of talk and not just think about am
I saying I are we too much my detached
am I connected okay but I'm gonna put
that aside let's let's let's you and me
I you we whatever let's think about an
array what is an array an array is an
ordered sequence of information an array
of numbers for example might be like 32
91 three thirteen fourteen sixty seven
ninety these could all be counts thirty
two could be the number of times the
word hello appears ninety-one could be
the number of times the word goodbye
appears so maybe we can have another
array with strings in it and the the
strings in that array match up with this
eraser and then that could kind of work
there's there's a nicer way of doing
this these an array is ordered by and
and each element can be referred to by
its index 0 1 2 3 etc but what if I
could name
elements of an array what if I could say
this element is named Dan this element
is named Jean this element is named Joan
etc etc etc what if I could name each
one of these elements and this is
actually quite useful if I were making
an inventory list I want to know like
how many markers do I have I have ten
markers how many pencils do I have I
have three pencils right this is the way
we often store information in like a
database I have this many of this thing
this many of this thing the temperature
on Monday was this Monday stuff 72
degrees Tuesday is 81 degrees there's a
lot of scenarios where we want to pair
strings of text with a value naming the
elements of an array is one way of doing
that and if I could say Dan appears 32
times in a text Jane appears 91 times
Joan appears three times then this type
of data structure an array that instead
of numerical indexes has names would be
very useful and in fact this is a very
common data structure in the life of a
person who works with code and programs
and that sort of thing in Python this is
known as a dictionary it's also
sometimes referred to as a hash or a
hash map and probably lots of other
terms we could come up with to describe
this type of data structure in
processing processing has something
called an int dictionary and in int
dictionary pairs a string with an
integer there's also a float dictionary
which pairs a string with a
floating-point number there's a string
dictionary that pairs a string with
another string so you know name and
address these are useful data structures
for storing information in generic way
so int dictionary is what we can use for
Oh associative array that's another term
for this sort of thing anyway in
dictionary is the perfect thing in
processing to take care of storing words
and their counts how do we use it in
dictionary well it's an object like
anything else
I'm gonna call it words for example is a
new int dictionary so this is just
making an empty int dictionary and then
I can do things like say words dot set
you know hello
250 so now I've set then I've paired the
number 50 with the word hello in this
data structure of 50 and hello are
stored together and I could always ask I
could say words dot get hello much in
the way with an array we would have said
like were if this was you know words
index 2 that gives me the number 3 words
get hello that gives me the number 50
there's also a function which is going
to be very useful in this particular
example which is just words dot
increment so if I say words increment
hello whatever the value of hello is
increase it by 1 and this is the key
piece that that that I'll use that we'll
use oh my god that we'll use to build
this word counting example for every
word in the play Hamlet increment its
value in my--in dictionary look at the
first word incremented look at the
second word incremented and if it's not
there the the prop the integer will know
if it's not there give it its first
value of 1 if it is there increase its
value to 2 the next time piece is value
to 3 so this is exactly the data
structure we can use to do word counting
so let's go and finish this example I'm
going to quit out of the browser and
remember where we were this is where we
last left off every single word one at a
time well now what do I want to do what
I want to do is have an int dictionary
and I'm gonna actually call it
concordance so concordance there's a
term to store a list of all of the words
or tokens in a document and something
about their context
where they are this in some ways someone
similar to the idea of an index and in
our case what we what what I'm in a
store in this particular concordance is
every single word and the number of
times it appears in that document so the
first thing I want to do is make a new
int dictionary then what do I do
let me go through every single word
remember we what did we do in the last
example we took the play Hamlet we
joined it all together we split it up
into an array every single element of
that array has every single element
array is an individual word that appears
in the play Hamlet so what can I do I
could say concordance dot increment
words index I but let's let's actually
let's start in a slightly simpler place
forget about Hamlet for a second if I
say concordance dot increment hello
accordance not increment goodbye and
then let's increment hello two more
times imagine that this is the lot of
we'd not imagine this is the code we're
going to run right now increment hello
increment goodbye increment hello two
times let's let's now look at the
concordance in the console and we can
see what do I have down here I have
whoops I have sorry I have hello three
times and goodbye once so the dictionary
the size is two hello is three times
goodbye is once this works so instead of
doing hard coding all these words and
counting them I just need to go through
every single word in the play Hamlet and
call increment on it so let's come back
whoops and get rid of this and put this
down here and comment this back in
whoops and now let's run this and let's
look in the console look at this most of
the words almost all of the words in
Hamlet appear just once but I can start
scrolling up and we're gonna find like
oh yeah the is a hundred and three
three times so the this is not sort of
of is 576 times so you can see this is
very very easily a very quick way to use
this dictionary data structure to store
all of the the counts of all the words
okay so what are some things that we
might do next so first of all I want to
stop doing this drawing thing which is
making me totally crazy and we don't
need index anymore so now okay so
something what a nice thing that we
could do huh with in dictionaries has a
lot a lot of functions that'll that'll
let us do more stuff well one thing we
can do it we can sort so III I'm this
kind of a key piece of information here
so what is the intention area doing for
us paring a string with a value pairing
a string with a value a term a turn the
terminology that's important here is
this is known as the key it is the key
to unlocking the value and this is the
value so if we want to sort our
dictionary to give us all of the words
in alphabetical order we would sort by
key if we want to sort our dictionary to
give us you know the most infrequently
used words first or the most frequently
used words first we would sort by the
value so keys and values you're gonna
see it if you look at the documentation
and actually let's just go do this
together if I pull up the prop if I pull
up the processing site and look for in
dictionary and look at a lot of the
possible functions here you can see has
a key increment there's a lot of these
functions refer to sort by keys sort by
keys reversed sort by values so being
get it feeling comfortable the idea of
which is the key which is the value of
the key is the string the value is the
number that's something you definitely
want to get used to so let's go and say
concordance sort values reverse
so sort values reverse should hopefully
I spelled that and I did not spell that
correctly short values reverse will sort
by the counts in reverse order meaning
descending order meaning the highest
counts appear first so if I run this and
we look down into the console and kind
of scroll up to the beginning we're
gonna see the most frequently used word
is the that followed by an followed by
of I kept going through this though
we're gonna find though with a capital T
was counted separately those are not the
same string processing is going to
consider strings as case-sensitive so
though the capital T absolutely
different than though with a lowercase T
so something that I'm that I think would
be worth doing with the code here is
saying to lowercase this function to
lowercase takes the string oh boy
tonight this an important detail which I
want to fill in at some point takes the
string and converts it to lowercase so
now what this is doing is any word
that's in that text let's before we put
it into the concordance let's make sure
it's lower straight so we should get
more than just 860 times forth um
because it's now going to be a
combination of the lower case and the
upper case so let's run this one more
time and we can see here the is now 993
times so we can see that now the words
are sorted by their counts here and
that's what we've gotten the console
okay the next step would be to visualize
this information somehow well how would
we possibly visualize this we need to
somehow go through every single word
that is in that dictionary how do we do
that
I think this is right so there is a
function called key array which gives
all of the keys all of the words that
are in that dictionary into an array of
strings the reason why we need that is
there's no we need to look and look
through all of the words in that
dictionary and we need something to loop
through something that's easy to loop
through is it an array so we can ask the
dictionary to give us just give us all
of the keys and once I have all of the
keys I can say and I could say print
line the key followed by and now the
count is using the get function
oops I can get the count down okay so
look at this if I say get on a
dictionary and we give it the key it's
going to pull out the value associated
with that key
whatever that string is give me back
that value and that's in count so if I
were to just say print line all the keys
in there counts and I'm gonna say no
loop so it only does this once we can
now see that I've got everything now
here I now if I scroll somehow if I make
it all the way back up to the top we can
see there we go the I lost some of the
console oh well anyway you could see
that this is a way of iterating through
the entire dictionary and every string
associated with the count I'm getting
very it's very hot in here into these
slides getting very tired so I'm gonna
take a break in a minute do you you
don't really care about this but anyway
okay so so I'm gonna stop here actually
what could I do I'm printing everything
to the consult but I could use the text
function and I could use the count as
the font size that would give me
something very very close to exactly
what we saw with that first word
counting example that we looked at on
the web
and I think what I'm going to do is just
show you all so I'm gonna pull up there
some of these examples are there for you
if I co2 I'm sorry word counting
examples so if I open up this example I
don't remember what text this is using
we can see here a Midsummer Night's
Dream we can see here is kind of showing
us a simple visualization you might try
to create something like this the is the
most common word and is the second most
common word I is the third most common
word another scenario that you might
look at which is kind of interesting to
think about how you would accomplish
something like this you can take a look
at this example this example is doing
the same exact thing but it's actually
animating over the text has it's
counting all the words so for each word
that if those words should be wrapping
to the next oh yeah they are
I forgot that I just zoomed in so so
each word it's sorted and as it's going
through the words are growing based on
its count and the spacing is being
worked out manually so this is something
you could think about doing as well how
could you create a visualization of the
number of times a word appears in the
document how could you make that
visualization animated you know some
other things you might think about or
what what does it mean like what if I
compared this text with another text how
do those words look next to each other
there's a concept known as tf-idf term
frequency inverse document frequency so
let's say I look at Midsummer Night's
Dream and Hamlet they're both probably
going to have the word the in it a lot
but Midsummer Night's Dream is going to
have the word puck in it quite a bit but
that won't be in Hamlet Hamlet will have
the word Hamlet in it quite a bit it
won't be in Midsummer Night's Dream
those are two characters that are in
those plays tf-idf term frequency
inverse document frequency is a means
for looking at words that appear a lot
in one document but not in the other and
this might be a way of determining key
words associated with a piece of text if
you look at all the New York Times
articles what are some words that appear
across all the articles but certain
words
appear a lot only in certain articles
would might give you a clue to the
keywords are sort of automatic way of
tagging those articles with some type of
concept so you know we could go very far
with this then you know I could spend
hours and weeks and video after video of
different word counting and text
analysis scenarios so this is just a
little bit to get you started and I
encourage you to try try some stuff out
look at the examples and we're gonna put
this aside and in the next set of videos
we're gonna start looking at other types
of data sets besides just plain old text
what if the what if we're getting a
numerical data from some from some data
source okay boy this was this video is
16 minutes and 49 seconds long right now
if you're still watching ok</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
