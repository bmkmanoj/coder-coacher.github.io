challenge in this coding challenge I'm
going to program a visualization it
looks just like this now for the
thumbnail and I'm going to do it in
p5.js using javascript in the browser
what's running over here is an example
that I made previously in processing
which will give you a higher performance
so at the end of this video perhaps
we'll take a look at that very briefly
so where I'm not going to start from
scratch this video is really going to be
built on top of this idea of
two-dimensional Perlin noise if two
demential Perlin noise is not familiar
to you stop now go to the video
description and go and find my series
about Perlin noise and then come back
okay hi you're back great ok let's get
started so I'm going to start from this
particular piece of code which generates
this particular output so this is
already an example with two-dimensional
Perlin noise and each pick each each
pixel gets a grayscale value according
to two-dimensional Perlin noise but I
want to do something different what I
want to do is in the kind of grid of
pixels right this is my very very low
resolution grid of pixels instead of
having a grayscale value for each pixel
so to speak what I want to have is a
vector I want to have an arrow pointing
in some direction and I want that
direction to to be a direction set
according to Perlin noise because
ultimately what I'm going to do is I'm
just going to like pour a whole lot of
particles into this area which known as
a flow field this is known as a flow
field and pour the particles in and
they're going to follow the arrows and
we'll see what happens ok so the first
thing that I need to do is start
revising the code to make vectors
instead of pixels so let's take a look
about how let's take a look at how that
might work so I'm going to work with a
very low resolution canvas just 200 by
200 just to kind of get things kind of
started here and one thing that I also
need to think about is a core variable
here is I need to think about what is
the ratio of kind of cell to width so I
don't want to have an arrow for every
pixel it's not going to be it's going to
be unreasonable for me to have 200
instead of maybe a wanted vector every
ten pixels or every 20 pixels so let's
make that a variable called like scale
I'm going to call it SC l short for
scale I'm going to say that's 20 and
then what I but I also need to have is
columns and rows so I'm going to have
the columns is going to be the width
divided by scale and I better floor that
floor something that gets rid of the
decimal place and I'm going to say Rose
is a height divided by scale so now what
I want to do is I'm not dealing with
pixels anymore so I can get rid of load
pixels I can get rid of update pixels
and in fact I can get rid of all this
pixel array stuff but let's just see
that things are working for a second so
what I want to do is have Y now go
through all of the rows and have X go
through all the columns and what I want
to do is draw I'm going to draw a
rectangle I'm going to draw a rectangle
at x times scale I got to scale up Y
times scale and the size of that
rectangle is scale and I'm just going to
give it a random fill for right now and
I want to see that I'm at least getting
a grid of rectangles so if I run this
okay so this is working so this is now
going to be my grid now what I've done
is I put a grayscale value a random
grayscale value in every cell hey why
don't we make that a random note a noise
value just so just to get started here
so let me now change this look I already
have this year already have this noise
function why not let's just make that
fill based on that noise function and
you can see okay so you can see right
now that I'm not really because I'm so
low resolution that these cells aren't
these cells are kind of like very vent
that almost the color is almost
identical so one thing I'll do let's
just try making the scale 10 you can see
let's make the increment a little bit
bigger there we go so now we're starting
to see something that looks a little bit
more like Perlin noise because and and
what do thing I want to do also just
while I'm working on this okay I think
it would be useful to just keep an eye
on the frame rate so I'm gonna do
something a little bit goofy I'm going
to make a variable called F
our let's say fr equals create P so I'm
making a paragraph element on the page
and I'm going to say F our HTML frame
rate and I'm going to floor that so this
is a p5 function that just gives me back
the frame rate I want to just see it as
a paragraph element on the page so you
can see the frame rate I'm right now
everything's fine I'm running really
fast like 60 frames per second so okay
so this is my grid and I essentially
have a grayscale value for every spot on
the grid but that's not what I want what
I want is a vector for every spot on the
grid okay so one thing I could do is
instead of saying fill let's at least
right here create that a create a vector
so what I'm going to do is I will say
VAR v equals create vector now actually
there's actually a function in p5 where
you can create a vector from an angle p5
vector from angle and I'm going to
create a vector from the angle 0 I now I
now have a vector I've created a vector
from an angle and what I want to do
actually is instead of drawing a
rectangle I'm going to say a stroke zero
I'm going to draw that vector as a line
so I'm going to say a push pop there's a
bunch of different ways I could do this
but I'm going to rotate by that vectors
heading and then I'm going to draw a
line from so I'm also I'm going to
translate to x times x scale Y times
scale and then I'm going to draw a line
at that spot but that's a line oh I of
that is sorry from 0 0 to scale 0 so
what am I doing here what I'm doing is
I'm saying for every single one of those
vectors translate to this spot then draw
a line but that's just a line like this
and then rotate it according to rotate a
according to the heading of that random
vector the angle so to speak so now if I
run this you can see look I have a whole
lie whole bunch of lines pointing
directly across now what if I were to
say from angle pi divided by two now I
have a whole lot of lines pointing down
what if I were to say PI divided by six
now I have a whole bunch of lines
pointing that way we're getting
somewhere right you see where I'm
getting at because what I can do now is
I could say what if I have a random
angle between 0 and 2pi oh ok first of
all I should probably clear the
background so you can see now this is
just a random vector for every spot in
that grid every frame so one way I could
stop it from like changing all the time
as I could say a random seed 10 so if I
reset the random seed you can see this
is a whole bunch of random vectors now
ultimately what I want to do is show you
how to make this field of vectors this
flow filled with noise values but I
could I could come up with other ideas I
could use sine waves I could I could get
it data input I could get like wind data
from various geo locations through some
kind of like weather API and there's a
great project which I've shown in other
videos which does that but I'm going to
just use Perlin noise so let's go back
and say the angle is the noise value
times 2 pi right so when I wanted to get
a grayscale value between 0 and 255
I took the noise value times 255 now I
want a random angle I want the noise
value times 2 pi I don't need the random
seed anymore from angle that particular
angle and now you can see there we go so
now I have this nice flow field
essentially of all of these vectors
kind of pointing similarly at each time
i refresh I'm going to get a slightly
different one
now one thing you might notice is that I
don't actually need to calculate this
every time through draw because
ultimately I don't need to calculate
this every time through draw because
ultimately it's staying the same I could
calculate it once and set up and then
refer back to it later however I think
this might be a good time you and me
okay we need to talk meet me over here
at this other camera we need to talk
actually never mind let's talk over here
there is Pearlie noise I've shown you
one dimensional Perla noise though I've
shown you two dimensional Perlin noise I
have yet to show you three dimensional
noise Perla noise and in fact Perla
noise can exist in any n dimensions but
here is an opportunity where we might
decide let's do something with
three-dimensional Perla noise so the
what one dimension is the x-axis another
dimension is the y-axis imagine a Z
dimension as slices these angles change
as slices that I'm just like coming out
of the screen well what if instead of
actually building something visually in
3d that we thought of that third
dimension is time every frame of
animation what if I were to add as a
global variable Z off and set that equal
to 0 and then I were to say noise X off
comma Y off comma Z off
I've now said give me noise values in
three-dimensional space so there's a
noise value right here in
three-dimensional space it's similar to
all the values that surround it and so
I'm looking at a slice of noise values
then I want to present another slice of
noise values they don't want to present
another slice of noise values
so those Z offset change every time
through draw can you hear people
laughing and talking in the background I
don't know if you can and now whoa it's
changing like crazy so I'm moving
through time a little bit too quickly so
let me move like quite a bit slower
and that's when we move even slower so
you can see now I have a flow field
that's actually changing over time and
you can imagine lots that I could do
just with this much but ultimately what
I want to do if you recall and we can
sort of see this crazy sketch now is
like really just like filled over itself
a zillion times but what I'm trying to
do is recreate this particular visual so
what's happening in this particular
visual is that particles are being
dropped on top of this flow field and
following those arrows so this is the
first thing that we need to do now I
just realized we have a bit of a problem
small crisis of conscience here which is
that if I want to drop a particle on
there I need like a whole like physics
engine and to move the particle around
and all that and I kind of want to just
go and grab now let's make it we can do
this really fast this is a coding
challenge I'm going to to add the
particle object from scratch here so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
make a new file I'm going to call it ooh
particle J s and I'm going to use a
JavaScript constructor function and my
particle needs to have a position which
I'm just just make it 0 0 it needs to
have a velocity which is going to be an
0 0 vector and it needs to have an
acceleration I'm going to write an
update function where the position gets
added the velocity and the velocity the
acceleration gets added to the position
if you're confused about how these
physics engine works go and walk all of
my nature of code videos on physics
engines and then I'm also going to reset
the acceleration to zero by multiplying
the vector by zero then I'm going to
write an apply force function which is a
function it receives a force and what do
I want to do with that force I just want
to add it to the acceleration so this is
actually all I need well this
is so easy and then I just needed just a
show function whoops that's I wrote that
incorrectly equals function then I want
to show function which what does it Drew
do it draws the particle so what should
I draw it us let's just draw it as a
point for right now we're going to say
stroke zero point this stop position dot
X this stop position dot Y so this is
nice I have this really simple particle
object it has position velocity
acceleration and has a little update
method to update its velocity based on
acceleration to update its position
based on the velocity and then as an
apply force function to accumulate any
forces into the acceleration so now I
just need to make sure that my
index.html file references that new
particle J s file and let's just very
very quickly make a particle array and
in the particle array I'm going to say
particle index 0 equals a new particle
just but I've lost my train of thought
here a new particle oh yeah new particle
and then I want to say a here particle
index 0 dot a show sorry and dot a
update and let's just see
ok what's missing couldn't find particle
J s because I typed that in wrong I said
particles j s whereas the file is called
particle J s and now particle is not
defined
what's a particles and this is also very
confusing here the array is called
particles there we go so you can see
there's that particle up there in the
corner
so I have one single particle that's
good now what I want to do is add a
whole bunch of particles so let me make
this a for loop
is less than 100 let's add 100 particles
and just say particles index I and then
let's write another for loop iterating
over the entire length of the array and
having each particle okay so now
particle pipes something wrong particles
okay there should be a hundred particles
there let's make sure all the particles
are everywhere let's let's give the
particles random positions to start so
you can see there's 100 particles around
randomly and then just to make sure
they're like doing something let's say P
vector R ep5 vector dot random so this
gives them all a random velocity okay so
the particles are moving around with a
random velocity they're doing something
okay one thing I need to do I just
realize is that I need to have the
particles wrap around when they get to
an edge they should come back on the
screen so I need to let me add that
really quickly so I'm just going to add
a function called edges and I'm going to
say if this dot pause X is greater than
with this dot Paz dot dot dot x equals
zero and I'm going to do this in a kind
of short handy way and I'm going to say
less than zero should equal width and
then I want this again but I want to do
it with Y and I want this to be height
and I want to do this then needs to be Y
and this should also be height so I now
have a new edges function and I can
quickly also say you know wrap them
around the edges here so now we should
see I have a whole lot of particles
moving around forever and ever and ever
and let's not render the vectors for a
second okay
so now I have a window with a lot of
particles moving around but I want those
particles now to be
affected by the actual vectors in the
flow field itself so how do I do that
okay this is that this is the crux of
this project so first thing I want to do
is I want to actually say I'm gonna give
these like quite a bit of alpha so let's
see if so you can see that I can see
it's slowing down quite a bit but I'm
drawing the vectors but you can see the
particles are not moving anywhere
according to the vectors I also just
while we get started I'm going to take
off Z offset to see now this oh whoa
do I not hit save yep
so now I want to make sure this works
with a fixed flow field and with the
particles I also just so we see them a
little bit better I'm going to say
stroke wait for to make them a little
bit thicker okay oh boy but I don't want
my vectors to have that stroke wait so
I'm going to say stroke wait one okay so
now we can see the particles moving and
the flow field kind of behind it so what
I want to do is say for every particles
location look up the vector that's
nearest to it and then apply that as a
force so here's the thing the of all of
the vectors are calculated up here so
what I want to do is actually store all
of those in an array so I'm going to
make a variable called flow field which
is an array and that that array should
have as many spots as there are columns
and rows so now what I want to do is say
flow field equals a new array yeah this
is a weird thing to do in JavaScript but
I'll do it anyway you know you can
actually preset the size of an array by
saying new array and maybe that was a
bit unnecessary but I'm going to do that
anyway and then and then what I'm going
to do here is I actually already have
perfectly the calculation this was left
over from my pixel example this should
be columns and this
should be not be x for anymore because I
don't have RGB values I have a single
single value I can now say flow field
index index equals that particular
vector so now all of these vectors that
I'm calculating are now stored in that
particular array so now what I need to
do down here is say I'm going to say
particles index I and I'm going to write
a function called follow and I'm going
to pass in that flow field so what I'm
doing is I'm saying hey you particles
here's an array of vectors each particle
is responsible for finding the
appropriate vector in that array to look
up so for example just to come back to
this diagram I'm a particle right let me
get by actually it's fine to use I'm a
particle right here my position might be
like 300 by 200 and maybe these are 100
by 200 I need to first divide by scale
to look up the appropriate index into
that array find the vector and then
apply it as a force let's see how that
works so if I go to the particle
function I'm going to write a new
particle object the constructor function
I'm going to write a function called
follow equals a function I'm going to
just call this vectors and now what I'm
going to do is I'm going to say x equals
floor this top position dot X divided by
scale so I need to take remember its
exposition is this actual place on the
screen and but it's corresponding
position in the grid I have to scale
down by that scale variable its y-value
is do that with y then the index is X is
X plus y times columns this is that
formula for how you take a
two-dimensional value into a one
dimensional array
and I cover that in some other videos
which I'll try to link to in this one
and then now I should say the force is
that array of vectors at that index and
I should be able say this dot apply
force that force so now essentially what
I'm doing is I'm saying based on my me
I'm a particle based on my X Y position
scale myself to a grid of column in rows
then look up the corresponding vector in
that one dimensional array and then take
that vector and apply it as a force so
let's now actually have the velocity
start at zero and let's see if this
works and I'm sure I miss something but
let's give it a try oh okay that's kind
of working but you can see excuse me
that they're spiraling out of control in
terms of speed so one thing I should
think about is okay you know I should
think about one thing I should really
think about sorry is what is what is the
magnitude of these vectors so maybe
these vectors I need to set their
magnitude to something much smaller like
0.1 they shouldn't really be that strong
like a full a full a unit full and you
can see that now but you can see there's
still like really speeding up over time
that's because this acceleration is just
building up and pushing and pushing
there's no limits to how fast these
particular vet these particular
particles can go so I think something I
could do here which would make sense
would be to have a like a maximum speed
variable and set that equal to like four
and then in the update function I could
just say this dot velocity dot limit
this maximum speed so now I'm just
saying the particles actually you know
no matter how much you start pushing
them they do have a altima maximum speed
and now we should see that the particles
are following this flow field and you
know maybe they're not following it you
know you know and I could kind of
control what that now I could go back
and I could say well actually maybe I
want the magnitude to be five
and you can see when the magnitude is
five they're going to be lockstep
exactly with the flow field so you can
see what the magnitude of that force is
really controls how exactly are in terms
of following this path and by the way
let's add the Z offset back in so those
vectors change over time and you can see
now what we're kind of getting we've got
these particles following a flow field
but that flow field is changing over
time
reasonably I've still got 30 frames per
second I'm going to do a couple more
things one is let's add some more
particles let's have Z change a little
bit more slowly something like this and
let's see how we're doing
so now I have a lot more particles but
it is running rather slow so one thing I
could do here hopefully to get it to run
quite a bit faster is I can actually
just not bother to draw the vectors the
data for the vectors is still calculated
and exists but I could still I could
skip drawing them and you can see now
I'm getting a nice 60 frames per second
it's really getting stuck at the top and
the bottom that vector force is really
quite strong so I'm trying to I set the
magnitude to 5 let's set it to like 1
and actually I'm going to set it to 0.05
anyway you could play with this year and
I could also one thing that I could
really think about is well do I want the
full maybe I want the vectors actually
to be to have more variety to them
they're all is generally always pointing
to the left because remember I'm picking
random values between 0 and PI and they
cluster around the middle so I'm not
picking random so like I could say times
2 pi times 4 and now I'm going to get a
lot more sort of like noisiness but
there's a lot of different ways and it's
all moving like kind of too fast and I I
should create some sliders and I could
kind of like really control this stuff a
little bit more strongly so you can
think this is kind of this is more when
I was trying to get so I have a sort of
stronger flow field but there's a lot
more variety in terms of where the
particles go now I could add some
separation so they don't get on top of
each other as much but you get the idea
here now what
this I basically have all the way done I
now have this flow field where I can
drop particles in it and I could you
know I could sort of push the
performance here and say like well what
if I try to drop you know 500 particles
in you can see it's running a little bit
slower but I've got more stuff happening
but what if instead of drawing the
particles as dots what if I drew that
what if I allowed them to blend their
alpha to be sort of like alpha blended
across the screen for a while so let me
to kind of create that visualization so
really now one thing if I were you I
would stop this video and just go to
this show function and play make rainbow
colors to add alpha values but let me do
a couple things to try to get that
effect so one thing I'm going to return
the stroke weight back to one and I'm
going to give it quite a bit of alpha
and in the sketch I'm also going to draw
the background now only once in setup so
let's see what we get here with this so
now you can start to see what I'm
getting here I'm getting this kind of
nice alpha blending pattern now if I
were to zoom into this you can see
there's actually like the particles move
faster than one pixel per frame
so they're actually skipping pixels so
something that could actually be quite
useful here would be to have each
particle store at the very least a
previous position which I'm going to say
is a to start with is a copy of its
original position so it when it starts
it has its current position in its
previous position and then every time it
moves right after update it's actually
let's do this every time after we so
what I want to do is actually not draw a
point but I'd want to draw a line from
its current position and I know that
camera just went off because that means
a half an hour has passed to its
previous position
this previous position dot why now if I
whoops ah I'm in the wrong place if I
run this again okay there's a couple
issues number one is oh my goodness what
is going on there's some crazy extra
lines so we have a problem right if I'm
always taking a particle and drawing the
line between its fruit not its position
its previous position when it leaves its
previous position is here its new
position is here suddenly this line goes
all the way across so I want to add an
extra check in here just to correct that
there might be like a better way of
doing this and actually what I could do
is I could just update it in this edges
function which actually let me do that
this is different than how I did in my
other example but what I'm going to do
in this edge is function is I have to
add write if any of these are true what
I need to do is say what I want to say
this stop previous previous position dot
x equals this stop position dot X so I'm
going to I'm going to write a function
this dot update previous is a function
which just does this algorithm in it
whoops X so so any time it hits the edge
I'm going to just update the previous so
this is like an extra time and I need to
make sure I do this then right before I
draw it so I actually want to have edges
right before show so it gets updated and
then what I so this should correct that
problem so now you can see oh look at
that okay so it's actually kind of doing
something interesting
I never update the previous position so
it's actually drawing a line from where
it started to its current position so
let me actually add the most crucial
part here which is that I also want to
every time after I draw it to say this
dot update previous so after I draw it
the previous position comes the current
position and now you can see what this
is doing I'm getting nice continuous
lines actually see those continuous
lines what did I miss here uh hold on i
time out I get a debug okay i back i
didn't actually need to debug anything
it is working so you can see I've
basically gotten the gist by programming
from scratch of this particular example
now there's a bunch of few things that
are different number one is in this
larger version one size I've got kind of
higher resolution going on one thing
that I think you probably would notice
is this is running reasonably at 30
frames per second but if I were to go
back and try to add you know to make
this run over like a much larger canvas
and have something like 2500 particles
you're going to see that right currently
it's running at like 4 or 5 frames per
second whereas this processing version
which I will pull up right now this
processing has 10,000 particles and it's
for whatever reason it's 1200 by 800 now
let's look at let's and actually I'm
going to render this with in the P 2d
renderer which uses OpenGL hardware
acceleration I'm going to print the
frame rate just to the console and take
a look at that
come alive come alive processing so we
can see that this is actually running
over 50 frames per second and once again
again I may point out there are 10,000
particles and I'm that kind of high
resolution whereas here I have you know
only 1500 and then not as high
resolution it's running really really
slow so what I would need to do to like
pull the most performance out of the web
browser would be to probably render this
somehow with WebGL and a kind of
hardware accelerated way which maybe
I'll continue and look at at some point
but hopefully this video gives you the
basic idea and what I would love to see
and I'm just going to let you know what
I'd love to see you do is first I'll
make this like rainbow-colored try
playing with the various parameters try
rendering in a different way see what
kind of quality you can get can you make
you know large scale prints out of it go
and look at the processing version
there's a variety of things that you can
look at and try to expand upon this
maybe you can make a bunch of sliders to
change different parameters and that
sort of thing so I hope you enjoyed this
particular coding challenge it was a
little bit long a little bit scattered
if you liked it like the video say it in
the comments let me know on Twitter at
Schiffman and I look forward to seeing
you in another coding challenge soon
enough thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
