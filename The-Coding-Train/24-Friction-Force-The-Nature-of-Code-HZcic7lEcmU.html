with this video let's just take a moment
to remind ourselves where we are we know
about vectors we know the position or
location of an object can be described
as a vector how it moves over time is
its velocity also a vector how the
velocity changes over time also a vector
called acceleration how do we compute
acceleration force equals mass times
acceleration acceleration equals force
divided by mass so the forces in the
environment get accumulated into an
object's acceleration which then change
its velocity which Jen then changes
location that's where we are so this
begs the question how do we calculate
forces and what we've seen up until now
is just making up numbers let's just
remind ourselves for a second right if
we look at this example oh there's a
force gravity zero comma zero point
three fantastic there's another force
wind point two comma zero these are
forces we've just completely made them
up
however real forces exist in the real
world and have actual formulas that you
could find in textbooks I don't have a
prop to just grab but you find a
textbook open it up and you will find
formulas in it so the goal of this video
is to say take a deep breath and say we
could make up forces and that's
perfectly great we can also try to model
real world forces by looking at the
formula trying to understand the formula
and translating that formula into
practical processing code or whatever
environment you might be choosing to
programming so in this video we're going
to look at two case studies we're going
to look at friction and what we'll call
drag or a fluid or air resistance we're
going to look at these forces that slow
down an object when it's in motion with
friction two surfaces coming in contact
with each other or air resistance you
can think of as something moving through
the air and experiencing a resistance
force from you know I don't know the air
there's stuff there it blocks your way
too badly but anyway okay so let's talk
about friction first so
you're probably watching this in the
summer on a beach somewhere like
drinking up my tie is that a drink I
don't know some sort of glorious fruity
beverage but in New York City where it
is right now he just snowed and this was
a weekend where a lots of kids were out
sledding so let's think about a sledding
scenario just for a moment we have a
hill and we have a sled and a small
child on the sled a little bit too much
information for this web and we have
this object moving with a velocity so
this object has a velocity vector it's
also experiencing a gravitational force
we can say that's the force of gravity
and what we gather what we're here today
to discuss is the fact that this sled is
also experiencing friction the sled is
in contact with the ice or the snow on
those two surfaces in contact there is a
friction force and a friction force
moves is pushes the object in the
opposite direction of its velocity that
makes sense all right a friction is a
force in the opposite direction of the
way that you're moving if I could do the
moonwalk here
I can't there would be some sort of
friction in the opposite direction of
the moonwalk right okay so I can't
believe I just did the moonwalk okay now
there's something else going on in this
video in this video no this is this is a
video this is a diagram in this diagram
something called the normal force so you
might remember Newton's third law which
states for every action there's an equal
and opposite reaction or maybe better
stated as forces always occur in pairs
so just as I am exerting a force down
onto the floor because gravity is
pushing me down fortunately I'm not
going through the floor there is a force
pushing me back up these do forces
acting in pairs so there is also an or
something called a normal force this
would be called the normal which has to
do with the force of gravity of force
kind of keeping the sled from just going
through this hill of snow okay so
there's lots of stuff at play in this
diagram and what I am here to look at
what we're
hear me you whoever just nobody here
it's just me okay what we're here to
look at is what is the formula for the
force of friction it equals negative 1
times something called nu if I wrote
that correctly times the normal force
that is the magnitude of that normal
force so maybe I should by the way did
we ever say this I think we had a video
all about vector magnitude and I never
bothered to mention that in vector
notation this is typically how we write
a vector and when we want to talk about
the length of that vector we sometimes
will write it as the vector with these
vertical lines so the magnitude of the
normal force times the velocity vector
so this is a formula it's not that bad
of a formula but what happens often when
you see a formula is you look at it and
you think yeah just make up the numbers
in processing which is fine but in this
case what we want what we want to do in
this video is say we see am i recording
I'm recording we see this formula and
what we want to do is unpack and find
what are the actual parts of the formula
that we really need can we boil it down
right we if we were doing a really
scientific simulation we would have to
include all of these elements but what I
want to look at now is really what is
friction and can we simplify this
formula because after all what do we
have on the screen like if we want to
apply friction friction to this sketch
there's just this ball bouncing so
where's the normal force where's the
velocity where maybe we can make this a
little bit simpler ok so let's look at
this for in a couple of ways one let's
understand something about how we
calculate forces when we know that a
full a vector okay a force is a vector
we know that a force is a vector so in
our code we're going to have to do
something like say P vector friction
equals and actually that you probably go
down here that's going to be at the end
we're going to do some calculations at
the end we're going to end up with a
vector that is friction but what is a
vector and entity with magnitude and
direction so looking at this formula we
have to ask ourselves what is the
magnitude of friction how big is the
friction force and what is the direction
what is the direction of friction so
from our diagram and how we describe it
we know that friction points in the
opposite direction of velocity friction
doesn't cause you to speed up it's a
force against the way that you're moving
thus the food walk anyway so we're in
this formula is embedded the direction
of friction and ah
I messed something up in the formula
this is why sometimes it's good to like
practice or plan these videos but right
now I'm just kind of I feel very relaxed
this morning we're just kind of going
going slowly we're gonna go more slow
someone mentioned to me that these
videos go a little bit faster try to go
a little more slowly in this one okay
what I meant to write here is the
velocity unit vector the normalized
version of the velocity vector velocity
unit vector and by the way talking about
vector syntax we said that ah this is
how we say the magnitude of a vector V
this is often how we write a unit vector
V V with a carrot on top unit vector a
vector of length one the velocity vector
normalized to length one like I said
that eight times but you know that's me
trying to go a little more slowly okay
so what we're where were we we want to
know the direction so we need to know
the direction of this vector direct
should whatever spelling is not my forte
we need to know the direction of this
vector what is that is that embedded
into this formula somewhere in fact yes
it is it is it is it is in two places
velocity is a vector with a unit vector
with Direction negative one the opposite
direction of velocity so we can see in
that
formula that negative one times the
velocity unit vector that's the objects
that's excuse me the forces Direction so
we're going to get the forces direction
from there and if we think back to our
processing code what could that mean
friction equals velocity dot get can you
can you read that kind of getting up too
high I have to write a lower velocity
got get friction multiply oh forgot a
step friction normalize friction
multiply negative one see so we see this
formula we understand that one of the
things about this formula we need is the
direction of the vector the direction of
the vector is the negative and the
velocity unit vector and now we can
rewrite that in processing code how what
does that mean we say hey give me a copy
of the velocity this is very important
this is something we've referred to
before when we when we when when we're
dealing with vectors right we don't want
the objects actual velocity vector
because if we start manipulating the
object's velocity vector we've messed up
how that object is moving we just want
temporarily we're saying hey excuse me
object I really hate to bother you and
ask you but can I please have a copy of
your velocity vector because I need it
to calculate the force of friction I
don't want to mess with your velocity
just give me a copy of it so we have the
copy of and get a copy of a vector dot
get so we have a copy of the velocity
vector then we normalize it right
because in our formula it's the it's the
unit vector velocity so once we have a
copy of the velocity vector we can
normalize it and then we can multiply it
by negative one so it's moving in the
opposite direction
I was checking to see the time and I
never press the timer so this video is
going on for some amount of time I'm not
sure about it okay so now we have the
direction of friction we have a
normalized vector in the correct
direction now a vector is an entity with
direction and magnitude what do we need
next
magnitude so this is where it gets kind
of interesting what are the components
of this vector the this force of this
formula what are the components of this
formula that give us the frick frictions
magnitude
they are mu and the magnitude of the
normal force okay so someone's trying to
get hit everything's gonna be okay they
went away okay so the magnitude so this
is where things get a little tricky I'm
not really tricky actually this is where
we decide let's not make things tricky
let's make life easy on ourselves the
normal force well there's probably
trigonometry involved here there's a
force pointing down but it's going on a
slope and you know the normal force and
what's the mass of the sled and you know
there's all sorts of questions we could
ask here but we want to live in a simple
world right now we want to live in a
simple world where it's just like this
little ball bouncing you know what's the
normal force the normal force I guess
technically would be like pushing out
from behind the screen against this
circle but there's no screaming the
screen the circle it's just pixels so
what we can really say here is the
normal force which is some component of
the force of gravity and the you know
it's a constant and I have an even
better idea it equals one normal force
in our world normal force always equals
one
now what's mu mu is the coefficient you
can't read that at all of a restaurant
writing the coefficient of friction I
got to get better at this board thing
okay mu is the coefficient of friction
so what might be some different
coefficients of friction well the
coefficient of friction is going to
determine how strong that friction is is
it two blocks of ice is it - is it
sandpaper and you know a textbook is it
Michael Jackson and the movement will
walk like what is the sort of what what
kind of objects are coming into contact
so if there if sandpaper is going to
have a high coefficient of friction
there's a lot of friction going along
sandpaper ice is going to have a very
low coefficient of friction it's very
slippery you can just slide right on it
so we could probably I don't know go out
the field and do some tests and come up
with some numbers but what we are really
doing here in processing is saying
there's going to be a lot of friction or
there's going to be a little friction
the normal force the normal force
effects that to write a really massive
object pushing down a lot and with a big
normal force pushing up it's going to
have more friction than a very light
thing but you know later we'll look at
mass there's all sorts of things we can
we could add to this to make it more
complicated but for right now this is
what we can do with formulas we can
really simplify them we could say these
are constants let's make them up as
constants let's make up a variable
called C let's say it's zero point zero
one that's my coefficient of friction
and then let's say friction dot
multiplied by that coefficient now check
we're done yeah okay we're done we
looked at a diagram we looked at the
formula we figured out what are the
parts of the formula for the direction
velocity in the room yeah normalized in
the other direction what are the
components for the magnitude I had some
constants let's make up a constant to
either have the friction weak or strong
and you know we could control this with
a slider a variable it could change
different objects could have different
coefficients of friction and then we
multiply we scale that vector
accordingly and then what do we do next
apply force so I'm going to now that
we've done this let's look at actually
applying it in our code and I'll give
you an exercise okay here we are over
here so if you recall this particular
example has gravity and wind right and
we're applying gravity always and we're
only applying wind when I click the
mouse now you can see the wind is being
applied so let's let's just change a
couple things one thing is let's just
say let's apply gravity and wind always
and I'm like okay and now we're going to
say let's apply friction so right here
we're going to do everything we did on
the board to apply friction to this
object okay so what do we need to do
first the direction of the vector we did
this already friction equals the movers
velocity get so we've got a copy now of
the object's velocity vector now we want
to normalize it and multiply it by
negative one great and then what do we
do coefficient of friction now this is
so easy zero point one scale it things
are falling apart and then you know what
look at this sorry I don't want to trip
Oh coming right back hello again I
really I'm going so I think I'm going
slowly in this video I feel like
lethargic today
look how we're multiplying by negative
one and then we're multiplying by this
coefficient it's kind of unnecessary
let's just make the coefficient a
negative number
and now we've got M apply force C not C
sorry okay don't this pen cannot sit
over here I have a new podium thing it's
kind of now we're going to apply the
friction force okay so we get the
velocity we normalize it we reverse its
direction and scale it according to some
magnitude and then we apply it if we run
this look friction can you tell if
there's friction kind of hard to tell
right so let's just let's sort of like
look at this and make this a little bit
more let's let's make this a little more
apparent let's only a probably the
friction when we are pressing the mouse
and let's actually let's take out the
wind for a moment and I think also this
is a little bit silly but if I have the
mover start at the top of the screen
okay so there is now our ball that is
falling up and down up and down and now
when I click the mouse we're going to
apply friction let's see not not much of
a change a little change let's make the
friction the nice thing about we've done
is maybe the friction needs to be a lot
stronger and by the way the mover has a
random mass
so let's give it a not so random ass
okay oh and has a random location
let's give it I just want to make it
consistent for a second so we can kind
of look at this should have done this in
advance okay ready and now let's apply
some friction you can see now that
friction is causing it to kind of like
slow down and stop right it's actually
the weird thing about this this is a
terrible demonstration right because
what's really good like this this we
just simulated friction which would be
as if it's like sliding along the the
processing window itself but really what
we should be simulating with something
falling is air resistance so you know
maybe we there's so many tears the thing
what we did in this video and I you know
I got a problem this this could be that
this this isn't the best video I've ever
made I've ever made let's just be honest
here
it's going to do for right now what we
did in this video is we figured out how
to put this friction formula into a
processing sketch now the question is
for you and maybe what you could do as
an exercise is design a scenario where
this could actually make sense what if
you had a think of a gate like a
platform style game where something is
moving along a surface and there
actually would be friction along that
surface maybe it depending on like
different parts of it and encounter
something with friction so let me
actually describe to you what I mean
here so let's just say as an exercise
here's your processing window think of
there being this kind of ground and you
have objects moving along that ground
what if it comes in two different
contact with different patches when it
reaches this patch this is perhaps like
mud or quicksand or sandpaper or
something really rough the rest of this
is like ice over here could you create
this sort of variable friction as
something as moving along so this might
be a nice scenario for you to try to
build with friction and what we're
actually going to do in the next video
is create an appropriate force for
something that's falling we're going to
look at air resistance what air
resistance is very similar to friction
but air fluid resistance but
it's actually a different formula and it
operates differently so that's we're
going to look at in the next video okay
so hopefully this huh no added something
to your life or you didn't just waste
the last type no but for all I know this
has been like 45 minutes but it's
probably more like 10 minutes and see if
you could create this scenario I send me
an email if I haven't made this example
and added it to the nature of code get
repository because I don't have an
example that does this but I think it
would make sense and you know we'll be
in touch
somehow someday you it'll be little
seats here and you can sit probably not
maybe okay I got to press a button to
end this video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
