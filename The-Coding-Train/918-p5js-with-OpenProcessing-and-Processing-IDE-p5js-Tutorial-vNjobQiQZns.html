ways to create p5.js projects other than
the now deprecated out-of-service so to
speak p5 just desktop editor but don't
worry soon when I have more gray hair I
will be here in a video hopefully with
the creator of what's the upcoming p5
just a web editor to show you that and
how you can make p5 just project with
this new editor that's coming out soon
but while I'm here in this video I'm
gonna show you two wonderful projects
made by the processing foundation
community and one is called open
processing so open processing is
actually a p5.js web editor and it's a
project that's been around for a while
created by Sanada Show glue and I
apologize Zenon if I did pronounce your
last name correct
I'm correctly I'm sure we get lots of
comments here about how I botched that
but Zenon originally created open
processing as a way to share processing
sketches which are Java applets and he
recently launched a new design I should
really have seen on come in and present
this sometime on the channel but and so
it's a great way that you could quickly
mock up a p5 just sketch in the browser
and then have it to share so the only
thing that I've done before making this
video is go to open processing org
itself and sign up for an account so I
actually signed up for I already had an
account by signed up for a new one just
for this YouTube channel called coding
train and so once you've signed up for
account and go to your page you can make
a profile and do all that kind of stuff
that I'm sure you can figure out but
really what I'm interested in is the
fact that making a sketch is as easy as
this button create a sketch so let's
make a sketch create a sketch so now I
have a sketch and the fonts a little
small but I can zoom into it for you can
see it's a very simple sketch it just
did an automatic template for me I can
obviously add lots of code and do
different things and I can you know just
to do something I'm going to change the
background to a slightly purplish color
I'm gonna play it to see how it looks
and you can see here's my sketch it's
filling the background with one color
and it's drawing a lot of ellipses I can
how do I get out of this now ah there I
go so I have to go up to the top and
then a little menu appears
and I what I want to do is this button
looks like this button will go back to
the code so now I'm back to the code
this button will go back to the sketch
okay then I can also hit save and then I
can give it a name like coding train and
I am on the youtubes training juju you
interact with the mouse and then I can
do is hit submit and there we go I have
my coding train p5.js sketch and I have
this link which I can send to anybody to
share so that they could see it and use
it as well so that is a really quick way
also to create sketches in the browser
through an online site like open
processing and share those sketches
instantly so that's that's one let me go
I'm just gonna do two in one video
that's what I'm doing so another way
that you can do p5 just sketches is you
can actually go and get processing now
processing is a project that's been
around for since 2001 it's a Java based
platform I do do a lot of videos that
use processing and if you watched my
intro to p5.js that kind of referenced
the relationship between processing and
p5.js their sibling projects part of the
processing foundation so if you go to
processing org and you go to download
you can get to a download page where you
can download the processing desktop
application for your particular
operating system now what this is meant
for you to do is then write processing
code and run desktop applications but it
so happens that Ben Frey and fathom
information design been try being one of
the creators of processing created mode
for the processing editor so let me open
the processing editor here it is so this
is what it looks like it normally would
expect you to write your Java code in
here your processing code and run it and
that sort of thing but over here up in
the top right corner you'll see there's
this little box that says Java and you
notice I can switch to Android and
Python now those won't necessarily be
there by default those are modes that
I've added through this
mode option there there there are ways
of writing using processing to write
code in a different language for an
android application or for writing your
code in Python I'm going to add another
mode it's going to open up this window
and this is the one that I want p5.js
mode adds a simple editor for p5.js code
by Favot information design so now I'm
going to install that they're going to
wait for it to download download
download downloading downloading
downloading downloading downloading
downloading downloading down that's the
song it's the downloading song I really
I've really excited there and now it's
ready and I can't remove it I should be
able to go and switch to p5.js and look
at this it redid my window it gave me a
little setup and draw even have an
index.html file and I can say create
canvas 400 400 I can say background 200
comma 0 comma 255 and then I can draw a
circle here where the mouse is to do my
first sketch and I can hit run and then
it goes to the browser and opens up and
once again here if I want to if I want
to look at the results I'm sorry if I
want to see what's happening in the
console just like I showed in my
brackets tutorial if I want to see any
print statements I've got to look at
that javascript console in the browser
so I can I can get to that by saying
view developer JavaScript console or I
can use a keyboard shortcut to open that
up and close it ok so those are two
other ways that you can make p5.js
sketches you can use the brackets editor
which I showed in a previous video and
in this video I've shown you open
processing and the processing p5.js mode
so if you have questions or trouble with
these things please write it in the
comments and I look forward to hearing
what you end up making and hopefully you
enjoy using these tools good bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
