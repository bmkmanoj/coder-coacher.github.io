yes okay I think no I think's going on
here stat her someone is some mystical
force of the universe is looking at me
and saying oh machine learning that's
like to me this is what felt like
happening I was about to say I'm going
to unlock all the mysteries and wonder
of machine learning and I commend the
fire alarm went off so I think someone
is I think it was like literally saved
by the bell there so today is really
have to apologize to all of you viewers
now things are really quite messed up
for me in terms of my schedule I I was
streaming for about seven minutes oops
this camera's not on and i think it was
over here talking about kind of machine
learning in the broad sense and the
thing that i was about to do was
transition over to my syllabus and start
to talk about why i have some of these
topics here in the first week and then I
was going to show you some examples of
those and just kind of give you a
landscape of stuff that I plan to start
next week and then the fire alarm went
off there was no fire as far as I know
in fact I really don't even want to
admit this but I have to be I have to be
true I have to be honest the fire alarm
was actually in building next door so
technically speaking the floor that I'm
on its two buildings that are adjoined
you can walk between the buildings or
say hallway but technically the fire
alarm was the building next door now
it's quite loud and I could hear it you
could probably hear it too and so I
thought I should leave and you know on
my way out I was just stopping by the
fourth floor to just sort of check and
see if people were leaving there too
maybe I'd go out and grab some lunch
with some folks and then ones just
sitting around with their desks because
they're so far going off because I'm on
that floor can't there is no walkway
between the two buildings so i got
confused oh maybe the fire alarms over
and i came back upstairs
fire i'm still going off some people
said oh you don't have to leave because
it's the building next door i don't know
then I it was a really loud fire alarm
she's not going to just sit around and
do this live stream why this fire alarm
is going off you know if a fire is in
the building next door I think it's
still kind of a problem so then I went
out for a little bit and and then I got
caught in a couple conversations I was
maybe to get something to eat which I
didn't do so I don't know some time
passed and I came back and the fire
alarm is not going off anymore and
everybody's in this building so it seems
like things are ok unfortunately what
that has done to my schedule is that you
know i was i was hoping to leave about
now or a half an hour from now and you
know and i don't really have the
flexibility right now too first of all
so I very hungry sure eaten something
but I have a lunch appointment to go to
and so I like my energy and my brain is
a little bit melted so i'm trying to
think I've let's say I'm gonna be here
for 15 or 30 minutes let's look let's
let me finish up what i was saying about
machine learning and which is that and I
probably shouldn't do this because if
I'm going to do any let me finish up my
that thought from before because it's in
my head so one of the I know what I was
doing when the fire alarm went off oh I
think I made the fire alarm go off by
doing this let's see if I can do it
again cuz here's the thing this is I
don't understand these things really but
but I'm gonna try to teach them and
there's all this new research and I go
and I read these web pages of my eyes
glaze over and they roll into the back
of my head and then I you know I start
to get this like pain in my side and the
feels like this like this like
uncomfortable feeling in my chest you
know reading all these papers and stuff
about neural networks but oh I Senate
did the fire is there something going on
I feel like when I said neural network
could cost the fire nerve to come off it
was saving me but this is one of the
core this is certainly one of the things
that I get asked about the most so can
you do a neural network
coding challenge can you explain how a
neural network works and I do actually
I'm joking around to some extent because
I do have some examples already about
this idea of this thing called a
perceptron which I will build and
program from scratch when we get to this
week but one of the things about a
neural network is and I'm looking for my
I'm kind of a little out of whack here
where is my eraser here it is so one way
of thinking about a neural network is
inputs and outputs maybe there are some
inputs like maybe there are four inputs
like maybe we are going to send in some
information about a flower what color is
it how many petals how tall is it bro no
kind of thing these are sort of values
that we're going to send into the neural
network and then there might be some
output which is or multiple outputs
which you know the probability of it
being a certain kind of flower whether
it's a sunflower or a daisy or a lily
whatever kind of flower you might think
about and then in between there are all
these things that are you know these
inputs and then there's neurons and
there's information goes here then it
goes here then maybe goes here and it
goes here it goes here there's this
interconnected web of neurons the
information flows this is called a
feed-forward Network because the
information is flowing through it feed
forward and all this math happens in
here so at some point I'm going to come
back and look at this more closely and
look at the different pieces of some of
the calculations that happen in here and
what kinds of things you can feed in
what kinds of things you can pull out
but the thing that I thought would be
useful is kind of like a warm up to the
course is looking at graph graph systems
so for example a kind of classic
computer science algorithm is something
called a binary search tree which I
could draw like this and the arrows are
entirely
cessary because it's not anyway so you
get the idea of this idea of a tree with
a root node that has two children that
each have two children a left and right
binary because it only has a left and a
right you could you know I did some
videos on the traveling salesperson
problem a while back where maybe you
have a bunch of cities and you have to
figure out what is the most efficient
path to you know make it through all the
cities that's the shortest this is also
a graph system what if you had a subway
map and you want to get from this
station to this station and they're all
these different possible lines and all
these other possible stations and
they're all interconnected in strange
ways how would you find the shortest or
the route that takes the least amount of
time i looked at something called a star
which is an algorithm for looking at a
graph and solving your way through the
grass thurs Dijkstra's algorithm I hope
I'm pronouncing that correctly there's
breadth-first search and depth first
search so this is where and I wanted to
start as a warm-up because these are
network-based there's two reasons one is
these are network based systems and if
we can program these systems it's going
to give us some clues to what kind of
concepts will need to program a neural
network you know replace the subway map
with input and output neurons and
neurons and connections all in between
that's item number one the item number
two the reason number two is that I had
wrote this word called illusion prick is
dying I think this might be it for me
everybody I think I not no longer is
thinking about things in a way that
makes sense that I can explain I didn't
smell illusion correctly I guess
spelling isn't the worst thing to get
wrong I ll us io n pretty sure that's
right this kind of illusion of
intelligence so what if you think about
some of my examples about autonomous
agents I have this vehicle that's moving
around the screen maybe it's seeking a
target what if it learns to traverse a
binary tree or what if it learns the try
the most efficient solution to the
traveling salesperson problem so can we
create this appearance of software
simulated creatures that move about a
two or three dimensional space and that
are in any neural network might be a
good way to train it to like not hit
obstacles and this is something called
there's a technique called reinforcement
learning and cue accu learning algorithm
that I hope to look at later but even
just in a sort of basic way what if we
have a lot of nodes and the agency to
steer around those notes so this is kind
of where I'm starting or the chat and
see if anybody is listening to me okay
so I so I think I'm just going to talk
about this briefly so I'm going to clone
this repo and I've started doing some
work on some simple examples let me go
to terminal here and go to the desktop
and git clone so for those of you who
might not be familiar with github github
is a website where you can store
repositories of information most people
use it to store repositories of source
code and cloning is the act of
downloading the information from github
and I could have just I could have just
gone here to do download zip or there's
also like a desktop application but I'm
going to use the command line to paste
the URL for this repo and then I'm going
to go into the repo and I am going to
open the repo in Adam so I can look at
some of the code and I'm also going to
run oops I'm going to what's that
command K maybe that's it command K
clears the terminal my whole life is now
changed I'm going to run a local server
and let's take a look at some of the
examples so this is the stuff I'm going
to do some of these as coding challenges
and working on these examples this week
I haven't gotten very far but for
example let me just a lot of these are
wrong there's mistakes in them but let
me look at this for a second oh so this
is this is actual where's my crop so
this is actually a JavaScript version of
an example from this book called
rockin algorithms an illustrated guide
for programmers and other curious people
by Aditya bar bhargava and so why is my
slack chat is disconnected I don't know
why it is sorry everybody in slack I
that computer is disconnected so he's
you're listening so this this particular
scenario is a doing a search to find let
me let me actually there is a look at
this this computer lost its internet
connection I'm gonna have to deal with
that in a little bit a second ok so if I
go to the code for a second and I go to
this one what I've done in this
particular example and I'm going to come
back and actually program some of these
next week as coding challenges or sooner
the next week if I can and these names
are using these names because I want to
emphasize that this particular the code
doesn't come from this book but I wrote
the code while reading the chapter of
this book even though I have some
mistakes in the code that I've since
realized so okay so I'm only looking at
the YouTube chat right now just for
everybody's reference so okay so what
you can see here is that I'm creating a
bunch of nodes you Bob Alice Claire
onion so these are nodes like this you
Bob clear right and then these nodes
have various connections for example i
can connect myself to Alice Bob and
Claire so if I come back you know what I
really need is I need a data set of
Kevin Bacon movies that's what I need
for this so you is be as connected to
Claire it's connected to Alice I can't
remember if I was connected to Bob but
you get the idea here maybe Bob is
connected to a new
and I'm connected to Bob and inertia is
connected to so named Tom and Claire is
connected to Tom so the idea here is
let's say this was a social network and
these connections were whether your
friends on Facebook or you follow each
other on Twitter how could you find the
degrees of separation how could you find
the shortest path if each step is one
step and we can plainly see if I want to
get from myself to Tom here that the
shortest path is you me I should just
write me me declare the time I could get
there by going from me to Bob to an urge
to Tom but the shortest path this only
requires two steps so V this is that
this is you know in my mind in the
broadest sense artificial intelligence a
computer algorithm is solving a problem
in an intelligent manner to come up with
some optimal solution and so this is
where the class is going to start this
also has the has the advantage of a
couple things one is there some
interesting visual outcomes nap spaces
maze spaces that steering ages can move
around and the example that I'm using is
using a breadth-first search although i
think i might have had an error in the
code and might have made it more depth
first search by accident so i'm going to
look at all this stuff this is what I'm
coming back next week to don't get more
closely ok let's see all right so that's
one example here's another let's look at
some of these other examples and this by
the way that one thing that's okay so
anybody wants to come by the way first
of all I would be thrilled for the world
that's out there watching to contribute
to this repository so these examples are
in progress here's a major issue with
this example I picked them i'm doing a
visualization of all these connections i
just put them all at random locations
which is kind of terrible like they
really should maybe be in some sort of
order that would be make it easy to look
at and see and i could do a force
directed graph that's kind of a big
complicated thing but even just kind of
having rose so that's that's a little
challenge or visualize it a different
way if anyone wants to kind of help out
with some of these examples let's go
this is incorrect i should fix this
right now thank you to me i am so me let
me try to get this other computers
internet
working again maybe it's NYU turn Wi-Fi
off turn Wi-Fi on let's see if that does
anything Oh what is the repository
called I don't know if anyone can post
this into the it came back if anyone
could oh no attorney ins okay so this is
the repository Schiffman / all this
nonsense up here screenshot that or
someone can post it who can post links
in the chat okay so here's something
this is called this isn't a
demonstration of what's supposed to be
breath breadth first search trying to
get from this green dot to this green
dot and every time I refresh ah there we
go it got there it finds in the shortest
path the fewest number of steps and
which things are connected in this grid
or random so we can see it try to solve
and it solved that one and we can see
this now here's the thing one of the key
fundamental pieces of a breadth-first
search is this idea of a queue I've got
this Q align the queue is if i were to
demonstrate it with just myself i'm
going to queue up to ring the bell yay
my turns over so now the next person
comes up and things the bell so the
first person in line is the first person
who rings the bell and then the last
person in line has to wait until they
become the first person to line so what
what is what it's just like lining up to
buy tickets for something which is the
opposite of a stack which is this thing
that you pile things on and then you
pull things off so the last thing in so
in a queue the first thing in I could
diagram this but anyway the whole point
of this is it needs a cute let's go look
at the source code and I'm going to go
to this one that's BFS grid animate and
the algorithm is here in this draw
function and look at this it's saying Q
dot length is greater than 0 node equals
Q dot pop now here's the thing I just
was I I made up a variable called Q
because I want it to be a data
structure of a cube but what is it
actually it's just an array so I didn't
actually implement a kind of queue data
structure and an array I should an array
so here's the data structure we want
this is the queue right so if I add
something to the queue it goes here at
the end and if I take something out of
the queue then it goes there it's taken
from the beginning so pop pull something
out push put something at the end but an
array in JavaScript if I just use the
default if I use push push the push
function adds an element to the end and
the pop function takes an element off
that end but what I want to do is add to
the end and put you out here and i
believe the correct JavaScript array
function vlada shift so let's actually
fix that in the algorithm q shift and
now let's take a look at what it looks
like again there we go this looks much
more correct and breadth first search so
it's trying and see how it's going sort
of down and down and checking every
possibility eventually it gets there ah
so much better okay okay so these are
the kinds of things I want to dive into
these a bit more deeply next week I'll
just show you a couple more examples
here's one that I was attempting to
while it's running through and let's
actually fix the let me go fix it in
here also change a pop to shift so this
is what I'm talking about let me try to
make this bigger with this idea of
creating an agent that appears
intelligent like it's trying to figure
out the path but really it just looks
like a cursor going to the leg current
node so I'm looking for creative
possibilities of how do we use some of
these
rhythms that solve certain problems in
an intelligent way and then visualize
them in a creative fashion where the
elements on the screen appear to be
solving these prop figuring these out on
their own it's just asking okay so and
then these are from though this is not
nothing to see here yet this is
something that I did a coding challenge
of quite a while ago this is using
depth-first search to create a maze
pattern and this is a star algorithm to
solve a path through a maze but this is
just not amazes where the wrong word for
this this is just a random grid with
some some things being walls and
something's not being walls so um that's
what I want to do is also one of my
goals for an example for next week is to
have a steering agent move throughout a
maze solving it with a star so anybody
who wants to help a me IM sobe is
pointing out that i didn't make the
connections bi-directional which is an
issue so anybody who wants to you a
couple things you can you could just
file a pull request you can do a github
issue this is what I hope to have
finished and want to say by next week i
really mean by tuesdays when the class
meets here at nyu in the next friday is
when i'm coming to do my live session
okay so that's kind of other things i'm
going to do is talk about genetic
algorithms although I mostly have a lot
of videos on that already I have a
couple new scenarios in mind that I'm
going to do look at some classification
and prediction algorithms neural
networks and then some applications of
neural networks that are kind of new
research in the last few years so if
you're not aware neural networks are
concept that was developed in the mid
20th century I don't know the exact date
40s and 50s and there was a lot of
excitement and Wonder and amazement at
the possibilities what neural networks
could do and then Marvin Minsky and
other researchers kind of looked at
basic simple neural networks in rise
there's so many problems they just can't
solve for example a simple perceptron
cannot solve something called XOR and
then that some other research came along
to do this other kind of multi-layer
Network
blah blah blah but there was really a
lot of excitement around neural networks
but the I guess it's often informally
referred to us like the AI winter there
wasn't a lot of research that got very
far for a long time until quite recently
with some of these new advents in deep
learning what is deep learning so this
is stuff that I want to get it to and
that's going to come towards more
towards the end of the course so I'm
getting questions in the chat do you
think you'll be back later today for a
streaming session or is your schedule
pretty much shot until next week so i am
going to commit to coming back for at
least one hour at some point this
afternoon i lost about an hour for that
because i lost about an hour with the
fire issue and two things that i haven't
done right now is I guess I kind of
talked about the machine learning
syllabus I didn't get to show these
examples of work from the community so I
want to be able to show those and I
wanted to do I felt like after this sort
of crazy week that I've had I wanted to
do do some sort of simple and fun coding
challenges binary tree I put on there
because it's kind of a nice entry point
to some of the graph system stuff that I
want to do next week but but as always
ask for pong I feel like palm can I
bring back bunch of people from the last
week I've asked me to bring back the
timer I think that probably not the core
audience of my channel but there's some
the casuals who just kind of watched
snake video the purple rain video I have
these two videos that had a timer going
and it coding challenge it actually
could be done in somewhere between 15
and 30 minutes so I might where is this
what's this March 10 thing alka that you
keep posting about oh it says March 10th
here thank you dailies barge 17 so I was
thinking about doing that so a fire day
yeah so I'm sorry everybody this has
been a bit of a fail for this morning i
hope that discussion of neural networks
I mean sorry no
that discussion of machine machine
learning that discussion of and I'm very
specifically my syllabus it does not say
machine learning it does not say AI it
just says intelligence and learning so
that's my core topic and there's some
pieces of it which I hope that we'll be
able to program from scratch and
understand how it works and some of it
will actually be like can we just get
the thing to compile and that's kind of
Mona be my point of view and I'm this is
all new to me I'm slightly terrified but
I do enjoy this kind of learning with
you as I try stuff on the channel so so
that's that so I don't know what time
this will be let me look at it now my I
would like to say that I'm going to come
back at around two o'clock for one hour
that's what I'm sort of hoping to do I
guess stay tuned to the live stream page
that's a place where I can update the
time and i'll also tweet and post a note
in the chat all right let me see if i
can take five minutes of any just random
questions from the chat okay
i'm reading the YouTube challenge and
looking at the slac chat look at these
interesting go up camera went off don't
show processing work or is mine just not
good enough I don't up so though I take
the work from people who are in the
patron group which is a slack channel
for viewers who have chosen to help fund
some of the efforts that I'm doing
through patreon com but I'm happy to
show work what kind of hair products I
use what kind of I'm happy to show work
from other people best way would be to
tweet me and I can I can I love to show
stuff from processing what time is it
where you are it is a 1225 p.m. east
coast time do you ever do stuff other
than j/s such as Python or other web
stuff like HTML and CSS I definitely do
use HTML and CSS and a lot of my
tutorials and but I have not done any
tutorials in Python I do have a plan one
thing I am thinking about is looking at
tensorflow as as a framework to do some
to implement some of these machine
learning algorithms and tensorflow one
way to use tenter flows through python
and i'm thinking about creating a simple
python server that runs the tensorflow
stuff and then i can query it from a
processing sketch or a p5 jazz web page
to visualize so you know in one hand you
don't need that other aspect of it if p5
are processing but that's something
anybody wants to help with that I have a
couple links hi need to find where did I
put those out let me find those because
I'm going to open that as an issue so
one place that you might also look at is
machine learning coding train let's just
see what comes up if I google
look at this fourth link so this is a
repository from the community of just a
ton a ton of links that are relevant to
machine learning and I'd the link that
I'm looking for right now is oh no it's
not here it was the reason why I thought
it might be here is because it was a
couple links that Patrick Hebron sent to
me and Patrick he Brown is actually a
researcher here at NYU and has written a
book called machine learning for
designers which I highly recommend and
also has an accompanying webcasts so if
you want to go watch something about
somebody who knows about this stuff go
check out Patrick stuff but i'll have to
find those i'm going to add those i'm
just going to make it an issue right now
issues oh look at this all these issues
already oh I need just sign in oh dear
pick a username no no I sign in I have
no idea what my password I just did a
whole like redo of all my passwords it's
all coming from one password i have all
done to step verified on everything now
so can somebody for me i'm going to log
in can somebody for me go to shift mid /
NOC dash as this repository issues and
file an issue that says prepare simple
flask server that serves tensorflow data
to processing and or peopie thank you
very much i'm looking for any other
questions what path did you learn to
take what path did you take to learn to
code this is from cody fooler oh and ada
asks book recommendations these are good
questions so I've actually I kind of
would throw this okay so for a path that
I took to learn to code well I'll tell
you my first experience with coding was
probably I'm trying to guess the year
let's see I think it was about somewhere
between third and fourth grade this
would be like 1981 1982 someone asked a
fact chest
faq fact-check i was born in 1973 for
those of you were asking what my age is
and so the first computer that i
programmed on was an apple 2 plus and i
programmed it basic and i actually did a
science fair project on perception where
i wrote a basic program to flash things
on the screen and like flash a word and
leave it on only for a certain amount of
time and to test whether people could
see it and then type the word back in
hey that would be a great coding
challenge so did a redo haas great let's
do my old third fourth grade science
fair project in javascript somebody add
that to the rainbow topic suggestions
they'll come to that this afternoon so
but then I I don't think I did any
programming again until I believe in
middle or high school I did some more
basic and perhaps some logo and even a
little assembly language in like a
computer class then I never did any
programming again until after I
graduated from college at some point I
took an evening class of C++ like oh
maybe I should try some of that I did
not like it at all terrible class I
couldn't figure anything out gave that
up then and 2001 I came as a student to
ITP which is the program where i teach
right now and i took a class called
introduction to computational media and
it was taught using the lingo
programming language for macromedia
director and just the sort of
interactive animation quality of that
kind of hooked to be and I rediscovered
a lot of my interest in math and science
and logic and numbers through
programming and the kind of then I found
processing sort of writings Taurus
prosthetics or so I mostly i learned i
would say mostly as being an ITP student
and i would say the primary way that i
learned to program was trying to figure
out processing which was a new thing at
the time and trying to like write
tutorials and stuff and JT nimoy did a
workshop on processing at ITP which was
the first time that it came to ITB him
where I heard about it and also i meet
pitar ooh
taught a class at ITP that used
processing both before i started using
processing at ITP okay okay all right
everybody I'm sorry about this botched
live stream for today I hope you got
something out of it or at least it was
nice to see each other it is 1230 I am
going to attempt to come back stay tuned
at some point for one hour I'm what I'm
going to do is I'm going to do I'm going
to put up a Twitter poll I don't know
which two I don't know I don't know if
there maybe I'll just run my spinning
this is I got a fair what am I going to
do in that one hour maybe I don't know
it's not gonna be Chrome extensions look
could be actually could be any of these
things so I'm going to come back and do
one or two of these things in an hour
later show work from the community and
that's that also uh stay tuned I will
release you might have Molly by seeing
this live last week but the edited
versions are now ready if i go to my
youtube channel look I'm live now this I
published 19 hours ago the coding
challenge 64.1 forward kinematics all of
the other follow-ups are actually
available if you just go to the coding
cheddar unlisted because I kind of
released them one a day but if you go to
the coding challenges playlist and go to
the bottom you'll see they're all here
so if you're looking for something to
watch and of interest forward kinematics
inverse kinematics inverse kinematics
with a fixed point and then multiple
tentacles thingamabob errs ok thank you
everyone 10-minute pong challenge I
really like to do that day you know why
it would be good because what we can do
later is we can make an AI system that
plays pawn so that I think maybe I'll do
that pong challenge can I really do it
in 10 minutes maybe what I'll even do I
was talking about this earlier is i'll
do it in processing but then i'll do
i'll do twice I'll do it in processing
but then don't do it in JavaScript but
instead of doing it in a canvas I'll use
like Dom elements like divs and text
boxes and things to like
either be the palm all right thank you
everybody ten minutes is probably
unrealistic she probably say 20 minutes
that more real especially cuz I talk too
much but maybe that's what i'll do this
afternoon okay so if you're interested
in that apologies for a little bit of
the confusion around the machine
learning stuff as you see next week I'm
going to look at graph systems I'm
looking anybody wants to help me with
that just chime in on github open github
issues I let's help make those examples
great oh boy did I really just say that
I in a way that may be very
uncomfortable and see you guys okay I'm
gonna hit stop now hey I'm back did I
actually work somebody said you forgot
about the book recommendations does this
actually work my back let's see here
book recommendations I don't actually
have the book recommendations but I just
started reading a book called it's by
hold on let me go to Amazon
this is a book that I'm looking at make
your own neural network there is a my
logged in under my account no I'm not so
this is a book that I just got its i
think it's it's if you have Kindle
unlimited it's free it's a four dollars
for the online version so I'm necessary
recommending I'm recommending this in
the sense that I just started reading it
maybe I'm like three or four pages in
and it looked like what I was looking
for something that I could follow that
didn't have code in processing or
JavaScript and I could sort of follow it
and try to re-implement the stuff that's
in the book so this i think i'm going to
use as a basis so that was one
recommendation and the other
recommendation i have is under books
here up Patrick Ebron what's this
reinforcement learning book you know
what I'm going to do is go to the
library today did you know that you can
go there's this place it's called the
library and it's full of books and you
can go find any book you want and take
it with you you just to bring it back
later after you finished it's amazing so
maybe I'll go to the library so i would
love on anybody who has any book
recommendations in particular on that
are accessible friendly and for machine
learning artificial intelligence topics
please feel free to add to this
repository coding train / machine
learning and then of course there's the
classic the other book that i always
used as a reference I mean it's got to
come up why am I blanking on the authors
if I just search for artificial
intelligence book it's the seminal book
at least how I think of it there's oh
yeah there's the end this one artificial
intelligence a modern approach Norvig
and Russell so this is a book that i
often use also as a kind of reference is
this someone is saying is this link down
this one look it's there maybe there's a
different one this one oh yeah this is a
book I have looked at this I haven't
actually read it yet oh yeah I guess
it's just an error I think there's some
extra story
characters in that link because this is
the book that's also been recommended I
should probably you know what the thing
is owed this is have a print version yet
my issue is i'm a little bit weird i I
don't I don't do very well reading books
I on a computer kindle great print book
great but I have trouble reading so this
one I think is only available as an
e-book in PDF format so i think that's a
kind of that was that's why I didn't
bother to get out oh I guess I could
print it out okay sorry now i'm going
again and i will see you guys later this
afternoon we come back I'm to do pong
let's just celebrate happy Friday and a
spring break it's freezing there was
like a foot of snow this week Thank You
spring break let's come back let's do
palm later today and just have a good
time okay and then next week we'll do
harder stuff I don't feel like doing
anything hard today maybe God I got to
go to lunch okay goodbye now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
