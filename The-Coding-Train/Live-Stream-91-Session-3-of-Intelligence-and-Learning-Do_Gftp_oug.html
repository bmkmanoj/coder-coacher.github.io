of my microphone getting caught look I
have to fix that who'd you buy that
again hold up right back oh wait it's
gonna happen again
hello good afternoon
welcome to the coding train a weekly
YouTube thing that happens on YouTube
with me Daniel Schiffman I said it right
this time I think I think I got it right
this time my name is Dan I'm here on a
Thursday instead of a Friday usually I
like to be here on a Friday but this
week I had a conflict with tomorrow so
here I am today and I'm gonna do some
stuff and cuz it's a boy I've got to get
going here okay uh it's somebody the
chat is saying coding training on a
Wednesday I'm pretty sure today is
Thursday let me do some math here carry
the one Thursday today's Thursday
may the force happy may the fourth day
may the force be with you and all of
that stuff so ok so what's happening
right now looks like everything is
working looks like I am live I see a
bunch of screens with my face on it and
I'm here ok so I'm just going to jump
right in let's see let me introduce let
me try this again
well maybe it'd be better if I walk it I
mean let me try that is a more shopping
this more I need to get some new starts
hello welcome the coding train with me
Daniel Shipman
happy may the fourth Star Wars day I am
here every week sometimes on a Friday
sometimes on a Thursday some sort of
time where I happen to be here - who did
I already do this I already did so but
this is not going well do you think I
should rehearse possibly rehearsing
could help I'm very hot in here I don't
know what I'm gonna do about this I
think kind of get some climate control
going on alright so today what I'm going
to do is I'm going to continue some
topics in coding from my course nature
of code intelligence and learning this
course is actually finished this was the
last week of the semester here at New
York University next week is a week of
thesis presentations there actually will
be a live stream for all the thesis
presentations here and the ITP program
but I let me let me show you that I it's
not going to be on my youtube channel
but let me open up this web browser here
and if you go to ITP dot NYU dot edu
slash thesis here you can see there
should be a couple things there's a
presentation schedule and project
descriptions I'm going to click on this
so this is the ITP thesis website we can
let's look for one by topic hmm
algorithms art behavior date of is
education I don't know machine learning
well let's look at machine learning
let's try that it's good we got three
projects let's and we can look at this
one Liane Eckert biometric intimacy so
if you wanted to catch Leon's pieces
presentation about biometric intimacy I
could go back to ITP NYU edu slash
thesis and I could now go to
presentation schedule I could search for
Leon who's going to be at a 448 p.m.
that's Eastern Time on Wednesday next
week Wednesday May 10th so anyway I
encourage you guys to tune into this
live stream there's going to be about
100
theses presentations from students here
at ITP I will be sitting in the audience
watching every single one of them and at
some point there will be a link oh yeah
live streams what happens if we click on
this now ITP thisis live stream live
stream it's not going to because there's
nobody there
my master volume could be turned up a
few notches this happened to me the
other day as well let's see what I can
do about that I the thing is I have I've
got like a bunch of things teetering on
the edge and I've got to find a
three-three let me see here
turning up turning up turning up how's
that my master volume a little bit
better okay so anyway so tune in next
week to this thesis livestream I hope
that I'll be able to do my own coding
train episode next week but it's going
to be a very busy week as you can see
this is happening all week and then the
week after if you happen to be in New
York City you can actually come
physically come to ITP Tuesday May 16th
Wednesday May 17th 5.the times are there
721 Broadway all the students will have
their work on display and one of the
reasons why I mention this is you might
recall that in the winter I produced a
short video recapping some of the
projects I might do that again but I was
thinking what if I actually just
livestream from the show itself and I've
been working on something if I can get a
journal mic to go into a phone I could
use the YouTube app to livestream I
could I was I'm playing around with this
like gimbal camera stabilization things
I'm hoping to have an actual livestream
from the show itself so my volume is
fine thank you it I turned it up now so
hopefully that's better okay
so let's see that was one announcement
other things I will plug for you briefly
is don't forget if you want to support
the processing foundation you can become
a member this reminds me I want to do a
kind of membership drive live episode at
some point so I got I'm glad I'm
remembering
so consider contributing to the
processing foundation if your it is a
501c3 organization so it's
tax-deductible here in the United States
if you would like to support the work
that I'm doing on this YouTube channel
you can go to patreon.com/scishow
recent message after killing my VM and
freeing up more ram audio seems fine see
what a wonderful chat message that I
just read okay
and finally if another way that you can
support this YouTube channel is you can
get your coding train merchandise here
at coding train Storenvy comm I am not
wearing a coding train hoodie I'm
wearing an NYU Shanghai hoodie but I put
a little coating sticker on it so it's
kind of like a coda create hoodie but
you could get your own zip up hoodie
right here okay so I have one it just
hasn't arrived yet I was hoping to wear
it I'm also wearing my I don't want to
mess with this my robe NASA t-shirt
which I'm very happy about okay so I
think that's all of my introductory
stuff today I am going to open up the
web browser again and I'm going to go to
nature of code syllabus and guess what
we are here we are ready for week three
classification and regression so this is
some material here that I would like to
cover in today's live stream so before I
do that I will take some questions I by
the way I think I need a better so two
things I need to improve a lot of things
I need to improve but two things I would
like to improve is one having a way for
people to submit questions I was kind of
I do have this rainbow topics repository
which is just people post suggested
ideas and then I had like a question
label so I could kind of look let's see
if there's any questions there yeah
there's some questions maybe we can
answer one of these questions I think
these are most of these let's look
hi Dan I just finished washing your
p5.js versus processing video it's
really cool thanks
I've watched loads of your coding train
videos you have a really good fellow
thank you thank you very much okay and
pick up okay I don't know to coat it in
okay so this is really more like a video
suggestion less a question to sort of
compare and contrast doing things using
p5 yes with the native JavaScript on
tone so I'm looking for a good way to
collect user submitted questions maybe
upvoting maybe I could answer one or two
of those at the every beginning of every
coding training episode for right now
what I'm going to do is look into the
YouTube chat which I'm pointing over
there because that's where I see it I'm
going to look in the slack Channel for
coding train patrons and I'm looking
right over here and I will see if I can
answer any questions and while I wait
we're going to listen to a little of
Symphony number 40 in G minor
will I ever do tutorials on c-sharp asks
uh it already scrolled by unlikely
anytime soon I think the languages of
choice that I tend to use in my own
tutorials are Java and I do Java
programming in processing and then
JavaScript often using with the p5 GS
I'm often with the p5 just library
sometimes with node and other JavaScript
frameworks I would like to get into a
little bit of Python and maybe do a few
learn Python tutorials and then bring in
some machine learning stuff with some
Python code that's in the future how
long will use stream so it is about 4:15
right now I hope to be finished at 6
p.m. so we've got an hour and 45 minutes
what is a binary tree oh wait now what
is the binary tree and what can use it
for exactly okay hey guess what I have a
coding challenge binary tree I would
suggest actually just finding that video
and watching it because I spend a good
20 minutes discussing what a binary tree
is David in the patreon group writes hi
Dan I've been following your tutorials
on making a Twitter bot I'm having some
issues where the load JSON breaks when I
try to attach it to a button
mousepressed
event in time inside setup it works
inside of preload any suggestions okay
so this is a great question I don't know
if this is your issue but it might be so
let's say I'm going to open up atom
editor here and I'm going to close some
stuff and I'm gonna make a new file I'm
going to just call it a scratch jf and
just save this on the desktop
okay so David let's say what is what I'm
guessing you have is you have a function
preload and then you have like var data
and then you say data equals load JSON
some date some data json some file and
then maybe somewhere else in your code
you are using that data
you know var score equals data dot you
know L
you know index 0 dot score something
like that so there's some JSON that
you're reading in and you're pulling
some data out of it now what I'm
assuming that maybe you did I'm going to
read the question again button mouse
press so forget about the button just
for a second because this will be the
same let's say you just had a global
mousepressed event and what you were to
do there is you were to take this code
which is in preload and put it here and
then try to access the data here this
would not work this would give you a
major bug and this is because javascript
in its way that it exists is by it by
nature it's it's I was gonna say the
human nature of JavaScript the
JavaScript nature the nature of
JavaScript is to be asynchronous meaning
this line makes a request to go and get
that file and at some point the data
will come back but it's going to move on
to the next line of code while it's
waiting to retrieve that data the data
won't be ready here if you were working
in processing Java if you're doing
something in Python where they'll apply
where everything is synchronous meaning
the data has to be loaded before it can
go into the next line of code then you
would not have this problem so what you
need to do instead is actually not set
the result of load JSON equal to
something but rather have a callback as
a second argument here got data meaning
when low JSON is finished execute this
function called got data and there is
where the stuff will come in and I could
say data equals stuff and you know score
equals so you know I did some weird
things because why do I have this global
variable and then I said the global bit
but that's if I want to access it later
there's other different ways I could
organize it but ultimately if you are
using low JSON out of outside a preload
preload is a special p5 function to make
the loading of external media and data
synchronous meeting set up doesn't
actually happen until everything in
preload has been
and it's because of the way p5 is
programmed underneath the hood this is
not native to how JavaScript tends to
work with loading stuff but if you're
outside of preload because you want to
load when you push the mouse you've got
to do it this way okay hopefully uh I
would have Adam Adam in the chat by the
way I would have in the patron group
saying that I'm reading messages without
screening them I think I read a few
words ahead so I would have stopped
myself if anything was a problem okay
I'm looking in the mic Soderberg asks in
the YouTube chat would you try and hit
colony algorithm sometime this is great
so one of the things that I'm a little
sad about right now I'm a little sad is
that I wish I really like I wonder I
really enjoy doing quick coding
challenges that you know one of my
favorite ones that I did is just the
phyllotaxis pattern was a movie a 15 or
20-minute video involved a little math
little color or make a beautiful
sunflower shape and you know I sort of
missed doing these kind of quick
simulation coding challenges to do a
little algorithmic art or something but
I do have a commitment to get through
this particular syllabus and so that's
what I'm going to do and with that I
think I am going to begin starting this
week's new material and guess what it's
15 minutes in and I'm here to start here
we go ah great okay so what do I want to
say to get started here did you do you
like my mug coding trade mug okay uh
it's finished I'm going to put it over
here and switch to drinking some water
and see what we're going here okay so
what I need to do is alright let's look
at this a good review here's the thing
my plan was I'm teaching at ITP this
course and the week that I teach I would
then go and make videos that same
peak but I never was able to keep to
that so I've got hum I go we did this in
class like a month ago or month and a
half ago I don't remember any of this
stuff so let me see what okay okay okay
that's okay okay okay nearest neighbor
okay okay okay okay got it
all right so uh yeah oh yeah you know
what this is too soon I'm starting to
soon I think we should read some random
numbers okay
where do we last leave off
really should keep track are you use a
bookmark or something mimimi mimimi
mimimi
thirty thousand nine hundred fifty three
sixty three thousand three hundred and
sixty nine five thousand four hundred
and forty-five twenty thousand two
hundred and forty thirty-five thousand
three hundred and sixty to eighty two
thousand and seventy two twenty nine
thousand two hundred eighty seventy two
thousand sixty eight ninety four
thousand eight hundred forty-five and
ninety seven thousand and four okay
is this class for beginners asks
Mewsette murray in the chat no so that's
the other thing that I am very torn
about which is that I've kind of waded
into territory you know one of my goals
with this YouTube channel is to be as
friendly and open and inclusive and
accessible for everyone and in
particular beginners beginners the
coding beginners to open-source but I've
kind of waded into this territory of
doing a lot of somewhat you know medium
to advanced content that I barely
understand myself so I'm but I'm
committed to doing this so I'm going to
do this and I hope that later in towards
the end of the summer next fall
I'm going to get back to my roots a bit
I might redo a lot of the learn to
program from scratch videos not using
scratch with in JavaScript p5.js I have
some ideas about that okay
will there be a live string tomorrow
there will not be a live stream tomorrow
so this is the live stream for the week
today okay so what I need to do here is
an open up terminal and I'm going to run
a little local server and we go back to
the web browser gonna have this stuff
ready and I'm going to be in week three
here so these are some so one thing
about what I'm going to do today just to
let you know is I'm going to build a
program that does a similarity score
between two people based on movie
ratings and but I have all this stuff
already built I made these examples I'll
reference this again but I made these
examples and a lot of the content comes
out of this book programming collective
until
gents so let me let me let me put that
somewhere I can reach it easily by the
way if you're wondering why I disappear
over here this is a computer
it just has agreed on it so at least
it's not blocking what's on the screen
when I'm standing over here but this is
where I will look at the slack channel
um okay so let me see so so I want to
build some stuff but I also have some of
these examples made already and uh oh I
know what I need to do let's do some
data cleaning and I'm going to do this
not in the edited video so I need to go
to my Google Drive and log in as coding
rainbow live did you know that this
channel used to have a different name
what's that password for this account
maybe it's this nope nope oh my god
really seriously what there we go
okay so I'm logged in here I'm going to
look at this survey that I sent out so
if somebody could post a link to the
survey in the chat then now is you're
kind of like last chance to fill out
this survey and it's asked you to Ray
type rape some Star Wars movies we've
had 47 people fill it out I am going to
I want to look at the responses I want
to create a new spreadsheet okay I'll
give it I'm going to give it I'm going
to give it like about 30 seconds here so
what I want to do now is I want to take
this spreadsheet and I want to turn it
into a JSON file and there's a variety
of ways I could do this I could write my
own program I think I did this in a
previous coding challenge somewhere but
I'm probably just going to use an online
tool that's like a CSV to JSON converter
but before I do that I want to go
through the results manually and remove
any remove any entries that have sort of
like whoops aah I got to do something
about the fact that I keep getting this
cable caught on me ok I'm going to I
want to remove so ok so hold on I'm also
now going to switch to this view so you
can't see oh look that you could see the
green paper
the reason I'm switching to this view is
I have learned my lesson and I don't
about opening a document that the jet
that that is a anybody can contribute to
who behind me on a live stream because
sometimes people it offensive language
and things in it so I'm going to do the
data cleaning while I talk to you maybe
I'll play some music in the background
how about some kittens a kitten song
well that's really loud so many
complaint that I play this dot too
offense will play this one okay all
right create a new spreadsheet create oh
you can't see what I'm looking at
anymore but you can see me so I'm just
looking here I'm going to delete these
entries that have no name
I'm doing some data cleaning live ok
delete this row I'm looking at
everybody's names yeah somebody has a
name that I am going to change all right
now I'm looking chewbacca new Mack
Keyser söze these are all fine these
are all fine these are all fine there's
some duplicate entries we might as well
I want to delete duplicate entries and
here's one with no name which I want to
delete ok
ok I'm going to delete here's some with
no ratings and look how are you nice
people nobody's put any here here's
another blank one with no name let's
remove this I'm just going to scan
through this ok I think we're good this
dot was the last entry was from this dot
so I think we're good ok now I'm going
to turn off accepting responses and I am
back okay so we're 113 responses I've
now turned off accepting responses I can
turn it back on later and what I'm going
to do is I'm going to export this this
is so it's ok what do I have here so
what a Google for I'm just using a
Google Form people enter their name and
then their rating for each one of these
and some people are missing ratings for
certain movies I think we can account
for that in the code but you know what I
kind of want to I'm going to I'm just
going to fill that I'm going to fill
these in because I think it'll just make
it easier with just some random numbers
some random ratings I want I like I
should have done this in advance
obviously wait hold on let's make it so
I can see all these on the screen oh my
god how many movies did I ask people to
rate okay I'm scrolling through as I
miss anything looks like I got there's
no here's a blank one sorry that I'm
ruining people's ratings but this is all
just for okay oops
ah okay alright I think everything's
there no blank ratings anymore these are
our ratings I'm now going to do export
where do I do export download as a CSV
got it I can close this I will now
accept responses again so if anybody
wants to use this dataset later it can
have more data in it I'm going to close
this and I'm going to look now at the
CSV file where did it go oh I guess it's
in like downloads or something okay
right here it is
so Star Wars dot CSV let's put this on
the desktop let's open this in Adam
where is where's where's Adam okay I'm
opening this in Adam okay here we go
so this looks good you know what oh so
I'm going to fix this right here I want
to have simpler headers so timestamp a
name and a 1 so that's episode oh no
that's episode 4 right episode ok
episode 5 this is clean data cleaning
101 episode 6 episode 7
now we're at oh no no no no episode 1
episode 2 this is very scientific
episode 3 and then we have now we have
episode 7 now we have rogue one rogue
Rouge rogue one and now we have the
holiday special holiday ok so now I have
my CSV which has a timestamp a name and
a set of ratings for each person ok so
I'm going to save this and now what I'm
going to do is I'm going to go to the
Internet and I'm going to say CSV to
JSON so CSV to JSON converter let's try
using this random website let's choose a
file and I'm going to go to the desktop
and what I want is oh wait convert CSV
to JSON select my input oh here choose a
file
starwars CSV and now let's just let's
just generate a download result
interesting so no no I don't like this I
want it I need a header input options
first rows column names great so let's
do this again look at this perfect I
have a nice big array with each name and
set of ratings great so now I'm going to
download the results and let's take a
look at this in atom as well
and now I have great so this is a JSON
file it now has just an array each
object has the name of the person who
submit it and the ratings for all of the
different Star Wars films okay Nick Nick
in the chat asked was ITP affected by
yesterday's Google Docs hack I don't
know if ITP in particular
affected but NYU certainly was I got
tons of emails but boy don't open this
don't open that yeah that's what thing
okay okay now what I'm going to do we're
getting somewhere
yeah scared myself by clapping I am
going to get set up to program something
so now what I need is don't look at what
I'm about to do I'm going to download p5
for the sixth time and I'm going to go
in here up and grab I'm going to turn
the camera back on I'm going to grab
empty example I am going to put it on
the desktop I am going to then go to the
desktop and rename empty example - let's
call it similarity score okay and I'm
going to open that in actually you know
what we should do
I'll just call this session what is the
session three and puts them similarity
score in there and then I'm going to
open session three in the atom editor
and I'm going to go back to terminal
what's all this stuff here oh my god why
do I have 18 million terminal windows
open I would like to close all of them I
am closing my terminal window song I
need some new music really do okay
what what I call it session three okay
let's go to another port and now back to
the browser and I have these examples
and I have these examples awesome
and this can go away this can go away
and I need this okay can you see this
yes or knows my question let's do this
okay so now what is next the next thing
I need to do is turn on this other
camera and watch this as always I always
forget to dis stop this stop it stop
this stop this stop I lose this pit stop
this stops in stock energy this stock
will stop is not this table this dock
this stop this dock this body so what
I'm going to do first is some sort of
intro video for this week's session is
going to talk about what sell this stock
sheena learning this stop general thanks
sis stop what's there what's some
different algorithms talk about the
difference between classifications were
diner should stop in then I am going to
show what some of the examples are
after that I will start doing the coding
challenge okay so any last questions
comments concerns complaints whoa did
the stream start over weird okay hold on
uh okay hold on a second am I here
everyone can see me I lost the YouTube
chat this computer may be disconnected
from the internet briefly didn't please
try again later hold on sorry everybody
I've got to get the YouTube chat back so
I'm going to see if I can do that
okay
so maybe that just didn't happen for me
I saw somebody with a message saying
chat broken
okay okay perfectly fine here we are
okay
I was offline for a few seconds yes
strangely enough the streamed out says
to me that I've only been streaming for
two minutes look at it which is clearly
not true okay oh there's some applause
it's coming for the room next story okay
how am I doing with my markers is a
question here's a marker here's a marker
look since this marker works I'm going
to use this part of the whiteboard
that's by the door nope this one's no
good let's try this one this one's good
okay great uh okay so let's get started
everybody okay thirty five minutes back
okay
do you guys hear that applause okay I
think I'm ready for this huh my watch is
beeping okay okay here we are
do you know why okay here we go
hello welcome to session three of the
nature of code intelligence and learning
so this is one of my opening videos for
these sessions if you are watching this
video as part of that playlist for the
intelligence and learning course you
will see a lot of videos in front of you
with a variety of demonstrations and
different coding challenges there will
also be a video at the end where I come
back and pose some ideas for an exercise
or assignment that you could try but
what I want to do in this particular
video is now now at the time this
courses were started with this little
warm-up of thinking about artificial
intelligence search algorithms and graph
systems took this turn and thought about
genetic algorithms and evolutionary
systems but you might be here because
you heard about this term machine
learning maybe even heard about this
term deep learning and you want to have
to get a sense of what does that mean
what are the possibilities with machine
learning and deep learning how do
machine learning systems work what are
they for what's the lingo for this sort
of stuff and and now's the time to get
into that now session three here I will
not be using any neural network yet so
what I want to do in session three is
just talk about what machine learning is
what its applications are so something
I'm going to cover here is
classification and regression what are
those terms mean and what are some
classic algorithms for performing
classification and regression and so I'm
going to look at something called
nearest neighbor similarity k nearest
neighbor and I'm also going to look at
something called linear regression and
so these will be some sort of classic
algorithms that you can play around with
and do some actually do stuff with and
then in session four we'll start looking
at what a neural network is and see how
we can use that as part of a machine
system okay you with me by the way I
barely know how to use this stuff so
you're watching this for an expert you
probably want to find somebody else on
YouTube but I'm learning the stuff
trying it out and hopefully you're gonna
come along and join me on the train
right I forgot we're on a train on this
ride on the train in the sky with me as
your guide do sky and guide rhyme I
think they do you'll see I I had to buy
it appointed by digress okay so um what
is machine learning so first of all one
thing that I might suggest for you if
you wanna watch some videos about
somebody who really knows what they're
talking about you I would suggest Andrew
Aang's a Coursera course a lot of my
knowledge and inspiration has come from
that course and Andrew Aang does a good
job of giving a nice introduction to
machine learning and to particular
references one is this definition this
quote from Arthur Samuels who is a
pioneer in the world of machine learning
of defining machine learning as a field
of study that gives computers the
ability to learn without being
explicitly programmed and so here's an
interesting thing we can think about
when we looked at the a-star algorithm
in session one for pathfinding we were
designing us the programmer writing an
algorithm to specifically perform a task
the computer would follow those
instructions and get to a result there
was an intelligence to that algorithm
there was the disappearance of sort of
the computer solving a problem in
thinking about it but ultimately we had
written the instructions the code for
the computer to solve to arrive at an
answer so what if instead of us writing
the instructions we would just set up a
framework for the computer to figure out
what the instructions might be what are
the right parameters for some type of
model to perform some sort of task so
this is the idea of machine learning and
I would encourage you to look at the
work of Arthur Samuels one of the things
that he did was train a computer to
learn to play checkers by just having it
play itself over and over and over again
thousands of times to be able to learn
what a good strategy was so but
ultimately so one of the things that I
want to talk about here is so let me let
me come up
the whiteboard here I have this readme
that I'll link to in the description you
can read some of the definitions instead
and information that's on that readme
but what I want to look at is this model
for this I'm going to describe to you
Michigan machine learning in this
particular way so there is some sort of
input that input is going to go into
some sort of algorithm some recipe I
think it's a nice way of thinking about
it some machine learning recipe and then
out of that machine learning recipe we
are going to get an output the input
into the machine learning recipe is
typically numeric so you could think of
it as you know a classic example that's
always given is what if we want to build
a machine learning system that can guess
the price of a house based on some
inputs so maybe we might say something
like oh the house has three bedrooms and
it has two bathrooms and it has 1,000
square feet and etc etc this is the
input into the machine learning recipe
and the output might come the house is
you know 1 million dollars something
like that nice house apparently
ok so this is what machine so typically
speaking another way of thinking about
machine learning is making sense of data
so I have some sort of data and I want
to make sense of it have some input and
some output so two kinds of output that
you'll see in many most machine learning
algorithms are classification classic Oh
timeout no timeout I can't spell where's
my eraser here's my eraser time in one
kind of output is classification
classification another kind of output is
regression so what you might not have
realized here is
example that I gave to you where the
parameters of the house a data point
goes into the machine learning recipe
and we get this price output this is
actually regression regression refers to
predicting some sort of continuous
numeric output whereas classification
refers to taking an input and
classifying it into a discrete set of
labels so here might be another scenario
I have an image of a cat that is the
input into the machine learning recipe
and the output is something like this
well I'm getting it usually the output
comes at numeric so we have to sort of
figure out what this could mean but you
know I'm speaking in a kind of higher
level terms here so I'm just going to
say the output is cat I am labeling it
maybe the only possible options are cat
versus dog so what that output actually
is is something like you know point nine
point one like there's a 90% chance this
is a cat 10% chance it's a dog so this
is classification attempting to assign a
discrete label to something like an
image we could have done something with
the house data using class the
classification we could say you know
fancy house you know summer house winter
house you know we could classify into
one of two categories
that's classification regression getting
a continuous numeric output I'm going to
pause for a second and think about what
I'm doing in this particular video and
where I want to go next let me see if
there's anything in the chat that people
are asking a question okay what about
clustering yeah so I need to get to all
this stuff all right okay let me have a
little bit of water here I'm looking in
the chat okay people are talking about
how you can't get even a one-bedroom
flat in London for a million dollars
New York City is just as bad okay okay
so how does this work so number one is
we've got to at some point start talking
about what are some different recipes
that could go in here and I could name
you a few for example k nearest neighbor
this is a particular algorithm that can
work for both classification and
regression I could say something like
support vector machine or I could say
artificial neural network and then there
are a variety of flavors so to speak of
styles and of artificial neural networks
convolutional neural network recurrent
neural network so this is something I
ultimately intend to spend a lot of time
on what is an artificial neural network
how does it work and why is it effective
to put it in here but even with all of
the amazing innovation that's happening
in machine learning and deep learning
right now there's a lot that you can do
without artificial neural networks a lot
of simple fun exercises and things so in
this particular session session 3 I'm
going to look at other algorithms that
are non artificial neural network non
neural network based that become the
machine learning must be like K nearest
neighbor but let's take a moment here to
talk about how it overall this works
because the thing is this doesn't just
happen magically you can't just you know
the point of doing this is that at some
day we might want to put an unknown
image in here and get a classification
label for that image
but how can a machine learning recipe do
that from nothing and it can't so one of
the things I want to talk about here is
how does this work so before you can
actually use machine learning to make
predictions for unknown data you need to
train the system so the training step
involves so there there are several
different strategies for how machine
learning
can learn in order to perform operations
like this one is called supervised
learning and supervised learning is is
the strategy that I'm going to use in
just about everything that I do in this
particular course from session 3 right
now and on although I will come back to
some other techniques as well another
kind of learning is unsupervised
learning and another kind of learning
that I really love my favorite kind of
learning is reinforcement learning fact
I have a whole book all about
reinforcement learning that I'm reading
right now ok so what are these different
and you know there's something called
semi-supervised learning and there's
little variations on this but these are
three core types of learning that can be
applied to the machine learning process
let's start with reinforcement learning
for a second reinforcement learning is
the kind of learning where an agent
observes the environment and chooses an
action you can think of a mouse trying
to get through a maze the mouse looks
around there's a wall here there's a
wall here there's a wall here the mouse
decides to go left the mouse or the
mouse decide just go right and then once
the mouse makes that decision the mouse
receives a reward that could be a
positive or negative reward and you know
as the mouse receives more positive
rewards for certain kinds of actions it
does more of those actions over the long
term and gets better and better at
things so that's reinforcement learning
I'm going to spend a whole session
looking at this at some point and we're
going to see some techniques I have an
example that uses a kind of
reinforcement style learning to train a
to play the autonomously play the game
flappy bird ok unsupervised learning is
a kind of learning that's generally
applied to data that you know nothing
about so I have a hundred thousand songs
and I just want to kind of learn like
what patterns are there in the songs
so typically unsupervised learning is
applied to problems like clustering so I
have all this data and I want to kind of
figure out how can this data be arranged
in groups could I have an I don't know
anything about it could an algorithm
figure out based on patterns
the data how to group that data how to
cluster that data so I don't know that
this is something that I'm going to
spend any time snot on my current
trajectory slash syllabus but it is
something that I would like to do at
some point in the future and there's
actually have some ideas for some stuff
I want to do about that eventually okay
but here we're gonna give a nice little
star and heart and a little smiley face
and like a little rainbow for supervised
learning because this is what I'm going
to use in most of most of my examples
over the next several videos the idea of
supervised learning is I have training
data training data so number one I have
training data number two I have test
data and number three I have the rest of
the world universe of data so maybe we
could call this unknown unintel unknown
data so how does this work so first what
we do in supervised learning is we take
this training data we have a huge
database of a spreadsheet of bedrooms
bathrooms and square footage for houses
with their actual price that they sold
at so we have a data set that has the
parameters and some sort of target often
called a target so this would be like
the training data with the inputs and a
target the idea is the inputs go into
the machine learning recipe they come
out the other side and some sort of
guest is made maybe they were pried the
house actually sold for 1.5 million
dollars but the guess was 1 million
dollars
ah so the machine learning recipe got it
wrong so we turn some knobs here but
mess around with it to try to get it to
have a better result that's towards what
that error is we're going to talk a lot
about this error and that sort of thing
or to come back to this many many times
so we do this over and over again with
lots and lots of training data turning
all the knobs
to get it to do a good job then what we
do is we have test data now test data is
just like the training data it's data
that has inputs with a known result a
known result that we should get but we
didn't actually use it while training
because we have this issue a machine
learning recipe might perform really
really well with the training data but
not with actual other data so to see how
well it's working we've actually got to
give it data that we didn't use to train
and that's called the test data so we
would feed that see how well it does
evaluate and evaluate the performance
and say like ah you know what it got all
the test data right it's ready it's all
grown up our machine learning recipe is
ready to go and we send it out into the
world to start interacting with unknown
data so this is really the process this
is supervised learning it's saying hey
I'm the teacher this is the machine
learning system I'm going to teach the
system with mine own data with known
output I'm going to test the data with
separate known inputs and known outputs
and then it's going to be all grown up
it's going to graduate I'm going to send
it out into the world and yadda yadda
yadda you know more by the way I plan on
doing a lot of yadda yadda yadda neural
network stuff like I said we might get
to like and then you have to do this
like calculus thing yadda yadda that's
so I think that's a good good good
practice to yadda yadda yadda machine
learning as much as possible
okay so pause again for a second let's
see what have I missed where am i where
am i oh I could you couldn't really see
what I was writing over towards the edge
but that's fine where am I in time why's
anybody in slack keeping track of about
how long that was
okay I'm looking at the chat not seeing
everything okay so what did I miss I
talked about classification and
regression I kind of talked about what
supervisor talked about supervised
learning is is involved did you guys
learn anything was there anything new
that anybody watching didn't know I feel
like I'm trying to be very beginner
friendly in terms of this sort thing I
disconnected from the I lost the
internet again for a brief second so
weird and I lost the YouTube chat so let
me fix that I can't check how long I've
been streaming because it keeps cutting
out okay so hold on everybody I've got
to get back to the good news is even if
the stream crashes out and that sort of
thing I'm recording to disk so I lost
I've lost a lot of people I know there
was like 800 people at one point okay so
I've got the YouTube chat again okay
okay so here I come
and okay okay
okay so what I'm going to do is actually
you know what I'm going to do hold on
sorry everybody I'm thinking about this
examples do I have a list of examples
here now how come I know that my oh I
guess I think they're so good at do I
have it on the wiki for homework too
maybe
wait that's some work homework three no
okay that's some all right so that's
fine so okay so I'm just going to so
that's up for brief introduction to what
machining learning is overall and what
some of the sort of key aspects of how a
machine learning system works but we're
going to get into a lot more about the
details here and we're going to look at
a variety of different kinds of recipes
that can be put in here and how they
work with different kinds of data like
which recipe do you want to work with
images which recipe would you want for
working with text for this for this kind
of classification so this kind of
regression but right now I'm going to
move on and start looking at nearest
neighbor what is this thing called
nearest neighbor how can I look at two
different pieces of data so let me um so
I have a bunch of pre-made examples in
some of the if you follow along with the
playlist you're going to see a bunch of
examples where I code stuff from scratch
but I won't be able to do I'm not going
to do a video for every single one of
these examples I mean maybe I will
someday but for the first thing that I'm
really going to start looking at is and
this is an example inspired by this is
an example inspired by Rebecca fie brink
who has a wonderful course called I
think machine learning for musicians and
artists from the company cadenza I'll
put a link to that in this video's
description or she uses a tool that she
built called Weka neener to do
classification and regression a variety
of other things so she does a lot of
stuff with gestural interfaces and you
single output so one of the things I
want to look at I'm going to hit play
here can you hear that hold on
of a stop yeah I think you can't hear
that start Hold'em I'm not you might
have to edit this okay
so hold on yeah why does this keep going
to sleep okay okay so I'm gonna hit play
here and what you're going to see is as
I move the mouse near a particular note
the note changes c d e f and this is
actually a classification this is an
example of classification what I'm doing
is I have two dimensional data a
Cartesian coordinate system and I want
to classify every XY point to a
particular note this is classification
so the nearest note is the note that I
play I can actually switch this example
to perform regression and this is an
example now of regression you can hear I
make a prediction based on a weighted
distance so here I essentially have an
average of C and G I'm hearing the
little G I'm at a frequency between G
and C you can hear G C G C so this is
these are the kind of examples that I
want to build to get you started with
understanding the algorithms and have
some ideas for some creative
possibilities that you can do and then
we're going to just keep going so okay
so stay tuned there'll be a bunch of
videos in this playlist where I go
through a few different examples and
scenarios I'll come back with another
video with some homework ideas and
hopefully you'll make some stuff and
share with me and live your life in this
world / universe / place and maybe give
somebody a hug or say something nice to
somebody because those are good things
to do - okay see you in a future video
all right um okay so there we go I think
that's my that's my course yeah yes
there is also a deep learning tensorflow
course on cadenza actually have an
enchant to really dig into that which I
would really like to okay so now I am
ready to do some actual coding I think
what I probably should do
is erase this does anybody have any
questions that I miss anything sort of
important I'm going to erase this and
what we're going to do is use similarity
scores okay
so now I need a my set up okay so let me
close to here I'm going to go to here
similarity score open up the console
then I'm going to go to atom and what I
need is that data file desktop and Star
Wars oh wait no downloads where was the
artists so what I want to do is copy
this into session three similarity score
and I want to rename it I'm going to
call it movies Jason Jason Jason Jason
Jason just soul there's just soul movies
and it's here okay one thing I think I
just want to see here is sometimes p5 is
a little bit finicky with loading
loading data that's just a kind of a
JSON array without being wrapped inside
of an object so let's just see what
happens here for a second
okay it was fine with that it's just a
plain old array I sort of feel like oh
look we missed a holiday rating that's
fine that'll be an interesting thing to
do
I do think though even though that works
I do also want to change the JSON file
to be an actual object so I'm going to
there's a lot of data in here I'm going
to wrap the whole thing in an object go
back up to the top please and I'm going
to say something like movies are no
critics right and it's not really
critics what is it people users let's
just call it users and so now if I do
this object users is an array with 103
okay I like this better
okay so I guess I can leave this I'm
going to say no canvas okay and then you
draw okay uh switch cameras ah crap
sorry everybody sorry I do need a
notification system sorry about that
everybody
boy I was doing that for quite a while
huh so sorry okay alright so let me just
show you what I did I was just mucking
around with this JSON file and I wrapped
it in a user's okay sorry about that
everybody okay it would be good if what
I could do is if I have the volume on
this computer these are a way for slack
those of you in the patron group to be
able to make slack play a sound without
it just being the sound that it always
plays I don't know okay
alright so let's go forward here and
let's do this okay
all right I am ready for I turn this
camera back on how's everybody doing
okay ready for this okay
it's my inspirational music I got it
like figure out okay and see look it's a
lot of whistling oh my god that's a long
trolling sound okay can I share the JSON
I don't know of an easy way to do that
people want to code along with me let me
think about this yeah this is what I'm
going to do I have some random Dropbox
account
on this computer and so what I'll do is
what I'm going to do is go to the
desktop into my let me put session three
here session three I'm going to take the
movies JSON and go into Dropbox and then
I'm going to do share copy Dropbox link
and well that's great
Wow so hopefully somebody can you know
freeze-frame this and copy down this
link sorry I should have a better way of
doing I could tweet it out let me tweet
it via coding train the coding train
Twitter yeah is that going to be noise
for random people shorten it okay
shorten a good idea okay paste Binet all
sorts of options let me just use bitly
come on people
okay so let me put it in here I thought
that Dropbox has its own link shortening
okay so there you go I'm sure I could
customize it if I logged into an account
you're saying but that should work okay
great so you should have that JSON file
hopefully somebody caught that in here
okay
okay use the Force
I don't have any type need to use the
Force good idea okay pastebin yeah I
could have used paceman that would have
been good too
okay somebody else make a pastebin fig
and put it in the chat very hard to read
the chat I'm doing my best
it's 5:10 I got it I gotta get movin
here okay and here we go let's see
you
okay ready everybody doing my hair
makeup hair would it be great just like
people started wandering in putting
makeup and doing my hair on me I'll be
great I'm one person operation here okay
here we go
really loud
let's try the whip instead hello welcome
to another episode coding challenge of
the coding train and what I'm going to
do okay okay stop whistling my train
that train whistles a lot okay let me
forget the whistle if we start over
again hello welcome to another episode
of the coding train and I'm going to do
a coding challenge and what I'm going to
do in this coding challenge in honor of
may the fourth Star Wars day is I am
going to make a simple movie
recommendation engine where what I have
I've collected a lot of ratings from the
coding train community of all the
different Star Wars films you can see
alkis here ratings are five five five
two four five four based on the episode
number rogue one and no rating for the
holiday special you know what though I'm
gonna I think Alka what Alka give me a
rating Alka you're in the chat right now
give me a rating for the holiday special
let's see if there's any other null no
there's a lot of nulls for the holiday
special you know what we're going to
leave those nulls in there we're going
to work around the nulls that's going to
be part of our challenge here to deal
with the fact that some people don't
have ratings for particular movies okay
so what am I going to do the first thing
that I want to do in order to build this
movie recommendation system and first I
should mention a couple things number
one is most of the code that I'm going
to write even though I'm going to write
it from scratch is essentially the same
code that's in this book collective
intelligence and it's a wonderful book
it's from you know I think probably from
like eight years ago at this point I
think this is 2008 or 2009 but it's good
my knowledge is old still try to get
there and so I highly recommend this for
you I read this book again about a month
ago and so I'm sure whatever ideas are
in there are still in my head that's
ultimately what I'm going to end up
programming here the book is in Python
by the way so if you want to see a
Python version I'm going to build this
all as an interactive example in the
browser using javascript so what is this
a part of so before I actually get to
coding this is part of a set of videos
where the topic is really K nearest
neighbor
in this case I'm gonna not worry about
the K right now I just want to think
about nearest neighbor what I want to be
able to do is you know Alka and find
somebody else and haba
LW GQ and Hubbell WA Alka and Hal bucha
have both rated movies are they similar
do they rate movies in a similar way
do they have similar tastes how could we
numerically establish whether people who
are rating movies are have similar
tastes or not similar States and that
has to do with nearest neighbor that has
to do with this idea of the similarity
score now there are a lot of different
ways you can calculate a similarity
score and the kind of similarity score
I'm going to use in this video is a one
of the easiest simplest ones called
Euclidean distance
Euclid being the mathematician who
invented a lot of geometry stuff and so
Euclidean distance meaning actually just
the sort of distance in space between
these two people now what does that even
mean these are people rating movies they
don't lit with space they live in out
Wow how did that mean that they're far
right now if I said to you what's the
distance between this little dot and
this little star where we could pull out
a ruler and actually measure that
distance in inches and centimeters and
pixels this would be Euclidean distance
the actual length between these two
things Euclidean distance on a
two-dimensional plane so with X Y values
it's sort of easy to think about
distance the same thing goes for XYZ
values in fact in this room I could have
you know this hand here and this hand
here and how far away are there I could
measure that's the Euclidean distance
but let me let me ask you something what
have you thought about color for a
second color is our G and B at least
digital color has a red green and blue
value so what if I have two red green
and blue values I have color one and I
have color two which might be our two
r2d2 can I please just have a read
what's a con it starts with D I'm sure
we get a million comments with
interesting colors it starts with D well
I wrote it Rhett R - G - B - right I can
have R 1 G 1 B 1 I can't even do it
anymore
point is I could have two colors and I
could actually think of the distance
between those two colors in the same way
that I might calculate the distance
between two XYZ points after all it's
three values and in fact if I have four
values or five values I can use the same
formula that I would use to calculate
the distance between two points in XY
space between two points in five seven
ten dimensional spaces are very hard for
us to imagine in our heads what that
would look like but the math is the same
what is that math that math is actually
based on the Pythagorean theorem if this
is point a and this is point B and the
sides I probably should have not called
these a B but at the sides of this
triangle a B and C C is the distance
between those two points and a squared
plus B squared equals C squared so C
equals the square root of a squared plus
B squared and in three-dimensional space
a squared plus B squared plus F squared
form M plus G squared these are the X
differences the Y differences so this is
ultimately what we're going to do now at
the end I'll show you why there are some
I'll talk about why there are some
issues with leek Lydia distance and
other ways of calculating similarity but
ultimately what I've now established is
with these two let's say both of these
critics have evaluated have rated given
a star rating to five movies all I need
to do is get a distance score which is
the square root of the rating of movie
one - move of movie one algas movie one
- so al cos mu v1 minus H mu V 1 squared
+ al cos mu V 2 minus H mu V 2 squared
etc etc etc for all five of those movies
so this is what where we're going to
start and eventually this is going to
lead us to be able to get recommend
for a new person who comes in and maybe
hasn't rained one of these movies to
calculate guess whether they like it or
not okay coming back over here let's
start to write some code now so the
first thing that I need to do is I need
to load all this data so I'm going to go
into sketched out yet oh look I already
did it
lucky me I actually wrote some code
before I started so let's close some of
this stuff here so let's just make let's
take a look and make sure that this data
is actually loading into our sketch I'm
going to go to the browser and I'm going
to go and open this up
it's an Alera t-score it's not happened
here why do I have this error here save
there we go I don't know why that didn't
work but it's working now and you can
see I loaded there is an object that it
loaded with a property called users and
that users is an array of 103 users each
one of them has a set of ratings for all
of these movies okay great
so first thing that I want to do is I
want to make something where the user
can select two different critics by
which to calculate a similarity score so
the way I'm going to do that is by two
little drop-down menus so so what do I
need to do so the first thing I want to
do is I want to save our users equals
data users now I want to loop through
all of those users and I'm just going to
say console dot log users index I dot
and what was it what was their their
name is their name by the way because
all this data came in beat all this data
came in via Google form I'll put a link
to that Google Form and that's what this
time stamp is this is the time that on
may the fourth this was submitted okay
so let's just make sure that works and
there we go look tentacle shift pip jr.
is somehow participating in this there
is no Daniel Shipman jr. Leo okay look
at all these people
okay z3r oh okay so now okay so what do
I want to do let's p5 has some functions
for creating a drop-down menus
and so I'm going to say person 1 equals
create select and var person 2 equals
create select and then I'm going to say
so create select should give me whoa I
have an error oh I don't have the Dom
library so one thing I'm starting using
the Dom library so I need to make sure I
have a reference to the Dom library so
let's try this again so we can see there
are two drop-down menus here and this
very silly page that has this
unnecessary styling in it okay oops so
let's make that a little bigger so I
could see I have two drop-down menus but
nobody in them yet so what I want to do
now is I want to say person 1 dot option
users index dot name and I want to do
that with person 2 as well so actually I
want to call this drop-down one I think
this wheeler call this drop-down one and
this B drop-down too so now we should
see here I've got these drop-down menus
so what I want to be able to do is just
say okay I want to look at code land
which was a wonderful conference by the
way and he walks and calculate a
similarity score so I probably want a
button too so let's let's create a
button I can actually just do that right
in here using the Dom library as well I
can say create button submit and there
we go and so I can do this
okay so alka and unicorn what's the
similarity score submit I want to get
the syllabary similarity score okay so
we have a little interactive system set
up here we go we're getting somewhere
okay so button dot mousepressed
and button dot mousepressed a similarity
like let's call this Euclidean Euclidean
similarity boy that's really hard to
spell you Euclidian similarity so that's
a new function I need to write
function Euclidean some Euclidean
similarity so now what I want to do is
get who are the two people that I want
to look up var person 1 equals person 1
equals drop-down 1 value so the value
function in p5 gives me the current
selected value of the drop-down menu and
person 2 is drop down to value okay now
let's try console logging person 1 and
person 2 let's just make sure this works
Alki unicorn and we can see alka unicorn
there okay so we're getting somewhere
now what I need to do is say I need to
write the algorithm that's going to and
what is this down here that I have open
time out for a second how do I get rid
of this unnecessary extra menu down here
oh it command J brought it up by
accident or something okay oh I realized
that it's an array so I don't have the I
don't I need like a lookup table you
need to make an object because I'm going
to need to make an object okay I'm in it
I'm going to keep going here
Mattia this is an edit point clearly
okay so I just realized something
I have the two people that I want to
compare but I don't have it easy without
their names but I don't have an easy way
of accessing their data and that's
because my JSON file just came in as
like a giant array so I could look
through the whole array to find the
ratings for each one of those people but
that's not going to be great so what I
want to actually do is and I'm sure
there's I have to think about if there's
a nicer way to do this but what I want
to do is I want to create a lookup table
that is essentially called
and where did I say I call this bar
users but really what I want to do with
this is I want this to be an empty
object because I'm going to actually
have this users variable become a lookup
table for all the data associated with
each user by their lookup by their name
so this loop I'm just going to take data
users data users name data users name so
I'm going to forget about this variable
as being this sort of shorter version of
data users and just use data that users
there and then what I'm going to do is
I'm going to say users index so you know
what I would like to do is var name
equals data users index I name and I'm
going to put the name as the drop-down
option and then say users name equals
data dot users index I so in other words
all of the stuff is in an array that's
how it came in and this JSON file I
could reorganize the JSON file to work
in a different way but I'm just going to
build a lookup table here in the code I
might as well so now I'm just going to
show you the difference here if I say
console dot log data and console dot log
users I think you'll see in the console
what I mean so I'm going to hit refresh
and I'm going to pull this over here now
look at this this is data data is just a
big array 103 users each one lookup by
its inverter actually here doesn't
matter at all this next thing is
actually every I look through all of the
names I'm going to happen to remove this
hold on all of you watching the live
stream can enjoy the profanity I'm going
to remove this entry here want to find
it
what's a nice name app Mingo today mango
this user has now been renamed to mango
I'm going to rerecord that little spot
there I'm also going to take this
opportunity to blow my nose okay let's
close this and hit refresh okay oops
this computer went to sleep okay so this
this is the original array and you can
see look at that it's just an ordered
list where each critic is a lookup by
its index but this is useless to us the
order doesn't actually matter
so I've reworked the data and now I have
an object where each particular critic
is actually listed by their name so I
can instantly see Corey's ratings are
right here look up by Corey so now that
I have that in my code if I come back to
the code
I can now I don't need this console log
anymore I can now say console I'm just
going to a console dot log users index
person one console dot log users index
person to now you might be asking
yourself oh wait person one is a string
but you're using array syntax users
index person one JavaScript objects are
collections of key value pairs and I can
access the key of an object like I could
say users index Dan or I could say users
index Dan these are 100% well these are
identical but a lot of times Dan might
have a space in it and so this is a
completely invalid syntax but this is
valid syntax so I have a whole video
tutorial about this topic in particular
called what is an associative array I'm
going to link to that in this video's
description so if this is new syntax for
you you could pause here and go watch
that video and then come back okay but
I'm going to move on now okay so let's
just see if I have both ratings
and what I'm going to do is I'm going to
sorry ah where am I too much stuff here
I'm going to now hit refresh and I'm
gonna hit submit and look at this I have
Alka &amp;amp; Alka and now I'm going to go
switch to Alka and unicorn I'm gonna hit
submit and I have Alka and unicorns
ratings so we can see I've got those
objects with the Rings now it's finally
time how long is this video going on are
you still watching if you are thank you
very much I'm going to actually do the
similarity score now okay so what do I
need to do okay so first of all I need
to get all of the movies associated with
this particular person now this is a
little bit tricky actually because once
again I haven't been too thoughtful
about how I structured this data so the
data has all of these movies and these
particular time stamps so you know what
I'm going to do this is a little bit
silly because I could I'm just going to
have an extra thing I'm going to
hard-code in the list of all the movies
just to make this a little bit easier
I could certainly extrapolate this I
probably should do that let's
extrapolate it what I want to do is get
rid of a time stamp and name so what I'm
going to do what I'm going to do this is
fine
sorry I've thought about this stuff
before it started there's a lot of
different ways I could approach this I'm
thinking it through right now but one
thing I'm going to do is I'm going to
say VAR titles so the movie titles
equals object keys person 1 so this is
going to give me an array of all of the
keys that are part of person 1 what are
those things they are time stamped name
and all of these now I want to ignore
time step in knee so then what I'm going
to do is I'm going to loop through all
of the titles
and I'm going to say raiding 1 equals
okay
so the actual title is titles index I
and then I'm going to say you know what
I should do let's remove from the array
titles will this actually work can I say
let's let's think about this
let's what's the best way to so if I say
VAR titles equals a b c titles dot split
it's never going to I could say titles
dot index of B right and then titles dot
splice 1 comma 1 and so that removed B
so what I'm going to do this is this is
a little bit awkward is I'm going to say
I equals titles index of name and I'm
going to just say titles dot splice I
comma 1 I just want to clean the data
here a little bit I don't want the name
I don't want the timestamp title J is
titles index of timestamp so that should
work so now I should be able to see a
console.log title let's take a look at
this hit submit and I got huh 0 1 what
okay titles equals object keys what's
wrong here hold on I'm like looking at
the chat like noticing what I did wrong
with a little edit point Mattia okay
what did I what's going on here yeah
okay so first of all let me get rid of
these console logs titles
zero one two three hmm
oh the keys ah I'm not okay sorry
everybody
I'm Ron a boy I made a silly error which
is important okay I'm back I made a
silly Eric this is not the full object
the whole reason I built that users
table was so that I could grab the full
object so I don't want the keys
associated with person one person one is
just the name so this is really name one
this is name - now person one the whole
thing or I could actually could say like
ratings one is opt is is users name one
ratings two is users name - then what I
want to do is get all of the titles
ratings one so let's look at that
because okay they're all the titles but
it has timestamp and name in it
so now if I console.log titles again
after removing them we should see there
we go what the array with net times they
have a name and now here it is removed
and so now what I can do is I can get
rid of these console logs and how I can
actually do is say rating one equals
ratings for that ratings one for that
title rating two equals ratings two for
that title so this is me looking at each
and every one of those ratings one at a
time and now I want to look at the
difference the difference between how
did user one rate episode four and how
did user to rate episode four so so now
I'm going to say var difference equals
rating 1 - rating - this is if I come
back over here this the difference
squared and in the formula I need to
square that difference sum all the
squares of the difference in
the square root again lots of other
formulas we could apply the square root
calculation is perhaps unnecessary here
and it's expensive but I'm going to do
it the standard traditional way so what
do I need to do I need to add up the
squares of all these differences I'm
going to say sum equals zero sum of
squares and so now I'm going to say sum
of squares plus equals difference times
difference and now I'm going to say I'm
going to say square root of difference
equals the square root of the sum of the
squares and actually this is the
distance so this is now the distance so
what I'm going to do now is I'm going to
say create P distance so let's look at
this okay create P distance so we're now
going to see let's see if we get
something here now if I do to alka and
alka if everything works correctly I
should get a distance of zero zero right
because two people he's out cut is
identical to alka okay now I'm going to
switch to Alka and unicorn and I also
got zero
hmm I'm a little bit concerned here Alka
and he walks zero okay I don't like the
way this is going but let's see if I
have an error hi I can see it in the
chat already look at this
ratings 1 equals oh no no no no up here
name two very important that I actually
get this ratings from the second user so
that was very important that they
actually sorry aha
very important that I actually get the
ratings from the second user if I get
the ratings from name one name one it's
going to be wrong so now let's go back
and say Alka and Alka have a similarity
score of zero and unicorn and al-qaida
similarity score of six point three two
now here's the thing if they're more
similar the numbers should actually be
higher and if they're really far apart
that number should
lower I want to have a similarity score
where the more similar two people are
the higher their score so what I really
want to do is make some adjustments to
the formula so one way to invert a value
is to actually say similarity equals one
divided by D right I want to invert the
distance if if the distance is 10 I get
1 divided by 10 which is a bigger number
then if the distance were 21 divided by
20 but here's a problem what if the
distance was 0 so a nice way that I can
fix that is just say 1 plus D what this
will actually give me is a number
between 0 &amp;amp; 1
because if the two people are identical
1 divided by 1 plus 0 is 1 divided by 1
a similarity score of 1 and if D went to
infinity like the distances as far away
as possible
1 divided by infinity approaches 0 so I
have some number between 0 &amp;amp; 1 so we can
now see Alka and alcoves and so now I
want to create P and let me actually
change this to what I'm going to do is
I'm going to say I'm going to make a
variable called result P and I'm not
really being thoughtful about how I'm
designing this at all and we say result
P equals create P with nothing in it and
then so I'm just going to instead of
creating a new paragraph element each
time I'm just going to replace what is
in that existing paragraph element with
the new similarity score so here we go
alka and alka similarity score of 1
alkane unicorn similar score point 1 3
alcove and Ewoks
similarity score of point 1 9 let's
scroll with Chewbacca
I saw a Chewbacca in here Chewbacca
Chewbacca and the Ewoks a similar score
of 0.1 6 6 6 6 6
okay so similarity score between two
people what have I missed so one thing
is there were some ratings that were no
so I gotta watch out for this what am I
getting if I have a null rating so let's
just say if rating 1 equals no console
dot log null so let's just check this
did Alka have yes Oh Alka had one
particular rating that was null so what
happens when I say no - null it probably
javascript is sort of worked itself out
anyway but I what I really should do is
check and make sure if either of these
ratings is null or undefined so I can't
say not because it could be zero and
that would evaluate to false I guess in
this case the only only value of getting
is null based on my data so this is
going to be fine but I might have to be
more thoughtful about error checking
ultimately but as long as rating one is
null and rating two is not is not equal
to null
I could go forward and continue to do
this so so here we are now the only
issue I maybe might get is if somebody
didn't rate anything I'm ultimately
going to get a similarity score of one
but anyway error checking aside I could
do a better job of that at least I'm now
checking to make sure there isn't a
particular value of null okay so here we
go unicorn and this dot and we have our
similarity score okay now I'm going to
end this particular video here and what
I'm going to do the whole point of this
was I want to start thinking ups
I'm sorry hold on okay about how long
this is probably very long okay okay so
we've come to the end of this particular
video I would encourage you to try
getting this code get your own data make
a different data set see what you can do
with this worm idea of similarity scores
and here's an exercise for you which I'm
going to do in the next video what if I
wanted to take any user and just give me
a list of the five most similar users
and this is the next step we need for
something called K nearest neighbor
because what I want to do is start to
evaluate to look at how can I find based
on all the data what can I find that's
similar to similar to me and so that's
something I'm going to do in the next
video and that's going to lead us
towards this idea of making a
recommendation system for a new user who
might not have rated all the movies how
can we then predict a rating for a movie
that that new user hasn't watched that's
coming the other thing I'll mention is
something you might want to look into is
the something called the Pearson
correlation score so one one issue with
Euclidean distance is that let's say i
let's say the ewok rates all the movies
four and five four and five four and
five four and five stars chewbacca
rates all the movies one-and-two
one-and-two one-and-two stars well let's
say that for every movie that the ewok
rates of for chewbacca rates a one and
for every movie that the ewok rates of
five chewbacca rates a two their
different score might be quite their
distant score might be quite far apart
but their tastes are actually quite
similar so the Pearson correlation is a
way of calculating a similarity score
that kind of accounts for that
difference in range it has to do with
fitting the data to a line and looking
at the slope of that line if I were to
graph all of Chewbacca's scores and they
look
kind of like this and we're to graph all
of the ewoks scores they look like this
well even though the ewok scores are all
much lower it's the same shape as
Chewbacca
so the Pearson correlation would be a
very high similarity
whereas if Chewbacca scores looked like
this then they're going to be up it's
going to be very low similarity so I do
have this built and you can check this
particular video's description for a
link to an example that has the Pearson
correlation score built into it maybe
I'll come back and do that as a coding
challenge but it's a bit of an ancillary
point to this particular video okay
maybe I'll see you in the next one
all right um uh okay I think this is
like the most boring livestream ever am
i right about that it's already 5:45 I'm
in the wrong camera here ahem sorry I
don't know why I got to get something
more excited going here maybe people are
actually learning something okay uh here
we go okay so next what I'm gonna do
next what I'm going to do is I'm going
to do the K nearest neighbors okay all
right let's think about this fire alarm
was exciting yeah not false yeah start
drinking boring spice it up yeah I don't
know what to do here let's uh maybe it's
Thursday I should really be doing these
things on Friday what are you gonna do
what are you gonna do okay uh all right
let's move on
okay so what I'm going to do now is I'm
going to so this is random this is noise
/ Lee noise that is in the core random
algorithm the actual random algorithm
itself those numbers aren't related at
all some victory I'm picking red numbers
40 zero ten nine two seven six one nine
four eight nine two one
three I think nine a lot fairly but with
pearly noise I might pick numbers like
this two three four three four five six
five four five six seven five six seven
five six seven eight nine eight seven
six
these look like Perlin noise performance
part I'm doing like some changes here
too
three four five six five these are like
girls enjoys performance apart with
curly noise I might pick numbers like
this for three four five six five four
purling noise that is early noise this
is Hurley noise that is Hurley noises
this is Hurley noise that is Hurley no
so this is Hurley noise that is her
pearling know her pearling all right
this is Hurley noise that is Hurley
noise I guess is Hurley noise that is
her legal so this is Hurley noise that
is because I played the harlot music in
person this is her ocean something that
is pearl it is Harley energy by F Weaver
available it sounds loud but with curly
noise I might pick numbers like this
whoa two three okay three four five six
okay I think we're ready this is like
Berlin noise performance part okay those
were the times of yes of yester your
when I used to make entertaining videos
okay uh alright here we go now we are
going to be in a new video part 2 of
this tutorial
okay okay here we go okay part 2 here we
are with I made some changes now I have
a web application that lists all the
possible users in my system and I can
pick the biskits King for example and
hit submit nothing happens yet but what
I want to do is hit submit and I want to
see the five most similar users to the
biskits King this is leading us towards
this idea of K nearest neighbor with K
being five so mackay being three show me
the three nearest K being ten show me
the ten nearest so again I'm not fully
implementing the whole K nearest
neighbor algorithm for a machine
learning problem yet but I'm just kind
of looking at the pieces of it along the
way of kind of doing some stuff so okay
flip this are you excited
the last video if you watch the previous
one was so boring I thought but maybe
you watch it me do you enjoy this one's
gonna be probably pretty boring but I
have lots of energy now cuz here we go
okay
so so all I did by the way as I changed
it to just having one drop down menu and
here's another thing this was kind of
terrible and this by the way I should
call this Euclidean distance and I don't
like what I did with this at all what I
should do is pass in to people right
because really what I should be saying
is this general function this should be
a general function that can look at the
Euclidean distance whoops between two
people and I'm going to and boy I really
don't like the way
I get so many terrible things in the
last example that I don't like but
that's fine
I want this function you know it was
stilling that I put this in the HTML
right here what I really want is that
for this function to return that
similarity score so I want to have a
generic function that receives two names
and returns that similarity score so now
what I have is when I press the mouse
and I say find nearest neighbors when I
press the mouse I want to find the
nearest neighbors so that's my function
find nearest neighbors and to whom who
are the nearest neighbors name is
drop-down dot value so I want to find
the nearest neighbors to name okay so
who what am i what what bye bye goodness
what am I going to do here so in order
to find the five nearest neighbors what
I actually unfortunately need to do is
calculate the similarity score for
everybody and then sort that list by the
most similar and take the top five okay
so how are we going to do that well
luckily for us we happen to have this
nice array of in data users that's the
array of everything so what I can do is
I can say let's go loop through data
users index data users length and what I
want to say is I want to look at
somebody else other equals data users
index I and as long as other is not
equal to name like I don't want to check
my similarity rating against myself as
long as other is not equal to name I
want to get my similarity score between
Euclidean distance we calculated this in
the previous video if you didn't watch
that link in the description below
setter etcetera between myself name and
other so I want to look at all those
similarity scores now where am I going
to put those similarity scores well
there's a variety of places I could put
them but why not just add it to that
object
so data index users index I and now I
don't like this so I think what I'm
going to do is create a temporary list
so what I want to do is create a list
called similarity similar similarity
scores is an array and what I'm going to
do is I am going to for every single
user this will be interesting
ah yeah why not what I'm going to do is
I'm going to say similarity scores index
I equals equals that similarity so I'm
going to make a little table called and
let's so let's look at all the
similarity scores let's see if this
works okay here we go so I'm going to
run this and let's look at okay users is
not defined sketchiest line 45 okay
because I put this function out down
here and you know really what I should
do is pass in the ratings right so what
I probably should do is pass in the
ratings not just the name so I mean
there's so many different ways I could
do this this is the boring part this is
the boring part of this video I'm going
to make it more exciting somehow I can
have like a tippity going in the
background came here that I can't hear
that okay but I didn't do anything so
well cut that out
edit that out okay where am I here I
want the similarity score between
ratings one is user's name and ratings
two is users name you know what I don't
like the time out go back edit I don't
want to do it this way this is all for
you live viewers out there plus we can
get rid of the stupid tympani and made
no sense let me come back out here go
back
wait what's going on here okay I'm back
to where I was okay because okay so what
do I want to do I don't have access to
this users variable here I'm just going
to make it a global variable which is
not the best solution but it will do for
right now so that I can have access to
it there
let's hit refresh and cannot read the
property for of undefined at sketchy is
60 so I have another bug here in line 60
okay hold on what's going on here
console.log name one name too so let's
see is this working at all ah
name one alka so there is no name - why
did I not get a name - other Oh dot name
this needs to be dot name so this needs
to be dot name I want to look at the
others name not the full object and so
now where I'm seeing everything here so
I can take out some of these cons this
console dot log so now let's do this
come on
so there we go as my people attempt to
make this more interesting we could see
this is an array of all of the
similarity scores now notice there's no
index zero in this array because alka
happens to be user 0 and I am NOT so
what I should do here is I should do
something like I'm just going to do
similarity scores equals negative 1 so
by definition if a index I so if it is
yourself I'm going to put the similarity
score as negative 1 so I'm gonna that
well when I do the sorting later it's
going to ignore so what I have here is
an array of all of these values I can
easily sort that array because then I
have these value I have this array of
all the scores sorted but that's not
what I want I want all of the names
somehow sorted but I have a separate
array guess what JavaScript array
sorting to the rescue so you didn't
maybe you woke up this morning and
thought I hope I watch a video YouTube
about how to make a movie recommendation
system and then you watch the video to
realize I bone açaí learn about
sorting JavaScript arrays so we're going
to do this so let me show you a little
bit about this let's say I have an array
and it knows what I want to type it has
some numbers in it 52 1 negative 799 513
so I can actually say array dot sort and
what do I get I get the array in sorted
numerical order now what is the actual
array it actually changes that array so
it doesn't create a new array in sorted
order it actually changes this array
that's in sorted order and hopefully you
can see that now here's the thing if I
have an array and it's like some letters
c b a z e g right and now i have this
array of all these letters I can also
say array dot sort and now I have it
sorted in alphabetical order JavaScript
arrays can be sorted with the sort
function
if JavaScript happens to know how to
sort them because what if I were to just
put some generic objects or some other
kind of data that doesn't have an
obvious way of how to sort
how would it sorted well JavaScript to
the rescue this sort function can
actually take a callback I can put a
function inside of there and the sole
purpose of that function is to tell
JavaScript how to compare two particular
elements so how am I going to do this I
realize there's a flaw in the way that I
wrote this but we're gonna everything's
gonna be fine I know what to do trust me
I know what to do it's going to be okay
okay so what is it that I want to sort I
actually want to sort data dot users I
want to see that array the array of all
the users in sorted order were the most
similar users or at the top of that
array so what I want to do is say at the
end of this where I calculate all the
similarity scores I want to say data dot
sort sorry data users dot sort and I
want to say compare similarity by having
the longest so in other words I want to
write a function that compares the
similarity scores between two now what
this callback by definition takes two
elements that are in that array a and B
so one thing I could do is just say
let's just look at this console dot log
a dot name B dot name now this is not
going to do anything but let's just run
it because it's just going to log stuff
okay
let's run this submit so oops I'm
console logging too many things I don't
want to see this anymore let's do this
again submit so look at this so it's
definitely comparing doc versus Leon he
walkthroughs Leon Daniel versus Leon
blank versus Leon chewbacca so this is a
list of every
user being compared to every other user
in order to sort that array however I
don't want to sort it by their names
right if I wanted it to be in
alphabetical order I could do that very
easily by by comparing their names I
want to sort by the similarity scores oh
but how do I look up their similarity
score by their name now I have no real
easy way to do that unfortunately
luckily for us I could not put these
similarity scores in an array but I
could put them in an object where what I
actually do is store it by their name
and in other words I could just at this
point now yeah I could keep that as
negative one so so what I'm doing now is
I'm going to store all of the scores in
a lookup table that is organized by
their name so now what I want to do is
I'm going to say I can say score 1
equals similarity scores for a and score
2 equals similarity scores for B so now
let's consult log score 1 and score 2
let's see what those look like undefined
undefined undefined
okay whetted ah a dot name B dot name
right I want to look it up by their name
because the array that I'm sorting is
the array of the full object so I want
to look it up by their name so let's try
that and look at this so we can plainly
see we're comparing all these similarity
scores and now it's our job to say to
JavaScript to the sort function this is
how these numbers should relate to each
other if one has if score one is higher
than score two then then user one should
be before user two in the array and the
way that we do that is by saying I can
never remember this so I always just do
this through trial and error but
basically it's up to me to return
a positive one if I want a before be a
negative one if I want be before a or a
zero if they're equal well I don't
actually have to do as a positive one or
a negative one what I can actually just
return is I can return score one - score
- so I am giving a set a comparison
score to these two similarity ratings to
JavaScript so that it can sort those
objects okay so it's sorting the objects
in data users by their score in the
similarity scores lookup table okay
let's now say consult log data users
let's take a look at this okay here we
go
submit so here's our array hold I'm sick
I'm going to look at it boy this is
white okay
I'm gonna look at it now let's look we
should see a high similarity score for
oh no I think I did it wrong
oh I don't see the similarity scores
here I should put this in this is very
silly what I'm doing so many things are
wrong with what I'm doing hey look
somebody the chat is saying something
interesting I need to come back to this
in a second I recently published Dimitra
an NPM package called recommender it
covers some of the stuff explained here
check it out NPM does this guy always
make live videos yes okay high-five I'm
sure everyone's gone
this is probably my lowest rated live
stream ever so I I realized I'm going to
come back to this I probably should give
up and just put the similarity scores in
this particular or make the other array
and random objects with just name and
similarity score
how did I do it in the example that I
made um nearest I say nearest horses No
uh ah 520 viewers yes I lost about a
hundred in the last hour but gaining
some day maybe if I like I don't know I
don't know what I would do to gain
viewers but uh all the ideas that I
would have would be terrible ideas okay
let's think about this before I come
back what I want to do is look at you
know what by golly I'm good
the topic is less excited you're right
put the scores in the data objects I
know the reason why I felt that was
weird was because there it's just sort
of temporarily there and I kind of liked
having it be somewhere else but the so I
should just sort this I could make this
an array it's okay I'm gonna I'm coming
back okay I'm coming back to this okay
everything's gonna be fine okay so
clearly I this thing is sorted in the
wrong order
because alka is the first thing in the
array and alka has a similary squared
negative one I just realized I can't
even see the similarity score so one
thing I could do which you might do as
an exercise I could add as a property
the actual similarity score here but I'm
going to do this in a little bit of a
different way so first of all let me
just say score two - score one
let me invert that and run this again
and hopefully what we're going to see in
the first spot in the array is
Praetorian so this is the user that's
most similar to alcohol but we can't
really see this for sure so how can I
see this for sure so what I actually
want to do is I just want to display the
top five so what I'm going to do here is
I'm going to say for VAR I equals 0 I is
less than data well I is less than 5
I want to look at the 5 so this is let
me say VAR k equals 5 I want to look at
the K the five nearest neighbors and I'm
going to say create div
data users index I dot name + : space +
similarity scores so first of all I want
to look I just want to get their name so
let's put that in a separate variable
name + similarity scores by name so
let's see if let's see those come up
here we go and on what I'm going to do
is I'm going to make all of these divs
I'm going to put them in that put that
in that result parent that I was using
from the previous result paragraph that
is using from the previous example okay
so here we go let's look at the top 5
most similar users oh boy isn't this
exciting - Alka so Praetorian with a
hope it's it really a half an hour later
that's sad criterion with a similarity
score of 0.36 léo with a similarity
score of I don't have other sounds 1 3 3
3 Jeremy with a similarity score of 0.33
Baraka this really sorry and randy with
a score Randy they're in the fifth spot
with the score of 0.28 alright so we
could try this with any other user like
Chewbacca and we could see oh look at
this so I not clearing it so let's um I
think what I could do is a I might as
well fix this while I'm here is right
when I'm about to find the nearest
neighbors I should just take if this is
a silly way to do this but I'm going to
is this going to actually work will this
delete everything that's in result P
just by giving it blank HTML this might
be a terrible idea no because those divs
are still in there so what I want to do
is
result divs is an array this is a very
silly thing that I'm doing but I'm going
to just put all those divs in an array
so that at the beginning what I can do
is and I'm sure I could dynamically
access all of those by doing a select or
something but I'm just going to say
result divs index i dot remove and then
result divs is a new empty array so that
should yeah and interestingly enough the
sorting order because these are all
three or equal I'm actually getting a
different order each time which is kind
of interesting to realize and now we can
see we're getting similarity scores for
any person
Kenneth similar to this dot frost try on
Stefan and Keyon okay we've done it now
we have the k-nearest similar people to
a given Raider now here's the thing this
is what I'm going to do in the next
video before I leave here today to make
one more video what if a new person
comes onto the scene and rates a few
movies but hasn't seen one of the movies
how could I guess a new rating for the
new user based on their similarity to
their K nearest neighbors and this is a
regression problem I want to predict a
star rating like you could say it's
classification because I could classify
the stars into 0 1 2 3 4 or 5 but I
might do like a three point four I might
sort of calculate a numerics
continuous score but so that's what I'm
gonna do in the next video I am going to
predict a star rating of a new user who
hasn't seen all of the Star Wars films
are you going to be here to watch that
video I would say I hope so but I fully
understand if not so I will see you
maybe in the next video thanks for
watching
okay are the middle three always the
same rated value or that just that's got
to be cool that's got to just be no I
think there's just not that much data
here so we're just going to get a lot of
similar that was just a coincidence by
the way I put my ratings in here so
let's see who this should be in
alphabetical order but not these are the
people who are the most similar to me in
their view of Star Wars films Adam hari
Matthew unicorn and rock art okay how we
doing here so far you guys everybody
with me everybody okay here you're
learning something are you enjoying
yourself
I don't know someday I will do some more
exciting stuff okay so let's see here
what I'm going to do is session three
similar score nearest neighbors movie
recommender this is actually not a movie
recommendation system I guess it is yeah
it is it's not by but we'd still by user
there's so many different ways you could
do this
so mccoullough Lee and the chat asks how
can i get the schedule for these live
videos I'm really sorry about this I
don't do a good job of being consistent
about time I hope that in end of May and
June I'll have some weekly slots where I
do the live stream at the same exact
time because my schedules much more open
then but you can get notifications by
email that I sometimes send out you can
stay tuned to my Twitter but the best
way at least to get a notification at
least the day of is to subscribe to my
channel and then click the alarm bell
and it should give you notifications
YouTube notifications the moment I go
live and the moment I schedule live
stream okay the fact that somebody just
said how can I get notifications for
this with this like incredibly boring
live stream thrills me to no end okay
what happened with my typo
you guys are telling me something in the
patron chat about a typo did I get the
hint by the way does anybody live in
Newfoundland Newfoundland Labrador think
I'm going on a vacation there if you -
can I get some tips from you or anybody
visited there it tweet me at Schiffman
okay uh okay uh by the way can somebody
do some kind of data visualization on my
gray hair I think well if you look back
at my videos from several years ago it
wasn't so gray
all right here we go can we do this last
piece I think we can so what I might do
is prepare this in advance to what I
want to do is create okay what do I need
to do I need to have a so I need to go
back movie recommender and what I need
to do is go to this code hold on we
close these out go here go to here and
what I want is okay so I need to add a
form I need to add a form where I can
rate the movies should i hard code this
in there no I think I should probably
dynamically extrapolate the form so I
typed neighbor wrong where did I do that
but how did I type it Oh
let's fix that okay thank you
all right so okay so what do I want to
do do I want to include this in the
edited version of the tutorial to spend
the time to make the form or do I just
want to do the recommendation system you
know why not why not spend the time I'm
going to do it anyway here we go
okay still wrong still wrong neighboors
is that I smell neighbor is that right
now that's right right ah so say I'm
glad this is I'm glad you got neighbors
neighbors neighbors did I get it right
cuz that's not gonna neigbor nee nee
hoor neigbor neigbor nee born a board a
bore the neighbor song never forget how
to spell neigbour as always i always
forget the dis stop it stop it stop just
stop
I think this stop is stopped underneath
this dis stop this stop this diet
I feel like it's a little too vain just
playing these songs over and over again
okay this is the end of this is the last
thing I'm going to do in today's
livestream which has been going on for a
little over two hours I am NOT I am now
going to I am now going to do them do
the do the movie rating rating thing
okay please let there be a neighbor song
come on
musicians of the world make me some
music that I can play doesn't need to
have my voice in it could you write your
own song sing it I will play it I would
love to have some song submissions
theirs that would make me so happy to
have more music to play on these live
streams okay original music okay you
have a different tune though probably
neighbor neighbor won't you be my name I
can't sing isn't it sad my voice a
singing voice is terrible honestly if I
had a good singing voice I would just be
auditioning for musical theater to be on
Broadway but it's dead I want you to
make encoding tutorials so I guess
that's good that I can't sing because I
would never if I could sing if I was
that's what I would be I would be so
nice if I could say paint if I could
paint about any artistic talent in any
way whatsoever that's what I always
wanted to do but Here I am building a
movie recommendation system in
JavaScript which is probably like the
worst language ever to do this in as I'm
sure everybody in the chat has said over
and over again k-nearest neighbor
k-nearest neighbor it's you and me are
you with in my case
it's the caterers de Bourgh there's five
of K and they're all together with me -
hmm yeah okay now the gating viewers or
losing viewers
most likely losing them okay huh here we
go
here we are again whoo
this is the third video in this series
about nearest neighbour and similarity
scores and we're finally finally kind of
figure out which Star Wars movie you
should watch so how are we going to do
that what I need to do first is I need a
forum where a new user could enter this
world hi my name is user that's my name
user and I have only seen episodes 4 5 &amp;amp;
6 of Star Wars so I'm going to make some
ratings and that is going to predict
which Star Wars movie I should watch or
how I might start rate other movies
something like that okay so first it's
unfortunate for you that I didn't bother
to do this before the video now after we
could fast-forward a little bit if you
don't want to bother with me
building the form to get the stuff but
I'm going to do that now so what I need
to do how am I going to do this so
instead of having a single drop down for
all I need a new I'm a new user so what
I need to do is just give me I need
those titles uh I don't want I don't
want to do this is there any way I could
just somebody else could just come here
and do this part I think that it might
be time for me too lazy to be lazy about
this I'm going to be lazy about this um
what I'm going to do is I'm just going
to add one two
of these need to be double quotes
three four five six what did I call them
rogue one and Holliday so what I'm doing
here is I'm adding and then I need a
comma I added to the JSON file just a
list of all the titles obviously I can
extrapolate that from the data set in
different ways
but this is just going to make my life
so much easier right now let's do this
let's be happy let's just make our lives
easier why worry so much let's do it
this way okay happy JSON file
we all have easy happy easy JSON files
okay so now that I've done that what I
want to do is where am I
in setup I want to create I first I want
to do is I want to get all the titles is
now data titles and I want to loop
through them titles dot length I plus
plus and I want to say I doing it this
way I'm going to do it this way though
this is going to be fine I'm going to
say VAR div equals create div yeah this
is going to be fine
creative with the title let's look at
what I got so far
all right see I got a div with all these
titles okay okay this is good this is
good
var select equals create select select
dot parent the div so that's that
drop-down this should I'm going to call
this a drop down that drop down should
go in the div well look there it is this
is the worst design for ever but it's
fine yeah there's so many better
somebody's going to save me on the
internet someday and make a really nice
version of this with better data and
better design it's going to have it play
a beautiful song about design and data
okay and then what I want to do is save
our you know star
what are the possible stars you could
have zero stars one star I didn't give
in I didn't give it a star is let you
could have 1 2 5 stars
so I'm going to say drop down dot option
star so now what what's wrong oh this
needs to be parentheses I'm giving all
these stars and this is not start it's
star that's hot eyes star my brain is
melting now look at this so I could say
I want to rate this movie this way and
this movie this way and this movie this
way and this movie this way now I mean
it's submit bah bah bah bah bah and what
I'm going to get what I want to see is
the movies that I didn't rate I want to
see what it would guess my rating should
be so I'm going to actually add an
option where I'm going to say drop-down
option I'll just call it not scene i
guess so i can just rate the movies that
I've seen and get a prediction for the
other movies that's where we are so far
okay we're good we're good now we're
ready to do something so now I don't
need any of this stuff from before but I
need to handle the mousepressed
so what I want to do is I'm going to
need this fine nearest neighbors
function so when I press the mouse what
I want to do is what predict ratings so
I need a function that's predict ratings
okay and what am I going to do in this
function okay so first of all I need to
create I need to create a new user new
user is me and then what I need to do is
make a user object that has a rating so
how is the data organized originally
it's to each user object as the user's
name and the lookup of the movie title
and the rating okay so now what I need
to do is I need to say for
what would be nice is if I put all of
these dropdowns somewhere in like a
variable so I'm going to say drop downs
equals an array and I'm going to I mean
I could select them but I'm going to say
drop downs dot push drop-down so this is
where I can now get I can get for all I
can look at all of the drop downs and I
can say new user new user oh okay
interesting what do we need to do I need
to figure out how to pair when I loop
the reach of these dropdowns I'm going
to get this number
but I need to be able to pull out the
actual value so hold on everybody I'm
thinking so I need to actually pair it
with the dip so I'm going to just do
something silly what I'm going to do is
I'm going to attack them and when I make
these drop down I'm going to say drop
down dot title I'm just going to titles
index I so any a JavaScript object the
drop down is an html5 app live element I
could just attach another variable to it
and put some data in it so I'm going to
do that and I'm going to now say new so
as I go through the new user so the
title is drop downs index I dot title
the value the rating is drop downs index
value the function this is a function
that returns the current selected value
out of those options so new user index
title equals the rating so let's just
now console.log that new user here we go
let's take a look at this so I am now
going to say 3 5 and I'm gonna hit
myth and look I now have it I know I
have a new user object that has all of
these movie ratings and not seen now
here's the thing
I think previously the way I had written
this is I used no to ignore a similarity
score - so what I should do here is I
think it might be useful is to say if
rating equals not seen let's just
instead of using the string not seen
let's say rating equals no so I'm just
going to change that to be null in that
user object so let's just see if that
works so I'm just going to only rate one
and we should see now okay so now I have
no for all the other ratings perfect so
now what I could do is I could
definitely see who are the most similar
users to my particular rating here
because that we just did so let's do
that
so what I'm going to do is now I'm going
to say once I've done that I want to say
find nearest neighbors but what if I
nearest neighbors do before well it got
the user from a drop-down menu but I
don't want to do that anymore
actually what I want to do is give
myself get this I'm going to pass in a
particular user so what I want to do is
I want to say find nearest neighbors for
this particular user I want to find the
nearest neighbors for this particular
user so here where did I get the user
like I said sort of I got the user from
the name Euclidean distance named ah so
the Euclidean distance function it looks
up so many problems so many things I
have to fix you'll have to restructure
the way I did this this is the life of
programming it just seems like oh this
won't be any big just going to add this
one little feature and then I've made
all these weird kind of not-so-great
decisions earlier so we got it we got to
do better okay so I'm gonna I'm just
going to have to live with myself but
I'm gonna try to make my life is easy
and friendly and happiest
this function Euclidean distance should
really receive to you user objects so
what I'm going to do is now have this
receive ratings 1 and ratings 2 so these
should be 2 user objects with all of the
readings it's stripping out the name and
timestamp thing but that's fine the
titles I don't the titles I could
actually just use so now one thing I can
do to simplify since I have that movie
titles thing is I can get I can just get
sorry one thing I can get is I shouldn't
scroll so many functions in too many
places I'm scrolling all over the place
I can say when I look for the titles in
Euclidean score please cut out all that
scrolling but - thank you ok when I look
for the titles should save our titles
equals data titles ok so that simplifies
it so I want to get the two user objects
so I'm going to come back up and I'm
going to get where where do I just give
me a second pause for a second I'm
looking at the chat here they did not do
any community variations today James did
you have something for me because I
didn't do that today ok where am i what
am I looking for
ok
okay so what I want to do is back up to
where I call Euclidean distance this is
where I call it I call it between two
names but now the user is coming here so
I want to call it between user and not
and I don't have to worry about this
anymore if this new user can't be the
same
aha like actually this is actually
simplifying things I can get rid of this
and other can actually be the full user
object and so now I want to say
Euclidean distance between this new user
and other similarity scores etc etc okay
so the rest should be fine what if I
must have missed something right but
let's try this so I'm going to rate a
few movies just picking random numbers
I'm not even thinking about it hit
submit okay sketch touch yes line 46
users not to fight I should have known
better just try this line 46 oh this is
right here I'm passing a new user let's
say I lost track of so many things here
and maybe you've lost me let's come back
and say what we're doing predict ratings
happens as soon as I press the mouse I
build a new user with a bunch of ratings
based on the interface and then I say
find the nearest neighbors for that new
user and finding the nearest neighbors
for that you user means go through and
check all of the users in my database in
that JSON file and good player compare
the Euclidean distance sort all of them
and show me show me the five nearest
ones and one thing I want to do is now
I'm gonna just leave this like this I'll
fix this in a second okay let's try this
now I'm going to rate a few random ones
hit submit and okay so this is good I
got a bunch of users it looks like these
are users in the quarter undefined so
something didn't work here I would have
to debug this welcome to debugging okay
so let's try to figure out where this
went wrong so right here let's look at a
similarity so some obviously I assume
what's happening to me
is I'm getting a similarity score
similarity score of undefined so I'm
just going to rate one movie oh look at
this you know the similarity scores
worked so the similarity scores worked
but somehow what I'm printing out here
is undefined
okay so the similarity score ah
so the lookup is no longer by name
because other is the full user but I
want the lookup to be by other dot name
so let's just see if this works now
great so I'm exactly the same as all
three of these people because all three
of these people rated Star Wars Episode
one with a two and we can see here's the
here's four people here here's four this
is five people all three five people
okay but now I could start to get some
more interesting similarity scores by
rating more movies so here are the five
most similar users to me here's
something that is really bothering me
what a nice little function at least for
like looking at stuff is a number format
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
say score equals number format and I'm
going to format the similarity score and
what number format does is I could say
give me this many leading decimals and
this many trailing decimals so I could
say something like you know one comma
two and so if I do that what I'm going
to get now is this so I am here now what
I'm doing if this looks so horribly ugly
but design aside at least I'm getting
just the similarity scores with and I
could with just two decimal places even
if they go on for much more okay yeah
one of these you're getting so many of
the same score because it's just a very
small small data set this would work so
much more this would work so much better
if I had if raided a thousand movies and
then I had a huge database of other user
ratings now scale is also a problem the
algorithm then run really slow and
there's ways around that that I will get
to at some point I forgot the force
awakens oh yes but no but I didn't
forget it in the data set right it's in
movies JSON yeah yeah I just
got it in here okay so let me add that
in thank you let's include the force
awakens' here and force awakens is back
there we go okay thank you for that okay
we're finally ready now what I can do is
guess a rating for a particular movie
that I the new user has not seen and
after all isn't that what we're here for
to figure this out and make me you fast
forwarded all the way to this point in
the video and if you did we're good
we're here okay what do I need to do I
need to find the place where i whoops i
need to find the place in the code where
i create all those divs and that happens
at the end of fine nearest neighbors and
what i actually want to do is instead of
yeah I'm trying to I'm thinking about
this pause I don't need to display
anything if the end of this the result
of it is sorting yeah I think I'm just
going to hack away at the code right
here there could be a better way better
way to do this I need a break for a
second need a little water
6:35 this has been a very long live
stream I'm just peeking at the chat I
feel like very hungry I'm getting to eat
a big enough lunch starting to feel a
little woozy will this help up camera
went off I knew that was gonna happen
it's been about a half an hour these
aren't going to be some long videos but
somebody someday might choose to watch
everybody must watch these on like 2x
speed right okay okay listen up here we
go
here we go okay okay okay let's flip
through this together you and me feel
your energy your chakra it's gonna go
inside my vibrations somehow this is all
getting very weird let's stop talking
about that I need to refactor this
because I don't want to look at the five
nearest people I want to use the five
nearest people to compute some guesses
for movies I haven't rated so first of
all I need to keep track of the movies
that I haven't rated so let's do that
where could I do that here is so so
let's just do that here so first let's
create an array so called new titles and
what I'm going to do is for I equal 0 I
equals data titles do I already have
titles here somewhere I think I have
just this is a very silly way of doing
this but titles do you know what I don't
need to clear two separate array I need
to go through all the titles is less
than what I want to do is go through all
the titles and find out have I not seen
that movie yet so I'm going to save our
title if VAR title equals titles index I
if a my new user in here where I might
know I'm user if and do I have access to
titles now I need to say data titles
data table titles if user index title
equals equals null now it's the time
create div title creative title so I
want to do a result P parent Oh No yeah
no no did this should be div parent
results P I had that wrong cuz I want to
put the div inside that but that's
somebody I want to do this
creative title result gives push and
then div dot parent title I just want to
see the titles we're going to get to
this in a second this step boy that took
me a really long time fleck brain is
melting this should just give me on the
HTML page the movies that i want to have
my predicted ratings for okay ready
here's a rating here's a rating submit
okay
cannot read property appendchild of no
div dot parent not title result p try
this again okay so now what did what did
the button go up here and holiday went
down here that is craziness
what is craziness this is somehow
getting parented what have I done what
crazy weird thing have I done oh I know
why so I need to put the head of
variable and parent it okay everything's
gonna be okay
can you hear my stomach grumbling okay
here we go
great so I should see a list of
everything but episode one in Episode
four perfect so now I need to predict
the star rating for those we're getting
so close so now that I know this is a
title I need to get a prediction for it
this is where I now want to look at the
five nearest neighbors okay it's gotta
be okay so let's get rid of this div for
a second and right now I am going to
look at the five nearest neighbors okay
so I don't care about their name
that camera went off but it doesn't
actually matter there'll be any point I
don't care about their name but I do
care about their score you don't care
about number formatting it because what
I want to do is I want to okay how do I
do this prediction I want to basically
take a weighted average of all of the
neighbors so let's think about this in
using the whiteboard for a second okay
so for example if we imagine just a
2-dimensional space and if there were
just two movies like episode 4 and
episode you know 7 you know I could put
plot everybody's you know this is
somebody who rated episode 4 with 4
stars but episode 7 with 1 star right
would be over here so what I want to do
is I'm a new user and I'm somewhere here
what I want to do is and I've only rated
well this is getting confusing this is
where by the way having a live actual
set of people in the room with you would
be really helpful because I just like
lose myself like I'm talking into the
void but ok so what I want to do is I
want to look at the people who are
nearest to me maybe the five nearest
ones this is and make a prediction but I
want to wait I don't have to do this I
could just take the average of all of
these but what I want to do here is I
want to wait this person who's nearer to
me I want to wait the prediction that I
have for there I want to wait their
movie rating more heavily than somebody
who's a little bit further so how am I
going to do that well first I could just
do the average let's do that first it'll
be a little simpler so what I want to do
is I want to say I want to make a sum of
all the ratings so what I want to do is
what's the title this is the title that
I want so sum plus equals
the users index name whoa
index title right isn't that their
rating right because the ratings is
users index that name I don't need the
similarity score right now I'm just
going to do an average without waiting
it by similarity score so I could say
sum plus equals users so I could
everybody's leaving I've look I did like
a little break and then I'm just going
to like churn through this of you I'm
gonna come back I mean I want to just
like start over for a second and and not
I'm gonna come back to this it's gonna
be great
believe me oh oh yeah okay um okay here
we are
where was I where yeah okay here we go
I know what I'm doing now I've got stay
hydrated okay here we go
people are leaving is 1:00 a.m. in the
morning in your app yeah
maybe put some emojis in the chat that
are like motivational emojis that's
gonna help me I don't know if that
really helped I think I might have
pulled a muscle there okay okay so first
let's actually just take an average of
the K nearest neighbors ratings over
that particular title so what do I want
to forget about the similarity score for
a second what am I doing here
so what I want to do is get all of the
ratings user title is right okay
so how do I do the Ray
are from that users my variable naming
is pretty poor here and I need to do a
better job with that but users remember
is the lookup table of all of the users
user right now is me I should probably
not call it your really regain this
stuff and i maybe i'll refactor this
when i publish the code okay i want to
get the ratings from all of the users
for one particular so that's Nate okay
so these are all the ratings for one
particular for now what I want to get is
the actual rating is the ratings index
the title right so first I need the user
the k-nearest user where's name coming
from wait a second users okay hold hold
your horses I I went a little nuts here
users index K forget about the name I
can get the symbol I'm gonna get the
similarity score button named K is what
I want
come on we can do this I want to look at
that particular it's sorted I'm going to
get the ratings for that particular user
I'm gonna get the rating for this
particular title then I'm going to add
them all together some plus equals that
rating then what do I do some divide it
equally and now here we go
I can make a nice little div and what
does that diff going to have in it it is
going to have the title what am I
looking you're over there it's going to
have the title plus a colon plus some it
I'm going to just say stars equals that
sum divided by K that's going to be the
stars and I'm also going to number
format it so that it's with with a one
leading digit and two decimal
okay here we go now this isn't good that
there's a lot there's a bunch of things
I want to do to this to make this better
and then talk about all sorts of things
like mist but I think we're somewhere
bear with me
the lights episode 1 don't like episode
ii don't like episode 2 I liked episode
5 for ask them it cannot read proper TV
of undefined at fine nearest neighbors
ok let's see if we can fix this sketch -
line III oh this is it what it ratings
is ok let's think about this users is
the lookup table data users I see I've
done it
lesson learned I maybe what I'm going to
do after this video is do a separate
video where I just refactor this to make
it better variable names and make it
more organized in a way that I could
follow I've done a terrible job this is
really the lesson in poor code
management but hopefully you're learning
something I see me doing what I wanted
to look up the array is actually data
dot users data is the stuff I loaded
from JSON so data dot users is my array
users was my lookup table so this is
what I want so let's see how this goes
ok I get it Oh oh no I think we're
infinite loop right I think I've frozen
the browser right hello what's going on
hello I can't do anything you could type
here so where do I have an infinite loop
or something can i refresh the page I've
crashed everything users index I know I
not K anymore sad sound effects my brain
is so toast right now you're absolutely
right idea ok so one thing I have to do
is kill this and see if I can get it
back oh no it didn't well I'm in the
wrong place
sorry buddy we're going to edit this
part out and try to get back to it
something else is going wrong here yeah
it's still still having this problem
what have I done
uh ok Oh Oh terrible terrible terrible
error look at this I I didn't I'm not
paying close attention and I'm in a loop
within a loop and I use I twice which is
absolutely absolutely a disaster so no
wonder I had an infinite loop let's
change this to J okay I'm feeling
slightly more confident now
ira fish should stop doing this
I got these star ratings so and so I
really think that I should have so I
should really be seeing episode 5 or 6
and I'm really not going to like the
holiday special this pen by the way has
been in the way all this time okay so
we're doing well this is pretty good and
I really should quit while I'm ahead
even though I'm not very far ahead I'm
Way behind but we've now got a
prediction engine I would be nice to
sort these I'd probably want to sort
these I can leave that as an exercise
for you but I absolutely should do the
weight I should do a weighted Sun so
let's at least add this and I'm seeing
it in the chat I'm gonna do it right now
okay and I wish it had some emojis to
this because I need some need some some
happiness some smiles and some hearts in
my chat okay here we go okay so now what
I want to do is let's use that
similarity score score equals similarity
scores okay similarity scores index name
what is the name so-so okay so the name
is data users index J name so remember
the name again I don't know I love the
way I've organized this the similarity
scores are in a separate lookup table
than the original data so the data which
I really probably should have put that
in the original data but anyway the name
is coming from the sorted array of users
the score then is coming from the
similarity scores and then the ratings
is also in that original lookup table so
now the weighted sum okay so a couple
things I should do I need the I need
this the weighted sum and then I need
the similarity summon I'll try to
explain this I think in a minute so I
need two different sums here so what I
need to do is add up the weighted sum
equals the ratings times the similarity
the score and I don't know maybe I'll
call
just sim for similarity so this is the
weighted sum it's the rating time now
remember if they're really similar the
similarity score is one if they're not
very similar the similarity score is 0.1
the reason why I also this reason why I
need this similarity sum is that what
this is what to get the average like if
I add up five things and divide by five
I have an average but I'm not adding up
five things now I'm adding up five
things weighted by similarity so what I
actually want to do is the number of
stars is the weighted sum whoops is the
weighted sum divided by the similarity
sum so this is actually going to give me
the weighted average does this make
sense to you if it doesn't ask in the
comments maybe I can sort of answer this
again another time or make another video
but now I have the weight it's up now
the other thing here is it's very likely
in a more elaborate system that the user
is not going to have rated all every
user is not going to have rated every
other movie so I would add need to do an
error check to make sure I should do
that here so I should check as long as
rating is not equal to null that could
be no then I add this up and this is
going to work so there could be a
thousand movies it's only going to add
up the ones that that particular user
has rated okay okay here we go
okay here we go here we go here we go
here we go and I am now going to rate
some movies I'll stop using the sound
effects for no no no I really don't like
episode one or two three was kind of
okay um you know these are all good
no that's this is a good one come on
Empire Strikes Back Return of the Jedi I
liked I liked seven okay here we go so
what will be my estimated star rating
for rogue one and the 1977 I think
that's not right whatever the Star Wars
Holiday Special
my the guess is I'm gonna rate robe one
and three point nine six stars and
holiday at one point six
we did it okay
I wish I could play some Star Wars sound
effects but I'll get a copyright problem
so um this is now a recommendation
engine it has got a very limited data
set there's a lot of problems with this
but let's think about what are some
things you could do with this going
forward first of all you could think
about a whole other context of what you
might use this in I mean think about
similarities and predictions of rate it
doesn't have to be you know product
ratings movie ratings you could think
about any property associated with a
person a thing you know think about word
counts what if you look at like all the
emails sent to yours all the emails sent
from all of your friends and you counted
all the words in all those emails
essentially those word counts are
equivalent of star ratings for each word
can you find similarities between your
friends can you predict you know this is
sort of laying the foundation of how you
might do spam filtering for example so
there's a lot of ways you could think
about a data set that's full of key
value pairs and how you might have a lot
of data points and make predictions
based on that and that's what's
happening here
that said maybe you're interested in
doing something really close to this
like a movie recommendation system
getting your own data set now here's a
challenge for you
I've met a lot of this code I should
thank again I'm building this based on
after having read this collective
intelligence book I'll put a link to
this book in this video's description
something you might think about is okay
what might you think about movie lens so
there is a website called movie lens and
movie lens has a giant data set with 20
million ratings so you could actually
build this exact same program with a
large massive data set now you're going
to have a lot of issues all of a sudden
with performance and so how do you
approach that now that's a topic for a
whole other video but that's kind of a
challenge for you and something that
you'll notice here is I have to
go through every single other user
because this is all and looking up
everything by user but I could have some
precomputed look-up tables that kind of
know something about how movies are
similar based on user ratings and
calculate calculate these predictions
based on movie similarities as well so I
think this is covered in this book maybe
I'll come back and do another video on
that and explain that very well but this
is user based you could do something
that's item based and that's going to
really improve speed maybe if you use a
database and have some pre computed
look-up tables in certain ways it's
other ways you could approach it write
in the comments ways that you think
about like how you might do this with a
large data set but even just redesigning
doing a better interaction building a
like actual server-side program that
saves stuffed in a database I would
encourage you to go do something
creative with this something strange
something useless something playful and
share it with me so thank you for if
you're actually still watching thank you
so much for sticking through all three
parts of this tutorial series for
building a little movie recommendation
engine with me I can't wait to hear what
you think what you make subscribe like
all that sort of stuff and I will see
you in the okay okay okay what was
somewhat hold on what was your actual
rating remove yourself from the data set
and then see how close it is to your
actual rating Oh interesting okay
there's a little challenge here let's
try this this videos not ending less
okay not ending yet my words are jumbled
okay I'm going to go in here I'm going
to remove myself from the data set
Schiffman so oh look at this I could
actually just four and five so it got my
rogue one rating pretty well but I gave
these different ratings cut this part
I'll do this afterwards not as part of
the videos it's a great idea
Mattia edit this part where I started to
go off on this because this video is
probably 45 minutes longer
and it's seven o'clock I've got to go
okay but I'm going to try this in a
second so thanks for watching and I'll
see you in a future coding challenge
video thing etc goodbye
alright okay let's just try this so if I
could remember I said four five four one
two two so I gave some different ratings
now four okay so let's I think that's
kind of similar I didn't put three let's
so let me remove myself take this out
I'm going to save it somewhere so we
could see it then I am going to rerun
the program and I'm going to put my
ratings in four five four one two two
four four five four one two two this is
not right
these are in a different water for five
four four five four one two - and - I do
seven and four and here we go three
point six and one point four here's the
thing this is not probably not that much
better than just taking an average of
everybody so the thing is it's not going
to really ever give me you know I don't
I'd actually have not seen the holidays
special I think I watched some clips of
it on YouTube at one point maybe years
ago or but on you know it's probably
almost impossible for example predict a
high rating for the holiday special if
nobody else in the database actually
predicts tonight now I probably got that
wrong but okay so I am going to go I'm
going to put on my goodbye so everybody
asked what this goodbye song is let's
see if I can find it at one point it was
on soundcloud when I looked for rainbow
and it was like
shoot I just searched rainbow and then
maybe I like on Soundcloud I think Oh No
maybe it was free music archive I don't
know you know what to be honest I don't
remember where I got up to look it up
okay
I'm gonna see if I could take some
questions okay hold on hold on I'm
getting some good calm I'm getting some
comments here in the patriot group Nick
writes but you're in the set that's very
influential wrong numbers you input them
wrong 1 &amp;amp; 2 were wrong but I took myself
out of the data set so all right but it
inputted them wrong okay yeah yeah I
think there's been talk of a guest to
tour Oh video request 3 J s I would love
to do a video tutorial on three J's I'm
hoping to get my act together and have a
lot of guest tutorials in June so June
is my most free month of the year where
I'm working and not not teaching so I'm
hoping to get a bunch of guest tutorials
in here if anybody has suggestions for
somebody in the New York City area who
would be great for a 3 J s tutorial just
tweet me at Schiffman I would love to do
that
Nick Nick we'll work this out later okay
oh this doesn't do the pause anymore
okay do this okay uh any other questions
I'll take a few more questions
we'll be back I hope to be back next
Friday for you and still watching let me
remind you to tune in next week to the
ITP thesis presentations all week
livestream all day I'll be in the
audience I know maybe I can have if
you're in the pits you want to join and
become a patron coding
patreon.com/scishow ting train and join
our slack group we could have a slack
chat during ITP thesis presentation and
discuss all the pieces presentations
cryptography guest lecture would be
great
socket programming in the snake game I
have a snake game tutorial and I have
WebSockets tutorial you did one for
agario and agario and I did also a
shared canvas drawing when will be the
next live stream ah so the problem with
this if you look at these schedule
thisis week where's the schedule
presentation schedule so I am will be
watching all of these presentations
Monday I have some meetings I will be
watching these from noon to oh it only
it ends at 4:00 4:30 Tuesday I'll be
watching these from 10 a.m. to on the 6
o'clock Wednesday from 10 a.m. to 6
o'clock Thursday from 2:00 so I'm hoping
that I'll have some time on Friday to do
a live stream so it will be next Friday
the thing is I'm we're also have a show
of student work I wouldn't be surprised
if I miss gonna do a live stream next
week but where am I in this particular
syllabus I am now I would say I think I
would love to hear feedback from you
guys as to whether if I should do some
more videos on this stuff or move
straight to neural networks like was
that enough for this ok
hmm neat
I love neuro evolution teach stand for
again but I love neat which is using an
evolutionary algorithm to evolve a
neural network oh boy I've got some
demos of that I'm gonna do some video
tutorials about that that's coming it's
one of my favorite algorithms to work to
do to use yes so everybody can watch all
those presentations they won't I won't
be live-streaming them on my youtube
channel there'll be a separate live
stream but just remember I'll tweet it
out just go to ITP that when you slash
thesis multiplayer snake using sockets
yes Oh get spiking neural networks I
have not I'm not familiar with that term
spiking a neural network so maybe
somebody could fill me up camera went
off neuro evolution through augmented
augmenting topologies yes okay when will
this livestream be over in 48 seconds
I hope you guys got hope today was good
it will be be useful I think these are
gonna be very long videos Matt sure if
we want to like if you want to like make
break them into smaller chunks I could
come back even tomorrow I might have
like 20 minutes just to record some
intros and outros if that would help um
thanks sacrifice productions will I do a
Ruby on Rails tutorial that's unlikely
again if anybody has suggestions for
guests you can uh you can tweet at them
and tweet at me I would love to have
more guest tutorials I'm trying to
figure out a good mechanism to go to pay
people to come in here and do guest
tutorials and so again I you know using
some of the patreon funds for that I'm
really trying to include a diverse set
of voices in guest tutorials so
suggestions especially women and people
of color I would love to have
suggestions for people can come and do
video tutorials keep me posted okay will
I ever do a Rubik's Cube code so for
coding challenge it sounds hard okay I'm
gonna be gone in a second yes there
already is 1k Weakland there is a guest
suggestion tab already in the rainbow
topics repository ah I do have a plea
though here's a plea if you want to help
I really feel like I need a better
system for organizing all of the source
code that's with my video tutorials and
so if anybody wants to help with that
there is a github issue thread about
that I um and you know I at some point I
might have the resources to hire
somebody to build a website but I would
also be happy to do that as like a kind
of community based thing so if you want
to help me even just figuring out like a
better directory structure and just
leaving it on github writing a better
readme this read me is like so old it
has nothing to do with my youtube
channel anymore so I would love love
help with that so maintaining github
repositories you know potentially I
could
have you know if I go to the coding
training calm you know you know I don't
know if this make this isn't there's a
lot that could happen here so if you're
a web designer a github person want to
contribute I would certainly love your
help okay all right
thank there won't be a live stream
tomorrow today is the live stream and I
will see you guys hopefully next week
next Friday but if I don't buy the wait
expect a serpent know if I'll anyway
come and watch the ITP thesis livestream
join the patreon community and
participate in a chat during that live
stream and see you all soon I'm leaving
now need to say that to more than 300
people yeah good point so um can you
Lake the ITP somebody link the ITP dead
enemy you don't you slash thesis I don't
know the URL for the stream yet oh no it
was in there it just didn't show up yet
I think it might actually be ITP NYU
that edu slash live is that was that
what it was no that's something else
well let's just find this right now the
presentation scheduled live stream I
don't but this might change so I would
just go to ITP dad NYU slash thesis and
there'll be a link to this but I know
there's gonna be like a 360 live stream
and everything but right now it's thesis
audience 9 HTML okay you know I'm like
do I have a new system where I can live
stream for my phone so that's where I
was like oh maybe I'll do a surprise
livestream just for my phone wandering
the hallways but we'll see I don't want
to promise that okay that might be just
a bonus for the like I don't know why
I'm going to like motivating people what
I do when I test new technologies I
often do like a private live stream just
for people in the patron group good I
don't know I'm really plugging this
patreon thing it gives me such happiness
when I see somebody joint um I also
would think they would if there's awake
yeah okay I gotta go see you everybody
later thank you for
being here and hopefully I'll see you
next week subscribe like share this
channel with other people to bring more
people into the community and more
people that are here the more time it
helps me just have more time and
resources to allocate to it so I'll see
you all later I'm going to hit the stop
now okay I hit the stop request</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
