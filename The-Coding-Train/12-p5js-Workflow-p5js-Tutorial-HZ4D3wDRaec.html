workflow video I've made a bunch of them
but I always get lots of questions there
are always problems with them so I am
now going to make a video that describes
my entire workflow even though I have
pieces of this and other videos I'm
gonna do it all in this video
you could be watching this video as the
as you're just starting to learn to
program this isn't the most beginner
friendly way to just type your first
line of code because I gotta have a
bunch of steps but at some point I will
also come back and show you some other
what editors that you can kind of get up
and running immediately with so how I
work for I want to I want to make a
p5.js sketch I don't want to do it in
ink I mean youyou might want to do this
I want to do this also but at the moment
it's I do I want to do this locally on
my computer this laptop thing without a
cloud-based editor so let me talk about
the pieces of the puzzle that I need one
thing that you absolutely need have a
look at that beautiful is project files
now to make a p5.js sketch or really any
JavaScript program web page thing all
you need is an HTML file you can write
everything you could write all your
JavaScript and everything in there but
that's not so convenient it's kind of
nicer to just have the HTML stuff that
you need in there and you need to sketch
it out J's file so you need these
project files we could just make these
from scratch and type what we need into
them but generally we want to get like
some sort of template from somewhere so
that's one thing we need another thing
we need we need a text editor we need
something that we can open up these
files by the way we could have more
files and project files and CSS files
and image files video files but at a
bare minimum this is what we want we
need something where we can edit those
files you know you could use just about
it if you use TextEdit or notepad or
anything really I tend to use something
called the atom editor it is an open
source text editor thick put out by
github there's also a text editor called
sublime text which is quite wonderful
you there's a free version but it's also
commercial software that you can pay for
there's there's like
you'll studio people tell me they love
and the list goes on there's lots of
them everybody has their own favorite
text editor you can say which one is
yours in the comments so we need this
and then the third thing we need is a
server so here's the thing these are the
files this is how we write our code in
the files how do we see what we
ultimately want to do is see the result
in a web page and it is true that if you
just on any computer double-click
index.html file will like pop up and
open it in the browser
but what you might end up seeing is that
it's opening it with this path in the
address bar file colon slash slash and
what we want to do is open it with this
path HT feed colon slash slash basically
we want to make sure that we are
simulating the actual real world way
that someone of the internet would view
this web page which is it would view it
served up on a web server so we want to
run a little web server on our local
computer to be able to look at it in the
browser and there are lots of options
for that I could run a node server what
snowed oh my goodness I could run a
Python server
what's Python oh my goodness oh yeah I
could use like an atom server package
right there's all these different
possibilities so when I forgot to
mention there's lots of ways you could
get your project files you could just
have a friend of that here say hey do
you have any p5 schedules can email me
one and then you can edit there you just
copy paste copy paste like a hundred
times you have under project folder I'm
gonna use a tool called p5 manager it's
a little bit of overkill right now
because it might be easier just to say
hey just download and I'll put a link in
this video's description to a zip file
where you can just download a blank p5
sketch but I'm gonna use this tool
called p5 manager which has a little
command line thing you can type it it
generates the project files for you so
I'm gonna use p5 manager to generate the
project files I'm going to use a text
editor to open the project files I'm
then going to type my code into the
project files
I'm then going to run a local server and
then look at the beauty that is my
results does that make sense
again I'm trying to make the workflow
video to end all work further to cover
all the pieces I mean there's so much
more but this is kind of what I use and
I know by the way there's lots of online
editors and code pen and glitch and
there's a new one coming out for p5.js
soon so there's so many possibilities
but this is this is a way of working
just one just one all right so now here
we go how do i how do I use this p5
manager thing first of all you have to
be a little if you're on a Mac you've
got to feel a little comfortable using
terminal
if you're on Windows tell me what you do
on Windows so you've got to run this
piece of software called terminal it's
usually in applications utilities and it
looks something like this then you could
just magically type p5 generate - be my
project no no no you can't so here's I
think this is the command that I type
what this commands meat means is hey
generate a p5 project I want it to be a
bundle look I can talk about what that
is and I want it to be called my project
the thing is I'm gonna I'm gonna just
pretend there's something called x5
you're gonna see this x5 p5 command not
found when I do this it's actually going
to work whoops ignore that p5 generate -
be my project this is actually gonna
work when I do it because I've installed
p5 manager already and you can see what
this did it created a folder called my
project and it gave me sketched such as
index.html and by the way I kind of
forgot something important I'm realizing
is I also need all those library files
you actually don't need the library
files locally because index dot HTML can
like point out to a URL to get the p5
libraries and you'll see that in a lot
of examples and things but i but the p5
manager watch they give you those
library files locally alright here we go
now ok so how do you how do you install
this p5 manager one thing is I do have a
video where I go through how to install
this in more detail but I'm gonna do it
here anyway but you can I'll link to
that p5 manager video as well so the
thing that I need is a piece of software
called node a node is
JavaScript runtime built on chrome v8
JavaScript engine blah blah blah blah
it's a thing that you run JavaScript
programs on your computer and on servers
and lots of other places so you're gonna
want to download this and install it and
you'll know that it's working one of the
things you can type by the way in
terminal is clear and then I'll clear
everything you'll know that it's working
if you just take node and you get that
there so pause this video install node
go back to your terminal type in node
see if you get this and you can do
things like five plus seven and it gives
you twelve so you can run a little
JavaScript I'm gonna hit ctrl C and two
eggs again press ctrl C again I'm gonna
hit clear so once you have node
installed you need to use something
called NPM you've already got it
installed and to install the p5 manager
you have to say npm install p5 manager
now here's the thing you also want to
say - gee what this means is I want to
install this thing called p5 manager and
as a global thing for my computer I want
to be able to always type p5 Manager
wherever I am I'm gonna hit enter you
might have a problem it might well I
already installed it but I'm gonna let
it kind of go anyway and I got an error
so here's the problem
I forgot that in order to distill
something globally on my computer I have
to say sudo by ok what am i doing by the
way the up arrow the up arrow allows you
to scroll through previous commands so I
can go back and find this command and
I'm going to now say sudo which stands
for Super User do which will give me the
permission to install it ah
detected my password that's what this
there we go now I think I'm not having
like I did the same stick in a different
video so it's installed so that's great
I'm gonna hit clear and now I can so
here's the thing I can now you
that p5 command and look it's telling me
I'm running p5 manager zero point three
point two I don't know why the color
became all weird here
I like selected something I don't know
what's going on but I'm gonna just
pretend that's not happening now here's
the thing where do I want to make my
project well let's say I just want to
put the project on the desktop here's a
command that's useful for you
PWD print working directory and you can
see this is the director I'm in user
slash processing my user name is
processing on this particular login it
should probably be coding train or
whatever but now I can say CD for change
directory like maybe I just want to go
to the desktop so now if I say PWD here
we go and guess what let's say actually
want to go to some weird folder on my
computer if I go and say like oh there's
this like coding train folder and it's
frog or two and I want to put something
in there I can actually just drag the
folder into here let go and that's the
whole path users processing documents
old desktop PC D coding train frog or
two so I don't need to do that right now
and hit ctrl C and I'm just gonna say
clear I'm gonna say PWD I'm on the
desktop and now I'm gonna say p5
generate - B B stands for bundle p5
actually generate you this whole like
file system management for a lot the p5
manager for a lot of different sketches
I personally just like to generate one
sketch at a time so that's what - B does
- be coding train one so here we go hit
enter it created all those things and
now just to be sure I'm gonna minimize
all my windows and look at this on my
desktop is this folder called coding
train one and it now has index dot HTML
sketch touch yes and all the library
files that I need step one is done again
just one way to do that you just need
these files you can make them from
scratch you can download them somewhere
you can copy them from a previous
project but step one is done using p5
manager now I need step two so again so
many different possible
text editors let's use the atom editor
so the atom the software is a piece of
software you can get by going to atom do
and you can do download for whatever
your operating system is here you can
see this is kind of what it looks like
it is a text editor hooray
I already have atom installed so I'm
gonna go down here and I'm just gonna
use the search bar to type in atom so
I'm gonna run the atom application open
it and you can see it's just opening
this blank page you'll probably see some
like welcome messages and stuff I've
used it quite a few times so it's just
opening something blank and then I can
do file open I can go to the desktop and
I can just select this coding train
folder and I can press open and then
boom we can see here in the left pane
these are my files and this is blank and
I can click on sketch and I have the
code ready to go so if I add something
like background zero and let's make it
like a green color just to be sure this
is working or I've added some code now I
am going to do what I'm gonna just I'm
gonna throw caution to the wind and I'm
going to don't do this don't try this at
home
double click this index.html file and it
works so this is OK it's a very bad
habit please please please that's making
me so uncomfortable it's all green and
bright but you can see here this is what
I'm trying to avoid it opened the HTML
page via the file system and while just
drawing a green background it had no
problem with that there are many other
areas where you can have a problem so
what I really want to do is run a local
server now we're now done with step two
so now I need to go to step three hmmm
what local server should I run I have a
video I made a long time ago I ran a
Python server I think I used a node
server in another one I think I might
have used the atom live server package I
don't know which to use you know what
the p5 manager comes with its own server
in fact I think I'll just show you a
bunch
so one thing I can do I got an open
terminal back up one thing I can do is
first of all I want to be in the
directory of my sketch or in a directory
above actually would be fine let's just
run the load I don't know let's change
into the directory I'm gonna do this I'm
gonna hit clear again so I could type
some command to run a local server for
example this is a command if you have
Python installed on your computer which
a Mac will and it probably easy to
download install Pike Python and a PC
that is now running a local server and
if I go to the browser and type in
localhost colon 8080
goggle comm or yahoo.com but instead of
that web server somewhere off in the
Internet I want to connect to localhost
the web server running on this laptop
right here and 8000 is a port so when
you connect to a web page it's usually
on the default port 80 and you don't
specify it but this local server it told
me right here it's running it on port
8000 so that's why I knew to type 8000
there is another node package I could
install sudo npm install - g HTTP server
i think that's what it's called dot
server - server so i could install this
node package i already probably did and
then I could say HTTP server and now
it's running a server there it is
8080 there it is it's running a server
8080 and you can see this is my local IP
address so now I could take go there and
put this and I'm running the sketch hold
so many things another thing that I
could do is a lot of these text editors
will come with a special plugin or by
default of a menu option which says like
preview run live server that type of
thing I brackets is one that I did a
previous video on that has a little
button that you press which is for a
live preview and it runs a server so
Adam one of the things you can do with
Adam is you can under here there's
packages now you'll see I already have
dev lot no no actually you don't have it
so I don't have so this is perfect so
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna see can I
install a live server package with Adam
so packages oh so Adam I want to go to
preferences you suffer you see what I'm
doing I'm going to preferences and then
I want to go to install which is right
here install and then I want to look for
I'm gonna search for a live server dev
live reload oh maybe that's what oh no
Adam look so this is a circling that
I've installed dev live reload maybe
that does the trick to Adam live servers
what I was thinking of so I'm gonna
click install okay it installed because
I know that because now it says
uninstall or disable packages now I have
I have that installed I can just go to
Adam life server start server there are
keyboard shortcuts to automatically
launch it but I'm gonna launch it here
and boom there it is and here there's
another local server at this address and
that port and what's interesting about
this now is look at the green color I'm
just gonna go to my code and I'm going
to add this color I'm gonna hit save and
then I'm an alt tab to the browser it's
live reload so as I change the code like
okay well actually I just wanted a 600
by 400 canvas and I want to have like a
random something I don't know you can
see it's continuously reloading the page
for me which is wonderful so okay to
recap all the pieces that I'm using are
I'm getting my project files from p5
manager which is a node module so we
need to download and install node so I
can write some terminal commands with
notes I am using a text editor I happen
to be using Adam but any text editor
will do then I want to view the results
of my code in the web browser so I need
to run a server now someday you might
watch a video where I explain how to
program your own server for all sorts of
interesting things and I'll link to
those videos as well you can write your
own node server but you're gonna use a
built in node server you can use a built
in Python server if you have Python you
could look for a plugin for your text
editor just I'm sure the comments of
this video will be filled with lots of
other suggestions of how to run your own
server so here's something really
important something that you might
notice in a lot of
my example says I have this other pane
open in the browser where I can see
error messages or I can do console log
statements and the way I'm doing that in
chrome it's different in different
browsers it's under view developer
JavaScript console so if I click that
the JavaScript console it now pops up
over here you can see Adam is even
talking to it because it's saying hey
you've got I've got the live reload
enabled so one thing the couple
important points about this number one
is you might not appear there for you it
might be on the bottom you can pop it
out you can kind of control where it
goes you can you can look right here and
you can say oh I could put it on the
bottom or I could pop it out so that's
one important thing another really key
thing and depending on what the server
using is but I like to keep something
checked if I go here under settings and
I scroll all the way down to network
this is a pretty important setting
disable cache while dev tools are open
this is a setting you want to have
checked because sometimes browsers they
would like to remember stuff they like
say you know what I you're asking me to
do something I already you asked me did
this a while ago I'm just gonna do what
you asked me a while ago because it's
faster but if you changing you're
changing your code a lot you don't want
it - by accident run your old code so
this will disable its ability from
caching some previous version of your
code and running that instead whenever
these JavaScript console is open so if
you have that set you will never have
that problem and I can just go and I
wasn't having that problem because the
live reload is probably you know I can
change all these colors and it's it's
changing my code but that's an important
sort of detail there other question I'm
sure a lot of you are asking is if
you're using Windows what do you use
path as the equivalent of this terminal
application so there is just the command
prop on Windows there are also some I'm
reading the chat here some things that
you can install like cygwin c YG wi n
there are some other tools like you can
install the Linux file system maybe in
Windows 10 it actually does this for you
I have no idea I'm lost so if somebody
writes a helpful calm
about the what to do for your terminal
and windows I will pin that comment to
the top of this video's page and maybe
look for there and see if that's there
the chat is telling me that git bash is
also an excellent tool for Windows is
there some one that I've used before so
you can download something called git
bash I will include a link to that as
well in this video's description alright
I think I've covered everything just
just to like I think I feel like I
should do a whole video just on the
console alone but so maybe I'll do that
but just to like at least put something
in there I can do stuff like console dot
log you know Mouse X if I put that into
my code what I'm gonna see is I'm gonna
be able to debug the value of the mouse
as I'm running it and if I have some
kind of error like I misspelled
background and don't put the D on the
end you can see uncaught reference error
background is not defined so this is
where I say sketch digest line number
six so I can go back and see line number
six that's where my error is so that
JavaScript console is really a useful
tool to get used to using and practice
using so I hope this video didn't end up
being super long and I hope that you
found it helpful and I'm sure I'll end
up remaking this again because workflows
and tools is acknowledged easy to just
change constantly and thanks very much
for watching
