hi by the way this next video is about
color so by the previous video that I
just made I looked at shapes drawn
shapes into a canvas using beginner
steps with p5.js and now I you bet maybe
you made something with just shapes of
course the next the natural next step is
and make some stuff have some coloring
so maybe you had a canvas you have a
canvas perhaps has a rectangle on it
maybe it has a ellipse on it and maybe
it has some lines on it perhaps you came
up with a much more interesting design
than this and now we have to ask the
question how do I everything you notice
was just black lines and white interiors
so how do I color these shapes so to
draw these shapes we learned a bunch of
commands but really the word we should
be using is functions we I showed you a
bunch of functions rect ellipse line
these are three functions rex draws a
rectangle ellipse draws an ellipse line
draws a line in it these are for drawing
now for color
there are also functions and i think
there are three relevant ones that i
want to look at in this video
background stroke and fill the
background function will set a color for
the background the entire canvas
what is the color that's in the
background of the canvas although you
know the word background is a little bit
of a misnomer here even though it's we
use it i'm you going to use it to set
the background the order of when we call
these functions is quite crucial and i
will i will i will show you that as well
stroke stroke is the function that sets
the color for the outline of a shape so
what is the color of the pixels of a
line what is the color of the outline of
a rectangle and fill sets the color of
the into
of a shape so let's say we the code for
this was wrecked something or other lips
something or other line something or
other so now we need to figure out if I
want to set the stroke or the fill for
this rectangle where do I write these
functions where do i execute these
commands if i want to set the fill of
the stroke for the circle the ellipse
where do i write these commands and now
order of operations has always been
important but it's particularly
important when you call these functions
it's kind of like setting of the color
of a pen so before i draw the rectangle
i need to set the color of my pen to red
or blue etc so if i want to set the
stroke or fill i don't have a lot of
room here the stroke or fill of this
rectangle i need to write these function
calls before before i execute the
function rectangle and then if the next
thing I do is ellipse it will also use
that same stroke and fill and line will
also use that same stroke not the fill
because there's no fill for a line so if
I want to then change the color have a
different color for the ellipse then I
just need to have another call to stroke
and fill I'm gonna after I draw that
rectangle I need to set new pen colors
for that ellipse so so okay so this is
part one part one is I got to put these
things in some proper order part two is
what well what do I put inside here what
do I put inside these functions stroke
fill background etc that's a very good
question I wish I had time to answer
that question I do I have to answer it
okay so let's erase all this for a
moment and let's think about color now
there's a lot of ways to describe color
in the world you know I could get some
paint and I could would just say the
words red on the can and that would mean
that there's red there but we need a
mechanism we need a methodology we need
a system for defining color in p5.js ER
and
and we're going to use I'm going to use
the p5 just ism which is really just
mostly how colors define on in most
computer graphic systems and a basic way
that I'm going to look at it with you is
RGB color meaning a color is a
combination of an amount of red an
amount of green and an amount of blue so
for example if I say stroke 255 comma
zero comma zero what does this mean well
stroke can accept three arguments the
first one being the amount of red the
second one being the amount of green and
the third one being the amount of blue
so you can now sort of guess there's
clearly no green and no blue because
I've set the value to zero however
there's some amount of red 255 does that
mean like a little bit of red a lot of
red it turns out that means the maximum
amount of red so the range for these
arguments is between 0 and 255 meaning
there are 256 possibilities you know I'm
spending a minute to mention I can't
spell possibilities but I'm spending a
minute to mention this because this is
this way of counting is actually kind of
will come up again and again in
programming right let's say I said the
range is between 0 and 9 how many
possibilities are there there's 10 right
I got it
just take a moment to prove this to
myself 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 whoa 10 right
I counted to 10 it's confusing as I got
to the seat it's this is a very
confusing world we live in I got 2 9 but
there are 10 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 but I
really turned into a crazy person
counting up my fingers in a room by
myself cameras pointed at me but so this
is the range now why is it this range it
has to do with the way that information
is stored in the computer's memory and
bits and binary numbers and all that
stuff and I would love I actually
wouldn't love but I could or I might
fail at it but I could go talk about
that more but you could find another
video or maybe I'll make another video
send me an email or something we'll find
a way to talk about that more right now
I think it's easiest for us to just
think of this is the range and you can
change that range to there's a function
and p5 that allows you adjust that range
but for now let's keep that range 0 to
255 so by the way Phil will also take an
RGB with a range of 0 to 255 background
will also take the same range RGB so
let's go look at that now okay so I have
proceeded here a little program that's
drawing this little alien creature and
what I would like to do is take a moment
to add some color so and this is excused
to look at a couple other things number
one is you can add comments into your
program so the way that you add comments
is with a slash slash if you add two
slash / - a line of code the computer
will completely ignore that line of code
meaning it's not executed so you can put
you know whatever you want you could
write like little notes to yourself or
little secret notes to a friend who's
going to look at your code later
whatever you like to do but here you can
see a kind of typical use well this
rectangle is the body of this this
ellipsis the head these tulips lips.i
ellipses lips lips lips so waka Buddha
doodle those are the eyes and these two
lines are the legs so this is a useful
thing I would get in habit of this now
if you can get yourself to do it it
makes things easier later so for example
if I just add right now Phil to 5500 and
I hit play we can see look everything is
all red all the shapes now have a fill
of red but if I were to come down here
and say fill 0 255 comma 0 and look what
I've done
no red all green no blue and now you can
see the eyes have a fill of green now de
Nathan come after the eyes just the legs
and the legs don't have a fill so green
only affected the eyes and I could say
here fill 0 0 255 and I could hit run
again we can see now the body is red the
eyes are green and the head
is blue now interestingly this order of
operations is really important notice
how the head is drawn after the body
let's just very briefly whoops let's
just very briefly move the head above
the body and you can see what's going on
here that rectangle is covering that
ellipse so p5 is is going to draw the
shapes layer them in the order of the
sequence of the code in draw so that's a
kind of key piece so just the way this
design works is the head has got to come
after the body so that it covers up that
top portion of the rectangle and the
same is true in terms of fill and stroke
if I take this red fill and put it after
body the body is no longer is red
because I called fill after rectangle so
that red fill has to go before rectangle
that's kind of a crucial piece of
information as well the other thing we
should notice here is that I have
background here now background let's
make the background some so first of all
you can combine you don't have to just
do all red and no green and blue I don't
I don't really I'm not very good at this
color thing I hope that you are but you
can obviously combine colors you know
you put red and green together and you
get something like put a little red a
little green and no blue you can see you
get like a kind of a different green
let's put a lot more red get kind of
like a yellowish greenish thing that's
kind of yellow so you can see that you
can start to play around with different
amounts of red and green but notice how
this background there background you you
think like okay background it's drawing
the background so whatever I call
background with the color it should put
everything behind but you ever remember
background all it's doing is actually
filling the entire canvas with the color
so if I were to take background and put
it at the very end of draw you can see
now background is being called after all
the code I won't see anything at all all
those things were drawn but when we get
to the end of draw to see the results
background has covered anything so this
is another reason why the order
of operations is important and I'm
mostly finished now but I want to
mention two other things about color
okay
so let's look at something in background
let's say I put fifty comma 50 comma 50
what did I get I got kind of this dark
gray let's make it a hundred
whoops hundred fifty hundred fifty
hundred fifty I got this light gray so
one thing you'll notice if the red value
equals the green value equals the blue
value you get a gray you get you get a
color grayscale color is all zero being
all black all 255 being all white why is
this so the reason why this is is were
the way the color works here is the same
as the way color works with light so if
you take a bright red flashlight and a
bright green flashlight and a bright
blue flashlight you shine them all
together you add all the colors together
adding up colors you get things are
brighter and brighter and brighter
you'll get white no color the absence of
color is black so grayscale color is
something you want might want to use
kind of often and it's inconvenient to
write 150 150 150 so one of the things
that you can do is you could also call
all these functions background stroke
and fill with only a single argument if
you use a single argument it's just you
get the grayscale color so that's an
important thing the other thing I should
mention kind of briefly but you have to
dive in this little more is these
functions alright we looked at how these
functions will always take three
arguments now we could saw how they
could take one argument there's another
possibility they can also take four
arguments and that last argument and oh
you can't see what I'm writing here is a
transparency sometimes refer to as alpha
transparency so is that color well all
of our colors have been fully opaque
when you put a shape on top of another
shape it completely blocks out the other
shape but if you want to create the
illusion but being see-through you can
add a fourth argument zero being
completely see-through you can't even
see the color at all 255 being 100%
opaque that's what we've been doing
already
so let's look at
that very briefly I think a nice place
to see that would be with the head let's
see what you got here so remember how
that head was covering up this rectangle
what if I add a fourth argument to the
fill and I say like 100 you can see now
that that head is transparent - it has
its own fill but you can kind of see
what's behind it you know there's
obviously a ton of stuff you can do with
like color and combining it and shapes
in a million different ways hopefully
this gives you a basic start and what I
would say is if you were working on a
design from your previous that you
worked on after watching the previous
video now try to add some color with it
and again just to mention what I would
recommend you do and I seem to have lost
that page is go to p5.js go to reference
go to color and whoops I clicked
something wrong go to color and you can
see here are the functions that you
might take a look at fill stroke
background by the way no fill if you
want to not have an interior shape an
interior color first shake no stroke if
you want to not have an outline color
mode that's that function I was kind of
mentioning you could change the range if
you don't want to have your color
between 0 and 255 you want to go between
0 and 100 there's also other ways of
thinking about color you can just dive
into that a bit yourself but again the
nice thing about working with p5 is you
can go here and you can just hit edit
and you could play around and say okay
this is grayscale 51 and now I'm going
to change it to RGB and run it and see
what I get but you can see there's lots
of different postures so many different
ways you can do color actually in p5 and
I kind of barely just scratch the
surface of it okay but this is a guy
this has got to be the end of this video
it's 15 minutes long which is a very
long time in the internet world and I'm
gonna go eat some lunch now before fall
over okay
have a good rest of your day I'll be
back making more later oops come on
