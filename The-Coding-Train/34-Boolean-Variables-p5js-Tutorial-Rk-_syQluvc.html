about conditional statements and I
recall or I thought of during one of
them that there's sort of a key element
here that I think would be worth noting
and spending a little bit of time on in
its own short little video which I am
attempting to make right now have tried
to be perky because like really inside I
feel like lying down to taking a nap
okay so what is the topic of this video
and what I want to talk about is what if
you had a variable and instead of
assigning the value of that variable to
say a number or perhaps a string or
perhaps an image these are some things
that you may or may not have seen so far
what if the value of that variable
I'm going to call it like going or equal
to true itself or false so in fact this
is a datatype now as you know anytime
you declare a variable you just say var
and the name of the variable and then
it's up to you to assign it a value most
of the examples we've seen so far we
give those variables numbers numbers are
useful they can be used to specify
coordinates on the screen sizes of
shapes colors red components of the
color transparency the color numbers
generally are being used over and over
again
everywhere in code however it can be
useful to have your own variable that is
either set to true or false now before I
get to that one of the reasons why I'm
mentioning this to you is there also
happens to be a variable built into p5
right there are the variables built into
p5 that you likely know about mouse X
and Mouse Y these variables are numbers
they hold the coordinate as to where the
mouse is on the screen but there is also
a variable called Mouse is pressed and
this particular variable is a it's data
type is boolean meaning it's either true
or false so this is relevant because why
is this relevant this is relevant
because sometimes you want to know is
the mouse being pressed or is it not now
earlier in a previous video at some
point in some life where I may visit
this other video there
to be a function a function called
mousepressed and i stated at the time
that this function is an event meaning
the code that you write inside this
function gets executed instantly the
moment the mouse is pressed so why is
there a mouse pressed event but also a
boolean variable to check whether the
mouse is pressed or not and the
distinction comes down to the following
and this is a really key distinction
which is totally built into the way that
you live your life and use a computer
but you may not have thought about it
it's such detail because it's kind of
like just sort of like inherent way of
being but there's a difference between
clicking the mouse I want to click the
mouse to instigate something versus I
want to hold down the mouse to have
something happen continuously while I'm
holding down the mouse and in essence
the boolean variable is something you
want to use when you want to test if the
mouse is being held down and the
function mousepressed is the function
you want to use when the mouse for the
event the moment is in the mouse is
being clicked all the stuff that happens
after that is it being held down there's
also a mouse release function for
knowing when it's released but I but I
digress so let's look at the distinction
between these two and I'm not sure
exactly how I'm going to do this but I'm
going to go back to the example the
rollover example and see if we can kind
of play around with this idea of it as a
button versus a rollover okay so let's
look let's review this example I 11
since the last time you saw this example
because in my fantasy world people are
just watching these videos what happened
if another sequence which I don't know
if it's true I don't know if anybody's
watching I'm doing this anyway you don't
have to watch it's just something I do
to entertain myself during my day and so
I'm going to hit run this and you can
see I did a couple things one is I used
this function rect mode so now the
rectangle is being drawn according to
its center and then I adjusted the
coordinates and I added the y coordinate
so this if statement has become very
long I'm checking if mouse X is between
the left and right hand side of the
rectangle between the top and bottom so
you can see this works perfectly now it
only only changes color if the mouse is
anywhere within that rectangle so we've
got a rollover now what if I wanted to
when when you're inside the circle do
something when the mouse is pressed
sorry okay I know what I'm doing here so
let's look at that if mouse is pressed
variable so I'm actually add just a
completely separate if statement and I'm
going to say if mouse is pressed
background and I actually I think I want
to put this yeah put I want to put this
above that one just actually doesn't
really matter but I'm going to put it up
here just to kind of for a second just
to kind of keep it all together so look
I've added another I've had it another
if statements are lost my train of
thought or but everything will come back
so if the mouse is pressed change the
background so remember this is different
then I click the mouse and one thing
happens at the event now I'm checking
this is the mouse pressed in draw so
what I'm trying to do here is check is
the user holding down the mouse this is
how this is used okay so now if I click
the mouse I'm holding it down you can't
see here watch this this is going to be
a really crazy moment for you this is my
computer rising and this like mechanical
testing we did this doesn't really help
but just check those computer air I'm
going to now hold down the mouse it is
green I am now letting go it is not
green so I have this interaction which
is different then I click the mouse and
it's green forever we're going to have
to sort of see how to do that the other
thing what I want to do is only actually
have this happen when I'm on if I'm on
this on this roll over so let's do let's
figure that out so it's kind of silly
but the way I'm going to do it right now
is take this if statement whoa and put
it inside this if statement now I
probably could figure out a way of
joining this with another hand but what
I'm saying here is look at this look at
this this is kind of exciting and
different if the mouse over let me put
this back down
if the mouse is within that rectangle
and it's press to change the background
but doesn't matter where it's pressed or
not if it's when the rectangle always
change the highlight so we can see the
logic here that I now have it's always
good always have this roll over it's
going to get highlighted as soon as the
mouse is over there I could click
anywhere around it doesn't change color
but now when I click here but only when
I'm holding it down okay so now that's
using the if mouse is pressed what if I
wanted this this is this is like a
button that you hold down it's like if
you had a light at home and in order to
have the light on you just always had to
hold down the button to switch as soon
as you left it like turned off so with
your light at home you want to press it
it goes on you leave you can come back
later you could press it again now for
this to happen we need an entire other
kind of we need another variable okay
and we need to use the mouse pressed
event so we're going to piece these
things together so now we have a
rollover where you hold down how nine
seven minutes you hold down the mouse it
turns the light on what I want to do is
press the little button turn the light
on press the button turn the light off
this is kind of like strangely such a
simple thing so a bit of a tricky a
tricky interaction problem in tricky
programming logic something like that
problem let's figure it out okay so
ultimately what I want now is to have my
own the way to do this
is is not to use the mouse is pressed
variable that has a value that's just
built into the operating system into p5
into JavaScript into the browser
it knows where the mouse is press or not
I want to have my own variable I want to
have a very bun call it on might be
something might be an issue with using
this term on but for now I think it's
going to be okay and I'm going to start
with on equal to false so then the
program first runs the light is off when
on is false the light is off and in draw
what I essentially want to do is I want
to say if on then set the background to
some other color otherwise set the
background to some other color so this
is the idea here
if I have my own boolean variable that's
either false or true I could just change
the value of that variable somewhere
else in the code when I click the mouse
turn this to true and the light will
always be on that I have to figure out
when do I set it back equal to false so
let's take a look at at doing this with
this now in theory I should upload all
these code examples somewhere and I got
to figure out a way to do that but the
very least where I'm going to do is save
project as conditionals button and
hopefully that previous one will be
saved so I go to I'm going to take some
of this code for a second and just stick
it at the bottom and put it in comments
because I may need to refer to it later
so down here we might need to get back
this rollover code and maybe we need to
look at the if Mouse's press thing again
but right now instead what I want to do
is just add at the top VAR on equals
false and here I want to say if on
background a green background otherwise
a black background so let's look at that
this is just a simple if statement if on
otherwise marker now I there's actually
like I can't believe I didn't even
mention this really because we looked at
this with mouse is pressed we looked at
this with look at the on is just sort of
intuitive to be but always before when
you had a boolean expression you needed
to have some sort of like relational
operator like if mouse x is greater than
100 here I just said the whole point of
this is this evaluates to true or false
that sort of off the edge or a bit of
glare there but this evaluates to true
or false a variable with type boolean
you don't need to check anything about
it it inherit itself just has the value
true or false it evaluates to true or
false that's what it's a toll purpose in
life you could technically say this you
could say if
on equals true and this would be the
same thing like if on has the value true
but this is redundant so this might
actually help to sort of think about it
this is really what's going on but code
wise it's a little bit shorter to just
write if on and then open curly braket
okay so now I'm coming back over here
and we see that now if on green
otherwise black so I'm going to run this
you can see there's no green because on
is set to false and I'm not setting it
to true anywhere now if on is set to
true I'm going to hard-code that now the
background is green because on is true
so this code is being executed so now
the difference between wanting to do
something when the mouse is held down
versus instigated event the moment the
mouse is clicked is I need to add
function mousepressed so instead of
before remember with the holding down
the mouse i had this if mouse pressed
and draw now i want to have this event
and what i can't do i don't want to put
draw the green background here right
remember draw is always looping so
drawing code here in this case doesn't
really make sense because it will just
get overridden by what happens in draw
what I want to do is change the state of
the program how do I change the state of
the program well on starts that's false
that's its initial value and when I run
the program it's false it's black what I
want to do is say when I click the mouse
set on equal to true or on equals true
so now on equals true let's click the
mouse tada it's on click the mouse again
it didn't turn off also when I run this
again I can click out here it turns it
on so how do I get it only to turn to on
if I'm within the bounds of that
rectangle well that's an easy thing
that's why I save this code we can now
inside mousepressed test for books we
can test for the location
so the thing that I've added right here
is now when the mouse is pressed first
check see where the mouse is and only if
it's within that rectangle set it equal
to on so let's run this again okay I'm
clicking all around the outside
nothing's happening I'm going to click
in the center here comes it turns on now
I want it to turn off so this is a
tricky one if it's on if it's true it
should go off otherwise if it's off it
should become already confused myself we
want it to toggle its state true becomes
false false becomes true true becomes
false false becomes true and I could
actually type this out
I could diagram this for you but I'm
just going to kind of type it out I'm
going to say if on is true on should be
false otherwise on should be true now
this is kind of like oh the camera shut
off here I'm trying to get back on so
this is definitely again is like a point
of confusion the temperature off I don't
need to go over there anymore this is
definitely a point of confusion it's
tricky like sort of like very circular
weird logic but think about it if it's
on turn it off otherwise it must have
been off so turn it on so let's see if
that works
yay so now I have this button every time
I press it I change the state of the
program pretty exciting now this however
can be condensed all into one line of
code and it involves an operator that I
this is perfect because I was like what
operator did I forget the not operator
is something that I forgot
so let me oh I do need to come over here
so I need to turn this camera back on so
I want to look here at the not operator
so we know that I could say something
like if mouse X is greater than 100 do
something and I could invert this like
the opposite if it's greater than 100
would be kind of like less than or equal
to 100 but I can also say if it's not
true that it's greater than 100 do
something and the not operator is an
exclamation point
so for example if not on what does this
mean
do something so I have a variable on
it's equal to false does this code get
executed yes or no not false is true so
this expression together evaluates to
true therefore this code does get does
get evaluated so let me make another
statement to you and this is like really
this is like very uncomfortable here
we're going to do it on equals not on
what does that mean I want to set the
value of this variable to not itself so
if its value is false not false is true
if its value is true not true is false
so this much like we had that expression
speed equals speed times negative one
this reversed the polarity of a number
three becomes negative three negative
three becomes three take a number
multiplied by negative one makes a
negative positive a positive negative
this expression takes a boolean value
makes false true or true false so if I
come back over here and look at this I
could take all of this right here which
has this effect of toggling the boolean
variable and I could just change it to
one line of code equals not on and I'm
going to run this the light goes on and
off I've got a button I can click
outside and nothing happens I click
inside now we lost our little roll over
so I'm going to also add that back in
which is just about highlighting the
color and so we don't need the mouse's
press part anymore sorry and so all
we're doing here sorry
Allah is I wanted to add in also so
notice if I want to check is the mouse
over it continuously that's something I
need to do and draw but at the moment
the mouse is pressed I also
to check is the mouse over it for the
button so this is now has the
functionality of if I'm over it it's
highlighted but only if I click does
that button engage so I have a couple
things to say about this number one is
anytime you notice two pieces of code in
your program that are basically
identical you should ask yourself the
question is there a better way to do
this
now we haven't we need to get further
down the road here but maybe there's a
way we could create our own function
that tested if a if the mouse is over a
given point and we kind of do that in
two places without how copying pasting
the same code that's something we're
going to see later then I'm going to
show you later the other thing to think
about here that's super interesting
again I think it's a point that I
started with is we just spent oh my god
this is 20 minutes this video crazy
20 minutes just looking at how to like
make a button to happen you know
rollover versus a button and what's
interesting about working in p5 and in
the browser is later on as I get to
further topics I would like to show you
how you can add buttons and interface
elements that you get essentially for
free that are part of the native browser
environments they're HTML elements
they're elements that you can add to a
web page with a little bit of actually
code in p5 will let you just create one
and you can kind of hook different
events and the the p5 is going to take
care of a lot of this is the mouse over
it or did the mouse press it that type
of thing but I think there's a moment
here as you're just starting out
programming working in the raw canvas
that it's worthwhile to try to program
some of these button and rollover kind
of elements and it's just good practice
and kind of gets you working with all
this logics up it'll be interesting to
compare to it later so I would say if
you're trying to think of an exercise to
piggyback off of this is you might have
some stuff try have ad putting this kind
of button on a sketch where there's
something moving around the screen and
when you press the button can you make
that like thing move in a different
direction or change its size or what
kind of other types of things can you
hook into like a button like this
besides just changing the background
color okay hopefully that was useful to
you I am now going to stop this video
and I'm going to move on to making some
videos about loops
it's not recording</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
