this little section about variables in
p5.js and before I go because I'm not
going anywhere because all I do is stay
in this room and make videos before
before I go on to the next topic which
is conditional logic which will really
unlock a lot of creative possibilities
for you I want to give you one last tool
that'll hopefully make things a little
bit more exciting in your life and that
is the random function so the random
function so we you and me together I've
been doing a lot of stuff like this VAR
x equals 50 this is well and good and
because X is a variable and 50 is a
perfectly fine number and I'm happy with
my rectangle at pixel 50 but there might
be a time where you want the whole point
of doing this programming thing is to
have systems of logic rules to generate
behaviors and graphics and designs it's
not really about like let me pick my 5
favorite numbers and set those variables
for those numbers so there's a lot more
to it but a first step in that direction
so we could least say here's the rule
whenever my program runs the circle will
appear at a random X location so instead
of saying VAR x equals 50 I could say
something like var x equals random and
random is a function just like any other
function line ellipse fill stroke it
requires some arguments to define how
that function will behave and random if
you watch the previous video is just
like the map function and if you recall
or if you didn't watch it the difference
is when you say line a line is drawn on
the screen the line function performs
the task when you say random a task is
performed picking a random number but
that function resolves to it evaluates
to that number and you can take that
number what it resolves to and assign it
back to something a variable value in
this case so if I say 0 comma 50 I'm
kind of at the edge of the semicolon
there the parameters the arguments that
random takes are a minimum and a maximum
and random will give you a number in
between 0 and 50 one thing that's
important here to realize which is a
small little distinction is that here
are some numbers you might get to 2170
look at 73 that's above 50 42 but I will
mention you probably won't ever get
these I mean we could get these numbers
we're likely gonna get numbers like this
it's giving you actually what as soon as
referred to as floating-point numbers or
decimal numbers so in this case it
doesn't really matter p5 can handle that
if you get the number 50 point three
four five six seven it knows to just
draw something at pixel 50 but there's
other cases where we might need to do a
little something more with that I
probably shouldn't even mention this
because it's like a little unnecessary
point of confusion but I've already
started we sorted this video like five
times so I'm going for it okay so let's
actually start messing around with this
and see what happens okay so I have a
sketch here actually I'm going to start
a new one I know I'm gonna say file new
project and I'm going to call this dots
and what I would like to do is have some
variables and I'm you know I'm going to
use objects since we learned about these
I cover those in a previous video so I
have a point and I'm also going to have
a color
let's see how I'm doing here with my
having just learned JavaScript syntax so
you can see I'm setting up a couple
variables I want to have a point that
has an X on my finger disappeared the
point that has an x and a y I want to
have a color with an R a G and a B
because my plan for all this is first
and set up obviously to create a canvas
let's make it a nice small size and then
in Drew and then what I'm going to do is
I'm going to I'm going to set a
background I'm going to set it in setup
because I'm going to just just
background just happen once and then in
the lips I'm going to draw the ellipse
at point x comma point y it's going to
be a small lips and I'm going to fill it
at color our color G color dot B so I
can zoom back out here and we can see we
should be able to run this sketch now
hit run okay problem with scope what
happened look at this interesting
ellipse is receiving an empty variable
in spot number 1 - this is not
intentional color dot our color dot B I
could put some semicolons here what did
I miss
RGB Oh help help look at this what am I
doing here
Oh ellipse no it's ellipse it's got oh
look some crazy stuff has happened here
some horrible stuff this video is a
disaster I'm going to fix it might cut
this out if I remember to point comment
X 100 Y is 50 point X point Y ellipse
alright let's let's do some things first
when we have these kind of problems this
is a useful point let's just comment out
the offending lines of code it's save
and hit run get no errors anymore let's
let's comment back in phil we can figure
out what's going on
still no errors let's draw an ellipse
the old-fashioned way and let's see if
this works okay that seems good now
what's wrong with my point X and point y
let's try this just point comma X let's
run it again empty variable in spot one
you know wonder if point let's call it
spot if there's something wrong with
using point yeah
huh wow this is interesting we're gonna
have to look into that so I don't know
if point must be some keyword that's
doing oh oh I've done something horrible
boy wow this is great this is great okay
I know what's happened I know what's
happened this is great okay so um so
here's the thing um what wouldn't I just
do let's think of some functions in p5 I
know I'm on off on like this horrible
tangent now for another five minutes but
some functions in pi5 are like line
rectangle for drawing a rectangle
ellipse for drawing an ellipse what if
you want to draw a point on the screen
huh well what's the name of that
function again point so point is like a
kind of an important thing in p5 that's
meant for something highly specific
drawing a point so if I try to make up a
variable called point I've completely
overridden the existing point function
and you know what I didn't actually
override it because p5 then overrode my
variable because things are happening in
weird orders and strange ways so that
didn't work he was trying to like use
the point function as the place to draw
the point and everything exploded I got
a weird error message so that might be
something that p5 could handle with a
friendlier message and maybe after this
video is over someone will file a github
issue maybe that person will be me but
let's go back and we solved it but
hopefully you saw this the steps of
debugging of like everything was like
exploding and going wrong and just if
you can't take it
calm down calming some stuff out start
putting it back in slowly see where
things go wrong we've gotten a bit
further but now we're back I'm back this
video still only at 8 minutes which is
totally reasonable and we're going to
I'm going to go back and change this to
spot and I'm going to say spot X spot
comma Y and I'm going to run it and we
can see there we go I have the circle
and I'm going to move this over here
being drawn excuse me I'm like what this
to give me a little more space I have
the circle being drawn at 100 comma 50
where the spot is with this particular
color so what happens we start to add
some randomness here so one thing I
could do first remember draw looping
over and over and over again so what if
I just say spot x equals random between
0 and 600 this is another things worth
mentioning I want I have a random spot
anywhere between 0 and the width of that
canvas the width of that canvas is 600
so I could write the number 600 there
that does happen to be a built-in
variable in p5 that knows just
dynamically what the width of the window
is and this is useful to use because if
I use that variable width here instead
of typing 600 if I later change the size
and create canvas I don't have to change
it elsewhere in my code so I'm going to
do that and I'm also going to say spot Y
is random 0 - height so now let's run
this program and look I just get spots
all over the place spot spot spots all
with a nice red color but perhaps what I
want is to say color dot R equals random
between like I'm going to 100 and 255
color G is always zero color dot B is
random between you know 100 and 190 I'm
just picking like random arbitrary
ranges here and now we might see look
I've got a nice variation of random
purplish-pinkish and I could even say
add a little bit of alpha here and run
this again and you can see I have a nice
little like point
to list and you actually one thing
you're noticing here if you look really
close there's a little black outlines
because I didn't turn off the stroke so
what I'm going to do now is say no
stroke and stop and start and there they
just look at this beautiful all these
nice little dots layering there's this
nice little pointillist thing so you
could take this much farther you could
make random sizes you can map the random
ranges based on like where like if the
dots appear on the left are more
greenish if they're on the right they're
more blueish so there's so much you
could do try to see maybe try to create
a random painting here you could use
other shapes besides just circles that
sort of thing that sort of says an
exercise you could try I also might
return to this particular program if you
remember this we worked on just a little
bit of a painting program where you move
the mouse around and as you move the
mouse around you paint something and so
what if you could every time you right
now every time you click the mouse it
erases the background what if you do
every time you click the mouse you get a
random background color or as you move
the mouse the color changes randomly so
there's lots of think interesting
possibilities there you can make this
painting program a bit more
sophisticated ok so that is the end of
this video and I think this wraps up my
section of videos on variables and I'm
going to keep that weird little thing
that that happened that I think was a
good good moment for today ok see you
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
