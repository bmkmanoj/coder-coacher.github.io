moment in our life of learning to
program the computer and in fact this
this may very well be the biggest moment
of all of the moments and I'm sure I'll
just say in the next video it's a
biggest moment but right now it really
is because we're going to start talking
about conditional statements that may
not sound like it's the most super
biggest moment ever but it really is
let's first so let's let's understand
why this is going to be such a huge leap
for that we're going to take maybe
perhaps you don't remember where we last
left off where we last left off we had
this nice processing sketch we were
learning about variables we declared a
variable at the top we initialized its
value to zero and then we manipulated
the value of that variable by
incrementing it every time through draw
which looped over and over again when we
run this sketch we have our circle and
it's going there it is it's going going
going going very very slowly so this is
like awkward now but eventually it's
going to get to the end and it's going
to leave and it's not going to come back
and it's that's sad it's a sad moment
for the circle for us the programmer for
processing everything but we will now
get over this sad moment and we're going
to add something new to our bag of
tricks our bag of tools we're going to
be able to say if the ball if the circle
reaches the end of that window do
something else change color turnaround
reset your position back to somewhere
else this is this is this is what we're
going to do with this videotape so we're
just going to get started with this so
let's start let's let's move over here
and let's think about what are the nuts
and bolts of what we're doing we are
writing now a new kind of block of code
it is going it is called a conditional
statement we'll write this down
conditional statement and it is going to
look like this
if open parenthesis this is the squeaky
pen I don't know where the other one is
can I pause for a second pause okay got
a new pen if open parenthesis
close parentheses open curly braket
close curly bracket some code I guess
all these pens squeak to some extent but
I don't filleted it's not bothering you
like it's bothering me okay so enough
about the pen what do we have here
if parenthesis parenthesis something
that's going to go in the middle here
open curly braket close curly brackets
oh this looks familiar in some ways this
is a block of code just like we had a
set up and draw setup instead has a
beginning and an end with the curly
brackets draw has a beginning and end
with the curly brackets but we are now
having a block of code with this what
this would this block of code means is
if whatever is in here is true then
execute this code if not don't execute
this code so this is a moment where we
now have the ability to add some logic
to our program that lets the program
take a path it could choose to execute
some code it could draw some stuff on
the screen or it could not draw some
stuff on the screen it could change the
values of some variables or it could not
change the values of some variables so
if it's always doing this through draw
every time through draw sometimes it'll
execute things one way sometimes it'll
execute things a different way
this allows our program to have
different behaviors at different moments
in time so this simple simple structure
is incredibly powerful and important so
what I want to do in this video is
really just talk about we're going to
obviously be a whole set of videos about
conditional statements we'll look at
lots of scenarios but what I want to
focus on in this particular video is
really just this question mark what goes
in there and what goes in there is known
as a boolean expression now a boolean
expression is some an expression that
evaluates to only true or false for
example I could say my name is Francis
and that would be false or I could say I
am an extremely nervous person and that
would stay true you know the thing about
it is that's a little bit I should point
out that's a little bit subjective you
know we could in in English
we might say things like I'm feeling a
little melancholy today and that you
know that could be sort of true mostly
true but not exactly true because I'm
only a little bit I don't know what I'm
saying but the point is there when the
types of boolean expressions we're going
to write for a computer program are
going to be distinctly true or false
only one or the other no gray area
whatsoever now there are many ways that
we're going to see that we can create a
boolean expression but the simplest way
what's going to be most useful for us
right now to start with is using
something called a relational operator
so let's make a list of relational
operators
what are relational operators here's one
greater than this really this
technically does squeeze another one is
less than greater than or equal less
than or equal I'm going to list a couple
here more at the bottom there a little
bit goofy equals two equal signs or not
equals exclamation equals so one of the
things about programming is sometimes
syntax can be a little bit cryptic right
if I want to ask if something is not if
I want to test if so value is not equal
to another value I need to know that
these symbols for that or exclamation
point equals not equals
so we'll see examples of this as we go I
think for right now let's just focus on
just these two simple relational
operators it'll get us going
so let's write some boolean expressions
here is a boolean expression for u6 is
greater than 5 this is an expression
that evaluates to true or false is this
a true statement or is it a false
statement that is definitely most
definitely true here is another one 717
is less than negative 10 is that true or
is that false
that's quite obviously false right there
is no way for this expression to be
something other than true or false even
if I say 7 is greater than 7 is that
true or false
that is
so we can see these are the types of
boolean expressions that we can write
with these relational operators is one
value greater than another value is one
value less than another value less than
or equals equals not equals etc so these
are boolean expressions using relational
operators that must mean they go in
between the parentheses up here because
this is where you put your boolean
expression if six is greater than five
execute that code if this expression
evaluates to true execute this code if
this expression evaluates to false skip
and keep going right don't evaluate that
code so now let's look at this and think
to ourselves does it make any sense at
all in any universe to write that code
think about that for a second well I
argue I make I'm going to pick the
argument right now that this while
syntactically is correct it's no logical
value right because six greater than
five can never ever be anything but true
so there's no point in having this
conditional statement because we're
always going to execute that code so the
point of writing these condition
expressions is not to use hard coded
numbers but to use variables variables
which have variable values sometimes the
value of that variable might be greater
than five sometimes it might not be
greater than five for example what if I
were to say if Mouse X is greater than
five
so if the value of the mouse X is about
if the value of the mouse's exposition
is greater than five then execute that
code so only when I have my mouse over
here execute this code if I don't have
my mouse over there execute some other
code think about it like if you need to
program a roll over from scratch right
you need you have this rectangle on the
screen and whenever the mouse is over
that rectangle you want it to light up
and change color that's what you're
going to do it if the mouse X is greater
than here and if it's less than here and
if Y is greater than here if it's less
than here it's within all these bounds
then draw a different color this is
where we're going with this type of
stuff okay so I think this kind of gives
us the pieces the beginning pieces of
what the formula conditional statement
looks like what a boolean expression is
what some basic boolean expressions are
using relational operators let's just
get one tiny little example in code and
then we'll move on to the next video
okay so let's put aside our whoops sorry
our our bouncing ball the program that
we're hoping to eventually turn into a
bouncing ball a sketch for a moment and
let's do something quite simple so here
we have a processing sketch that does
nothing but draw a gray background size
and background and draw let's add some
new code in here let's add this
conditional statement if Mouse X is
greater than I know pick a value
everybody's just a few there it's just
me it's very sad 200 then I'm going to
say background um duh I pick a color any
color I agree a red that's red I guess I
don't know a little yellowish or
something whatever
here's another color we're gonna run
this sketch look gray background look
there's a line of code in there
background some other color but we don't
see it's not happening why because mouse
X is currently not greater than 200 what
is the value Mouse X no maybe it's about
20-30 years exciting moment it's about
to happen 50 100 hundred 50 either is it
orange what that's a nice color like
orange so you can see that whoa it's not
whoa so we can see pixel 200 is right
about there and we could be a little bit
better about this and we could do
something like say stroke 255 draw a
line at pixel 200 and so then I could at
least see that hey whenever the mass is
on this side it's gray whenever the
mouse on this side it's orange so you
know this just like quite possibly the
most very very very very simple
beginning of conditionals but I I would
I would venture to say for a moment that
one of the amazing things about
programming is all you really need is
data variables and conditionals to be
able to make different choices we're
going to look at lots of stuff loops and
functions and objects and all sorts of
other fundamentals of computation but I
would suggest that even with just the
all that I've shown you so far that you
can have variables and that you can have
a conditional statement there's nothing
you could not program right now
nothing everything else is just going to
be about
helping make your code shorter more
organized more efficient I mean
obviously you're really going to want to
have a loop otherwise you sometimes have
thousands of lines of code but but
really a sort of important moment to
realize that you now have all the tools
to make anything you could imagine so
you should really start giving this a
try so if you're looking for a little
exercise to to try before you get to the
next video what I would suggest now is
think about this program could you write
a conditional statement that said that
execute this task if the ball if the
circle reaches the right-hand edge of
the window reset its location back to
the left-hand edge now I stated that in
a sort of very English language kind of
way I could state it more like code more
like pseudocode more like code and
eventually write the code for it but
think about that where would you put
that conditional statement can you get
that to work very simple exercise and
we'll move on in the next video and do
more with this stuff okay but I want to
say something profound at the end but
there is nothing profound other than I
am staring into the abyss of an empty
camera and I bid you adieu because I am
