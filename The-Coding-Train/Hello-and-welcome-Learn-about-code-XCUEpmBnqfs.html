making kind of a promotional video
what's in this channel here so I like to
make videos about programming and I hope
that you watch them and maybe learn
something new make some art make
something different think about the
world in a different way and in these
videos I use two different programming
environments I use something called
processing here's processing three built
on top of the Java programming language
p5.js built on top of the JavaScript
programming language both of these are
part of the processing Foundation which
is a nonprofit organization I'll leave
that for another video but what kinds of
things do I have in my videos you might
like to learn about are you interested
in drawing and art and color and images
well one of the things you can do with
processing is read input from a camera
you can draw stuff onto the screen
shapes here now all of these circles are
being colored according to me uh-huh
and then so you can see this is kind of
interesting you can learn about how to
do stuff like this another thing that
I'm super interested in is looking at
the natural world not natural the world
itself how do things work this is a
flocking system originally developed by
Craig Reynolds and the implicit
influence it and in processing looks at
patterns of like birds or bees or what
about you know physics and motion and
tree growth and fractals you know for
interaction design for art for game
design for programming games this is
useful content I have a whole lot of
videos about this sort of stuff are you
interested in making stuff that runs on
the web you could look at some of my
videos about p5.js data is something you
might be interested in here's an example
that queries the New York Times says hey
New York Times how many times did the
word computer appear from 1950 to 2015
and you could see a little graph of that
and also just like I don't know if I
wanted to make some weird thing with
some sliders on a page that like danced
back and forth by themselves I have a
whole video that just looks at how you
do that so how do you make stuff happen
on the web I did this in under two
minutes that was my entire goal I've
never done that before so watch it send
me an email send me a tweet I've got to
stop five four three</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
