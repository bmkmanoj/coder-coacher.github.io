series of videos all about working with
data working with data using in
JavaScript in particularly using the
p5.js JavaScript framework but of course
this this topic is much bigger than any
one library or framework or programming
language it's really about there's this
world out there
there's lots of stuff you could get that
stuff and use it in a project and why
might you want to do that and what kinds
of results can you get with that and and
really I want to focus on how to do that
so what I have here is a kind of like
quick demonstration I would love to just
sit here and show you like 100 amazing
and interesting projects made with data
on the web but I'm just going to show
you one which is a particular I think
relates to kind of what the kinds of
things I'm hoping to demonstrate in
these videos is this project called the
wind map it's by Fernanda Viegas and
Martin Wattenberg and you can see here
there is a map of the United States
there are these white streaks flowing
across the map and you could imagine
there's some data underlying data
latitudes and longitudes wind speeds
wind direction and somehow that data is
being read and then a data is being
interpreted and manifested through
drawing so thicker white lines for
higher wind speed lines in a particular
direction for a particular wind
direction and so how what are the
building blocks of a project like this
what are all the pieces how do you read
the data how do you cycle through the
data how do you draw with the data and
what if the data comes from this thing
called an API which requires you to like
a login have like a secret key and all
this horribly scary strange stuff I
would like to make this seem like a very
easy and welcoming friendly thing for
you to be able to do that's my goal here
so in this first video what I want to do
is make a list of the kinds of ways you
might find data and I've got a few like
examples over here but I think just to
get away from the computer for a second
I'm going to move over here hello
again so let's think about this this
question so first of all I got to go
back to the computer again let's say
you're interested in in a particular
kind of thing like you like flowers
flowers that's like your thing oh boy I
really should have plan for the suit
advance but let's say flowers is your
thing so you might Google flowers and
then you're going to get this
uh you're gonna get all this commercial
stuff trying to sell you flowers I
really just want to know how to grow
flowers I'm really off topic I don't
care how to grow beautiful flowers okay
whatever
so you know I could go here and be like
oh look here's this website about flower
gardens and I want to get some data
about flowers I'm not really good but
I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna I could be
I could be a much better Googler and I
could say flower data base Dana not to
forget Danish flower data data so now
flower data sets now I'm getting some
the point of what I'm doing is is
actually not is to like not it's
just to like be sort of random here this
is will happen to you you have an
interest in a data piece of kind of
dating or googling around you're finding
things what are you going to find so
first of all I think there's two
approaches to a project one is you
actually have an interest in you're
looking for a particular kind of data
but right now you might say to yourself
I'll do that later I'm just going to use
some existing examples of data sets that
are out there that you be I thought that
I I'm going to show you how to do but
but but but there is a reason for
talking about this so you're going to
come across and you're going to see a
lot of things so first of all the data
could come in a variety of formats
here's a list of some formats that you
might see CSV what is that XML what is
that JSON what is that you know you
might just find a text file you might
just find a PDF or you might actually
not find in these formats but you see
the data right there on the webpage I
mean that data is there how do you get
access to that if it's not in one of
these quote-unquote formats and then
there's this sort of like side
discussion of like what if you see this
word API so what you're looking for when
working with data is you want to find
somebody on the internet who says I have
this data it's about flowers and I would
like you to have it please enjoy it and
I've prepared it for you with examples
and documentation to make it easy for
you and a particular keyword in the
context of what we're looking for is you
might be looking for data of the format
JSON the reason why you might be looking
for
is JSON stands for JavaScript object
notation hmm that might be convenient
right because we you I have spent many a
many a day making videos about
JavaScript object notation because I
could say here's a flower and it's name
is sunflower and it's color is like I
don't I don't want to use though it's
fine whatever you get the idea I could
put like a variable firts color I could
have a very bitter this is I went off I
when I was thinking about flowers I lost
my train of thought but um so this is
JavaScript object notation it's how you
write objects into your code it turns
out that this data format is exactly the
same as this now there's a little bit of
nuance there are some slight differences
in kind of but if you find data that's
been prepared it's like somebody said
are you programming in JavaScript
would you like data made for you to use
here it is so this is an ideal scenario
you're happy if you find data in this
javascript object notation so and on the
next video it makes essentially all
about what that is and the actual syntax
now another format of data that you
might find very intuitive and familiar
to work with is this format known as CSV
now CSV can take is a particular kind of
a larger format which I really mean
tabular data so what does it mean for
data to be in a table you know you have
you know name age gender Dan 42 min okay
now I just that's how old I am
let's just get that out there on the
Internet I'm youthful at heart though
and then there's some other data there I
can put my phone number that I could say
my phone number and like make this video
even more embarrassing but um so you're
familiar with this probably like here is
what's the wrong thing I was going to
open like Google Docs those are deaths
tabular data and in fact you can have a
Google spreadsheet and access that
Google spreadsheet in your JavaScript
program and in fact you could tie that
to a Google Form so this is a topic that
I want to explore the reason why I'm
mentioning CSV as a particular
format is that what a kind of raw format
for tabular data is to have the all of
the cells separated by commas so you can
see an example of this here is a table a
comma separated values the first row
being the header XY diameter name the
next row being some values the next row
being some values and in fact this is p
FP v sketch that kind of loads that and
using the data puts the things on the
screen so at some point I'll demonstrate
that in more detail in a particular
video dedicated just CSV there's lots of
CSV data out there here's one that I
think is worth kind of interesting to
look at actually let me write here this
is a citibike data city bike is a bike
sharing bike sharing system in New York
City and they have all of the trip data
so the date allows you to lunch you the
address were was picked up the time is a
huge data set how would you load that
data set read through that data set
maybe draw you know lines of people
riding their bikes all over the map of
New York City so this is the kind of
thing that I want to explore in these
sets of videos so that's really when I
that's really what I've got here with
CSV data and JSON data now XML is
another standardized format for data
these three up here are really like
standardized format what I mean by
standardized format is you the human
being want to look at data in a nice
presented way like like if you're
interested in movies I don't know why
I'm plugging some IMDB here but um you
could go to this website and look oh
look at all this data here and I can see
it and I can soak it in and I can find
the movie that I'm interested in yay but
this is not useful for a computer to
read it's it's really this is designed
visually for you to look at with your
eyes and you can make the same argument
that this Google Doc has actually done
that as well like column headings and
colors and like lines of grids all that
sort of stuff but the point of these
data formats if I come back over here is
that these are all designed for
computers to read
there's commas separating everything
there's this programming syntax that has
kind of got curly brackets and
semicolons and quotes and commas so
the standardized format so that's sort
of if you can find a standardized format
that's a good thing
p5 has a particular set of functions the
light read JSON data very easily read
CSV data very easily read XML data and
let slightly trickier way but it works
but you might also be in a scenario at
some point where you just found the data
not in a format that's meant for a
computer to read like there's just a
text file a lot of stuff in it or
there's just a web page and it's all
there but it's like a mess and there's
not in a standard format or some PDF
document so some point I would like to
make a one video to sort of talk about
how you might deal with some scenarios
like that if you find a particular piece
of data online but it's not sort of
handed to you in this nice friendly JSON
way and then of course there's this
question of API now if you find if you
have a fixed data set just sort of like
this is the data it might come as a file
but if there's a huge data set or a data
set that's changing over time like
Twitter is the data set that's changing
over time because people are posting to
it continuously you know all the
articles that appeared in The New York
Times in 1950 that's not really changing
time I don't think it was a good to time
travel but anyway you could download
that and have that so an API is stands
for application programming interface
meaning you're writing an application
somebody else has an application that
other person says like oh I would love
for your application to talk to mine so
I'm going to make an interface for those
two things to talk to each other and
that interface might be sending data in
one of these formats back and forth so
the tricky thing is if just use the New
York Times as an example do New York
Times has an API it's very nice of them
they're like hey you know what we have
this newspaper and all this stuff and
why don't you read it like like a human
being or why doesn't your computer
program read it and we'll make it easier
by giving it to an API but you've got to
log in get an account get a secret key
figure out how to query the API how do
you say I want the articles from this
year or from that have this certain
keyword in them and so that's the kind
of thing we're going to do and just to
like run through a few examples of that
like for example here if I'm interested
in flowers this is me query
the New York Times article search I
didn't try these examples to see if they
work
let me try a different one oh let's try
this one I'm in a search for word
computer this is very sad
my internet the hello it's work I'm
making a video
I'll go look at why the your times will
didn't work but one of the API is that
I'm going to spend some time showing you
is an API called word neck when we move
this over here where you can see here
I've put in the word Apple and I've
clicked this button called examples and
word Nick is giving me back a set of
example sentences that have the word
Apple in it this is Google image search
which I passed it the word Apple and I'm
getting some you know I like flowers
better let's go back to flower and you
can see I'm getting a whole bunch of
flower images so this API meaning
application programming interface Google
has a server I have a program those two
programs are talking to each other
because Google has this API built but
the point is I I can't just download all
of Google's data is like a big CSV I've
got a query that API so how does that
work
Instagram is another one flower oops
let's just turn that off to think Google
sheets we talked about okay so that's
kind of a basic I don't know how well
this way you should do anybody it's too
late now because you've already watched
this video if you're watching it now but
I'm going to get into the next video
that I make is only really going to be
about what is the JSON format how does
it work how do you make how do you pull
the data format of the JSON into your
project and do something with it so
that's what I'm going to do in a few
short minutes in the next video thanks
for watching and see you soon okay wait</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
