series about building your own API in
node and in this video what I want to do
is add a very important very key piece
of functionality which is persistence so
right now this particular API that I'm
building a node if you recall in the
code at the top of the code just has
hard-coded essentially a database a
database of words and their sentiment
score Rainbow five unicorn three do
negative three Glu negative two so that
they're eight but then I can add and I
can add to it so I can I can go to a
particular route and say add purple four
and then if I go back to all I'll see
that purple is there but as soon as I go
to terminal quit and relaunch the server
and go back purple is gone so I need
some mechanism by which I can save the
data forever whether or not I'm running
the server quitting the server not just
in memory and the way that this is done
is typically with a database now a
database is a big topic and I expect
that in the what I imagine future amount
of time that I have in my life to make
videos I'll get into a lot of different
facets of it so what do we have so far
is we have just like data in memory
that's what I have so far
quit the program the data is lost one
quick and dirty way to save data to have
data persist over time is simply to save
to a text file it's easy to forget that
you could just have a text file as a
database right I can have a text file
that has a list of words in it word
comma score word comma score and I could
just save all the stuff and load that
when I when I run the program a way to
make this even easier is to actually
save this to a JSON file JSON standing
for JavaScript object notation
so this data if you look at this this is
this is JavaScript object notation this
syntax of having a variable full of key
value pairs
that's JSON so I can actually nice
option is just save the data to a JSON
file and then load that JSON file every
time the server starts so this is
actually the way that I'm going to do it
in this particular tutorial but this is
very limiting first of all if I have a
massive amount of data huge data set
this isn't going to work very well have
to like load this like giant text file
and like save this giant text file all
the time that's not going to work very
well you know if I if I care about
security I have like private data just
having it all just sitting there in a
big text file like text file full of
everybody's like logins and passwords
that's not going to work very well so
there are a lot of reasons why this
isn't a particular for a quick and dirty
project for understanding how things
work playing around a node I think this
is going to be a great demonstration but
I will be making videos in the future
that look at other database systems
namely one called firebase firebase is
something that's referred to it's a
Google product database as service
meaning fire bait you don't have to have
your own server you're just a program
and you're like keeping track of stuff
and you're like hey firebase can you
save this for me class free later and
then later you come back and take
firebase could I have that data so you
get an account you signup you send a
data you ask for data and it has a lot
of sophisticated features so that's
certainly one thing you can do and then
of course you could use a quote unquote
a real database or some type of database
system there are other databases service
products by the way so you can find
those but you could use something like
CouchDB or MongoDB or another database
that I actually like which is very
simple which is called Ned B I think so
these are all database systems that you
can use with node or other server-side
programming frameworks so at some point
somebody remind me hey weren't but I'm
definitely I have a whole bunch of
examples already for firebase so I
intend to do that
but I'd love to look into this kind of
stuff and make some examples with that
as well but in this particular video
let's look at even just what saving a
JSON file gets us okay so back over here
I'm going to go back to the code and the
first thing I want to do is let's just
actually make that JSON file ourselves
so right here I'm going to in my node
project where my server code is I'm just
going to create a new file and I'm going
to call it a word
dot JSON and in that file instead of
instead of having this in the code I'm
just going to take this and I'm going to
comment this out and I'm going to put
this into words JSON so here is now a
JSON file with the initial data that I
want for my program to start with so now
what I want to do in the in in the
program is instead of having var words
equal the hard-coded data I want to just
load from the file I want to do
something like you know if I were in
like client-side p5 land I would just
say like lo JSON words JSON right I want
just a load whatsoever in that file and
stick into words but this is not node
code this is a p5 code so I need a
different set of syntax for that so how
do I do that in node well what I need to
use is the FS module so FS node node I'm
just going to Google FS and node which
and here I'm going to get the
documentation for the file system API
which is built in part of node it's not
an extra thing I have to install so this
is the document documentation for it
there's a lot a lot of functions what
I'm looking for is one called read file
and write here so you can see first of
all there's FS dot read file and FS read
file sync so why would I use one versus
the other this is something I definitely
want to talk about but let's just at
first and actually I'm going to start
with using read file sync so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to say VAR f s
equals require FS think that's right
this is like importing the file system
package it's built in part of node in
order to install it but I do have to
reference it in an import or require
statement and then I want to say words
equals FS read file sync words JSON and
let's just see and then I'm going to say
console dot log words let's see what's
happening here ah ok so it runs it look
I read the file there's the file perfect
there's my contents what is that so one
thing you have to realize is the node
file system package is just reading the
raw data files and writing the raw data
out it doesn't know oh I want this to be
like JSON and all that
so if I have that raw data from the file
but I actually want it to be JavaScript
and JavaScript object I need to parse it
and there's a quick and easy way of
doing that so actually what I want to do
is I'm going to say I'm just going to
save our data equals that and then I'm
going to save our words equals
json.parse data so this is something
you're going to see once I'm using a
local files when I want to read a file I
need to interpret it as JSON when I have
a Java Script I need to interpret it as
a JavaScript object before I can use it
when I have a JavaScript object and I
want to save it to the file I need to
convert it to just plain old text and
then save it to the file so let's look
how that works now and you can see there
we go so now my server is reading that
stuff so we've got step one in that
everything should work as it did before
all and I could add something but I'm
still going to have the problem as soon
as I quit the server and relaunch it
anything that I've added will be gone so
how do I now have persistence where in
my code do I want to save data to the
file itself well I want to do that
anytime I add something new to this list
and if I go back to the server program
the only time I add something new to the
list is right here under AdWords ad word
so this is where I want to save data now
this brings me to another important
point which I glossed over which I will
come over here to discuss for a second
sync versus no sync so there are both
read file sync that's a function as part
of the node filesystem package and there
is also read file without the word sync
there's also write file sync and just
write file what's the difference the
difference is this is synchronous also
known as like a blocking line of code
meaning if I come back here if I'm using
the sync function the next line of code
will not execute until that action has
been finished and in this case that's
what I want when the server starts up I
don't want to do anything actually until
the data has been read so
want to use the synchronous version so I
load the data and it makes I don't have
to have a callback and it makes writing
the code a little bit simpler however if
I'm going to perform an action where I'm
reading and writing to files while a
user is making an API request I don't
want to use the sync method because that
will actually lock up the server while
it's waiting to do this operation I want
to use the nonstic asynchronous version
so a callback will happen in the server
can still listen for other connections
and that type of thing so this is now a
moment where right here under ad word I
want to write the data to back to the
file but not but asynchronously so let
me show you how that works so first of
all this is a little error handling that
we built in last time so I don't want to
write the data if the score wasn't given
so I want to write the data right here
so I can say now write file words Oh
let's let's look at the documentation
let's look for write file write file so
it looks like write file I need to give
it the file name and the data and
there's some other options and that sort
of thing so but I'm going to do it
simply I need to say write two words
JSON and now cut the data which is words
and then a callback finished I'll call
it and then I could say function
finished you know maybe it gets an error
or something I don't actually know I
should look this up just a console log
all set so let's look at this now and
see what happens now now first of all
I've made up a big I made a big mistake
already but let's just see what happens
anyway even with my mistake probably
going to get an error or something like
that so the server has restarted it's
listening and waiting let's go to the
add route and I'm going to say I want to
add the word purple and the score three
now right file is not defined okay oops
silly me I actually just made a mistake
in my code where I need to say FS I need
to refer to that file system module that
package
right file that's not the error I was
expecting the server should restart okay
it has hit refresh hmm thank you for
your word but let's look at a crashed
unexpected token blah blah blah object
object it couldn't figure out how to
write that to a file right because once
again just as if I'm reading data from a
file I'm getting the raw bytes I need to
parse it as a JavaScript object before I
can use it now what I need to do is I
need to turn it into text-based data
before I write it to the file and the
way to do that I can say just bar data
equals JSON dot the opposite of parse or
the inverse is stringify so I can say
stringify words and then write that data
to the file so now that I've done that
now one thing I want to do actually is I
want to stop using node money because
node bond restarts the server every time
oops I have oops what's going on here
error undefined one unexpected token
JSON oh you know what I messed up the
file so this is what I wrote to the file
because when I made my mistake so that's
why it's not working um so the reason
why I don't want to use no daman right
now is because every time I rewrite that
file it thinks like Oh something change
is going to restart the server which
will mess things up so right now I just
want to manually stop and start the
server myself to make sure things are
good so okay so now the server starts it
reads the data from the file then what
I'm going to do here is I'm going to now
go to this route again and I'm going to
hit enter thank you for your word I'm
going to go back and I'm gonna look and
look it's there but I lost the
formatting like my JSON file is all just
one long thing so one thing that that's
I mean this is sort of like a small
point and sometimes it could matter in
various scenarios but since we're
talking about it I might as well talk
about it this string of five function
takes the JavaScript object and kind of
makes it a string with as few characters
as possible so no white space to make it
kind of human readable but I can use
some other arguments and I can add like
a
got why you put no there to look at the
documentation for stringify but -
meaning that I want to use two spaces
for an indent so if I if I do this and I
restart the server and by the way purple
is already there so purple is now there
forever and I can go to pink and add the
number six thank you for your word and
if I go back and I look at that we can
see there we go so every time I go to
that route it rewrites the entire file
with the current list of words every
time I quit the server and start the
server back up it reads the list of
words so this is the full round-trip you
know there's lots of inefficiencies or
issues again with scalability and
privacy but this works for a simple
project where you just want to save a
high score list or a table of words in
there sentiment score you can do
something like this I'm sure you can
imagine some other scenarios where just
this basic idea is plenty good enough
let me say another few things about this
though before I move to the end of this
video one is that I've kind of made a
little bit of a mistake here which is
that even if something goes wrong here I
still send the reply like thank you for
your word so really probably I should
wait to send a reply to the client who
added this word until that file has
finished being written so I would say it
probably makes sense too to put that in
here and I'm going to send the reply
actually and and because I had this
error checking I have to send the reply
up here I could think about if there's a
better way but I'm going to have if
there's no score I send back a message
scores required and if it gets the data
if it gets the word adds it writes the
file and all that is successful then I'm
going to say and you know what I think
is useful in an API is for a word -
actually for an API to just send you
back the data that you've sent it and
then I could say something like status a
success so in other words sometimes when
you're making an API request or you're
adding something you're sending some
data to an API and you're doing that
like many many times
as a client when you get a reply back
you need to match it with which one you
sent so if you get some information back
that you can match that can often be
helpful so even though this is redundant
and I don't personally need this
information I think it's useful to add
so and I did sort of a very awkward
thing where my variables all have the
same name but this will this will
actually should work so let's restart
the server one time we can see I've got
all the words that I added before and
now if I go back and I say add flower
seven and I hit enter success the word
flower was added and if I go to all we
can see flowers in there pink is in
there purple is in there and I can even
restart the server I restart the server
and there it all is again so this is the
full round-trip of how to receive from a
get request through a route data from
user save that data to a file and have
the server always keep track of that
data so I'm still got more to do in
terms of building this API which is
actually like get some text and produce
a sentiment score I need to look at well
how would I build like a client a
front-end that would actually like
interface and interact with the API but
this at least now we've seen a little
bit about saving data thanks for
watching
