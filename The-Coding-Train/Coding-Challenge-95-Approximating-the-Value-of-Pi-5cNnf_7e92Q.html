happy pi day I have to admit this is
take number two I kind of messed up the
first time I am going to do a coding
challenge where I am going to
approximate the value of pi now what's
running here right now is the actual
number pi I mean someone should fact
check that this is correct
compare it to pi day org slash million
which I think has the first million
digits of pi but this is a processing
sketch using a particular algorithm to
calculate all the digits of pi one at a
time it will go on forever it will get
very very very slow pretty quickly I
will come back to this in a future video
but what I'm gonna do in this video is
font is look at a way to approximate the
value of pi now this came in as a
suggestion from originally from a Kraus
fifty-three on github for how to look at
random particles that end up in a circle
or outside of a circle interesting
that's something to do with the area of
the circle so I'm gonna diagram this out
I should also mention thank you to the
stem coding YouTube channel and a stem
coding project which has a ton of videos
in various topics using programming and
coding to teach different types of STEM
related topics it's wonderful they have
a video you can find a link to it in
this in this video's description
basically doing exactly the same thing
that I'm about to try to do probably
better but you know I'm gonna do my best
would give it my all and I'm gonna do
this in processing which is a Java based
programming environment if you're not
familiar with it I'm sure I'll link to
some video where I talk about what
processing is okay we're gonna let this
run and I'm gonna come over here to talk
about a method that I'm going to use to
approximate the digits of pi now there
is something in our world known as a
circle it is a beautiful round shape it
is a shape that I'm not going to be able
to draw but I'm going to attempt to I'm
gonna move over here just give myself
more room here is a circle now if you
were to look up formula for
circumference of a circle or you would
find that it's equal to some
called two PI R this is the formula for
the circumference of a circle now what
are these things well two is the number
2 R refers to the radius center to the
edge R this is the same length anywhere
from the center of circle to any edge
point and pi well this is this sort of
magic number 3.1415926
that's all I can remember might not even
gotten to in the six right good we're
gonna approximate it we're gonna see if
we can get better than my memory tells
me so how can I use this fact to
calculate the number pi well one thing I
could do is I could get a piece of
string and I could wrap it around here
in my perfect circle that I could undo
the string I could get a tape measure I
could measure it and then whatever that
is if I knew the value of R I could
solve for the value of pi that would
work I should mention by the way just
because I know someone's gonna say
something in the comments and it's not
today today is not towel day I'll come
back and do this with tau but tau is a
number the Greek letter tau or tau PI
being spelled with English letters or
Roman letters P I is essentially well pi
is half our tau is two pi I don't know I
don't want to get into which one is
which but this is often used because
then we could say the circumference is
just tau R but there anyway this opens
up a big can of worms that I don't want
to go down so I'm not gonna do this
string method let's look at another two
formulas from geometry so so one thing
is what's the formula for the area of
this circle well hasn't it looks quite
similar and there's a special
relationship there that's a topic for
another time but PI R squared so PI R
squared is the area of this circle now
let's think of saying what if I put a
square as a bounding box of that circle
a perfect square and I can draw that
over here with this idea of our being
here so the sides of this square are
twice the length of our the area of the
square is the width of a rectangle the
width
height a square just being the side
squared so the area so this is the area
of the circle the area of the square is
six four four two times two is four R
squared so look at that four R squared
PI R squared now imagine something
there's a relationship here right
there's a relationship between the area
of a let's say the area of the circle to
the area of the square that relationship
can be expressed as a ratio I could say
the area of the circle PI R squared
- the area of the square for R squared
the ars cancel out the ratio is pi
divided by 4 or I could say that pi
equals 4 times that ratio in a way but
what do I mean by this exactly what I
mean
well I play here why are we even here
how am I going to use this to
approximate so in the in the original
github post it said well simulate it
with physics so we could imagine one
physic scenario is throwing darts what
if I were to just throw random darts on
the wall at the wall well there would go
all over the place some darts would land
within the square but not in the circle
and some darts would land within the
circle but not within the square so in a
way I can kind of imagine the ratio of
the area of the circle to the area of
the square as the number of darts that
land within the circle divided by the
number of darts that have landed in the
square now three have landed in the
circle and four have landed in the
square so I could say pi in this case pi
is approximately four times the circle
count divided by the square count which
is equal to 3 divided by 4 4 times 3
divided by 4 is what 3 so there is my
approximation of pi 3.0
so that's right I mean it's not very
good but only through four darts the
more darts that I throw if I did this
infinitely and fill the entire space I
would get closer and closer and closer
to a better approximation of the number
pi so this is what I'm going to
implement in code now I really really
want to just use for my dart throwing
the numbers from this million random
digits book I'm tempted to use the
random.org API which gives but I think
I'll probably just use the processing
random function which is a pseudo-random
number generator that's another topic
but that I will come back to okay so
let's go over the code actually before I
go to the code I wrote this in such a
weird way what I mean is four times the
circle count over the square count this
equal sign was sort of a problem there
I'm replacing the circle count with
three the square count with four so it's
four times three over four and that's
how I get three apologies for that
alright so I'm back in the code look at
this we're still getting digits of pi
here but slowly over time unfortunate
I'm gonna stop this program and I'll be
running again later and I'm gonna go to
a blank sketch whoops I'm just gonna
close this and I'm gonna go to a blank
sketch okay so what are the first things
that I need to do let's create a window
that's 400 by 400
let's give it a background of zero yeah
zero that's fine stroke 255 then let's
call the ellipse function at and let's I
think life our life might be easier if I
just do translate to the center to put
the zero zero at the center yeah why not
and so the ellipse is going to be at 0 0
with a radius a radius of 200 the
ellipse function expects a diameter so
the radius is 200 the diameter is 400
and then we're gonna do we're gonna say
I'm gonna say no fill and I'm going to
say rectangle also 0 0 400 400 and let's
say stroke weight 4 whoa
Oh Rex mode and I wanna say rect mode
Center okay and let's make the size
actually a little bit bigger so I can
sort of see the outline what I want to
do now is I want to start throwing the
darts so I'm gonna use the Processing's
random number function which is random
and I'm gonna say right here I'm gonna
do this at the end let's do this is the
end of draw draw is a loop that happens
over and over again if you haven't used
processing before and this is the java
programming language with a extra set of
functionality for drawing x equals
random I'm just saying and let's let's
actually let's make a variable a global
variable called R which is equal to 200
so I'm gonna say R times 2r times 2r
times 2r times 2 I'm gonna make a random
number between negative R and R and a Y
which is a random number between
negative R and R then I'm going to draw
a point at that X Y so let's do our dart
throwing okay look at that so one thing
is I'm getting something starry
flickering thing so I really want to
just draw this in setup as kind of the
initial background and then I don't want
to redraw the background again but I
think I probably will need the translate
in both places there we go
so now you can see I am filling the
space with dots so now what I need to
figure out as I need to count the dots
that are well I know the total dot and
actually all of the dots I don't have to
test if dots are within the square
because I've set this up in such a way
that it basically can only create dots
that are within the square so what I
need to do is determine how many dots
are within the circle so let me do this
I'm gonna say if R if so first I need to
get the distance what is the distance
between 0 0 and X Y so this is how far
from the center is that point to be
honest i i weirdly in all every case of
life
I would use the distance function but
for some reason right now I feel like
it's worth noting that pi is not being
used here that the distance function is
actually using the Pythagorean theorem
because if I know the X offset from the
center and the y offset from the center
then this hypotenuse of this right
triangle x squared plus y squared equals
H squared eighth best Pythagorean
theorem H is the square root of x
squared plus y squared so I I kind of
want just for the some weird arbitrary
sense of purity to say square root of x
times X plus y times y and if that
distance is less than less than or
equals or just less than let's say less
than mm this is just an approximation
anyway less than R I'm going to say
stroke stroke let's make it a greenish
color okay here we go otherwise stroke
255 here we go oops and I need another
curly bracket here we go so we can see
now and let's let's make it a I don't
know I'm gonna pick some arbitrary
colors that are gonna not look very nice
I'm gonna do my best and here we go so
we have two different colors we have
this kind of green I pick colors that
are quite similar so okay right I could
by the way I could do this without
randomness I could just check all of the
pixels but I like I like the random
method and let me let me make these
colors quite a bit more different there
we go so we can see I've got some blue
ones and you can see if they're on the
line you know depending on where they
are because I have a stroke width of two
they're either blue or green so that
could use some finesse in the chat the
live chat that's going on I see
someone's asking what is float float is
the datatype so unlike in JavaScript
which a lot of my other tutorials in I
would just say let X or var X or context
depending on how I feel London even
getting a float is a floating point
decimal number
okay hmm now so now we need to do is we
need to count so what I'm gonna do is
I'm going to say I'm gonna say I'm gonna
say int I'm gonna using an integer total
equals zero an int circle equals zero so
this is going to be total it's going to
mean the total number of dots circle is
going to be the number of dots that are
in the circle and what I'm going to do
is I am going to say now I'm going to
look back at my formula write pi equals
four times the total number of circle
divided by the total number of total so
pi and I'm going to say P ie just not to
be confused with the actual there is a
constant called pi that's available in
processing I guess I could do lowercase
PI processing wouldn't but I'll just say
pi because pi is delicious pi equal
Minnie that's really like kind of beep
upset people float pi equals four times
circle divided by total and let's put
those in parentheses just for fun now
here's the thing there's a couple of
problems with this number one total I
don't want total to be zero it will
never be zero because I'm going to
immediately say total plus plus like as
soon as I pick a point I'm increasing so
at least the first time it runs through
this total will be one and then of
course if it's within the radius circle
is plus plus and so let me say print
line pi so let's just look it let's run
this and see what we get
I keep getting a zero why do I get zero
I don't get anything so this has to do
with integer arithmetic so integer math
these are both integers circle and total
so even if I say 10 divided by 20 that's
0 remainder remainder 10 or 20 divided
by 19 divided by 20 is 0 remainder 19 so
it's always going to give me the 0 so I
need to explicitly convert one of these
to a float I think I might change this
to double to for more precision but this
should now give me
you can see here I am slowly and slowly
getting closer and closer perhaps to the
value of pi' let's let this run for a
little bit okay I'm back I've let this
run for just a couple minutes you can
see that I'm not really I had some kind
of getting something that looks kind of
like PI I'm a little bit higher than PI
I start to ask myself the question
what's going wrong here well my one
guess that I have is that I haven't been
so exactly thoughtful about my distance
check that maybe that like sort of
border of what's on the line versus not
on the line is something that I need to
think about more deeply the resolution
is this kind of an issue there but the
other issue might be just the way that
floating point math works in the java
programming language I might need a
different data structure data type that
allows me for sort more precision so
hold on I'll be right back I'm gonna
make some adjustments in the code well
one issue is so look at this nice
drawing first of all one issue is
certainly that I'm spending all this
time drawing just to get like one point
at a time 30 frames or 60 frames per
second so one thing I can absolutely do
is there's no reason why I couldn't just
put a little for loop in here and say
hey let's do a hundred points per frame
and what I'm going to do I don't want
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna say let's
make a PI a variable outside of that
loop just so when the loop finishes I
can take a look at what the value of pi
is so now I could do a hundred points at
a time and you can see how much faster
this is sort of filling up the drawing
and we can now go look and see what have
I got here yeah so I think I think we
just have a lot of randomness here and
now I'm getting 3.14 when it's you know
we're converging it as best we can so I
think we've done a pretty good job at
approximating pi think maybe I could
actually be done a couple things that
people noted one is I could actually get
rid of the square root from this program
and just look at
r-squared that could be my comparison
that's gonna square root is very slow
expensive calculation I could fix some
white space here another thing that I
could do is let's just try this with
like ten thousand and see what we get
pretty good per day but a pretty pie all
right thank you everybody
this is me oh no no no no let's let's go
a little step further let's use doubles
let's see if using double actually does
anything so what is a double so
processing natively actually doesn't
really support the double data type any
number that you have in a variable is
stored in memory and so floating-point
numbers there's an infinite amount of
decimal numbers between any two integers
but we don't have an infinite amount of
memory on our computer so we allow
locate a certain number of bits so
floating points allocate a certain
number of bits doubles allocate more so
if we really need to do precise
mathematics and then there's other Java
classes and implications for really big
numbers but let's at least change this
to double let's change this to double
and I'm gonna I'm gonna have to use
casting because double is not and I'm
gonna change this just going to change
this to double as well I'm gonna be
really I'm gonna overdo it I don't need
to I think I need to change all of these
but now I should see that this and by
the way I don't need to calculate it I
don't know why I did that I can just
calculate it once there and I wrote
float and let's make this double okay so
now let's take a look at this and one
thing we can see is already there are
more digits appearing in the print line
statement and maybe maybe I think
there's just so much randomness that's
part of this that ultimately ultimately
I'm not so sure that we're gonna get
much anything that's really that
accurate out of this method
but this is nice to see we've
consistently got 1.41 now which is right
if only we could get a five here one
point four one five let's see we get a
five here come on get a five I saw five
five consistently so maybe over time as
we do this over and over again
now one thing might be it maybe we could
make who we make this drawing any
prettier I mean one thing that I might
choose to do is make a stroke wait
that's actually more like it's actually
at like that's more like 0.1 so a very
light stroke maybe you can't see that it
also makes a stroke weight of one but
maybe give some alpha so some
transparency there we go this I don't
know that's kind of interesting looks
kind of like I'm looking under a
microscope I'm gonna let this run for a
while and I'll just be back in a couple
minutes to check where it got to I
actually I'm back because I got a good
comment from the chat which is that I
could choose to try to make this test a
bit more precise so I could make this a
double I could cast the X as a double
and again I'm gonna just overdo it and
cast everything so let let's take a look
at let's let's cast all of those as
doubles and let's run this one more time
we can see it filling up here and it
seems to be running at a perfectly
reasonable frame rate so I'm actually
gonna try to do this ten thousand times
per frame well now it's a little bit
slow so I cut my animation to be fast oh
that was that was a hundred thousand
let's just go with ten thousand okay so
let's take a look okay I'll be back in a
minute let's see how many digits we can
kind of get and see how close we're
doing and back again so you can see this
kind of algorithm it's not gonna
converge very quickly there's a lot of
noise in it from the randomness but one
thing I could do to add to this program
is try to keep track of which one is the
best so there is in Java natively let's
let me take out this print line for a
second and what I'm going to do so I'm
going to say print line so processing
natively has the constant pi but Java
also has the constant pi that is in the
math package so let me look at both of
those and you can see that that one is a
double so this is the actus is actually
what's stored is type at many digits in
math dot Pi in Java so what I'm going to
do is I am going to create I'm gonna
create a variable called record pi and I
am going to set record PI equal to 0
just as its initial value I don't need
to set it down there I'm sorry I can
just set it up here then what I'm going
to do is I'm going to look at double the
difference between math dot pi minus
record PI and let's take the absolute
value of that and I also need to oh can
I guess I have to do math dot absolute
for because I have doubles so I'm gonna
take the difference between matha pi in
the record pi then so this is actually
really the record difference then I'm
going to look at the difference between
the PI I just calculated my math dot pi
minus the PI I just calculated so if if
the difference is less than the record
difference if we've gotten one that's
closer then the difference is now the
record difference is now the difference
and the record PI why did I use an
underscore did I use an underscore
that's sort of unnecessary record pi
equals zero and then record PI then
record PI is that new PI and what I
could do is whenever I have a new record
I could print out record pi so let's
take a look and see what I get in the
console there and in a way I kind of
want to do that every time because I
feel like I should give it a chance and
this is not a big calculation to do I
might as well do this every single time
even though I'm only drawing every so
often so let's put all this inside of
this loop and let's run it and we can
see the this is now currently the record
one point four one five nine two six hey
I know I don't know like how many digits
have I gotten correct alright so let's
go look at the actual digits of pi so
I'm gonna go to pi day org slash million
and I don't need that many of them this
is going to be plenty just the first
line here
let's open up TextEdit let's put this in
here and let's make this a little bit
bigger let's go back to the processing
sketch oops let's bring this down here
how many did you show I have and let's
take a look and compare
so so far we have gotten one is correct
4 is correct one is correct five is
correct nine is correct two is correct
six is correct five is correct my font
size is not the same ah have I gotten as
close as I can get no no this is wrong
6 is correct 5 is correct 3 is correct
ah okay so I'm just gonna give myself a
couple minutes to take a short break and
I'll come back and see if anything got a
little closer all right thanks for
watching this coding challenge there are
so many ways this could be improved you
could sort of plot the difference you
could visualize these numbers and kind
of like highlight which digits are
correct which are incorrect there's so
many you could think about how you're
drawing this you could get your you
could make the random numbers double
that you're picking I don't know if that
would really help you could use my
favorite website random or which has an
API for random numbers really not gonna
make your program run faster but there
is so much that you could try to do so
if you make something with this coding
challenge please share it with me in the
comments below you can also go to the
coding train com website there's a place
where you could link to your shared
version I will also release a JavaScript
version of this that you can run in the
browser and maybe actually that's a
might be an easier way to also display
the results so thanks for watching I
hope you enjoyed this pi day coding
