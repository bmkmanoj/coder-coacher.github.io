I'm fresh like to losing steam but I'm
gonna make this video somehow take a
break and if you're watching these in
sequence I'm finally gonna get to this
discussion that I've been
procrastinating installing because I'm
afraid of it but I want to talk about
CSS cascading style sheets the style
function in p5 what's the difference
between those two things but that's the
next video right now I want to look at
some more events that that that you can
handle in javascript in the browser page
in p5 besides just mouse press so what's
the context of this discussion VAR
button equals create button button dot
Mouse pressed and the callback the name
of the callback goes here so this is the
only event that we've looked at you have
this button you click on the button and
this code whatever the code inside this
function you know function do it and if
I reference do it here Dwight I don't
know what that means if I reference the
name of the function here this code is
executed when you click what are some
other events that are part of the
browser that p5 handles for you again
now one thing I should mention is you
don't need p5 to do any of this this is
not an invention of p5 I'm using p5 as a
as a as a library that gives you a set
of functionality to access a lot of
what's available in native JavaScript in
many other JavaScript frameworks in you
know jQuery being probably the most well
known and famous one of these frameworks
that has incredibly sophisticated a huge
library with tons of event functionality
that you can handle but I'm using the p5
library as an entry point to this much
larger topic of javascript in the
browser and later in some video try to
peel back those layers and compare and
contrast with other types of ways of
doing the same thing breathe so but what
are the events that I want to show you
in this video so here are some other
ones mouse over
mouse out changed input so with any of
these for other events the process is
exactly the same if I want to know when
you mouse over the button
I say mouse over and another function to
handle that mouse over now the thing
about the button which in some ways it
was a great example because it's so sort
of obvious what you want to do with the
button click on it but all of these
events are available for any kind of Dom
element that you might create you can
click on a paragraph you can click on a
h1 element you can click on the canvas
you can mouse over a canvas you can
determine when a slider has changed its
value so let's let me return back to the
code and see what happens if I attach
some of these other events to other Dom
elements and ultimately what is it you
probably want to do you want to like
when you mouse over an element you want
to highlight it by changing its style Oh
wouldn't it be nice if I there was a
video about CSS and style I guess maybe
I'm not doing these in the best order
but you can watch them in whatever order
you want that's just kind of the magic
here so let's look at the end I'll come
back to these events in the CSS video so
let's come over here and let's look at
what what types of elements are on the
page so right now there's this paragraph
element there's a button there's a
slider there's a text field so let's
look at a few different kinds of events
I'm going to handle first let's look at
the paragraph so what if I were to say
name P dot mouse over and what should I
do to that paragraph I'm going to just
call a function like over peripera
oh boy I'm terrible with variable names
but now this means that when I mouse
over this Dom element I will by darkness
is upon me oh it's sunlight look the sun
is shining right on me this is Wow look
at this is kind of exciting well the
green screen stuff I have this window
open it's sunlight I need sunlight we
all need something light you should stop
programming now and go skip some vitamin
D
uh sorry about the sort of weird
shadowing thing that's going on I kind
of I'm kind of enjoying I'm looking at
myself over here that's why I just keep
staring over here it's very vain of me
anyway what we have we had a video a
topic ah sorry
okay we're on my mouse over when I mouse
over this paragraph this over para
function should get executed so I need
to write a function called over I'm
probably standing in front of this right
now over para it's the terrible name for
a function so what might I do when I
execute that function is I might change
name Pete HTML your mouse is over me and
you know let's just go crazy here and
let's also do Mouse out out para and I
could write a function and let me zoom
out here so maybe you can see this
better out para named PhD ml your mouse
is out you're out and that like from
some you're in you're out it's like my
heidi klum of a sudden severe someone
watch this in the future the aliens will
be watching this video and will won't
get that cultural reference I'm not sure
I even do okay um okay so what's going
on here oh my god losing my mind okay so
let's let's try to get some code here in
the same window that you can see I'm
going to use some line breaks here I'm
going to bring this down here just so
you can I'm obsessed with getting things
laid out nicely so you can see here I'm
there's a Dom element with two events a
mouse over a mouse out over I changed
the name to some to change the text to
this out I change the text to this so
let's zoom in on the browser and if I
mouse that didn't work mouse over Mouse
out oh is that the right paragraph Nate
yeah it is what am I doing wrong
somebody helped me out here
named P your name wait type your name oh
you know why it's not working so this is
kind of an important thing it's good to
have these mistakes my hair is the
messed up this is a bit of a crazy video
but it's a if you're watching I thank
you but so it's good to have these
mistakes like what's going on here why
is that not working well you can
make events and those events can happen
but if there's something else in your
code that's also happening it can easily
override those events and I I made a
sort of classic error of forgetting
about this draw loop so what's in the
draw loop name P dot HTML that's
happening always always always always
always always always always always so it
doesn't matter if this momentary event
is executed instantly as draws looping
it will override that by changing the
text back to the text input so let me
comment this out and now I can run this
again and we can see my mouse over and
mouse out mouse over Mouse out mouse
over mouse out so this is how these are
just more events right there's the
button event mousepressed there's the
mouse over Mouse out event I could
actually attach a mouse click event for
when I click on the paragraph with a
little bit awkward because it's not
really like a clickable thing so that is
one nice that's another event that you
could look at for incidentally you know
I could attach that same event to the
canvas oops
ah right like any element out para and
then look at this I could say canvas dot
mousepressed change color so all of
those those same events right the thing
that happens when I mouse over the
paragraph also happens when I mouse over
the canvas the thing that happens when I
click on this button also happens now
when I click on the canvas but not when
I click over here and not when I click
in here so this is an interesting you
can see these functions can be attached
as events to multiple elements so
there's so many possibilities here now I
want to look at this is enough for you
to just mess around with now that you
have mousepressed mouse over and mouse
out but I also want to look at these
events which are a little bit strange
the changed event the input event so
let's think about this why do those
events exist and why do you the person
who is watching this video need those
events what I need now is some lunch a
fading fading fast
I'm going to make it for this video okay
um changed at input so let's let's think
about the slider let's think about the
text input box the input box I've drawn
what I just erased the slider how did we
use those elements before there was a
canvas and the canvas had things on it
and there was there is there was there
always has been there will be a draw
function and the draw function is
looping over and over forever and ever
and ever so if I use the sliders value
or the inputs value in draw
I'm always accessing that value
continuously so if it changed the stuff
and draw will use the changed value of
the slider but what if I want an action
to only happen when I move the slider
not when the slider is just sitting
there only when I move it what if I want
an action to happen when I only when I
move the slider and then release the
mouse or what if I want an action to
happen any time I type in here or any
time I not anytime I type it but when I
hit the enter key
that's what changed and input be those
two events do I just realized something
that I might be in my code using an
older version of the Dom library so this
input I might have to like pause for a
second but it's fine you have an edit
out edits it'll be fine
nothing bad will happen um erase what I
just said for a second out of your mind
and let's come back to this question
these are two events the lingo of these
events is a little bit strange and
possibly not the most intuitive but
there's two different events there's any
time it changes the value of this
changes ever so slightly or there's any
time I finish my action of changing the
value that's the difference between just
moving the slider all that continuously
versus moving the slider and releasing
the mouse finishing with this liner or
anytime I type versus hitting the enter
key so the
changed event is for finishing your
action the input event is for any change
to that the value of that Dunham's
element so let's come back here and take
a look at that so let on I've kind of
mixed and matched so many things here
but what I want to do here is comment
out the actually I can leave so I can
leave all of this sorry what I want to
do this is still working but what I want
to do now is when I type in my name and
I hit enter I want to see sorry it's
very hard for you see that when I type
in my name and when I hit enter I want
to see that content change so what is
the event for that input dot changed and
now I need a function to handle that you
know update update text so what I can do
here is I could say function update text
and say name P dot HTML input dot value
so now the text inside this paragraph
right this paragraph is named P so the
text inside this paragraph is changing
when I mouse over when I mouse over our
Mouse out and now it's also changing if
I hit the enter key right or tab
actually will trigger this event so
let's see if that works I'm going to
type my name Daniel nobody ever calls me
that but that is my name and hit enter
and you can see look at that magically
it updates now look at this those other
events are still triggering and I could
type you know my Fred Flinstone Flint
stone all right and you can see Fred
Flintstone so now this that's yet
another event that you can handle and
and the uh and so let's see okay so I
think the input this is a good lesson to
learn actually the mistakes should just
be in these videos and you know I'm
going to fix it all on the fly not even
going to edit it
it's gonna be fine I'm at 13 minutes
nobody's watching anymore uh you know I
should like say like a secret phrase you
could email me or tweet me that message
if you're still watching know what
that'd be Fred Flintstone
I don't know him nothing that I never
even wanted to watch televisions the
children my parents are not watching
this video I bet if I would gamble a lot
of money that they're not watching but
um anyway I don't know if I may be
better or worse or what but okay so
let's now try to change let's now use
instead of the changed event let's use
the input event input now I think I'm
going to get an error look at this
uncaught type error undefined is not a
function now it's on line 26 oh my
goodness first of all I created this
like crazy circular thing where I have
an variable named input and a function
named input that's actually okay I don't
really like it I kind of like it kind of
makes me want to change this to like
name input so at least I don't get
confused right name input and then I'm
going to change here name input
everywhere I put it so many places but
ah but but it's but there was a problem
ah here name input let's come back to
that problem undefined is not a function
we're still the problem the reason that
that doesn't exist is not because of any
other reason other than the input event
was something that was recently added to
the p5 Dom date the p5 Dom library and I
didn't when I made a p5 default project
out of this editor the updated version
of the library it wasn't ready so you
know what I could stop now and rerecord
this or fix it but and I'm going to kind
of dig into the guts of this in a sort
of a weird way but then the kind of at
15 minutes you can stop watching this
and just go and get the more recent
version of the library yourself but
let's look at how I might fix this so
number one is let's go to the p5.js or
website and I'm going to click on
download now what I want to I'm going to
download p5.js complete and I'm going to
look for that file and get the folder
and you can see if you download that
there's a lot of stuff in that folder
this is the most recent version of the
p5.js library this is a minified version
of the library which is kind of an
interesting thing you know a smaller
version of the code is condensed but
it's not as readable you might want to
use that for various reasons that's
another topic another time what I'm
looking for is this p5.js I want to get
this more recent version of the Dom
library so I'm going to hit command C
which I'm copying that file and I'm
going to go back to p5.js the project
and I'm going to do view show sketch
folder so that I can look at it in my
Finder window and now I'm in this
project other events there's a libraries
folder which has those files in it I
want to paste the new version of the
library in here and I want to replace it
yes I do and now I'm going to go back up
you know I kind of said now it's telling
me oh my goodness something horrible has
happened you made some changes to some
files I don't know what's going on
reload you'll lose any changes I
probably shouldn't have done that
change the file system while the editor
was open at the same time I might
complain to the editor and say you know
what I didn't change sketch j/s so you
shouldn't really be telling me this I
just changed a library file I don't even
have open and maybe that's a bug that we
can file that that's something that I
can remember to file or somebody
watching this video can file in the
p5.js editor repository click OK
so I'm kind of reloading that which is
fine and now I'm going to run it again
oh and I still got undefined is not a
function on line 26 ah yeah I think
that's right let's so let's let me be a
bit more methodical let me get the most
recent p5.js as well
and let me go back to the sketch folder
and in libraries and add that as well
looks I'm going to delete this one and
this is the new one we make sure that
wasn't the problem
what am I missing now okay oh boy this
video is it's a little failure I should
come back and just rerecord it later
it's like 18 minutes long maybe somebody
in the chat is like looking at me and
tell me what I'm last line has in a last
line has input value did I did I miss
something update text
okay let's yeah oh is that that's
definitely a problem is that the problem
no but that's not line 26 if I comment
this out name input is not defined I
spelled it wrong somewhere in line 51
it's working all right so you know what
this is I'm going to actually I won't
okay well I'm gonna kid I'm not stopping
this i'ma fix this fix this video I
could add cadena could get edited later
I'm going to look in the reference let's
see what happens and when actually what
I want to do is go under libraries and
p5 Dom I wonder if that wasn't actually
the most recent recent version it
doesn't make any sense though and look
for events input the input function is
called when any user input is detected
an element the input function is off
music keystrokes so this should be right
what did I I wonder if I do something
wrong let's look at this again name
input that's the element input update
text undefined is not a function let's
just see over para let's try that what's
undefined
so hold on let's actually look in the
Dom library so I'm now I'm going to look
in the library to see if this event is
in there October 6 yeah no so I don't
actually have I didn't actually get the
most recent recent reason why does that
why did I not get the most recent recent
version let's go to github p5 so now I'm
going to the actual github repository
for p5.js and I'm going to go under Lib
add-ons p5 Dom Jazz October 6 now that
seems like it's the most recent version
and let's look at the raw source here
fine add event listener change so how
come I was definitely using this the
other day I must be missing where the
most recent version is if I get some
sunlight it'll become clear to me oh
maybe somebody not pushed yet did I get
the right company yeah yes I could do
console people have so all these great
feed all these great pieces of feedback
I've just this has been a complete
failure this I don't know whether I will
upload this video although I think I
will but I guess I should you know
sometimes when you have this kind of
problem you should stop go take a walk
outside go talk to a friend I'm sure
that I will discover it those of you
watching this life on waiting with bated
breath
I'm sure it's about 12:40 p.m. Eastern
Time right now New York City time I'm
going to take a break and I'm going to
try to come back at around 1:30 1:45 or
2 and hopefully do a few more of these
videos I have appointments starting at
3:00 and I'll definitely come back post
another link to this live stream to my
Twitter account which is just at
Schiffman Shi F F ma n will be a
different link and
I will come back and answer this
question okay
Nicolette you get flex thank you guys
