starting a new little section of videos
about working with code and programming
and all that fun stuff in p5.js and the
topic here is conditional statements
conditional statements boolean
expressions true or false
if this than that if this than that
otherwise this how does a program make
decisions while it's running so in the
previous videos when we started working
with variables the topic was kind of ok
how do we store information and that
information changes over time now we
start to think about this new question
how can a program take different paths
right the only path we really have right
now is starting and setup that's the
first thing that happens
moving on to draw and looping over and
over again draw repeats over and over
again we saw that you have these event
functions like there was also the event
function mousepressed so if you click
the mouse the code would take a break
from draw go execute something down here
and continue in draw again but now I
want to ask the question how can the
code executes differently each time
through draw so one time through draw it
might draw a purple circle and the next
time through draw it might draw a pink
circle and in fact this I would like to
be the first example that I make in this
particular video I don't know if I if I
can get purple and pink just right but I
want to have a circle that's drawn with
two different colors based on something
that the user is doing perhaps where the
user is positioning the mouse would be a
good place to start so in order to do
this we need to learn about conditional
logic uh another sort of term we can
think of in this case is boolean
expression boolean logic from the
mathematician logician George Poulos
which I'm probably not getting right
internet will correct me I assume
dub-dub this over or put some sort of
like pop-up thing I don't know whatever
fancy thing that works here so boolean
boolean the word boolean indicates that
something is true or false this is often
also thought of as
one or zero zero being false one being
true and what what I'm going to show you
how to write is an expression that says
if something is true do this code if
something is not true don't do this code
so let's think about how the kinds of
things the kinds of boolean expressions
that might evaluate to true or false so
I'm going to give you a boolean
expression right now and in your mind
you will think about whether it's true
or false and hopefully this will be a
rather easy one five is greater than six
this is not true
this evaluates to false there's another
one a seven is less than 210 this is
true so you can see I'm starting by
creating these boolean expressions using
something called a relational operator a
relational operator it's an operator
that is going that in this case is going
to compare two numbers there's lots of
ways eventually in code that you'll see
that you can have something that's true
or false but a good way to start is just
comparing numbers are these numbers
equal is one number bigger than the
other one or is one number less than the
other one so now that we have this idea
of how we can create a boolean
expression a mathematical operation that
evaluates to either only two answers
true or false we can learn the syntax
for writing that statement into our code
and this is how the syntax works if
we've got it word in the English
language if that means exactly what it
says if some boolean expression that is
inside parentheses this is our boolean
expression if boolean expression open
curly braket close curly bracket so
we've created another block of code this
is a block of code with a beginning or
an end just like setup and draw our
blocks of code with beginning and ends
and the key thing here is if if this
boolean expression evaluates to true
then the code here should be executed if
this boolean expression evaluates to
false then the code here should not be
executed so let's say I write something
like if five is greater than six fill to
5500 so only ever if five is greater
than six should you set a red color now
if you're thinking about this piece of
code here you're realizing this is what
I would have created in this scenario is
kind of ridiculous and and useless in a
way like five no matter how much we try
over and over and over again five is
never going to be greater than six ever
I can't I mean maybe there'll be another
universe or a parallel universe or some
other kind of wormhole thing we go
through and five will be greater than
six but right now in this room where I
am on with these very hot lights that
make me feel a little faint for a second
um five is not greater than six so you
can see this is while this is the
correct syntax this is showing us the
idea here this doesn't really make any
sense the point of what I'm trying to
show you is that if a variable is part
of this boolean expression a variable
has different values different times of
the day in different moments depending
on what other things are happening in
the code then that variable might
sometimes be greater than six or might
sometimes not be greater than six and so
we can change this expression to say
something like if Mouse X is greater
than 100 so now as the user is moving
the mouse it's not greater than 100 -
not greater than hundred it is greater
than one and so this code even though
it's sitting there in the draw loop I
haven't put it there yet but that's
where it will live this code will not
necessarily be executed in fact you
could run the program if the mouse never
goes past 100 my code will never happen
it will just sit there never get
executed this is the power of a
conditional statement so let's go and
look and put this into our example and I
think that will actually wrap up this
video just sort of the very very basics
and there's more to it than this but uh
I'll get to that ok - ok
so here we are have a nice simple
example that I prepared in advance this
is B actually preparing to make one of
these videos in advance
I've got create canvas up here I'm
drawing a circle so
Oh Phil so what I would like to do now
is add something down here
if mouse X is greater than and let's say
300 which is the middle of the window
Phil I 255 0 let's try to give ourselves
some purplish color and we can see this
is what I've added here this is the
syntax so you can see whoops ah let's
move over here you can see a couple
things here so the boolean expression is
in between parentheses the if statement
opens with a curly bracket ends with a
curly bracket and notice how Phil gets
indented so the indentation is not
changed the way the code runs but it
helps you visually see you could have a
lot of lines of code you have a lot of
things happen within that if statement
so those curly brackets say this is the
code that should be executed and
remember if this evaluates to false this
doesn't happen draws looping over and
over again it might be true it might not
be true so let's run this and see what
we get this is very exciting okay
where's my mouse I don't know I think it
sounded like 50 so we're not there yet
okay maybe it's like 100 150 done 200
okay we're getting there close it's
almost there so it's there ah yes we got
it all right so you can see that as the
mouse gets beyond 300 that circle turns
this purplish-pinkish color when I move
the mouse back it's off so this is
pretty exciting and you could think like
we almost have this sense of like making
a rollover here I mean we don't at all
but you can start to imagine like what's
that if statement that says if the mouse
is inside the circle highlight it so
these are the kinds of things you all
these interface elements that you might
be used to using on your computer this
is how they work and I don't know if I
will actually solve this particular
problem in a video involves looking up
the distance function because you've got
to test the distance of the mouse from
the center of that circle but that could
be something if you want to kind of
tricky a problem to look at you might
sort of see later I'm going to
definitely get to an example that that
uses a rectangle try to see if if the
mouse is within the bounds of the
rectangle I think that's in my mind of
future videos so there's one other thing
I want to mention just to kind of like
make sure this video kind of like wraps
itself up and it doesn't leave off any
details
the
showed you these relational operators
there are other ones there is greater
than n equals
there is less than or equals so in other
words v is greater than or equals 6 this
is actually true but no it's not
I bet to say like that's not true Oh 5
is greater than or equal 5 right because
it is equal it's like I'm like I was
doing so well with this video now I'm
kind of losing my mind here a little bit
so but there are other relational
operators that you could use these are
probably the most common ones you're
going to get pretty far and then there's
also double equals there's a funny
distinction between the double equals
and a triple equals in JavaScript I'm
going to leave out of this video and
just use double equals because the
distinction and maybe this is a bad idea
I have to rerecord this or write
something in the video's description but
um there's a key sort of thing here if I
want to check this if Mouse x is equal
to 200 I cannot say Mouse X e I cannot
use this as my expression the reason I
cannot use this but as my expression is
the single equals means an assignment
operation meaning I want to assign the
value 200 to Mouse X which is not
something I want to do Mouse X doesn't
even get assigned it just picks up the
value of where the mouse is so if you
want to test if a variable is equal to
something you need to use the double
equals an item a B when when I get two
strings that's when I look at the
distinction between double equals and
triple equals and some might say that
you should actually use the triple
equals instead of the double equals I
really gone off the deep end I really
thought about this I wouldn't have
mentioned this in the first place so
these are some things you look at but
honestly this is generally not such a
good idea because it you know when are
you really trying to test if the mouse
is on an exact pixel generally you're
looking for ranges so and I think what
you could get started with is take
something you made earlier where
something is growing or something is
moving according to the mouse and see if
you can have a color change or a shape
change or something you could do that's
kind of interesting
here's an exercise for you is have this
shape change have it be a circle or a
square or possibly even is it could you
have three possibilities or a triangle
depending on where the mouse X is or the
mouth Y is that's something you could
try doing as a quick little exercise
after this video okay
this was 11 minutes and 20 seconds which
is I've tried to keep these to ten
minutes I almost sort of got that and
I'm going to hit stop now and record the
next one the stop buttons over here okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
