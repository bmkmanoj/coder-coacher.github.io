finished with this it's a dynamic
program its ties one line of code the
next Gibson set up a bunch of lines of
code that happen over and over again and
draw repeating repeating repeating and
what's the result this static rectangle
that just sits there in the window so
what is it that we want to do we want to
figure out how do we animate that
rectangle how do we introduce this idea
of variation into a program and truly
what we're leading up to is this idea of
learning about a fundamental concept of
computation this idea of a variable a
program that stores data over time in
the game context that data could be the
scores of different players the level
that a player is on it could be the
positions of things over as they're
moving right any program that has
something moving you've got to store its
position
what is its size and if it's growing
what is its new size there is data
associated that a program is storing a
profiting sketch of story whenever it
runs that stuff is being stored in the
computer's memory so that's what we're
leading up to but we're going to kind of
start in a simpler way just by kind of
sneaking in on this idea of variation
into our processing sketch so what if
for example we could say erase this
block of code thing here we have we're
writing this rectangle and we ready
we're drawing this we're calling the
function rectangle we're drawing a
rectangle at 100 comma 100 with the size
of 50 comma 20 what if instead of saying
that I could just say it ah I'm going to
draw a rectangle at the mouse's
exposition comma 100 comma 50 count of
20 wouldn't that be nice right instead
of saying oh I want to draw a rectangle
at this specific value I just want to
say draw that rectangle where the mouse
is at the mouse's exposition so if we
put and type this into processing I am
almost certain we get an error which say
some like unexpected token void you know
missing a blah blah blah it doesn't know
what this is but the but in fact we can
do exactly the same thing I don't know
where I went where I was going with this
but we can actually do this instead of
saying the mouse is exposition we can go
over here and look at this program and
we can actually say mouse X look at that
it turned this beautiful pink color it
turned this beautiful pink color right
this blue color is for a function we
think of it as a command rect mode
center stroke 255 Mouse X isn't a
command a function it's a variable it's
a word that stands for a number now X
stands in for whatever the current value
of the mouse's exit position is and
because processing knows about this word
it turned it pink for us all I forgot
the cameras are going up and and and and
it's great I've just excuse me for a
second I'm going to come and say hi to
you hi and I'm going to turn this off
and turn it back on and someday I'll
edit that out but I can't right now okay
so um so this is great now let's
actually they were had a big exciting
moment here we had a little pause I'm
gonna go back and I'm gonna run this
program I'm gonna run this program oh my
goodness look at this look at this holy
moly right you know I don't I'm getting
excited by just this rectangle moving on
the screen but I don't know it's really
not that great what can we do um so we
have this rectangle now moving on the
screen right because its position where
it's being drawn right it's drawing it
draw the rectangle draw the rectangle
draw the rectangle at any moment it's
and draw the rectangle where the mouse X
is where the mouse X's as I move it we
get this new rectangle this is pretty
super darn exciting so we now see how we
can introduce this idea of variation
into a processing sketch so let's see
let's think about some other things well
for one one thing I'll just going to do
here really briefly is I can add you
know Mouse Y here and so now I'm moving
this rectangle with where its exposition
and it's Y position is wherever the
Mouse's by the way we can start to get a
little crazy I don't know why I decided
to do this but what if I were to write
something like height - Mouse Y we can
start to add oh I got this I wrote the
word Oh height and I
explain with that then so here look at
this look at this thing about this for a
second right I just introduced the idea
of these what's called a built-in
variable a built-in variable is a word
that stands in for a value and there are
just a small number of them
there's mouse X mouse Y there's another
one there's width and height when we set
up that Prostate window we gave it a
width of 640 in a size of 360 we could
use those values again later in our
program but what if we change the size
of the window someday then we're going
to have to find wherever we put those
numbers everywhere else and rewrite and
change those as well we can dynamically
access the current width and height of
our sketch window through key words
width and height and so if I do
something like height minus mouse Y you
know think what's going to happen okay
well what mouse Y is zero and the height
is 360 360 minus zero is 360 so when the
mouse is at the top it'll actually draw
it at the bottom and vice versa let's
run this sketch and we can see look it's
kind of inversely its location its
vertical location is inverse to the
mouse value so we can see this is kind
of like actually kind of fun to to know
anyway so I wish there whatever
nevermind sorry okay so back to what we
were talking about we have I'm putting
it back to just Mouse X minus y so we
can see there are other built-in
variables all of which we could find and
I think even if I right-click on this I
can say find in reference right down
here you can see there's a fine and
reference of a one to look up Mouse X
now if Y but certainly in the reference
if you go to the product of the
processing reference all these are going
to be documented there okay so this
brings us to another interesting point
let's run this and remember I think in
the previous video we talked about okay
well size should definitely go and set
up because size is an initialization
condition of our program it's what we do
at the beginning right the rectangle
should definitely go and draw because we
want to try this stuff all the time
while the program is running
where should background go couldn't
really decide we just picked an
arbitrary decision we put back
and draw well let's think for a moment
what happens if I put background in
setup okay so thanks for in your mind
pause say and pause and think what's
going to happen look at maybe you pause
because you should fit it let me give
you a little help
when background was in draw every time
before we do the rectangle we would draw
the background who would wipe the
background clean with a solid color now
what does it mean to put background in
setup setup the code and setup only ever
execute once when the program first
begins
we're only drawing the background once
when the program first begins what will
happen let's run this sketch we can see
that look we have a history of every
single rectangle ever right because if
we don't clear the background if we
don't wipe it every time before we draw
the next rectangle we're leaving the
pixels we filled in there previously so
this is this this is a very like simple
thing right if we put background and
setup we're kind of always seeing
everything we draw on top of itself over
and over again if we put background and
draw then we are wiping clean the frame
that the we are wiping clean the window
every time through draw which gives us
that illusion of motion right wipe the
background draw the rectangle wipe it
draw the rectangle a little further over
right there draw the rector and a little
further over that gives us this illusion
of motion and you might actually be
asking yourself the question when
background was in draw how come I don't
see like all these steps how come I
don't see draw the background I see in
blank background then I see the
rectangle dentist a black round there to
see the red camel darkness in the
background right and we're almost like
flicker the reason why you don't see
that is processing only updates what you
see at the very end of draws almost as
if there's an invisible line of code
right here that says update the screen
so all of this stuff accumulates through
draw and when you get to the end it
updates this is why if I put background
at the end we'll never see that
rectangle right no matter what we do
it's always wiping it at the end of draw
which is what we clearly don't want to
do in this case this is a bug in our
program essentially okay so I've shown
you mouse X and mouse Y I'm going to
very quickly show you one other thing
which is that in addition to Mouse X
Mouse why there are two other built-in
variables which are called a P Mouse X
and P Mouse Y so if we look at this
sketch but whatever to do this but if we
look at this sketch what's happening
here draw a line from P Mouse X P Mouse
Y to Mouse X Mouse Y so so what does
that mean let's come over here for a
second oh come over here with me let's
come over here for a second this is our
processing window and this is our mouse
our mouse is here at one moment in time
at another moment in time we move the
mouse and maybe it ends up over here so
this is kind of like time equals zero
and this is kind of like time equals one
those are the mouse positions as if
we're moving it well this we know at the
current time we can think of as Mouse X
Mouse Y processing always stores for us
the previous Mouse position and mouse x
ms y position so if this is the previous
one what does it mean to draw a line
between the two
it means draw that line but if what if
we do this over and over again always
draw a line from previous to current
previous to current what happens if the
mouse moves over here and then the mouse
moves over here and the mouse moves over
here so this is the beginnings this is a
you can almost like one line of code
create a drawing app in processing now
actually the work that the possibilities
here are endless what you can do with
creating drawing drawing applications in
terms of colors and thickness and
brushstrokes in and saving drawings and
manipulating them later and also that I
almost want to just like stop and always
talk about that for a while but we can't
but weird but this is saying you might
think about if you're looking for an
idea for a project but here we have this
very simple idea draw from previous to
current let's see what happens when you
do that if we run this program we can
see look oh look at this
you can kind of see it there right
there's that blind from previous to
current why am I not seeing that
continuous line because I forgot
backgrounds in draw this is a case where
we absolutely want background to be in
setup because we want to be able to see
the cadet continuous line we don't want
to ever erase what we've drawn so here
we can see look right now it's always
doing it you know later we want to see
like how can I do it only when I click
the mouse we're going to start this so
much more for us to look at and
understand in terms of adding logic and
stuff to a program but this is a nice
little example of something else you can
do so what have we got now we've got all
the tools to draw I don't know why
there's nothing over here to look at
we've got all the tools to draw on a
processing window rectangle ellipse
stroke fill background we now understand
how to control the flow of things at the
beginning and things happen in draw we
can we see that we can start to vary the
program a little bit but really what's
the only thing that we have so far to
vary our program now sex Mouse will have
a VP Mouse
XP knows why so anyway here but so you
don't have a lot so far but you know
essentially what I would say to you but
we're going to look at what we're trying
to get much further than this we want to
be able to introduce all sorts of other
variables our own variables events that
happens when the mouse is when the run
up and the mouse is clicked or a key is
pressed so we're going to get to all
that but right now I would say to you
see if you can manipulate your
processing sketch just with the current
mouse location in the previous Mouse
location
you know these values don't have to be
used just for locations of things on the
screen what if you control the fill
right the color of something when the
mouse moves to the right it becomes more
red it moves to down it becomes more
blue how would you do that
how could you control the thickness of
this line based on how fast you're
moving it right the speed at which you
move the mouse is somehow related to the
difference between the current location
in the previous location
how could you vary its thickness as it
moves by the way is a clue to that
there's a
we haven't looked at there's a function
processing called stroke wait look that
up in the reference stroke weight allows
you to control almost the thickness of
this line right is it a very thick line
you're drawing thin or is it very very
thick right so that's something you
could look at do it and in the next
video what we're actually going to look
at where the next thing we're to look at
is how to control how to make things not
but when you click the mouse and when we
press a key so we just look very briefly
at events in the next video so try that
and I hope you enjoy it and you know
also do something else enjoyable that
has nothing to do with the computer
because it's probably good idea to okay
