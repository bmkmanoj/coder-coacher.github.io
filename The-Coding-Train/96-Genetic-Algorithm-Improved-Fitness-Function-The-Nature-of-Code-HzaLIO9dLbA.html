algorithms video in this video I want to
talk about an improved Fitness function
now there are so many different ways you
can improve a fitness function in ways
that you could design and think about a
fitness function right let's mean this
video to be like here's one thing but I
just want to use this video as a way to
start thinking about how this Fitness
function is your creative thing that
you're creating and anything you can
imagine you could possibly do with that
function so if you recall this
particular example which is a search
problem it's a simulation running a
genetic algorithm to evolve the phrase
to be or not to be and every time I run
this it takes it's typically taking
between somewhere between like 300 and
600 generations to get to the correct
phrase and you can see it took 550 for
generations so let's talk about the
fitness function let's talk about the
fitness function and the way the fitness
if I were to graph that Fitness function
right this is number of the x-axis is
the number of characters correct okay so
the more characters you get correct the
higher the fitness right yay more
characters correct higher the fitness
and this works because I might have you
know in the case I might have a phrase
that's like 20 characters long and I
have you know 16 characters correct
versus 17 characters characters correct
this has a higher fitness it's going to
be more likely to be picked as a in the
selection process to have its genetic
information passed the next generation
but there's a problem here what if this
phrase were not twenty characters long
but what if it were two thousand or two
hundred thousand or two million
characters long let's think about the
fitness values of certain random phrases
so one random phrase might have 390 1263
characters correct and another one might
have 390 1264 characters correct now
this one is better than this one and in
fact having just one more character
correct it's really a lot better
the other one and we really want to make
it more likely to have its genetic
information passed down to the next
generation but if you take this value
and divide it by two million and you
take this value and divide it by two
million the number you get from this
value is only a tiny bit bigger than
this one so in other words this value is
only a tiny bit bigger than this value
but I really want that one that's a
little bit a tiny bit higher to be much
more likely to be picked because I want
my evolution to happen efficiently and
faster and all of that so a simple way
around this is to make the to make the
Fitness function exponential what if I
could have the number of care the more
characters you have correct the more the
higher your fitness is exponentially and
there are variety of ways you could do
this I could say the Fitness is two to
the n being n is the number of
characters correct
I could take N squared or n to the
fourth power you know I could probably
come up with some other fancy or math to
do but I just want to get you thinking
that these are the types of issues that
you want to think about in fact let's go
back to this program and I'm going to go
to the fitness function which is here
right I'm just going to say as a very
simple thing I'm gonna say this dot
fitness equals power this dot fitness
squared so this is me taking fitness to
the second power and I could have just
said this dot fitness times this dot
fitness but whatever I'm doing this dot
fitness squared and now let's run it
again and I you'll have to sort of trust
in me at this point but I run this about
four or five times and it's solving it
between about three hundred six hundred
generations let's run it again replace
the music while I wait there's still
music oh I didn't have to wait very long
two hundred forty
let's run it again
oh boy picking a mug time oh this is not
good that was an anomaly right again
2017 that's pretty good
236 you can see I've improved and I
could even go I could go to the fourth
power right 120 little fun rockin button
refreshed 89 so you can see that that
exponential fitness function really has
improved things and so this is something
you could consider so you could also go
back to the smart rockets example as an
exercise find the smart rocket example
that I made in the previous coding
challenge and see if you could use that
distance the distance to the target
which is part of the fitness and use an
exponential function to see if you can
make that particular evolution happen
you know more quickly or kind of work
more efficiently okay thanks for
watching and I'll see you in another
video soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
