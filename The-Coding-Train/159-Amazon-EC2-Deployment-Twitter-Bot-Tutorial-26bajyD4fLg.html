how you can deploy a Twitter bot written
in nodejs to an Amazon ec2 instance in
particular one of the reasons I want to
use an Amazon ec2 instance in this case
is because not only is my Twitter bot
written in nodejs
but my Twitter bot triggers a processing
sketch which is a Java program to create
an image and that image is posted to
Twitter so if you want to make a image
producing Twitter bot this is one
solution for you this is not the be-all
end-all solution of course there's lots
of ways to write Twitter bots and
there's lots of ways to make images but
you can see here so I'm in a moment I'm
going to start going through those steps
but let's just kind of get a lay of the
land here for a second so here you can
see this is a particular trigger bot it
posts an image made from processing you
can see the image here this is the
processing sketch if I run the
processing sketch here you can see it
just draws this particular image it also
saves it to a file and exits because
here now is the code you can see the
code in node is triggering that
processing sketch here and now if I run
that code the image bot is starting it
says it worked and if I go back to
Twitter we can see here I got another
one now these two images are different
even though they look remarkably the
same remarkably similar but they are
they are different right someone's doing
a quick pixel analysis they're different
they have to be different otherwise my
whole understanding of the way the
universe works is faulty ok
so now we see this is how you run this
stuff locally this is what I did in all
the previous videos in this playlist
about node Twitter bot things now we
need to look at how do we how do we
deploy this stuff to an amazon ec2
instance you know basically you know any
of any Linux Linux server you could
follow these same steps and I'm just
going to happen to use Amazon and I was
able to do this with a free account now
at some point you might discover you
have to pay but for the most part seems
like you can run this
using free credits at least for quite a
long time okay so I do happen to have
these notes online on a web page which
will be linked to in the description of
this video which presumably you are
watching it some other time
than the actual moment that I'm speaking
right now but the first thing I'm going
to do here is go to this link Amazon ec2
but actually I can just type in Amazon
ec2 probably into Google and I'm going
to even just go down here and click on
the first result and what I want to do
is sign into the console the console is
where I'm going to get to configure my
server so that's the first thing I want
to do sign into the console and then I
have to enter in my password which is
with the full robot and I told one
chrome to save it okay ah I've presented
with this terrifying page of like 50
zillion things we could do I there's so
much here I have no idea what any of it
does but up here in the top left ec2
virtual servers in the cloud floating in
the air so those servers which are more
likely in an underground bunker
somewhere not in a cloud but this is
what I want I want to run a server
somewhere else where I can run this
particular bottle so I'm going to click
on ec2 and I get an ec2 management
console and oh good
oh no I do so but I have I currently
have one running instance which is I
guess probably some previous test that I
did at another time but I'm going to
just click Launch instance and now I'm
presented also with a terrifying set of
objects of of objects of options so I'm
going to go back to my notes page where
I said this is the one that I happen to
use so there's different versions of
Linux operating systems and different
kinds of and the key things that I'm
looking for one is free to your eligible
and see if I can get this running on the
free tier the other is I need one that
can also not just run node run Java it
so happens that this Mbutu server 14.04
it happens to also be able to run java I
also want to make sure I pick general
purpose free tier micro and then set
review and launch so I'm going to do
that I'm going to look for that one
which is this one
I'm going to hit select over here I
don't know if you guys can see this I
should make that but boon to Server 1404
I'm gonna hit select a general purpose T
to free TR eligible
I'm going to hit review and launch and
now it is launched great oh no lunch now
I'm going to hit lunch and ah okay so ah
so here's so if okay so here's the deal
this is the weirdest part of working
with Amazon ec2 is how you're going to
now authenticate and login to it and you
need to create this secret file that
holds the keys to your server now
apparently I've been here before and
I've made a bunch of these because I was
showing different examples so you likely
won't have any previous keys you can use
so but I'm going to create a new key
pair so I need to give it a name and I'm
going to call it coding rainbow if you
can see that and I'm gonna then click
download key pair Oh yikes
ah what happened I'm just who make like
a Chris I've completely lost my ability
to zoom effectively so I'm gonna hit
download key pair and we should see
hopefully that ah you can see here I'm
standing in front of it but down here
under my downloads in the downloads
there is now this file coding rainbow
dot p.m. you must have this file I now
need that file
always and forever to log into this ec2
instance in a variety of different ways
that I'll show you okay so I have that
file now and now I should be able to now
finally say launch instances now that I
have that file I can say launch
instances and waiting your instances are
now launching and now I can go to view
instances and I don't not worrying about
that right now so you can see this is
clearly one that I made a while ago when
I was doing another tutorial or another
test or and you can see this one hasn't
actually completely launched
so this is the problem Vicky's videos in
real time where I sort of uh I just
stayed here like completely awkwardly
like dumbfounded I don't know what to do
it's pending let's go to the next steps
and when we come back hopefully it'll be
hopeful it'll be working so okay so I
followed these steps I did this part now
aha
okay so what I need to do now is use
that key that file to be able to log
into that instance so the way that the
first thing I need to do is actually
change the files permissions so files on
computers have permissions some files
are like locked you can't edit them some
files are applications that can be
executable this particular key file
needs a CH stands for like change modify
what is it for somebody doesn't think
somebody right I'll do an annotation
here is that but I I need to run this
command to change its file permissions
so what I'm going to do is the first
thing I need to do is I need to go to
where that file is so actually I'm just
going to put that file on the desktop
you can come up with a better place to
put it and I'm going to go to the
desktop and I can see there is that file
and I guess I'm zoomed in or something
so now what I want to do is oops type in
this particular command chmod 400 and
then that filename which is was coding
rainbow PE M so that's the first thing
I've done I've now changed the file
permissions to 400 for that particular
file and then now I can you do something
called SSH SSH secure shell so basically
what I want to do is in the same way
that I have my I'm here in terminal on
my computer and I can look at the file
by saying LS I could run the files by
saying like node what I want to do is be
able to remote into that Amazon ec2
instance so that the terminal I'm
looking at the commands I'm
are actually not running on my laptop
which is here yeah it's dangerous to
pick it up not running on this laptop
but actually the commands are executing
on the server floating in the cloud
that's buried in the underground bunker
okay so let's see here if ah so me
rambling for a long period of time we're
at nine minutes here has actually caused
this this instance to be running I don't
know why it doesn't have a name here let
me give it a name so and one thing I can
do here if i zoom in and right-click see
this connect option this is going to be
really useful to me because actually it
gives me all of right this is the
command
it's got I've got the command right here
this is like the public this is like the
IP address essentially of that instance
and then here it's actually giving me
the exact command to log in to it so I
don't even need to figure out what it is
I can just copy this and go back to
terminal and paste that in here hit
enter and okay this is the first time
that I'm connecting so my computer sings
I don't know about this I haven't
connected this place before is anything
something that I should be afraid of you
it's nothing so I should hit type yes
and now it's added and then I just stood
here and I hope and wait and I hope that
the internet will oblige me and connect
ah there we go
so look at that you can now see here
that I am connected I have logged in
under my new name Vudu to my new address
IP 172 31 34 179 so now I can do things
like say PWD with print working
directory here I am in home slash boom -
I can type LS and I can see there's
nothing there so now this is great right
this bot which I have here locally on my
computer I want to be able to get it
over here on my Amazon ec2 instance so
how do I upload files there so the way
one way to upload files to your Amazon
ec2 instance is with a FTP or File
Transfer
Protocol secure FTP so the way that I
could do that is you could use any any
FTP software and all sorts of define a
way to do it through the web it's
through a browser but I'm going to use
something called cyberduck which you can
google and download I already have it
installed here and so I'm going to run
cyberduck apparently hi and what I'm
going to do here I have a cyberduck open
what I want to hit is this open
connection so I click open connection
and now I have this window where what I
need to do is put in all the information
for that Amazon ec2 instance so first
thing I want to do is make sure I do
SFTP it's got to be secure shell File
Transfer Protocol and then the server
address if I go back to here should be
this right this is connect to your
instance using the Public DNS it's this
so I'm going to copy this and go back to
cyberduck paste that in here now there's
this interesting question here which is
what's my username and password well I
don't have a username and password I
have this weird coding rainbow dot p.m.
private key file it turns out in
cyberduck under here under more options
I can click that and I can say use
public key authentication so I click
that and now I go to the desktop and I
select this file and now I now have this
file selected as my way of
authenticating and I should be able to
just say connect oh maybe I need to
write new boon to here just in the
username and it works ok whew so that
was one little step that I had
personally forgotten that I need to put
in the username I need to say boon to
but now I just have this window here
right this is now a view into home slash
and boo - so what do I want to do I want
to go and I want to just go here this is
this folder here node 5 is where I have
all of my stuff
and I'm actually just I'm just going to
take bot config and package.json I'm
just going to upload those files right
now so I can drag them in here drag
those files into here and they're now
uploading a little windows telling me
progress they're transferring I can see
that those files are listed here right
now and now I can go back here and I can
say LS and you can see those files are
there yay these things are working so
now running out of breath here now I can
type in node and you know this is going
to not work because I missed a set of
steps here but node bot J s and so
what's happening here the program node
can be found in the following packages
node nodejs legacy so and then saying
sudo apt-get install selected package so
one thing we first have to do is at
least configure node to work the way
that we want it to work and I believe
that I have mentioned that here
and these are some steps that you can do
so let's actually just run through these
steps the first thing I want to do is
call what do sudo apt-get update so what
that does is just says this apt-get
thing which is a tool to like get things
like node another software I want to
make sure it's updated and has all of
the most recent stuff so that's done
then the next thing I want to do is
install node J s which say sudo apt-get
install no - Jas so I'm going to run
that my audio is still working up this
is asking me if I want to use the disk
space which of course I do
so I'm going to run and install nodejs
which is great then I also want to make
sure I have NPM installed which is node
package manager which you might remember
from the previous node tutorials and
this is a 130 megabytes of disk space so
hopefully this doesn't take too long so
this is installing now the next step
while it's installing let's talk about
the next step for a second
this is now a command to make sure that
the particular version of node that I
installed is now the actual version of
node that will run when I type in the
node command so I am going to grab this
command here and hope that this is done
it's done and I'm going to because watch
what happens if I just type node right
now it doesn't actually know what note
it can be found in it's like well which
one should I run no js' legacy or this
one node so I want to make sure that I
run this particular one with that
command and now when I type node you'll
see I'm in node so now I have no running
on my Amazon ec2 instance and I can oh
if I say clear here oh it does still
work I can say node bot J s now first
error I get is it cannot find module
twit this is going to be notice when I
uploaded my files
remember how I said I upload the files I
didn't upload the directory that said
node modules I could have uploaded that
directory but it makes more sense for me
to just let those modules get installed
by Amazon itself so I can just type in
npm install and it's now going to
install all the modules that are needed
for this particular bot we went through
this locally now I'm doing this on the
server so if if we looked here and I
said I refreshed you can see that now
there is a directory called node modules
which has for example that twit module
in it so now I should be able say node
bot J s and it will run now here's the
thing it runs so these are all the steps
you need if you just have a plain old
bot that only runs a node but the reason
why I got an error now is it can't find
that image file output dot PNG the
reason why I can't find that image file
output dot PNG is because that the image
file that's created by the processing
sketch so while this part of the video
I've now concluded like you could if you
just have a node dot J a spot you're
kind of done although there's another
step of getting it to run after you
out which I will get to let's but let's
get the let's get the image itself to
let's get the image making processing
sketch to run as well so let's look at
how we do that and there's a lot of like
sort of awfully scary looking weird
commands to do that okay oh but actually
so yeah I'll come back to the forever
thing okay so the first thing we need to
do is make sure Java is on our server so
first thing I want to do is install java
which i want to say apt-get install
default JRE
so I'm going to put that in and run that
and it's going to take 209 megabytes of
disk spacing to say yes so now I'm
installing Java I'm going to wait for
that to install let's go back while
we're doing that - the next step the
next step okay so look at all these like
terrifyingly weird looking commands so
what's the weird thing that has to
happen when you work when you work with
processing on a computer your computer
is typically connected to a monitor a
screen and you're seeing the output of
processing on that screen your Amazon
ec2 instance has no screen it has no GUI
interface it's just a server that you
can SSH into or FTP files to but it's
known as headless meaning processing
actually when it runs it breaks because
it's like I don't know what graphics
thing to draw anything - there is no
graphics thing so these next steps are
steps that create a fake display
essentially the ec2 instance has this
display you're tricking it into thinking
that it is connected to a display
because we don't need to see it we just
want the graphics to be rented to a file
so the first thing I'm going to do is
install something called X VfB which you
could Google to find out what it is I'm
going to run this particular command
which will install this tool for a fake
display the other thing I'm going to do
is give it a now I'm going to give it an
actual screen which is has a resolution
of 1024 by 768 why not so I will do that
I didn't give some weird little errors
but you know big deal so this seems to
be running a process that I need to like
now quit out of so I'm going to ctrl C
to do that and then I'm okay so this was
this was the command that creates that
screen and that screen was there only
while it's running but I also now need
to export it and assign it to be display
one so actually these commands are no
good so this is the command let me let
me explain that again so I'm going to
run this command right and that screen
now exists for processing to draw into
but I can't type in any other commands
here because it's like running so what I
needed to do is I needed to run in the
background and a command for having
things run in the background is no hub
so I'm actually going to say this now
and now you can see I'm back to my
terminal but that screen is now created
and I also just want to assign it
display number one that's what
processing will draw to display number
one so that's done so now we're in good
shape now here's the thing if we go back
to the code you'll notice here this is
the code that I ran locally on my laptop
for triggering processing to run
processing - Java but actually now that
I'm on a Amazon server boy this is on 20
minutes it is anybody still watching as
20 minutes into a tutorial uploading
stuff to Amazon ec2 but I have now I'm
now on an Amazon ec2 instance which is a
Linux machine so there's actually a
different way that I could do this I can
go to my processing sketch and I can go
under file export application so export
application is something you can always
do and it opens up a little window and
what I want to actually do is check
Linux ok I want to export it as a Linux
application now there's this embed
Java option which I'm kind of confused
whether I want to select it I I don't
recall whether I need to select that or
not let's try unselecting it I probably
should keep it selected but let's try
unselecting it and I'm going to hit
export so you can see here now I have
the Linux application incidentally
here's a version that you could run on a
Raspberry Pi which we'll get to later so
now I should be able to go back and
upload this to okay so I'm going to have
this application which I want to include
so oh now boy this tutorial is not going
very well that light went off camera
went off I don't know why this light
keeps going off so I'm going to now now
what I need to do is I need to take this
folder and I'm going to upload that
folder to books my server so I'm going
to upload that here so I'm uploading
that Linux application dumped unta it's
there now I'm also going to rename this
file this folder and call it rainbow and
I want to I do want to do that so you
can see here the application is now here
in this particular folder so the first
thing we need to do is figure out does
this even work so remember here I am now
on my I'm now logged in to the server
and you can see there is a directory
called rainbow so I can go into that
directory we can see what's there this
is actually the application and the way
in Linux the way that you execute
something is with dot slash rainbow and
it's going to say permission denied so I
did miss a step there which is that the
permissions of the file I have to set
the permissions to be executable which I
can do by saying chmod 777 rainbow and
now I should be able to say
dot slash rainbow and run it and it did
something it finished and now let's type
LS and we can see look at that there is
a file in there now called output dot
PNG so if I go in here and hit refresh
and we go grab this file and I download
it to my desktop and I take a look at it
you can see this is the image that was
now generated on the server so now we
have the processing sketch as a exported
Linux application running on the Amazon
ec2 instance ah well this is I know this
is like 20-some minutes into this long
tutorial we're so close now to actually
making the thing run it's very exciting
ok so now if I go back to here one thing
you'll notice I'm going to go back to
the code is remember this this was the
command that I had for running on my Mac
to execute a processing sketch using
processing command line processing -
Java but now that it's a Linux
application the only thing I need to do
is actually just I change that command
to this dot slash rainbow only that's
not exactly right because it's in a
different directory and so I'm going to
go here and I just need to make sure I
have the folder so I think actually I
can just do this rainbow slash rainbow
and now I've changed the code and since
I changed the code I also need to
re-upload the code to the server so I'm
overwriting it continue so now that new
code is running on the server and I
should be able to go back a directory so
now what's here we have bot J s which
triggers the processing application
which is in rainbow and communicates
with Twitter API in place to post the
tweet so let's see if this works
image bot is starting
it worked and now if I go here and look
at the bots we should see seven seconds
ago this particular image now I want to
make sure it's really over writing and
making a new image so the only way I can
think to really do that is to go into
the processing sketch for a second and
change this to like a green value so
let's make whoops you can see now the
color should be green and I'm going to
export this export application as a
Linux application go into here take this
and I probably shouldn't be doing this
right now I'm going to upload it so
replacing it here we go so now I
uploaded the new application and I'm
going to go into that directory I'm
going to whoops change the permissions
again you don't ever need to do this I
just want to really make sure it's
working which is risky because it might
not be I'm going to go back up a
directory and I'm going to say node bot
J s image bot is starting it says it
works but I'm not entirely sure it over
wrote that file I have a bad feeling it
didn't I did okay that's impactful so it
does work so and I can run it again now
this particular bot by the way you
notice it just quits it only does it
once and you can see we got another one
these are too even though there's a
different color scheme they're different
I should just make a processing sketch
that makes a much more recognizable
image but here's the thing
what you want probably is your bot to be
running continuously so the one thing is
just to add set interval to the code but
the other thing that you need is to use
a tool known as for
ever so this is the last piece that's on
that's on this particular walkthrough so
in other words what you want is for the
node app to run forever in the
background even when you log out of
Amazon your instance and forever we saw
that this nohup thing is all way of
doing it which is also a way but no it
has its own way of doing that which is
something called forever so I can say
sudo npm install forever - gee so this
is a node module it's not associated
with a particular node application but
sort of global thing that you would run
across a lot of applications so if I
copy that here that's going to install
this tool called forever and then it's
going to my in forever install dance and
then and then I can now start and stop
things I can say forever start bot j/s
which is running it and you know you can
set all sorts of parameters like you
know how long should it be up for how
long should it sleep and all that thing
but I'm just letting it use the default
and another thing I can type now is
forever dot list I think and you can see
let's let's hold on let's make this a
little bit more easy for you to see
forever
dot list and you can see that this is
the particular process that's running
nodejs bot j/s so if i wanted that was
just running now forever it's not
tweeting forever because the process is
not set to do that but I could I can do
things like say forever stop all I
believe which just stopped everything so
now if I say forever list again there's
no forever processes running and I can
say forever start again so there's lots
of different ways so so this is what you
want to do you want to you end so if I
set that running and I log out my bot is
now going to be
running forever on that Amazon ec2
instance whoof this is like probably one
of the longest tutorial videos I've ever
made it was completely sort of like
frantic animal haphazard this is
probably hard to follow probably to be
honest with you this page of
instructions might actually make it
easier but let me just review to recap
what I covered this particular very long
tutorial which is that first thing you
want to do is create that server
instance right you need to get a key
pair a file so you can log into it once
you've logged into it you want to SSH
into it you can connect to it from
terminal then you want to do things like
install node then you want to connect to
it with FTP SFTP cyberduck being a tool
for doing that that allows you to upload
your files there once you've uploaded
your files there you can run your BOTS
but if your bot also runs a processing
sketch you want to also install Java run
these commands to create the fake
display in the background then export
your processing sketch as a Linux
application and upload that once you
have all of that there then you can use
forever to run your node bot that
triggers the processing sketch this is
like the the kick the cat that found on
my father bought for two zeusie
but anyway instead that that that runs
the node that runs the processing sketch
that creates the fake display that runs
with forever my father bought for anyway
whatever um so all those steps and
you've got your thing running so I've
anybody actually watched this entire
video it actually has a node bot running
on Amazon ec2 instance successfully I
don't know please send me a tweet or
something or to let me know because
because that would make me happy to hear
