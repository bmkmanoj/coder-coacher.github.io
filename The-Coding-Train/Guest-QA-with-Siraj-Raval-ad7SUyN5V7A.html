special guests right now a world it's
nagy there's no life in you I'm going
what I'm gonna do I think the microphone
it's probably so I'm old so you don't
have ten yet there's definitely snapchat
somewhere but this is like a takeover
and time to let Suraj talk and what I'm
gonna lock word least and here because I
can look at the end I'm gonna monitor
the chat and I will pull interesting
questions from the chat and if you want
to show anything or talk about anything
there's a computer here there's a
computer perfect so I have the computer
access I've got I've got you guys and
I've got I bought a bunch of stuff so
let me just answer some questions so if
anybody has any questions just put them
in the chat I'll answer them they could
be about machine learning anything
machine learning and of course personal
as well but I so one thing I'm saying is
a couple people in the chair saying oh I
don't know Suraj okay even though I
think Oh everybody must watch Suraj's
YouTube channel yeah you don't I guess
so why don't you can you take a minute
just to introduce yourself and maybe
pull up your YouTube let me pull up my
youtube channel okay the little
self-promotion here let's see okay
straight to them not to music video this
go to the channel okay sure I can add by
I'm gonna have dissolved okay okay guys
so I talked about artificial
intelligence on YouTube I'm like dan and
I are very complementary he does the
more JavaScript and I do Python but we
can switch back and forth basically I
talked about AI that's my thing I talk
about AI and ways that you can use it
for recommender systems
classifiers data generators anomaly
detectors anything that you could learn
from data from using AI that's what I
talked about so this is my channel check
it out if and you'll probably like it as
well if you like Dan's channel we do a
lot of similar stuff so that's me that's
who I am and I'm just visiting new you
work because I'm talking with the United
Nations and came to collab with Dan as
well so now I'm going to answer some
questions as well and some people think
the mic volume is too low so I'm gonna
you don't have to do anything okay do I
have ability to turn that up a little
bit that's gonna help I guess you can
move it up a little higher moving up a
little higher yes I'm trying to kiss
okay how can you use LS PMS to classify
data that is a great question so first
of all what is an LS TM great also
question LS TMS are it stands for long
short-term memory networks so LS and LS
TM is a type of neural network right and
neural networks are the the foundation
behind Yai is so popular these days
there's so many different types of
neural networks it's there's a there's a
zoo of neural networks in fact there's a
literal zoo that we can look at here and
the zoo just shows a diagram check it
out of all the different types of neural
networks there are feed-forward networks
as you can see here there are recurrent
networks there are long short term
memory networks there aren't all sorts
of networks out there there are even
lesser-known networks like hopfield
networks and Boltzmann machines so if
you're getting into AI for the first
time you might be asking should I talk
about should I learn about deep shredder
learned deep learning first or Schuyler
and machine learning for us first and
the answer is the answer is you should
focus on deep learning first because
almost 95 or 99% of the time neural
networks will outperform any other
machine learning model almost all the
time so once you get really good at deep
neural networks then you can focus on
the other machine learning models like
support vector machines and linear
regression linear regression and stuff
like that but you can do all that stuff
with neural networks or there are
incredible technology so deep learning
is
a subcategory of machine learning or
does that so and would you say that
everything that's deep learning is also
machine learning no no so it's a one-way
is yeah it's a one-way relationship
machine learning is just the collection
of all learning algorithms that you can
use to gain insights from data so all
and so deep learning is taking one of
those models called a neural network and
giving it two things giving it rocket
fuel and a and a rocket engine what do I
mean the rocket fuel is a data and the
rocket engine are GPUs so if you give it
a lot of computing power and a lot of
data on neural network will help you
find insights you didn't even dream
could be possible and you can do this
with a bunch of cloud platforms not
everybody has access to amazing GPUs but
Google Cloud is obviously a great
solution for this you've got Microsoft
Azure but I'm to be honest I I don't
like Microsoft if you're if you're a
Microsoft person watching this it's okay
you know what I found out that Microsoft
has the biggest contribution to
open-source out of all of the big tech
companies so that's pretty cool I will
say I just windows XP and Vista just
left a scar on my heart that hasn't gone
away anyway and korto Windows 95 was
good okay yeah I guess back in the day I
was pretty young but yeah anyway here's
a good I know if you were still going
but no pork go for it go for so one
question I think is good so if you want
to get into AI in deep learning
what kind of math knowledge do you need
and do you need to like go and learn
math first and then you can get into or
can kind of learn at the same time it's
a great question not would also like to
know the end for sure anything that I'm
trying to one of the things that I'm
trying to do on this channel I just
mentioned so if you're interested in
deep learning machine learning you
should really just go check out Suraj's
channel especially if you want to see
all the latest frameworks and work with
pipes on one of the things that I would
like to try to do in this channel to
complement what Suraj is doing is make
some really beginner friendly AI machine
learning tutorials that you
do quick in almost Twilight experiments
in the browser with JavaScript so anyway
that aside so I'm kind of curious trying
to figure that out like but what do you
really need to know can you just get
through this stuff without knowing this
so that's around yeah so I I had this
problem too right like if you look at a
lot of these machine learning courses
all you see are equations right like
mostly equations and as programmers we
don't actually deal with equations
whenever we're building anything right
we're dealing with code and sometimes
we'll deal with some basic operations
like add or subtract but we're not
computing derivatives right so you might
be thinking yeah should I just go and
learn all of calculus and all of it no
the answer is no these subjects calculus
linear algebra these are these are
massive subjects right and there are so
many parts of these subjects that are
irrelevant to deep learning there are
only very specific parts of calculates
and very specific parts of probability
theory and of linear algebra that you
need to know to do deep learning so you
need a condensed version of these
subjects and the best resource besides
my channel obviously to look at this and
this is kind of where I learned from I
kind of gleaned my knowledge mostly from
this book which is free its online you
can look at it in your browser and it's
called the deep learning book and the
authors of these books are first Arion
good fellow who invented generative
adversarial networks probably the
hottest idea in all of deep learning and
yoshua bengio who's one of the
godfathers of deep learning so
definitely check out this book it's it's
got like entire chapters dedicated to
subjects that would otherwise be an
entire textbook in and of themselves
like so in Chapter 2 you'll learn about
all the linear algebra you need for deep
learning so super cool right and so it
starts off by saying linear algebra is a
is a branch of mathematics used for this
right and then you'll talk and then it
talks it's so cool it talks about
exactly the topics you need you need
scalars you need vectors you need
matrices these are all you need tensors
these are all basically the same types
of things just sets of numbers but it's
our way of ordering these numbers
together right because that's what deep
learning is it's taking sets of numbers
matrices
and continuously applying operations to
these matrices for every layer and these
are in that's why you need to linear
algebra because you can't just multiply
a set of numbers you have to compute the
dot product it's basically
multiplication but for a set of numbers
it's our linear algebra is algebra but
for sets of numbers right so for groups
of numbers and yeah you only need parts
of linear algebra check out the book
yeah that's my answer to that question
so another question I think it'll be
useful is we taught you talked a little
bit just now about okay well there's
machine learning it's this broader field
of research deep learning being taking
one aspect of that neural networks out
of it and giving it the rocket fuel so
to speak yes what is AI how does that
what is our the top of artificial
intelligence how does that differentiate
that term or and how does that what's
the difference between AI versus machine
learning versus deep learning for sure
so okay so yeah there's a lot of
confusion in this field and if you look
at any of these articles by these
popular tech magazines like wired or
TechCrunch let me just look at one so
one of them is like you know just like
Facebook invents language or some things
like Facebook and a I invented its own
language right and so if you look at
these articles you look at them and you
say okay what's the topic here Facebook
AI creates its own language and creepy
preview of our potential future
immediately show a picture of Stephen
Hawking who is completely unrelated to
what Facebook's AI did so let's just
look at one more and I haven't looked at
these articles before but let's just
look at a single no it's a good call
face book AI agents created their own
language is more normal than people
think
researchers say okay so this is actually
a good this is a this is a smarter
article but basically these articles
take advantage of these terms that
people don't know about and just kind of
blow them out of proportion so I'm here
to just tell you this AI is kind of like
the biggest term right AI encompasses
everything right artificial intelligence
in some ways you can even say what Dan
is doing in terms of creative coding
processing that's AI it's just
intelligence right intelligence is just
is we are intelligent right it's the
ability to learn okay how can we learn
right and so if software is our way of
automating this one
process taking a bit of it it's a bit of
what we can do and automating it so it
doesn't need a human behind it
traffic lights can be considered AI
right it's just yes no on/off but in the
end
AI is just the really big buzzword and
what we really want is artificial
general intelligence that is an AI that
can do everything but the way that we
have found the best way the best medium
of making AI reality is using machine
learning technologies and the most
specific topic we can talk about all
these machine learning technologies are
deep learning and so that's why deep
learning is one of those hot words in
the past we in the past five years
because only now have we started to get
the computing power in the data we need
to make these neural networks perform
incredible things so in order deep
learning is the subset of machine
learning and then AI is the biggest
circle around all those things and AI in
general is the ability to learn some
would even say it's heuristics any kind
of statistical model it doesn't have to
learn necessarily but any kind of
intelligent algorithm we could probably
keep going forever forever yeah yeah one
more quick thing I just I've been
learning about brain computer interfaces
recently and there's this really cool
there's this really cool hardware device
called the Emotiv that it's I think it's
the easiest for developers to get
started on I know there's also open BCI
but there so there's a there's a
hardware cost to building it but Emotiv
is really just out of the box the sdk is
really really easy to use and you can
use this technology basically you put it
on your head and you can control robots
with your mind you can lift up objects
like 3d objects in a simulation with
your minds so think of the force from
Star Wars and I think the reason I'm
mentioning that is because I think
there's a lot of potential to apply
machine learning to these technologies
and it's one of those things that no one
has really done yet so there's a lot of
potential for a cool side project if you
wanted to do that maybe combine that
with some cool visualizations using p5
but yeah that's more or less it I'm
releasing a video on this stuff later
today so that's why it's on my mind
that was my next question so you were
you're usually you I know you release
videos Friday around what time around 5
p.m. I p.m. PST so you guys are gonna go
downstairs and work on releasing a video
right now
yes exactly what can you give us a tease
I guess is this the tease this is the
tease but Elon Musk's neural link and
Brian Johnston Johnson's kernel and then
Facebook's brain typing thing I just I'm
gonna talk about what this really is and
it's one of those really risky videos to
make but let's just do this so well I
won't get to watch it right when you
release it but I'm definitely gonna
watch it as soon as my live streams Oh
perfect I look for that I'm gonna so I
everybody stayed stay there I'm gonna
put on some waited music I'm gonna boot
the microphone for a second and help
