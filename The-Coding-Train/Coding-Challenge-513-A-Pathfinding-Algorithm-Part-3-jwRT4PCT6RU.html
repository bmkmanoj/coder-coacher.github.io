fully to the station again back for a
third part of this a-star algorithm
thingamabob because I did a I did want
to what you would saw actually in the
first part is visually this is surprise
third part by the way conventional
computer parts it's fine though it's
fine it's what it is
you're watching or you're not watching
that's like in the first part I showed
it visually a little bit different and
so I'm going to get to there now I just
want to kind of play around with
visually a little bit to give some you
guys some things to think about I'm
hoping that I'll see a lot of you
sharing 3d versions or other types of
visual versions so let's see um let's
see what we can do here the first thing
that I'm going to look at is a different
way of drawing the path so one way that
I want to draw the path is actually by a
continuous line so I'm going to say
begin shape and not begin shape an end
shape and I'm going to have this same
exact for loop but instead of calling
that show function that draws a
rectangle I'm going to add a vertex and
the vertex needs to be at each path is
path passes passes the I times W and
it's J times H and we don't want this to
have a fill and we do want this to have
a stroke I'm just going to make it white
right now and we'll sort of see if that
comes up so let's look at what happens
there so let's I don't see that why
don't I see that o path J ah shoot
always a I need a like a sound effect
not just for the this dot problem but
the I versus J X versus Y probably done
so if we come back and see that we can
see up still not working one Oh
dot J oh my goodness ak it I can't do it
anymore
okay there we go so we can see that I'm
drawing kind of a line so that's really
connecting on but you can see the line
though is kind of connected from the
edges so it goes across the top or goes
across the bottom which isn't exactly
right so I also should kind of consider
the line between the center of each one
of these cells which is
you know adding the height or width
divided by two so now we can see I'm
seeing the sort of path as a line now
there is this kind of issue of should I
be allowed to go between these two right
this is a valid diagonal step but is
this really like a valid part so I think
an interesting exercise for those of you
watching would be how do you modify this
so that's not a valid a move I would
have to actually go around that so now I
can go diagonally but not if there are
two only if this was open as well I
don't know if it should be or not but
one way I could visually at least
address this is I could say if I come
back up sorry to be where I'm drawing
means let's make these actually circles
and so actually I'm going to take this
same exact line of code and I'm going to
I need to draw the circles based on the
center and I also could draw their size
a bit smaller so let's draw all those as
points as circles you can sort of see I
look so there's some strange things
going on now the way that I visualize
this really weird things actually I
shouldn't be allowed to record videos
after a certain amount of time okay so
now we can see and I don't want to draw
the pass anymore I mean the circles
anymore for the path so I'm going to
take out those I also want to make this
stroke wait let's just make it like a
little bit wider so it's a little bit
stronger and now what are the white
circles why are there white circles the
only thing that I'm drawing now is are
the paths and the grid so I'm showing
the grid as white and I'm only so
everything is white unless it's an
obstacle it's black so but I actually
want to do is only draw it if it's an
obstacle
and I also need the background therefore
to be why I really did this in a crazy
way what's the background now the
background is so and then those are the
obstacles
now where's the path let's make the path
some kind of color there we go so we can
see now that I'm getting a path that's
kind of going and it almost looks a bit
more realistic I don't know if this is
better I had something different at the
beginning of the video but I can
actually like what I might do is make
some more obstacles or actually instead
of making more obstacles what I might do
just to sort of like see this a little
bit better is to make a larger grid we
can kind of see so this we could kind of
see a bit more about how you could start
to imagine like visualizing this path
finding thing in a different way it
almost looks like lightning in this kind
of like crazy way but you could think
about what does it mean to have
autonomous agents following the path how
much you draw these obstacles in
different ways what kinds of colors you
know what if again I said this before
but what if the way that you arrange
these obstacles is actually some type of
image or geometric pattern using Perlin
noise or perhaps actually creating an
actual maze using some of the major a
maze generation algorithm that you can
look at and boy why did it go to the top
left that time oh this is this because
it had nope this had no solution okay so
so I think I don't know if its third
part of the video should actually
anybody should ever actually watch it
but I guess if you're watching it then
it did happen and it is online and you
watched it but so I should connect
obstacles which are connected that's a
really good idea so I'm going to leave
that as an exercise for those of you
watching I'm making this video just to
give you some more thinking in possible
ways about we visualizing this in a
different way
and I would love to see what you make
out of it and so thanks for watching
