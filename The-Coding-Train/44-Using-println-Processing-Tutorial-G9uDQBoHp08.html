really a pause but I want to we're kinda
on this train of the fundamentals of
computation we're just plowing through
all these concepts but I want to stop
for a moment and just talk about a
function and processing that I you might
not see in a lot of examples but it you
will never we want to use all the time
print L n or print line and it gets some
arguments here here's the thing you know
your stuff is going to go wrong all the
time
you're gonna write some code you're
running it's gonna have an era date or
to fix the error that you can run if
it's not gonna do what you expected it
to do it you're gonna feel sad and
stressed out and you know you'll get
some tea and you'll relax in your last
good friend and things will eventually
be okay but there is a process there
about figuring out and this is really
what I want to say is that it's very
different the scenario where your code
doesn't run and you get an error because
you're the typo and your code runs there
are no errors but it doesn't do what you
imagined it to do and there's lots and
lots of debugging or witch debugging
techniques to sort of get the bugs out
of your program there's a lot of
strategies for doing that that hopefully
will see as I make these videos and you
know if there's any good thing about me
not rehearsing or planning any of these
videos hopefully I'll make mistakes as a
kind of doing examples and we'll see
some debugging during the course of
these videos but um when we haven't
gotten very far yet so we're not really
ready for all the tools we might have
but this is a tool for sort of figuring
out when something goes wrong that you
might want to have at your disposal
right now so let's look at what this
does the first thing that I should just
say is that if you have so you can put
anything in here I could write in quotes
the word hello and this will print hello
to Processing's message console where is
the message console right there's like
the tool bar up here
you have some code you've written
there's a little there's a place down
here where those errors appear right
where messages spit out if something
goes wrong with your program you can
print stuff too down there yourself it's
not part of the application window but
it's extra information as the program is
running so you could put a string of
characters in there you could put a
number
there but you could also do something
like this print Ln Circle X and you will
see the value of circlex print it out
down there why would this be useful so
let's go over here and look at the
program I this is what we've been
working on it's a it's a program that
draws a circle on the screen with an
initial location and maybe that circles
X location changes and if we run it we
can look at and see like oh there's no
circle what's going on I have a variable
called circle X I'm drawing the ellipse
of circle X and I have this line of code
but I don't see the circle so obviously
this is a canned scenario that I created
it perhaps you can even just look at
this and already see what the problem is
but let's pretend that you can't so one
strategy we have is to say print Ln
circle X and when I run this program now
we can see down here look the message
console all these values are printing
out this is the valid current value of
circlex now we look at this and we know
instantly okay I know why I'm not seeing
it on the screen the value of circlex
are some really high negative number
there's no negative pixels on the screen
crossings like pretending to draw it way
off so that's why we don't see it that's
what's broken okay so how now that gives
us a clue at least to figuring out what
the problem is now I could guess like
well maybe I should comment out this
line of code and run it again what's the
value of circlex oh it's zero all the
time that makes sense
that was its initial value and so this
line of code but somehow be making it
negative of course I'm adding a random
number between negative two and zero so
I'm never incrementing it by a positive
number
Circle X starts at zero and only ever
gets to be negative what I meant to do
was say not between negative two and
zero
but between zero and two and now I run
my program oh it's on the screen it's
moving and I see that the value of
circlex is now positive so this is just
I I mean this is a really quick video
just to show you that this is a tool
that's available to you you might kind
of practice with it you can do
interesting things like you can actually
say put a string of characters in here
with a plus sign so if I write the code
like this this isn't adding but in the
case of print line we're going to see
more about this when we learn about
strings later we want to print line
circle X : and then the value of circlex
so whoops so if I run it we can see
that's what's being printed out now down
there Circle X : and this is useful if
you want to print multiple values out
and you need to label them and you can
go all sorts of crazy with this and I
would I could turn off stop recording
and then just make lots of pretty like
elaborate print line statements on my
own because I enjoy doing that but I
don't think you need to worry too much
about this most of the step you doing
right now you're going to be able to fix
and solve through trial and error kind
of creating these simple programs but
this is just a quick little video to
show you about print line and hopefully
that was useful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
