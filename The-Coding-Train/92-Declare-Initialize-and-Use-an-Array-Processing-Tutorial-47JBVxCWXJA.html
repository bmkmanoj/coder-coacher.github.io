everybody okay um so we kind of had a
little bit of a little trip up there
before but here we are we've returned
this is the moment this is employment
we're going to actually use an array in
our code so here's the thing remember a
while back video something linked to it
down here in the magic linking internet
system that we learned about a few steps
when we wanted to have a variable in our
program we first had to declare the
variable that involved the name and the
type then we had to initialize the
variable that involved giving it its
initial value then you know we wanted to
use the variable I suppose we said maybe
at the time so that's kind of optional
but what's the point of declaring and
initializing a variable if you're not
going to use it so we actually what we
want to now look at doing is the same
thing with an array and we kind of did
that here we we declared the array it's
a array called numbers of type integer
and it's an array because we put the
brackets in here we initialized it by
giving it this list of values enclosed
inside of curly brackets and separated
by commas we didn't get to use yet
that's what I want to get to in this
particular video the thing is this was
kind of like I don't know maybe this was
a mistake for me to actually even show
this to you because this is a little bit
misleading this is reasonable I mean
this is correct it works syntactically
it's correct but this is kind of
somewhat rarely used when we are about
to make a list of bubbles do we know are
we going to actually set if we want a
thousand of them are we gonna have a
thousand somehow bubble objects
separated by commas if we need ten
thousand numbers are we going to list
ten thousand numbers separated by commas
no there are some instances where you
might hard code in the values of an
array but for the most part what we
actually need is an additional step
which I'm going to put as 1a here for
arrays which is to create the array and
by create
I mean how long is it or maybe a better
way of standing that would be how many
spots right how many spots are in this
array 1 2 3 4 5 6 this array has a
length of 6 there are six values in this
array so a more common way of doing this
of Cree of declaring the array involves
also creating it like so this is okay
we're good we're good we're good we're
good we're good
this is step one now step one a we're
going to say dumbs equals a new int with
seven spots boy so you know here's the
thing I in something I know it's like
and and and you could make some you
could really complain now if you want to
do be saluting your rights
there's a lot of confusing syntax here
let's simplify this even further steps
one and one a most commonly you would do
in one fell swoop I didn't just like we
say index equals 7 so let's rewrite this
sometimes would be nice if there was a
face right there and I could see whether
you were getting this or not because
today I feel like a little bit of
spinning in the wind here but I think
I'm just not my train of thought isn't
as clear ok int nums equals new int 7
boy 7 let's look pick a different number
let's say there's 10 spots okay what
have we done this is all steps 1 and 1a
look how redundant and weird this looks
but let's try to unpack it for a moment
this is the name of my variable of my
array that's the name of my array this
is the type of the array what type is it
it's going to have integers in it this
is indicating it's an array and not just
a single variable it's a list and this
over here is saying how
there are going to be ten spots now it
seems redundant what am i if I were to
translate this into English I would say
I hereby declare that I will have an
integer array called nums and there I
will create ten integers right so we why
it seems redundant that we have to say
int
twice but that's just how it works we
need to create a list of 10 integers and
store it in a variable of type array of
integers that's what's going on so this
hopefully will become more fluid to you
as you start to use it over and over
again but the question is what are
what's in the array right now the moment
that this happens we now have 1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 I should be
able to see that correctly okay
so what's actually in there a whole lot
of zeros because the default value for
an integer is 0 just like if I had only
set up here int X semicolon if this is
all I say int X semicolon the default
value for that variable is going to be a
0 so this moment we're at we're only
here at step 1 a we now need to get to
step 2 initialize step 3 use well when
we want to initialize a variable we
would say x equals 0 or when we wanted
to use a variable we would say you know
line X Y you know 10 10 or something and
we're using that variable there so how
do we use the array here's the moment
where we stopped talking about the whole
array we only really talk about the
whole array at the moment of its birth
we say hey I'm going to make this array
it's going to have ten spots in it go
forth into the world then be an array
now we want to talk about individual
elements of the array and the elements
of the array are referred to by index
number there are 10 things and you might
say
okay thing number one thing number two
thing number three thing number four
five six seven eight nine ten this is
not the case the indices of an array
start at zero zero one two three four
five six seven eight nine there are ten
spots and the index values range from
zero to nine this is very very crucial
this is a very crucial detail of
everything you're going to do the fact
that you always want to count from zero
into Jersey and nonzero numbes and x one
numbs index two so if I wanted to
initialize one of them I would say numbs
index 4 equals 132 what's just happened
there let's go look at our array let's
find index 4 and let's set its value to
132 let's say I wanted to initialize the
first one numbs index zero equals
negative three what happens there I've
put negative three here let's say I want
to use one of them I'm going to draw a
point from nums index 1 and nums index 2
what have I just done
I've drawn something at the point zero
zero because those are the values
currently in the array so actually using
an array is identical to using a single
variable X x equals zero line X Y the
only thing is now we have to refer to
which element of that array so remember
we have to declare the array we have to
give it a type and we have to specify an
array with the brackets we have to say
how long that array is going to be after
that we just need to assign values to
individual elements and we can use the
individual elements all refer to their
index the index values start at 0 and
end at the length of the array minus 1
so an array with a hundred elements
would have index values from 0 to 99 an
array with 14 elements would have index
values from 0 to 13 ok so we're nearing
the end of this video but I want to take
all of this knowledge
and apply it well actually you know what
I don't want to do it I'm gonna give you
this as an exercise and then I'm gonna
we're gonna start this in the next video
no yes shoot really help it by plants
with us in advance see the thing is
maybe what I'll do is just look at all
these videos and then go back and redo
them all and I'll sort of have planned
in advance I'm probably just incapable
of that anyway yeah I think we were out
of time so let me actually give you this
as an exercise so this is kind of a bit
of a challenging one what I would say to
you is looking at this syntax what if
you replaced int with bubble could you
turn this sketch here instead of having
bubble b1 b2 to have an array called
bubbles and we're certainly going to get
to that that's something we're going to
do I think you know it's funny I think
we're gonna do that in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
