session seven of programming from A to Z
on this YouTube channel of mine that has
an undefined name at the moment but
someday it might have a defined name so
what I'm asking for you to do as a
homework exercise for this particular
session on grammars specifically
context-free grammars is essentially to
write a computer well there's a lot of
things you could do but if you're
looking for something have a computer
program write your own story and write
that story differently each time so you
can see this one example that was
written by up this is written by a five
year old and an eight year old together
collaboratively and you could and using
the tracery grammar so that would that
might be a first thing that you start
find this example linked to in this
video and modify the story um really I
think one thing to think about is like
how much variation can you can you embed
into the grammar can the story sometimes
only be one sentence long and sometimes
be you know hundreds or thousands of
words long so think about this sort of
like how you might really explore
variety and parameterize the Festiva
know were to use the the the way that
the grammar works how nested are
unnecessary
so you can think about writing a story
the other thing that grammars are
particularly good at context-free
grammars are generating text that fits
into a very sort of prescriptive pattern
so one of my favorite BOTS on Twitter is
the art assignment bot and you can skip
the exercise that I'm talking about and
you can just do this one which is from
42 minutes ago construct a wood carving
researching the history of embosses due
on Thursday May 25th 2017 or build a
photograph about tools due on Tuesday
November 2nd so this you can see you can
really I don't know that this is made
with a context-free grammar but you
could imagine describing the grammar for
this so if you were to create on you
know a spell book I think it's a classic
scenario that there are some tracery
examples that do this creating a recipe
book or what types of kind of statements
defined statements the other thing that
I think is you know what I've done in
these two sessions is I've showed you
Markov chains here's what a Markov chain
is and here's what a Markov chain does
here's what a context-free grammar is
and here's what a context-free grammar
does so on the one hand and exercises
just take my exact examples and produce
output but I think really the magic of
project happens in the spaces in between
so maybe a Markov chain is just a little
piece of one word inside of some text
you're generating and the context-free
grammar just creates an overall
structure also you know interfaces with
an API and so how is it that these could
be a piece of the project and also
really in thinking about what's your
presentation so in the one hand if you
look at any of my examples you know this
is just generating little sentences but
who is the character that's speaking you
know what's the context is it a Twitter
bot is it a web page there's a wonderful
project in my class today that was
looking at generating fake election
ballots and so using the visual language
of a system that you're trying to
emulate to sort of spark the idea in the
viewer in either a playful way or
subversive way or to make a statement or
just to tell a story I think there's a
lot of possibilities in thinking about
the context and the visual design
elements that are surround how and where
you're generating that text the other
thing that I think is worth really
noting here is that both with Markov
chains and with context-free grammars
that words or characters what is it
what's the sequence of the grim what is
the grammar describing is it describing
language is the language English is it
an for another language or is it musical
notes or is it designs is do you have a
context-free grammar that builds a
design out of shapes and color how might
you explore something like that so I
encourage you to look at these examples
try tracery try rita you know as an
exercise you might try programming that
recursive algorithm on your own and see
what types of results you could get okay
so I hope you enjoyed session 7 and you
can share anything you make in the
comments or at Schiffman on twitter and
of course you know I always sort of plug
that if you feel so inclined you can
join the the patreon page and there's a
slack channel too to discuss and ask
questions ok so see you in a future
session video whatever and talk to you
soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
