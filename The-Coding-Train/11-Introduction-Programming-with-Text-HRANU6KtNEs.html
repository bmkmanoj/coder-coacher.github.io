playlist called programming from A to Z
and this playlist is going to be it will
be as I make it a lot of videos that are
going to follow this uh it's a syllabus
course that I'm teaching at a program
called ITP at Tisch School of the Arts
New York University called programming
from A to Z and in this video if you're
really just interested in the technical
content you can just skip ahead and stop
watching this video but in this video I
want to just kind of talk about where
the ideas for this course came from some
of my inspiration for putting the
material together for this course and
what my goals for it are so what and
kind of like who what do you need to
have in advance before you start
watching this sequence and I will
mention that a lot of the videos that I
make I intend for them to be kind of
standalone videos that could be Maude
you know put placed then you could kind
of come to you on them their own but I'm
going to sequence them in a way that
I'll give you a little bit of a
narrative over the course of this fall
it is September or something 2016 that's
when this video is being recorded but
maybe you are an alien robot of the
future watching it and wondering about
this strange earth of species on the
internet if the internet still exists
anyway okay I uh
so okay so let me talk a little bit
about where this the ideas for this
course came from so I think this was
probably at least ten years ago if not
more I was at the University of
Pennsylvania sitting in on a poetry
class you might wonder why was I sitting
in on a poetry class that's a story for
another day
but someone named Nick Montfort I was
giving a presentation
Nick Montfort is a poet and artist and
professor author who has a recent book
out actually called explored Tory
programming I don't see it on his
website it's a wonderful book that I've
been actually reading as a resource for
this course as well and Nick was giving
a presentation to this poetry class
about computational techniques in
writing and
I mean it was more sophisticated and
interesting than that but I'll loosely
say that it was so it was for an
audience of people who not necessarily
familiar with programming and algorithms
but our poets and writers and looking at
historical examples and new techniques
in writing using computational methods
and at the time I was kind of a recent
ITP graduate I think or current ITP
student I don't remember and I thought
huh this is interesting so much of my
time this was early in the days of
processing so much of my time is spent
thinking about programming for motion
and animation and I had it really
considered this idea of programming for
text reading a program that reads text
in a program that generates text out and
so at the time I actually decided to
work on some materials for a course
called programming from A to Z and
strangely enough I taught this course in
Java which in many ways a kind of
horrific elite arrabal idea but Java was
a programming language that I was
learning and familiar with at the time
it also is the was is the basis of the
creative coding environment processing
and so I was aligning some stuff between
those two environments and so I taught
this course and I believe this was like
2006 or 7 or something like that it
could look it up if someone resourceful
on the internet could find the old
syllabus for it probably and so a lot of
the ideas for this course came out of
this presentation that I saw from Nick
Montfort now interestingly enough at the
time Alison parish was a student at ITP
I believe she was actually a student in
his class and when she graduated from
ITP I talked with her I don't remember
exactly how this about starting a new
class at ITP called Rita in which she
came up with called reading and writing
electronic text so Alison Parrish is a
huge inspiration for this course as well
if you're not familiar with her work
with generative text and performance and
Twitter bots and a lot of things you
should be familiar with and so Allyson
teachers of course taught with Python
called reading and writing electronic
text a lot of the materials can be found
on her website so Allyson really took a
lot of the ideas from programming from a
z and made a much better and more
interesting course using a much more
appropriate programming language and
environment Python to working with text
the focus of her course however is is
really not about I would say I mean I'm
I could be wrong about this but just to
make the argument for argument's sake
about really focusing on what poetry
generative text generative poetry about
the sort of pour out text in text output
not necessarily about interactive
systems as related to text not about
server-side programming client-side
programming things that happen in the
browser so what I decided to do was
recently after she had started this
course at ITP was to revive programming
from A to Z and so now the course is
once again back and it's all about
programming with text text in text out
but with I would say an appropriate
language meaning job script sure a lot
of a lot of innovative and new work with
data analysis and text is happening in
Python and there are tons of natural
language processing libraries and data
libraries for processing for Python but
if you want to make things happen in the
web browser where users can enter text
receive text back participate in an eye
on attractive system javascript is a
language that is useful to make all this
stuff happen in the web browser so so
this is really where the ideas for the
course came from now I am going to just
briefly now so that's kind of a bit
about your long-winded than I'd hoped
but a bit about where some of the ideas
for the course came from now I want to
talk the next thing I want to talk about
is my goals for the course and just so
I'm not so I'm standing somewhere
different with a little visual variety
here I have a couple fundamental goals
one is programming and algorithms and
particular programming I'm talking about
a Java Script here so if you are a
beginner JavaScript programmer if you
maybe just took a single course in p5.js
you know a little bit about JavaScript
this is a course where you can improve
move and expand your knowledge I want to
talk about things like what's this
prototype thing what's this key word
what's a closure
what's an anonymous function all of
these kind of aspects to JavaScript
programming that you might not find in
an introductory creative coding course
so I want part of the course to be able
to get augment programming skills but I
want that thing not just to be for the
sake of you know programming itself but
to have a kind of conceptual basis a
creative output for you and this is the
other aspect of the course so I want you
to think you know creative new ways to
think about computational am I really
writing this down I am really writing
this down out computational output and
specifically text-based
output Oh an input right so maybe you've
taken a computer science course or some
other JavaScript course and the focus is
on web development for professional work
for getting a job at a start-up or maybe
the course is about algorithms so you
can figure out the absolute fastest way
to sort a list of numbers these are not
you know they're they're aspects to that
those ideas that might be in a course
like this but my goal is really for you
to discover new and creative ideas and a
generate creative projects playful
useless experiments from this course
because I believe I think I know that
that you know number one making art and
playful experiments is an enjoyable way
of interfacing with the world it can
bring meaning to people's lives but also
I think practical tools and new
discoveries come out of useless
impractical explorations so that's kind
of a goal for this course to augment
skills and and kind of inspire your
creativity okay so back to over here I
want to briefly run you over what the
topics will be as I go over them from
week to week this week I want I'm just
going to kind of introduce ideas for the
course I am
asking the students of the course to use
github pages as a way of publishing
their work although certainly not
required I want to look at Dom
manipulation in p5.js and kind of
compare that to other Dom manipulation
frameworks and libraries you might think
of I want to do a tutorial about just
the string object in JavaScript and then
I want to look at how you get text input
from a user in the browser via a text
box a uploading a file and I'm going to
do a couple coding challenges around
making a webpage that generates kind of
found random poetry and I'll talk about
an assignment for you guys that's what's
going to happen today
regular expressions I'm so excited like
my favorite topic ever cuz laughs like a
complete loser no no no if you love
regular expressions you know I am a
loser you watching this are clearly not
won lose are such a terrible word that's
a nice sound like I hate that word
nobody anyway edit this part out and
where's my uh okay but uh regular
Russians it's a topic that I love it's
an amazing tool puzzle exciting crazy
programming language kind of unto itself
thing that allows you to manipulate do
wonderful things with text I want to
look at how you can get text from data
sources different API so I want to look
at word Nick I think I've looked at word
Nick and other video tutorials what I
want to look at it deeper more deeply I
want to look at how you can get users to
fill out a Google spreadsheet use that
as the input to your program ah
server-side programming is a priority
for me so there's a lot of things that
make sense to do with only client-side
programming and p5.js but I want to look
at node in particular Twitter bots
unfortunately I have a whole set of
video tutorials already made about
Twitter bots so we'll see what I can add
to that for this week and then I kind of
want to run you through the classics so
my goal at hope for you is doing
creative ideas in text analysis and text
generation but I want to look at how
some of these kind of classic text
generation and analysis algorithms work
so word counting is kind of the
fundamental building block to all text
analysis so I'm going to look at a word
counting program tf-idf which is like a
fancy term for
figuring out how to glean keywords from
a text based on word counting I might
look at dasyam analysis if I can get the
courage for Bayesian analysis and also
there are a lot of node packages that
will do a lot of this stuff for you that
I'll examine text generation I want to
build a Markov chain from scratch I'll
talk more about what that is but a
probability based system for generating
text I want to look at grammars ah
there's a wonderful thing that I'll just
mention if you're not familiar with
another work that I find really
inspirational tracery by tracery by the
way that should not say tracery by
tracery somebody pull request fix this
it should say by galaxy kate so galaxy
kate kate compton on github and galaxy
kate comm is a wonderful artist
programmer a person who has built a
story generation library for a
javascript called tracery which i'll
examine later as a tutorial maybe as i
start to figure out ways of getting
guests maybe I can invite Kate to appear
to talk about tracery whereas I back
here and then look at code for building
something called a context-free grammar
so language the term grammar might be
familiar to you programming languages
have a grammar right function name
followed by parenthesis followed by a
bunch of arguments separated by commas
if you're missing a comma that's a
grammatical error a syntax error so
rather than looking at language and
seeing how it fits into a grammar if you
can design a grammar and generate
language from that what kind of results
do you get and then also I want to make
sure I look at chromic make some
tutorials on Chrome extensions I'm going
to show you a one of my favorite artists
addy wagenknecht addy wagging necked is
a wonderful artist who makes amazing
work that you should become familiar
with and she made a Chrome extension
called girls versus get I'm going to
just pull this up here and you can see
some of the things some of the features
that it does every username on github is
replaced with a generic female username
every Gravatar someplace
a chart of a woman or female type image
so this is something that you can do
with a Chrome extension you can have
control over a user's browser and their
browsing experience to kind of
experiment with all strange and
alternate ways of viewing the universe
of the web and experiencing obviously
this can be used for productivity tools
and you probably have Chrome extensions
for things like Oh pocket which allows
you to save you all your links but how
what kind of strange ways can you do if
you you know take everybody's uh every
time a you know noun is on a web page
and replace it with a food item this
came from an idea of somebody had in
class so you're just reading web pages
to make yourself hungry all the time so
creative ideas working with Chrome
extensions is something that I want to
pursue so this is kind of the trajectory
of the course goals for the course
trajectory of the course and after this
video is done I'm going to make the
first few videos for this first week on
some of the material now here's a quick
here's something I will mention to you
you people of the Internet can simply
just find these videos on YouTube you
could write in the YouTube comments if
you have questions and I try to answer
them when I have time and other people
answer them as well and I hope you will
enjoy and watch them if you want to
participate in this course in a slightly
Augmented way I will point you to
patreon.com slash coding rainbow or
coding rainbow comm you can subscribe to
my patreon feed which is a crowdfunding
system and with that you will get an
invitation to a slack channel where you
can ask questions about the course and
post your work in assignments and have a
peer group of people discussing and
giving you feedback so if you're
interested this is an experiment I'm
trying I'm teaching the physical class
for ITP students at New York University
I'm teaching an online version of this
class for free on YouTube it is ad
supported there will be ads for these
videos I'm mixed feelings about that but
I'm doing that right now for a little
bit of revenue there's expenses
associated with making this and time and
then I am also experimenting with a
crowdfunding platform to allow people a
certain additional form of interaction
so my kind of philosophy on online
education right now is free content paid
interaction
and but mostly I'm doing this because I
enjoy it and I enjoy discovering a new
audience and bringing new ideas and
doing we are dancing from time to time
and ringing my bell and all sorts of
weirdness so um so thanks for watching
this introduction I'm sure there are
lots of things that I miss saying ah I
thought of something I wanted to mention
two other in the admin a link to all
these things in the in the description
of this video I want to mention two
other big inspirations one is Lynch
Ernie who does a lot of work with data
analysis and presentations and another
is Darius cos Amy also known as tiny
subversions who is an Internet artist
prolific creator of incredibly strange
and interesting Twitter BOTS basically
you know I am NOT I have to admit
something I am not really a Twitter bot
maker I'm a person who makes how to make
Twitter bot tutorials and I put it and
so if you're looking for inspiration and
ideas and other types of materials
Darius is great I want to point out both
a Lynch Ernie and Darius Kazemi have
2016 talks from the IO Festival in
Minneapolis so I would recommend you
find those in all of these are great but
if I go here to see all I can find
Darius
oops actually okay anyway you can find
them I'll link to them in the
description but both of those are highly
relevant Linds journeys talk and Darius
cos Amyas talk from IO as kind of
starter material get you thinking about
ideas of things you might want to make
if you're following along with this
course okay thank you for watching and
stay tuned and in the next video I'll be
showing you some other stuff okay thanks
