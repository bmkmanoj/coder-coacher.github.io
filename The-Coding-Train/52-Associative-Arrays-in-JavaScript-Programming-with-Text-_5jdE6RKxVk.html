about something called how to clean your
glasses oh there's a horrible smudge on
my glasses that's what I look like
without glasses by the way I'm gonna
talk about something called an
associative array forever bore
associative arrays will be associated
with me cleaning my glasses but what are
you gonna do
what is it associative right okay let's
talk about first and and why do we need
one so first of all the context here is
I want to do a word counting application
meaning I want to have a list of every
word that's in a document and a number
associated with that word a list of
pairs of things word number word number
key value key value this is sort of
where I'm going but first before I even
get to there let's talk about what is an
array which if you're watching this
video hopefully you are familiar with if
not don't worry life will be okay I
might refer you to one of my videos
about arrays but an array ultimately is
just a list of things an ordered list of
stuff I'll get as markers excellent so
maybe I might have some numbers like 3 4
19 negative 7 29 now this is an ordered
list meaning every single number has an
index and when you count with arrays and
in programming generally speaking you
start counting with 0 0 1 2 3 4 so here
is my array 3 4 90 negative 729 ordered
in order 0 1 2 3 4 so this is a regular
array a list an ordered list an
associative array also by the way if
you're hearing a strange buzzing in your
ear it's not just you it's construction
that's happening right outside the
window over there oh I'm recording this
video but this is life in New York City
people like to complain about
construction happening in their backyard
but if you live here yeah signed up for
it ok what I'm talking about now
somebody edit that out
ok so
associative array let's say I have these
same numbers I'm just gonna draw them
like this because even though I'm kind
of giving them a spatial orientation it
appears they might have some sort of
order this new thing that I talked about
is associative array is that really
ordered so the way that I access if this
is called array this is a variable
storing that the way that I would access
the number 19 would be array index 2
with an associative array the I and this
is this is an associative array I'm
associating numbers with numbers but we
really what I was talking about the
associative array is being able to
associate a key that is not just an
index with a particular number and that
key in many cases is a string and all
the examples I'm going to show you is a
string of course the key can be
something other than a string by string
of a text but so the idea is here what
if instead of referring to each of these
by their index I could name them
so this one is rainbow and this one is
unicorn and this one is purple and this
one is heart oh I ran out of my happy
words and this one is a happy happy
little associative array for all of you
keep wanting me to make bob ross
references so this is the idea what if I
could instead of having an ordered list
with indexes what if I could name all
these elements and so if this is my
associative array I'm gonna write this
sock my associative array I would say
associative index unicorn so I could put
the name in square brackets to indicate
that's how I want to look up this
particular value so why is this useful
now I would like to I think I need to
make a like a separate side video
related to this one that I'm doing right
now to discuss when would you use an
ordered list and when would you use an
associative array and in this case of
word counting you can clearly see why I
might want to use an associative array
because I want to keep track of words
and the number of times they appear if
you give a document okay I have to just
sort of Zen out for a second let's just
say what I wanted to do was pair words
with numbers I could say something like
unicorn : 16 comma rainbow colon 2 comma
heart : 10 so you could see how this is
like a nice list of key value pairs this
being the key to look up a particular
value 16 let's put some more syntax on
this like oh I'll just put a curly
bracket here and I'll put a curly
bracket here and I'll say var dictionary
equals this well if you're looking at
this what you'll notice is oh that's the
syntax of a JavaScript object so a
javascript object is exactly this I
think I have a video that talks about
what is a JavaScript literal object I
think of what I say is it's a collection
of name value pairs so in fact we can
simply use the fact that a JavaScript
object natively is a collection of name
value pairs to act as a dictionary now
there are some tricks that I'm gonna
have to employ to make it usable how do
I sort its order javascript objects
don't actually have an order to them or
how do i iterate over all the
possibilities and we're gonna see that
as i build out the coding challenge to
do the word counting application but
let's just examine there's one piece of
this which is kind of crucial that i
want to examine so let me go back over
to the code for a second and the code
there is no code but i'm just gonna go
over here to a browser instance because
i'm gonna work just in the developer
console to show you what i mean so let's
say i want to create this object called
dictionary so the first thing I can do
if I want to create an empty object is I
can say open curly bracket close curly
bracket
make that a little bit bigger for you
open curly braket close curly bracket
now I have an object which is empty so
what if I want to say the number of
times the word rainbow appeared in that
dictionary is 12 well you know I could
say Dictionary dot rainbow equals 12 and
now if I look at the dictionary you can
see let me just do this again you can
see look the object now has the word
rainbow associated with the number 12
now let's say I'm trying to track what
out what I actually want to look for is
the number of times a writer uses a
contraction but I say that right like
can't or don't versus the sort of longer
way of writing that out cannot or do not
so I'm gonna say Dictionary dot can't
equals 15 right because I may use the
the author that I'm analyzing used use
the word can't
15 times a uncaught syntax error invalid
or unexpected token so this seems to
have broken my idea right because that's
an invalid variable name but I actually
think I might want to keep track of its
count right I want to know I also might
want to know how many times did the area
code you know nine one seven appear in a
text that's not a valid variable name
either I don't think right so if I come
back over here and say dictionary dot
nine one seven equals it appeared twenty
five times that's also invalid so one of
the things that's really important here
in how things work in JavaScript by the
way just if I'm gonna do something like
wow crazy juggling so for no reason okay
is that you can access the properties of
an object in two ways I can say
Dictionary dot heart equals fifteen or I
can say dictionary string heart equals
fifteen
these are equivalent the heart property
of dictionary has the value of fifteen
or the heart property in quotes in
square brackets of dictionary
the value 15 the question becomes well
this maybe looks a little syntactically
more concise and it might be what you're
familiar with I make a particle system
particle dot X it's 20 a particle table
Y a particle top speed but this is
actually something this is the syntax
will want to use for word counting
applications why because this will work
with something like Kant or 907 right
you we can make any string inside here
and set it as a valid value of the
dictionary and in fact even more
important what you're gonna see that I
need to do in the word counting coding
challenge is I'm gonna need to have a
variable I'm reading a text in so I
don't actually have that string in my
code it's in a variable so if I have a
variable name I can't say Dictionary dot
the variable name I have to say
dictionary bracket the variable name if
it's a string in that variable let me
make that more clear by showing you this
a couple steps through again here in the
console so first let's confirm that it
works if I say Dictionary nine one seven
equals fifteen that works and I say
dictionary can't now notice I switch to
using double quotes I switch using
double quotes because there's a single
quote in can't and so it'll get confused
if I use single quotes and a single
quote but I can just use double quotes
and it will fix that problem I can do
this and now let's look at the
dictionary and you can see look what
it's got it's got nine one seven and
it's got Kant in it so you can see here
that it's able to keep those as names of
the properties if I pass them in on a
string now let me talk about what I mean
by a variable let's say I say var word
equals did I do unicorn yet I don't
think so
var word equals unicorn well what
happens if I say Dictionary dot word
equals 99 right what's gonna be in there
is it gonna be 99 associated with the
string unicorn or is it gonna be 99
associated with something called word
let's see what happens okay now if I
look at dictionary unicorns not in there
word it thinks word
is the string right it doesn't know that
word is that variable like it's like I
can't even make explain it cuz it just
doesn't make sense in my head even
though it seems like maybe that would
work I have to use that other syntax
because what I want to do is say for
word equals heart then I could say
dictionary bracket word now it's going
to evaluate the property of that
variable as part and be able to set that
number and I could say a hundred and I
can look at my dictionary again and we
can see they're all all the words and
their associated counts heart is in
there at 100 and that's the thing I'm
gonna need to do because I'm reading in
a text and pairing the values with it
okay so I think this defines basically
the idea of what an associative array is
and how you can use one in JavaScript
now how you iterate over it how you
might sort it how you kind of like mess
with it these are things that I will
show you in the next video which is
going to be a coding challenge of doing
a word concordance okay thanks for
watching and see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
