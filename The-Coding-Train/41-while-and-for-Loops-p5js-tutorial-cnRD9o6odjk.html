something called a repeat loop this is a
essential control structure in
programming that you need to do all
sorts of things if you've been working
with code and drawing it's probably
become recently immediately clear what
you might need a repeat loop before and
I have a demonstration of that right
here so if you see this canvas year
there are 1 2 3 4 5 6 circles there each
circle is drawn with a single call to
the ellipse function and this works fine
you want 6 circles on the screen call
the ellipse function 6 times but if you
want to have 60 circles on the screen or
600 circles on the screen or spaced them
closer do more stuff with them having an
individual line of code for the same
thing that's repeated over and over
again is certainly not the route that
you want to go so this is exactly what a
repeat loop is for and I said that a
repeat loop is a control structure and
in a previous video I looked at another
control structure known as a conditional
statement so that control structure
looked like this if boolean expression
open curly bracket close curly bracket
and if this is true this code is
executed I'm going to add something once
and then we go to the next line of code
this is how this particular control
structure worked the if the conditional
statement control structure so the
control structure of a loop is written
just like the if statement but with a
different keyword besides if and now
there's actually two ways of doing it
the first way that I'm going to show you
looks very much like the if statement
its while boolean expression while this
is true continue to do this code over
and over and over and over and over
again so I want to think about this
control structure and I'm going to add
some things to the code and we're going
to add this control structure then into
the code so these are really identical
in their syntax and form the differences
are if here while here if this is true
do this while this is true continue to
execute this code over and over again
which opens up a little bit of a
dangerous fact it's possible your
program could get stuck inside this loop
and this is something we're going to
have to deal with immediately right now
as we start to work on this problem so
come on over here so let's look at this
code again so one thing you'll notice
about this code is I didn't use any
variables so I think it would be
advantageous to use a variable and what
I'm going to do is I'm going to start a
variable and I'm going to call it X x
equals zero now I declared it up on the
top a might in the previous videos that
I made in all the examples the variables
have always been declared at the top
this is because there it's it's the I've
been using these variables as so-called
global variables meaning I could just
use them anywhere in my code and the
program remembers then over and over
again forever and ever
here is the case right now we're
actually what I want to do is just use a
variable just for this section of the
code and I don't need to remember it any
other time when mouse is pressed or back
and set up or anything like that so
actually I'm going to take this
opportunity to show you something called
a local variable and if you declare a
variable inside of a function I'm inside
this draw function this variable right
now is a local variable it's only
available for the purposes of this draw
function okay
so now what do I want to do I want to
put X here and I could say X plus 50 X
plus 100 I could keep doing that and
we'd have the same program I just used X
instead of 0 but what I actually want to
do is show you what if I just have X
everywhere if I have X X in all of these
lines of code now what do I have I have
one circle at 0 because I drew the same
ellipse at 0 0 0 0 0
over and over again so what if I were to
now add after each one x equals x plus
50 so let's move X by 50 after each
ellipse and I'm also going to do
something I'm going to add some line
breaks whoops wrong place I'm going to
add some line breaks if I can manage
this just to sort of look at it to see
what is repeated okay so and let's add a
line break here okay okay so let's look
at this now I have these chunks ellipse
then add 50 ellipse then add 50 ellipse
then add 50 ellipse then add 50 all of
these blocks of code are actually
identical right like let me let me
delete them and just show you what I
mean right
so now we run this program one ellipse
now let me take these two lines of code
and just do paste paste paste paste
paste paste paste paste paste auto
format now I have all these ellipse
there so this now now now we really have
the same exact lines of code X like just
over and over and over again
there's got to be a way to perform those
lines of code over and over again I just
want to say ellipse at X etc and then I
want to say x equals x plus 50 this is
exactly what I want to do I just want to
do this over and over again while
something is true okay so let's think
about that we need to figure out when do
I stop doing this over and over again if
I just wrote true inside here this would
loop would execute forever and the
program would never would never stop and
get stuck there we'd never see anything
on the screen what is my exit condition
well there is no answer this question
it's kind of up to you and what am i why
am I even here drawing circles on the
screen I'll never know but presumably
you have a reason for learning
programming and you have an idea for
something you want to make in this case
no I can make up something I want to
let's say I want to keep draw circles
till I get to the edge of the window so
what is my exit condition I my exit
condition is this is the canvas the exit
condition I want to stop looping
when X is greater than with right this
is what I want to stop looping but
remember the thing that in here is when
it's true that's not when I stop looping
that's when I continue looping so I want
to continue looping as long as X is less
than width so as long as X is less than
width I want to draw this ellipse over
and over and over again okay so let's
come over here and see that so now I can
take all this nonsense and just leave
this important part these are the two
lines of code that I want to repeat over
and over and over again while X is still
on the screen do this draw a circle move
over draw a circle move over draw a
circle move over so now I can add while
X is less than width and then I need a
close curly bracket and again this is a
new block of code this while loop is a
new block of code it opens with the
curly bracket it ends with the curly
bracket and the convention is to indent
the inside just visually for human being
to be able to see it so now I'm going to
run this we can see there all the
ellipses now if you look at this you can
see it kind of the first one start to
deer on the last one doesn't start it
with that's simply because I have X is
less than width we could I don't know if
width is divisible by 50 I think it is I
could try less than equals and then I
kind of get that last one so the math
here matters like where's your exactly
your exit condition and that sort of
thing but now you can see I've drawn all
these circles so this is a good nice
start however somebody watching this
video somebody out there in the world
who may be watching this video is going
to say why are you bothering with this
while loop thing nobody ever uses a
while loop well I personally felt like
it was worth 5 minutes of our time your
time my time to look at the while loop
because it translates so nicely from
this if statement to Y so what happened
here if this is true do this once once
true do this and over and over again but
if you'll notice this particular while
loop has
three elements to it that I want to note
to you the first one is we start with
initializing a variable var x equals
zero the second thing is we test for an
exit condition X is less than or equal
to width and the third thing I want to
note is that we have this incrementation
operation X goes up by 50 so those three
elements are so common in loops that
there's an entire other looping
structure control structure called a for
loop that puts all those things together
as just one two three so I want to redo
this exact same program with a for loop
and show you what what I mean so we had
so let me erase all this so take me a
second think to yourself about something
so I had three things I had an
initialization var x equals zero I have
a boolean test is X less than with and
then at the end of the loop I had an
increment ation option operation x
equals x plus 50 so what I'm suggesting
to you is this is such a common kind of
loop that the loop you will most likely
use in almost all of your programs and I
would suggest you doing an exercise with
is a for loop for var x equals 0 X is
less than with X so I'm going to go off
of the screen equals x plus 50 can you
still see that parentheses curly bracket
okay so this is taking everything from
this while loop and condensing it so the
loop starts by initializing X every time
through the loop X goes up by 50 and
every time the loop finishes it checks
if the exit condition has been met in
which case it then exits the loop so we
can now go back to this program and I'm
going to what I'm actually going to do
is I'm going to leave this I'm going to
put this at all the circles at x equals
100 and I'm going to rewrite this same
loop down here with a for loop
so I don't need to paste it actually I'm
going to say for VAR x equals 0 X is
less than with x equals x plus 50 curly
braket and let me widen the editor here
so you can see the whole thing and then
all I need is the one line of code the
thing that I want to happen during this
counting increment is counting looping
operation which is that I want to draw
the ellipses I'm going to draw them at
300 so let's make these some color and
let's make these some other color and
let's run it so we can see oh and I I
guess I'll do the X less than or equals
for both of them and you can see now so
you can see both loops perform exactly
the same task this is a bit more
explicit because you can kind of read
the order more obviously start with x
equals 0
while it's less than with draw this
circle and go up by 50 but the exact
same thing is happening here and it's so
common that being able to condense this
into one line of code is something that
you might do now inevitably you're going
to see other examples around the
internet and one thing that I think I
should point out is this kind of
copyright operation x equals x plus 50
is also so common that programmers have
developed a shorthand for it which i
think is worth noting right now okay so
there is it's often you might see a line
of code like this x equals x plus 50
this line of code can be written as
shorthand as X plus equals 50 okay so
that's one thing to notice you might see
this in examples that you look at this
is certainly more explicit and more
long-winded but this is just as accurate
exact same operation the other thing you
might say is when you have the number
one x equals x plus 1 this is written
shorthand as X plus plus if you ever
thought about it there's a programming
language called C and there's a
programming language called C++ which is
like the next version of C that's not
exactly accurate but close enough but so
this is also such a convention that it
sort of made our way into kind of
vernacular speak I know whose
vernacular speak I don't even know what
vernacular means I really should have
stopped this video a while ago so this
is just a little tidbit you might see
that if I were to add that to this
example I would say I would change this
to x plus equals 50 and then I would run
it again and we have still the same
exact result so what I would say to you
is try to think try lines try rectangles
try to control your loops what if you
have things moving down or diagonally or
what if you could you change the color
like how would you have each one of
these shapes be a different color from
Bright to dark from dark to bright the
map function that I looked at in a
previous video could be relevant so try
using a repeat loop to create some
pattern of repeating shapes and the two
other videos I would like to make one is
I would like to look at a nested loop -
a loop within a loop to draw a grid
pattern and also I think I want to talk
about an array which is a list of
variables which goes hand-in-hand with a
loop so I need to make that video at
some point - thanks and this is the end
