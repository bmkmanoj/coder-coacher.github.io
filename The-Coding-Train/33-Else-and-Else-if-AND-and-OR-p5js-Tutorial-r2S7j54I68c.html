going to wrap up this discussion about
conditional statements in java script
and p5.js here so we've looked so far at
a conditional statement what's allowed
us to do it's allowed us to have
something have the draw loop executes
differently depending on something
that's happening in the code whether
it's where the users mouse is or we're
giving shape is on the screen it changes
direction or changes color this is this
has allowed us to create different paths
and have the program do different things
based on certain conditions that
evaluate to either true or false and
this is the essential topic here but
there are a few additional features to
the way that you can work with
conditional logic that allow for other
possibilities and the first one that I
want to show you is just the keyword
else so if you think about it you could
say if it's very hot you know turn on
the air-conditioning and I might add to
that statement if it's very hot turn on
the air-conditioning otherwise take a
nap now I don't know why this doesn't
make any sense but you get the idea this
idea of otherwise else is essentially
that otherwise so if I were to say
something like if this is what we're
familiar with if Mouse X is greater than
200 if this evaluates to true execute
this code and we know that if it's false
we don't execute the code that's in here
but what about in this other case of
otherwise else gives us an otherwise
else do this other code so we now
created this sort of like a sequence
nested block we have an open curly
bracket and a closed curly bracket and
then enough then an else and then
another open curly bracket in a close
curly bracket so what I want to do is go
find that previous example we made where
that I made where if the mouse gets over
the right-hand side of the screen the
the circle turns purple so now I don't
want to do is say like if it's on the
right-hand side of the screen have it
draw a circle or change the shape so I'm
going to based on if it's Susan else
that if it's on the right-hand side of
the screen do this otherwise do this
other thing
okay so this is where the else comes in
so let's look at that syntax now okay
over here so we can see this bit of code
right here this is where
our this is where our if statement is
and now I can I want to add an else
right here so all I need to do that is
type else and add another open curly
bracket and actually notice the editor
itself just filled in that second curly
bracket for me so you can see if this is
true do this code basically what we're
saying is if that's not true do this
other code and so I could have kept with
color but what I'm going to do is I'm
going to take this ellipse and put that
here and then I'm going to here I'm
going to say draw a rectangle so now we
can see and I'm going to zoom back out
we can see do this otherwise do that so
let's run this code and we can see okay
well right now the mouse is not greater
than 300 so when it starts we're
actually X I'm at the programs executing
that otherwise statement and as the
mouse moves over we've got the circle so
you can see that circle is turning into
a square based on where the mouse is
we've got this conditional logic okay
now there there's more to this than that
so in addition to having an else so one
thing I should know here is a
conditional statement you could only
ever have one if and one else but
there's something you can put in between
there if
mouse X is greater than 200 execute this
code now I could say otherwise execute
some other piece of code but I'm going
to say something different I'm going to
say otherwise if such-and-such else if
Mouse X is greater than 100 execute this
bit of code else if Mouse X is greater
than 50 execute this bit of code in all
other cases else execute this bit of
code so these if statements can actually
become this much longer piece of logic
where you're testing a whole bunch of
different conditions a kind of classic
example of this it doesn't really apply
to drawing in p5 but to sort of thinking
through logic is a program that grades
somebody so you could say if the grade
is greater than an if the grade is
greater than 90 assign the letter grade
a otherwise if it's greater than 80
assign the letter grade B otherwise if
it's greater than 70 C etc so you can
imagine there's a bunch of different
conditions that we're testing and you
have to start with it if you don't have
to start with an else but you can only
have one other otherwise in all other
cases and you can have as many else ifs
as you want in between so again the this
this idea absolutely makes a lot more
sense in the context of a practical
example and we can look at testing like
where the mouse is on the screen is it
here or is it here or is it here or is
it here which one of these conditions is
it met so I want to actually put this in
the code but I'm going to do it in a
slightly different way this is actually
correct but I'm going to put I'm going
to start with Mouse X greater than 50
then 100 then 200 and reverse this order
and it's not going to work and I want to
also discuss Y which is a key aspect
about how else--if works so this is a
really tricky interesting problem if you
haven't seen this before
ok so now I'm over here and I'm going to
add so I'm going to start with sorry
Mouse I really should have done color
here because now I have to like think of
foot or shapes but it's fine
so if Mouse
is greater than 50 a circle else--if
mouse X is greater than 150 do a
rectangle else--if Mouse X is greater
than 250 let's do a line and you know
what I'm going to do just because I'm
and then in all other cases do a point
300 200 okay so now we can see I've
strung together this conditional logic
and I'm gonna kind of try to zoom into
it a little bit to make it a little
bigger here you can see okay if the
mouse is greater than 50 otherwise if
it's greater than 150 otherwise if it's
greater than 250 otherwise draw points
so I should see either an ellipse a
rectangle a line or a points now this
isn't going to work so let's look at
your mind churning about why it's not
okay so there we go we've got a point
which makes sense in all other cases
right which is it's not greater than
fifty hundred fifty two hundred fifty
it's not greater than any of these we
should see a point so now when I get to
greater than fifty what do we get a
circle now I should get to greater than
150 a chévre rectangle or greater than
250 a line so why are these not why are
why am I not seeing a rectangular line
why why why this is sort of a key keep
distinction here so um one thing that's
true about this is that as soon as any
one of these evaluates to true the
program kicks out of the if statement
and goes to the next lines of code that
are below that is statement soon as
anyone about these evaluates to true it
doesn't check the next one so the order
of these is very very important only one
of these sections of code can be
executed not more than one if you want
more than one to be executed there's a
different way of doing it which I'll
mention afterwards but for a conditional
statement this is one whole statement
where if is joined with else if else if
and else so only one of these can be
evaluated so let's go back to here and
look at this again let's think about if
mouse X has the value of 275 well in our
minds what we want to happen is 275 is
greater than 250 so we should see that
line but let's now let's be the computer
for
second and go through this logic mouse X
is to 75 is to 75 greater than 50 yes
it's true it is greater than 250 so an
ellipse is drawn and remember as soon as
the first thing evaluates to true we
kick out of that and go to the end so
none of these others are check so the
order of this really matters if I have
just checked if it was greater than 250
first then I would have found that one
right the order here really really is
really important so in this just in this
particular scenario the way that I've
written this code I need to check 250
then 150 then 50 and we can run this
program and we should see first we're
starting with a point then we get a line
then we get a square and put these kind
of close together than a circle so based
on where the mouse is a different shape
is drawn so this is a really sort of
crucial piece of information as to how
these if statements work oh okay so now
it is true however that I could also I
hesitate to do this but I could write
this with it not being without these
else so if I take out these else but
leave maybe I'm going to the else ifs
I'm going to take out this one just
three separate if statements let's look
at what happens now you try to think to
yourself like what's going to happen
here so I'm going to run this I've got a
line I've got a I now I see all three of
those so these now are not related to
each other they're just three distinct
if statements on their own so when the
mouse is 275 it's greater than 250 and
greater than 150 and greater than 50 so
all of these occur however if I string
them together with that else right then
as soon as the first one is executed the
next one is not checked so these are
essentially the tools you have to work
with and it really depends what it is
you want to implement okay so there's
one other tool thank you my watch almost
a 10 minutes here which is about the
length I'm trying to keep these videos
there's one other tool that I want to
add to this video which is and and or so
let's look at this here
another thing that you can add into a
conditional statement is an and or an
org so imagine if you said something
like this if Mouse X is greater than 50
and now this isn't correct syntax so I'm
just going to write the word and here
for a second and mouse X is less than
100 I kind of write what does this mean
if this is the canvas and this is pixel
50 and this is pixel 100 what is what
and mouse X so when does this evaluate
to true well this evaluates to true
anytime the mouse is greater than 50
this evaluates to true any time the
mouse is less than 100 both of these
together the whole statement only
evaluates to true if both of those are
true which is all the area in here you
can think of it as the intersection so
with an and if you join two boolean
expressions with an and they both have
to evaluate to true in order for in
order for the the code here for the full
statement to evaluate to true now you
could also have an or here if you put an
or here only one of these needs to
evaluate to true in order for this whole
in order for the this code to evaluated
for this to evaluate to true so let's
think about this if Mouse X is greater
than 50 or it's less than 100 well guess
what that's every number that's ever
been invented or talked about ever in
the history of the universe of numbers
right because try to come up with a
number that's either greater than 50 or
less than 100 every number 2 is less
than 150 7 is greater than 50 171 is
greater than 50 so so this is kind of
like not so into the logical statement
but it makes a lot of sense with an int
now the one thing that I'll mention here
is even though I'm using the word
and an or this is not actually the
syntax so the syntax for writing an and
into your code is two ampersands and the
syntax for writing an or into your code
is two pipes pipe pipe ampersand
ampersand so I want to go now and I'm
going to go down and make two quick
examples I'm going to add an end to our
mouse X example and I'm going to add an
or to our bouncing ball example you'll
see how both of those work okay so over
here what I would like to do now is I'm
going to go back and I'm just going to
make a rectangle which is at 300 200 100
100 and I'm going to say if Mouse X is
greater than 200 and mouse X is less
than 300 so look at this
if Mouse x is greater than 200 and less
than 300 let's see what that results in
whoops I would sorry I'm going to draw
the rectangle always and I'm going to
change the fill color if this evaluates
to true okay so look at this the mouse
it's no it's not greater than 200 right
now or okay whoops
how come oh sorry I did that wrong I
want it to be greater than 300 and less
than 400 sorry about that my math was
off see look if the mouse is over the
rectangle it's turning purple otherwise
it's not of course if I'm up here also
you can see as long as it's in between
this side of the rectangle and the other
side of the rectangle that fill is
executed so what I might say to you as
an exercise is can you add some more
hands to check if mouse Y is greater
than the top and less than the bottom
and this would be the code for a roll
over here so one of the things you're
going to see as we work with p5.js more
and more and more is that a lot of the
is that we're going to eventually be
able to get a lot of this stuff for free
like we're in the browser I'm working in
the browser there's rollovers there's
buttons there's all sorts of things but
as you're starting to learn to pro
ran and just drawing shapes kind of raw
shapes working with the pixels getting
your hands dirty with the pixels in the
canvas you might take some time like try
to program a rollover try to program a
button that's actually something I need
a video about something about checking
if the mouse is pressed anyway there's a
blur because there's other content here
that I realize I need to make so but
this it can get you started so try to
make some rollovers can you put more
than one on the screen can you get them
to change different colors try things
like that I want to look very quickly at
an or and so I'm going to go back also
to my other example and remember this
example where the ball gets to the right
and turns around and goes back when am I
doing that I'm doing that if X is
greater than width so what I want to say
now is if X gets to the right side turn
around or if it gets to the left side
turn around so what's the left side if
the right side is greater than with the
Lexx the left side is or if X is greater
than zero and by the way what's another
way I can take right when it gets to the
right I want speed to become negative
three when it gets to the left
I want speed to become positive three so
negative 3 positive 3 negative 3
positive 3 once a way you can change a
number from positive to negative 2
positive 2 negative 2 positives negative
always just multiply it by negative 1 so
if I take speed and set equal to itself
times negative 1 what you will see here
is speed is 3 and now speed is negative
3 and now when it gets to the left side
up speed is positive 3
now now you have this circle that's just
bouncing back and forth so this is again
something you might start to play with
with this example further top and bottom
changing size changing color can you
have more than one circle on the screen
which is a little bit tricky right now
because we haven't used we looked at an
array which is a list of things but but
that so this kind of fills in some gaps
and in my mind I've thought with a lot
of other gaps with conditional logic
that hopefully is
helping you here okay I'm going to stop
this video and I might make one more
thought of a couple other things that I
wanted to mention about conditional
logic and then I also need to make some
videos about loops okay oops
