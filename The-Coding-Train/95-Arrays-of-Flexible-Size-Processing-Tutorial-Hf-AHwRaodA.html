of how to raise whether or not I
mentioned it I probably did but I don't
specifically recall you would have
noticed this an array is a fixed size
when we declare an array when we make an
array when we say I'm going to have an
array of bubbles right when I say I'm
going to have a array of bubbles I have
to say it is a new array of bubbles and
I have to specify the number of bubbles
I want to have I have to say are there
going to be ten bubbles 100 bubbles a
thousand bubbles that number that is the
size of the array the size of that array
can never change if later in the program
I suddenly want 200 bubbles I can't just
add an extra hundred bubbles there I
could delete the array and make a new
array and do all sorts of crazy stuff
but an array is a fixed size so we this
is obviously a severe limitation I mean
there are plenty of reasons why a fixed
size is perfectly good for you if you
are making some sort of a game and it
has 10 players then you just need an
array of 10 players 10 scores 10 player
names right you know there's not
suddenly ever going to be 12 players or
9 players it's always a 10 player game
there's many instances where an array of
fixed size is totally what you need and
that's great but there are also lots of
scenarios where you want to start with
no bubbles on the screen and then a
moment happens in a few bubbles come out
and then another moment happens and now
there's six bubbles and there's 12 and
then there's 15 and then suddenly all
the bubbles go away and there's no
bubbles anymore I don't know why I'm
talking about this strange world of
bubbles but you can imagine lots of
different scenarios where you want to
have this flexible number of elements on
the screen we need to develop strategies
for doing this and there are many so um
there's there's a couple that I'm going
to just sort of briefly gloss over and
point you towards other information
about for one if you look through the
processing reference under array you'll
see that there are a whole set of
functions there's one called append
I don't remember what the other ones are
called it's funny cuz this would have to
be the last time I did this video
shortened slice there's a plus a lot of
functions and what these functions allow
you to do is manipulate the size of the
array and you might choose someday to
use those functions I encourage you to
go look up sorry have a cough I
encourage you go to look up those
functions in the reference to see how
they work see if they apply to you but
let me just make something very very
clear let's say we're going to use the
function append and we have an array of
three elements what's actually happening
in the magical ComputerLand is not
suddenly that we're appending another
element to the end of this array and it
becomes bigger that's what's going that
sort of like the result that we want but
what processing really has to do in
order to make this larger array is it
has to make a new array that has four
spots in it has to take the first three
copy them over and then now we have a
new spot to add an additional bubble so
while this works and the append function
is something you could use it's not
exactly the most efficient and also the
syntax for append is slightly awkward
and a little bit weird so I don't love
you I love that these functions exist
and I'm very happy about them but I
don't love using them and I personally
don't use them that often the the
solution that I generally use the most
often is something called an array list
you can also find the array list in the
processing reference you can find an
example under topics advanced data I
will link to that below about how that
uses an ArrayList for a flexible SCI a
flexibly a list of things as flexible
sized you can start with nothing add a
bunch to lead a bunch an array is great
it's an object it has functions you say
you can say remove add get add a whole
bunch of things use all sort of stuff
you can do with an ArrayList I think I
just said array earlier when I meant
ArrayList I'm enter a list so an
ArrayList is something I encourage you
to look into and there will be a video
that covers the an ArrayList more
specifically after this one at some
points or a link to a video anyway
whatever yep don't worry I got you
covered veg scale do you think about an
ArrayList but what I want to do is
actually show you some
lucien that i think is useful in some
scenarios but also just it helps you
think about how how you can manage it
just helps you practice and kind of use
arrays more in an interesting way i was
doing so well but this is you know
whatever I'm doing the best I can you
know this is my second attempt and we're
just gonna keep going through it okay so
what let's let's give ourselves a
scenario work with here's a scenario
once we have this we have this example
which we notice we have 100 bubbles we
make a hundred bubbles they have some
random size and then we call these
functions and all these bubbles are
floating up on the screen so let's let's
let's build in this scenario for
ourselves a little exercise for
ourselves what if when this program
starts what we want is for there to be
no bubbles on the screen and every time
I click the mouse above a new bubble
appears how would we do that well one
thing that you can always do with an
array is that you could always say you
know what I'm gonna make an array of a
million bubbles not a million a million
bubbles and then that way sometimes if I
want to use 10 or if I want to use 200
for one is 300 I can just use part of
the array so let's leave ourselves at
100 and let's think about what we would
do first of all let me show you
something look at this loop down here
int I equals 0 is less than bubbles dot
length what does this loop do is 0 than
1 then 2 then 3 then 4 then 5 it's all
the way up to 99 its counting through
every element of the array what if I
just said 10 here even though there's a
hundred bubbles in that array I'm only
looping through the first 10 right if I
say zero how many do I have on the
screen I'm not looping through any of
them if I say 50 what's happening I only
have 50 of them now of course if I said
150 we've got a new problem on our hands
array index out of bounds exception
array index out of bounds exception I
think open and I think you probably I
probably mentioned this before but this
is the error you get if you try to
access an element that doesn't exist
when your array has 10 spots and you go
for number 15 that index is out of
bounds so watch out for that error
so we do have a limit here when there's
only a hundred but we notice we can
change how many were actually actively
using at any given point so what am i
doing here I keep changing this number
manually and running it again what is
what should i Dinda kate to you that
might indicate to you we could use a
variable so what if I had a variable
that I called total and I set that
variable to zero and then I put total
down here
well now when I run it zero elements
when I run it with ten ten bubbles well
this is a variable now what could I do I
could say void mousepressed total equals
total plus one look at this no bubbles
let's hope this works click the mouse
one bubble click the mouse two bubbles
click the mouse three bubbles click the
mouse four bubbles click lick lick lick
lick lick lick lick lick lick lick lick
lick and I'm adding bubbles so even
though we've made an array of hundred
bubbles if we impose some logic where we
only use a certain amount of the array
then more of the array and then what
could I do I could add key pressed ah
the camera just went off but you know
what I'm doing I'm gonna turn it back on
if I add a key pressed this what's not
going very well
total equals total minus one and I run
this again what can I do I could say hey
let me add a bunch of bubbles let me
delete those bubbles so we can see here
that we can manipulate how much of that
array that we're using and this is not
such a bad strategy
and you know even though in a ray list
is probably ultimately going to give us
more flexibility more power and just
it's for more ease and manipulating the
size of an array this is a nice sort of
scenario to practice with and kind of
get a sense of as an option in turn how
you use an array now so let me give you
some thoughts if you want to take this a
step further into an exercise here's
what I would say to you number one is
what do you do when total gets to 100
right total equals total plus one
there's still only 100 bubbles in that
array what do you do do you set total
back to zero how can you keep reusing
and think about what what scenario you
would do there the other thing you might
think about is how could this happen
autonomously so how could you just say
every frame there's like a 1% chance
that a new bubble would appear could you
pick a random number and test where that
random number is and like what if I
picked a random between 0 and 100 and if
that random number is less than 20 does
that mean there's a 20% chance I think I
just gave the answer but implement that
so you have to click the mouse to add
bubbles what if it just happens every so
often randomly so those are some two
things you could try doing but mostly
what I would say to you is find your
thing that you've been working on that
has an array and just sort of play with
the idea of only using part of the array
could you sort of turn objects in the
array on and off you know that's another
thing we could do what if in the bubble
object here's something you could try
what if in the bubble object you put we
put a boolean variable and I said active
and it was false and then I have some if
statements in there where I only do the
stuff to the bubble if it's active and
what if when I click I sort of activate
different bubbles that could be a way
that I could also manage certain things
to be there or not there at any given
moment so those are some things you
could try some ideas maybe I'll try to
implement that and put it somewhere if
it's not there and you're come to this
video email me and remind me but but
what I would say is um the next thing
you should be looking at though is at
some point is using an ArrayList and I
will the next video or oh I think I have
a video already from then let me just
say it I have a video from the nature of
code series that I'm pretty sure goes
through an ArrayList and what I'm going
to do is link to that from from this
video so you can go move on to that if
you're interested in ArrayList and if
that doesn't exist then I'll make one
okay I've babbled for too long I hope
this one was ok and I will see you later
the next set of videos will just be I
think the next set of is gonna make our
about images and pixels image processing
loading images from the camera all sorts
of cool fun stuff that hopefully you
will enjoy ok good bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
