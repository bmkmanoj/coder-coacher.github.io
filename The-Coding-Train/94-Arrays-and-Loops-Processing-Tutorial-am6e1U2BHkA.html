okay um so here's the thing maybe
hopefully you worked on that exercise
what do we have now we have an array
it's got two spots in it pretend for a
moment that it had three spots in it and
what does our code look like it looks
like this
let's say we want to display all of the
bubbles we have to say bubbles index
zero display bubbles index one display
bubbles index to display we with the
knowledge that we have right now the way
that we've done everything we have three
lines of code this leads us to wonder
when we have a thousand bubbles when we
have a thousand lines of code I think
I've said that in every single video up
until now maybe I'm just repeating
myself I have no idea but this is the
concept this is where we're going this
is the gold this is very exciting
pretend you're excited just try I'm
trying I'm trying to pretend I do feel
genuinely excited sort of okay so how we
gonna do this let's look at something we
learned about a few videos back let's
look at a loop let's I'm gonna write out
this loop for you for actually this is
exciting I just got excited about it
okay it's I equals 0 I is less than 3 I
plus plus and I'm gonna write inside
this line of code I mean this loop
inside the structure I'm going to write
print Ln I okay let's actually this is
this is momentous let's actually go and
and actually and take a look at the
output of this
println I when I run this
what's down at the bottom down here if
you could see that 0 1 &amp;amp; 2 what prints
out first I is 0 is I let 0 less than 3
yes it is print i 0 i equals 0 then then
then i plus plus i is 1 is 1 less than 3
yes print I 1 is I plus plus 2 is 2 is 2
less than 3 yes print I yes I plus plus
I equals 3 is 3 less than 3 no exit the
loop this is the output we get from this
loop notice that notice notice anything
similar take a look at these values and
take a look at these values this just so
happens to be a structure where we have
a variable called I that starts at 0
then becomes 1 then becomes 2 and then
completes well isn't that what we needed
to do we needed to display bubble 0 then
display bubble 1 then display bubbles -
what if instead of saying print I here
we said bubbles index I dot display what
we've now done is we've essentially said
instead of individually referencing each
index with a hard-coded number let's use
a variable that count through all those
numbers and repeat over and over again
bubbles index I for when I is 0 bubbles
index I for when I is 1 bubbles index I
for when I is 2 and we have now
condensed these three lines of code
essentially into one line of code it's 3
with the loop part especially for with
the print but you know once this goes
all the way up to 999 this is still
going to be the same length the only
thing that's going to change here is we
want I to go up to a thousand so let's
look let's actually this is this is huge
by the way you know you let's put this
into our program and see what happens ok
we don't need to save that so let's go
down here and say ok for int I equals 0
I is less than and right now we have to
I plus plus and we don't need both of
these anymore
all we need is to referee
index I let's run this program and see
if we get the same result we get the
same result instead of having to say a
send display and top-40 is setting
display on top for one we now just save
for i4ii okay pretty good so far but we
still initialized each bubble
individually you know what if we want it
to have the different sizes what are we
going to do well let's don't worry about
that right now let's take this and go up
here and do the same thing for
initializing bubbles index I let's run
this again now instead of having to
initialize each one individually we're
initializing each one in that loop they
all have the same size but we'll get to
that in a moment
great we're close
five minutes 30 seconds actually that's
probably not the time you see that's a
arbitrary time that I put up there let's
change this now let's not get too crazy
let's just make this 20 okay now we got
20 bubbles let's run it let's run it
let's run it two bubbles
shoot what happened well we updated the
array to have 20 spots in it but our
loop is still only looping to two so
we're only using two parts of the array
even though the array itself has 20
spots so we could fix this by changing
this to 20 and this to 20 now let's run
this ah
20 bucks okay okay there's 20 bubbles
now and look with by the way I should
really point out something very very
important incredibly important notice
this bubble tab over here we haven't
touched this once this whole all of
these videos about arrays we've never
touched this bubble class we're not
doing anything to the object that's
different it's the same object all we're
doing is figuring out how to make a list
of many of them to have one or many the
object is still the same so let's go
let's go for it let's go for let's just
go for a thousand and by the way this is
driving me crazy I'm gonna have a
I got to change the thousand here and
then here and then here I'm going to
change twenty one thousand twenty one
thousand this is kind of a problem
because really you could be referencing
this array in a zillion places in your
code well one of the things about an
array that I haven't pointed out to you
is it has a property a length property
we can actually access the length of
that array directly dynamically so
instead of typing 20 here I can say
bubbles dot length and I can say bubbles
dot length and now we have 20 bubbles
it's the same program but watch this I
could go back and say 3 3 bubbles and
here we go here we go Oh get ready you
can ready to like stand up and blood
what you're totally not gonna do because
why would you that would be weird um we
got a thousand oh it's so sad there's a
thousand bubbles there but it's running
kind of slow so we kind of ran into
something here we ran into the fact that
it's slow to draw a ton of stuff on the
screen this is actually kind of a little
bit of an aside but an important point
nonetheless that generally speaking the
thing that's going to make your
processing program run slow is drawing
too much stuff not calculating too many
numbers or having too many lines of code
but drawing too much stuff now at some
point we'll have to have a video I'm
sure we could get that we I know for a
fact we could get this to run faster
through various optimizations in
particular using a different drawing
mode with hardware acceleration which
I'm just kind of rambling about right
now we could even just try that by the
way by saying I'm gonna change it to p2
to here which is you see just throwing
her hand and thing into this video yeah
that's better
it's kind of working anyways a little
bit faster but more likely so what what
by the way let me just mention what I
did
p.2d is a what I've done here in the
size function is in the last parameter I
can specify what behind-the-scenes
rendering engine do I want to use this
really is nothing to do with this the
array topic but I can't stop um and and
what's the deal with that it's you know
you have to imagine like there's this
too
this is killing people sitting and sound
processing they're just waiting to like
draw the pixels on the screen but
there's like two separate teams there's
the default team when you don't say
anything in size and there's a P 2d team
there's also the p 3d team for when
you're like I get to draw stuff in 3d
and they jumped into action start
drawing stuff P 2d and p 3d use the
graphics card in a particular way farm
out a lot of the rendering to the
graphics card which can make things a
lot faster they use OpenGL which is a
term you can now google hook up if
you're not familiar with it
but let's just go back and make 300
bubbles and get rid of PGD and this is a
nice place to sort of just like watch
our bubbles uh no 300 I can't tell
actually if that's running slow or fast
or what I think all that alpha you know
it's actually slowing things down this
is quite all that alpha makes things
pretty slow to make it look like a
bubble we don't need a fill and watch
how much trash it's gonna be look at
that that's nice and fast now I think uh
I don't know what slow it's fast anymore
um so they're really look like bubbles
but whatever um
so it's funny because my I did this the
other day they really look like bubbles
and I don't know what this looks like
they're probably gonna shut off because
I think I need to stop now okay so
there's a there's okay there's a couple
of nuances to this edit the last one
minute out please there's a couple
answers to this one is that when you're
initializing a bunch of objects this way
you only have one line of code to
initialize the objects in essence we're
initializing every object identically so
one thing that we can look at here is
that why are that why are there why is
there variation it's because in the
constructor a lot of the parameters are
set randomly X is a random location the
speed is a random value so this is a way
we have a wide variety and there might
be some other algorithm for which you
would initialize these parameters but
one thing that you can do that is quite
common let's just go back to like 25
bubbles for a second there's 25 bubbles
okay let's go back and see those 25
bubbles what if I did this and this is
going to be a little bit confusing and I
times for for let's run this
notice that I have bubbles of varying
size in fact each bubble has a
particularly unique size the first one
is 0 the second one is for the next one
is 8 the next one is 12 right the next
one is 16 the next one is 20 right I'm
using the fact that I'm counting through
bubbles 0 I'm using the fact that its
index 0 to it in sinus size index is 1 2
a sinus eyes this is one way of doing it
I could also have just done something
random right here and now I have bubbles
of all random sizes so the point is
what's happening now and I can't believe
this is - oh that stopped recording a
while ago alright just now I saw the
minute I'm just over here so do this
this stop but this is definitely gonna
cut out of me any second um so try this
try now make your objects make an array
use a loop and see how do you initialize
that array of objects are they all the
same
is it the random is it an algorithm
based on counting give that a try and
see how you do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
