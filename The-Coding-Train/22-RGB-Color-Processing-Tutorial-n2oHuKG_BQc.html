series part the intro forget about the
numbers I will number them I can't keep
track of anything I did Lily
come in here turn the camera on a ramble
about stuff in processing but okay so I
forgot a couple things in the previous
video that I just kind of how to fill in
right here one is I think I showed you
this in one of the introductory videos
about frost processing but you should
take a note of the fact that you can
processing comes with a huge amount of
examples so I also encourage you when
you're beginning to just go through some
of these basic examples particularly for
in here you might kind of like well this
actually has a lot of stuff that we
haven't learned yet but you can kind of
get a sense of what's possible to draw
and processing you might find that
useful just to kind of poke through a
bunch of the examples to kind of see
what they do the other thing the other
couple things I wanted to mention is
that processing in addition to having
that reference that I showed you on the
website you can also here under a help
there are various you can actually if
you're not online you can actually get
the reference like if I just click this
it's going to open the reference the
processing downloads with the reference
as well so you can actually from the
development environment self from the
processing application you can look up
stuff in the reference as well the last
thing that I want to just mention which
is is that you might have noticed that
text is turning different colors like if
I by accident delete this.e
we can see that the Li n is in black if
I add the e it's it hooks
I have caps lock on if I add the e in
lowercase it's in blue so the processing
development environment will color the
text that you're writing different
colors just as a little way of helping
you along to to to see that you're kind
of spelling things right and what's
unknown word and what's an unknown word
so but those colors have nothing to do
with how your program executes it's just
a visual help to see that you've spelled
things wrong so one thing you might
notice
we know when I run this it's going to
say the function Li n does not exist
because it doesn't exist but the
function line it does exist in
processing and I would correct that by
by typing in E okay um I guess I'm going
to me yeah I'm gonna keep going so back
to color I I don't know if this filling
stuff in the beginning the video was a
good idea but I did it and I don't know
I can always split it into two well
you're I guess if I need to
okay so we got so what we've done so far
is we've learned about downloading
processing running processing we
understand about a computer graphics
window x-axis y-axis where the pixels
are we got a sense of different
functions we could use to draw to the
window but what about color so one thing
you'll notice if we go back and run this
program is that up here I am you'll
notice that the line is black the
rectangle seems to be white but maybe
has a black outline and then the back of
the window itself is just kind of this
gray color so we've never specified a
single color for anything we didn't say
draw a red line we can say draw a blue
line we and say draw a rectangle with a
blue scent is filling and a delicious
blueberry filling and like a red outline
um we it processing just decided to use
default colors which you can see are
just black and white because we didn't
specify but now is the moment where we
can start to look at how to specify
color okay so how do we do that
so one thing we should be aware of is I
is any shape and processing take a
rectangle for example any shape and
processing for example a rectangle it
has both an outline which which we
should really call a stroke and it has
also I don't know to call this an
interior which we should which we'll
call a film so fill and Stroke are the
key words the function names that set
color in processing for the outline and
the interior of shape now a line has
Phil because a line only has a stroke
but a lips or a rectangle has both a
stroke the outline and the filling
inside just decided to say now that
creamy filling ikrima upsets my stomach
so fruit I like fruit fillings not too
much sugar and I like it too sweet but
anyway that is that's the inside you
didn't need to know all that information
okay so how does this work so let's say
we have a program which draws drawing a
rectangle at 200 comma 150 with a width
of 50 and a height of 35 pixels so this
is our program that we are writing let
me kind of erase this how do we set that
rectangles color the way we set a shapes
color is by setting the fill or stroke
with the lines of code in advance of sin
rectangle so order of operations really
matters what we're doing is we're almost
like the process program is running
there's like a thing with a pen there
and it's like it reads oh a stroke blue
oak let me go get a blue pen read I got
the red head whenever I get to rectangle
I'm drawing with red and then if it says
stroke black it'll suddenly switch and
get the black pen again so it's reading
the code step by step and setting the
stroke setting the fill for whatever
that next shape is going to be so if I
were to say stroke oh we need some
arguments right how do we define the
arguments for a color and we need a fill
so that's the big question so we can see
that what we're all Tamayo
is we might say like hey I want to have
some sort of color stroke for the line
and some sort of stroke and some sort of
fill for that rectangle right I want to
give the line a stroke the rectangle of
stroke and a fill but what are those
arguments
what are those arguments how do we
define color okay like I'm asking a
question over algorithm here's a kind of
trying to avoid the answer because I
feel a lot
we'll try and explain it but let me give
it a try so first of all there are lots
of ways to think about color you might
have in some time in your life done
finger-painting and you have a look some
primary colors and you can mix them and
get other colors that's a good nice way
to start thinking but so that's kind of
what we're going to but we're going but
we're not going to use those I don't boy
I if I had a pause and restart I would
just do that now but I'm going we're
going to mix colors but we're going to
mix digital color and a digital color
follows the properties of light so we
need a little bit of red some amount of
red some amount of green and some amount
of blue and all of those together will
give us a color so that's what we're
going to do so we need three arguments
this is what's known as our G B color ah
our G B color ah so I got off track as I
got confused what I was saying um this
is just my rehearsal that I'm going to
upload it anyway
but um I should I want to mention that
there are what we're not going to get
into all this right now but processing
allows you to define color in many ways
you could define color basically about
hue saturation brightness you could
define color with all sorts of different
amount of ranges but what we're going to
look at is the default way that color
works it's the best way to get started
in kind of just try stuff out although I
think I think looking at hue saturation
brightness what is kind of important
then that's why it's own video though so
the default way is again red green and
blue so the range is for each one of
these values is 0 to 255
so if we say 0 red then that's no red if
we say 255 red that's a lot of red right
so you could imagine what is this color
0 comma 255 comma 0 if this is again RGB
color and we're saying the film
what would this color be well it's no
red no blue but all the way turn that
green switch all the way on so that's a
green color right so let's go take a
look at
you just prove that this works if I make
the interior of this rectangle green and
the stroke of the rectangle I'm going to
say is red and I'm going to have the
stroke of the line just so we see all
three of these as blue and we run it
again we can see now
AHA we have a green rectangle with a red
outline and a blue line why we have all
of that because that's what we specified
with stroke zero red 0 green 255 blue
right so obviously this is just sort of
a very basic beginning of this and you
might start to mix colors and imagine
like okay well what does red and what
does green and red make for the fill of
that rectangle yellow so I have a little
color challenged and I don't I always
feel like very but gives me a lot of
anxiety to pick colors so but I have a
feeling that if you found your way here
you're kind of interested in design
maybe you like color you have some ideas
yourself so what I would say here's this
is kind of all I have to I have a bunch
more things to say actually but in terms
of color I would encourage you to start
playing around you might have experience
using Photoshop or designing websites
and you've done a lot of stuff with
color already processing actually by the
way also allows you this is a bit of a
digression but to do to write your
colors this way so if you've ever done
color for the web with this hexadecimal
notation you can also do that directly
in processing but I think I want to
focus really primarily on this idea of
numbers red comma green comma blue but
let me add so we're only at 6 in about 7
minutes let me add a few more things to
this equation first of all what if I
were to make the fill 255 comma 255
comma 255 all the way red all the way
green all the way blue what do you think
you're going to get jeopardy theme music
playing you can run it we are going to
see we have a white rectangle again
remember this is the properties of light
so if we take all of red all of green
and all
of blue mix them together we have white
light if we turn all the lights off if
every one of these values is zero zero
comma zero comma zero then we have black
so we only have color in all those sort
of areas in between so to speak so one
thing I should say I lost my eraser here
it is is that right if you want to do
white right we said it's fill 255 255
255 or black zero comma zero comma zero
processing allows you to do something
with a little bit of shorthand will be
very inconvenient to always have to put
mul 3 in there you can actually if you
ever specify color with one argument
instead of three it will assume what you
meant to do was use that number for all
three values so I can say give me I come
back over here I can say I don't know
what I'm doing I kind of I need a better
layout my head is it the way which kind
of defeats the purpose of this or your
green screen thing but you know it was
kind of an idea that seemed to make
sense I can say fill 255 instead of
three 250 250 5 s right and get the same
result a white rectangle which is
interesting to note because by the way
what if I say fill 100 notice I have a
gray color a dark grey not black zero
would be black it turns out that
grayscale color by the way anything in
greyscale color Eddy is a vet I color
where red equals green equals blue so
100 comma 100 comma 100 is a slightly
dark gray that we could give a shorthand
as just the argument 100 so we can both
specify color as a single value for a
greyscale color or three values for red
green and blue two more things I want to
touch on in this video
another thing I feel like I pause for
questions is really what I feel like
doing right now
but it's a video and there shouldn't be
but it is okay so the other thing I want
to mention is by the way there is a
function called background right where
which allows me to also set the color
for the background so there is a black
background which I did using a single
argument for grayscale or I could say 0
comma 255 comma 0 and here is a green
background with that color so the
background function fills in the
background of your processing sketch
window with the color now the other
thing I should just mention by the way
is I've been kind of using the word
program your application the processing
window sketch I'm going to try to now
consistently use the word sketch the
word sketch is kind of a word for a
processing program we think of this oh
you're so folder of processing programs
that's your sketchbook for this idea
that you possibly one of the things that
allows you to do is very quickly sketch
out ideas through code so understanding
your processing sketch now has a green
background however here's something
really important order of operations is
key right just because what does
background actually do it fills the
screen with a single color even though
we think of the term background as that
you put it behind everything the order
that this code executes is quite
important what if I were to put
background at the end what do you think
is going to happen will it look the same
clearly no otherwise why would I be
doing this look what happens I don't see
my rectangle and lying anymore because
it drew the line and drew the rectangle
pathetic through the background on top
of it and this is a real once we start
doing animation this idea of where the
background goes is going to be truly
truly key ok the other thing I should
just point out by the way is that if I
didn't set a stroke for this second
rectangle right this stroke from the
hope course I have background at the end
the stroke from the line would carry
over which is very hard for you to see
but I can zoom in you can see that the
both the line and the rectangle are blue
that's because remember when you set the
stroke it's the stroke value for all
shapes that are drawn
afterwards unless you override that
stroke with a new value I should also
just sort of point out look out I'm
typing this the actual um these like
extra line breaks and where I put this
none of that really matters I like sort
of putting these with little groups
because I like a like anal I'm like the
anal retentive coder who's like okay let
me put size and background together and
then stroke in line then stroke filling
rect like it just I can read it and it
makes sense but but truly none of that
matters in fact this code would execute
exactly the same way but it's much
harder to read because line rates don't
matter at all semicolon is what tells
the processing program we've reached the
end of a line and I have to put it back
the way I had it so what's important to
realize is that the syntax spaces and
line breaks tend to not really matter
right I can put a lot of spaces here and
it's actually I put this extra stuff
it's actually going to run exactly the
same way but there often is a way of
writing code that feels a little bit
more human readable um this should be
easy these should be separate videos
like I because I won't talk about
comments now but it's okay um yeah and
I'm gonna do a few couple more things in
this video because I and I maybe I'll
fix these later through some magic way
of doing it again with
editing or something but okay so that's
what I wanted to mention there okay so
the other things right someone's going
to download these in like shorten them
because this video probably with all my
like extra asides could be without those
could be like five minutes long but um
so here's the other thing there's
something you can put in your code which
in a way like doesn't count if I ever
type slash slash you can see suddenly
this this line is like a light gray and
I can say this will draw a green
rectangle and I can run this program and
it still runs this is what's known as a
code comment if you ever want to write
annotations in your code you might say
like you might do something like to do
fix this line I don't like the design
you could add comments to yourself in
the code something that you might want
to do later just explanations of what
different sections of the code are doing
right now it might feel somewhat silly
to be doing this because it's so short
and in a way kind of like obvious what's
happening although um you know just
these functions and numbers is somewhat
cryptic but you will think your future
your future self will thank your present
self later if you get into the habit of
writing comments into your code now
because this inevitably will happen to
able to work on a program for quite a
while you will go on vacation or do
something else that has nothing to do
with sitting like hunched over at your
computer because that's good for you
when you come back to it you're not
going to remember how it works or what
you want to look at and instead but if
you have all those code comments in
there it's going to allow you to kind of
get back into it more easily so get into
the habit of doing that now okay so I'm
going to just so you know we kind of
have reached the end of this kind of
first there's three videos here one
talking about worded systems one kind of
looking at processing and starting to
write code now we saw a little bit about
color I'm going to give you since this
one's already 15 minutes long I'm going
to give you two hints of things you
could look at and maybe I'll fill them
back in with a in practice with with
another video later there is a function
called color mode
and I would encourage you to look up in
the reference look at a selected
exercise look up colormode in the
reference what are some examples can you
change the color mode and defining
colors differently one color mode that
you can do in processing I believe it's
HSB boy I don't have this memorized for
hue saturation brightness sometimes this
is written as H as a P hue saturation
value but this is another way of
defining color that's different than RGB
hue being the color on the color wheel
like what is the hue of the color is a
greenish blue is it really blue is a
really red saturation being how vibrant
is the color and brightness being how
bright is that color is a very dark blue
a very bright blue so one way you can
play with designing colors is through
hue saturation brightness and you can
affect that with the color mode the
other thing that I totally didn't
mention it all right we said that Phil
could have one argument which would be a
grayscale color we said that Phil could
have three arguments which would be an
RGB color well here's another here's two
other amounts of arguments that Phil
could have Phil could have two arguments
which is grayscale + transparency you
could also have four arguments which is
RGB gray are gb+ transparency often
written as alpha the Alpha value an
alpha of zero means completely
transparent an alpha of 255 means
completely opaque now of course there is
no such thing as real transparency it's
not that some way your physical screen
will be see-through it's this idea of
creating the illusion transparency so if
you draw a color with no transparency
you will see that color literally on the
screen if you draw a color with some
transparency it will look like it blends
through and I know I said it wasn't
really going to go through this in great
detail but let's actually just look at
this for a second let's make this
rectangle much much wider so we can see
it this is our
we have a green back I'm going to give
this a black background so it's a little
bit easier to see oh and that was not
the Phil let's which have a nice bright
green rectangle which we can see right
here what if we were to draw another
rectangle on top which is red and we'll
do it 150 comma 50 which with 100 pixels
wide and 300 pixels high right look at
that see that red rectangle right on top
of that green rectangle right that's a
hundred percent opaque but what if we
give it a little bit of transparency
right zero is completely transparent 255
is completely opaque so 127 will be
right in the middle there like 50% if we
do this look we can see ah the camera
shut up because I this is like a kind of
a little bit of a disaster the day but
you know you can just I'm doing the best
I can you can see now that there's red
here is blending with the black behind
it and the red here is blending with the
green behind and blending being it's
receives almost as if it's like a tinted
lens that we put on top there so of
course this opens up another can of
worms there are many different ways of
blending colors and different this this
is an infinite world of stuff you can
look at and do and add all of this
containing the reference at all between
examples and through trial and error but
this should give you some beginning
steps to some beginning steps to get
started so I think you in a way have all
the tools now you have all the tools to
make a first design you know about the
coordinate system you know about basic
shapes and you know about color so make
yourself an alien on this the my little
example that I always use is this like
tiny little thing person alien whatever
called zoo you can see there's some
ellipses a rectangle and some lines but
you design something share it send it to
me you're going to start to want to use
arcs and curves and try to go if doing
this will sort of force you to dig into
the processing reference a bit more so
um I have kind of one more video in this
little sequence which is about some
other
advanced drawing functions in processing
to do more complex shapes which I think
I'll tack on at some point but this is
sort of like your first weaker time or
whatever that's your exercise okay thank
you this video is way too long I should
probably cut it into a few different
ones but it just sort is what it is
right now
I'm going to go have something to eat
coat I need to go like I don't have some
kind of therapy or something after this
as well which baby would be a good idea
see you later and I hope you are
enjoying yourself and your day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
