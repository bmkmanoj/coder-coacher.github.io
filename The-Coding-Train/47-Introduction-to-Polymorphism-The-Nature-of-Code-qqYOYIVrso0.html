sometimes to say hello we're back
repeating myself okay so but this is a
video about edit that out about
polymorphism polymorphism polymorphism
sounds like a fancy word it's gonna be
really complicated topic this is the
third principle of object-oriented
programming and it's actually gonna be
something hopefully quite simple for us
to understand so we saw hint of this by
the way before we had this particle
system which managed particles then we
made this square particle class which
was a child of particle and we were able
to put that in the particle system and
everything just worked how did that
happen well let's think of a similar
scenario let's say we have an array okay
well let's actually just say for a
second we have a class called
animal and let's say we have a class
called dog and dog extends animal and we
have a class called cat and cat extends
animal and we have a class called turtle
and turtle extends animal right you can
see where this is going we could have
this base animal class like our base
particle class and lots of subclasses
that have all the basic functionality
and data of an animal but with their own
customization now what we want to do is
make an array I'm gonna in our in our
particle system example we're gonna use
array lists but just for thinking it
through right now let me use a plain old
array we're gonna make an animal array
called kingdom king dumb which is a new
animal array and you know we're gonna
have a thousand animals in it okay I
want to put dogs and cats and turtles
into that array can I do that the answer
of course is yes otherwise why would we
be here but just think back to would not
have been your first instinct maybe you
would have said I'm making a prostate
sketch and have all these different
objects on the screen
I need my dog array to keep track of all
my dogs I mean my cat already to keep
track of all my cats
I need my turtle array to keep track of
all my Turtles this is gonna get
unwieldy pretty fast in some cases you
might want that but the hope one of the
reasons for doing this inheritance
structure is it allows us to kind of
collect all of these objects that that
that that have the same parent together
and work with them together
this is polymorphism this is going to
polymorphisms is going to allow us to
put all these different kinds of animals
into the same generic array of animal
objects a ray of generic animal objects
I think is what I meant to say so let's
look at two lines of code that I'm going
to write out for you here I'm gonna say
dog god dog Rover equals new dog okay
this is something we should be very
comfortable with we're very comfortable
saying I have an object of type dog it's
name is Rover it's a new dog object
great here is polymorphism something new
that we're allowed to do animal spot
equals new dog this is polymorphism what
polymorphism which means from the Greek
many forms what it allows us to do is
say I have a dog object and if I well if
it's convenient for me to think of it as
a dog object I'm happy to do so if it's
more convenient for me to think of it as
an animal object that's also allowed I
mean it really truly is a dog a dog is a
dog as a dog as a dog but we can talk
about it as if it's an animal because a
dog is an animal it's a child class the
dog is made from a child class of animal
we can make an animal object which is
specifically a dog this is what allows
us to put Kingdom index 0 for example
could be a new dog Kingdom index 1 could
be a new cat this is the magic of
polymorphism Kingdom is just a bunch of
animals a dog is an animal a cat is an
well we can collect all these different
kinds of classes into the same array
great right okay so hopefully this makes
sense to you but there's one little
piece of this that I think would be
worth mapping out what happens when we
loop through that array right and we
know now by the way that we have this
new kind of loop that we can do we can
say for every animal a in the kingdom
array I could say and what do our
animals have they had a sleep function
and an eat function I could say a dot
sleep a eat so I could still loop
through all of the animals and when it
gets to each one I don't have to say if
it's a dog sleep like a dog if it's a
cat sleep like a cat that's the magic of
polymorphism and inheritance is it just
knows how to do it it knows like we made
a dog and put it in the first spot we
made a cat and put it in the first month
they're both animals but a dog is a dog
is a dog is a dog when it gets to sleep
it's gonna sleep like a dog when it gets
to eat it's gonna eat like a dog so this
is very powerful we can have a Janette
we can have an array of generic animals
we can put specific kinds of animals in
that array we can loop through all them
and we don't have to keep track of which
one is which Java slash processing slash
the you know the computer the little
people inside the computer pulling in
all the switches and buttons in there it
keeps track of all that for us this is
incredibly powerful it's going to allow
us to make a particle system full of
particles square particles spinning
particles star particles rainbow
particles and we don't have to keep
track of what's what we can just put
whatever we want in it we can say
they're all particles and the program is
going to keep track of that for us okay
I hoping this makes sense to you if not
we will remedy that situation somehow
but to let's actually go now back to our
particle system example I forgot to turn
the timer on so I don't know how long
this has been but I think it's a good
amount of time and with C polymorphism
in action okay so if you remember we
actually have polymorphism in action
right here because we are putting square
particles in the
a list but the ArrayList type is a
generic particle and we can see here
we're treating a square particle as a
square particle when we want to make it
but as a regular particle when we're
accessing it because this is us looking
at it in different forms so this is
probably more physical right here in
action but let's really prove to
ourselves that this is working and I'm
going to add just a little piece of
function out here I'm gonna pick a
random number between 0 and 1 and I'm
gonna say if that random number is less
than 0.4 there's a 40% chance of me
adding a square particle and there is a
60% chance of me adding a regular
particle so what I mean by this is I am
NOT keeping track of which particle is
square which parts was random I'm just
randomly adding sometimes I'm adding a
square particle sometimes I'm adding a
regular particle and when I loop through
the particles they're all just particles
but when I call display the square
particle is going to know to be a square
the regular particle is going to know to
be a circle and when we run this we can
see here some square 40% of the time
we've got a square particle 60% of the
time I don't know why I pick those
probabilities we have a circular
particle this is polymorphism this is
very powerful and what I would suggest
to you as an exercise is make a whole
series of particle classes that are all
slightly different that all inherit the
main particle with some extra variables
with some extra functions that do
slightly different things look a
slightly different way and put them all
in one big particle ArrayList and make
your magical confetti whatever explosion
happen on the screen and sing to
yourself and applaud and be really happy
so we should we should be happy while
we're doing this if you're not happy
doing this really
there's lots other things you can go and
do unless I guess someone's requiring
you to watch these videos which nobody
should and ever anyway ok hooray this is
the end of this video about polymorphism
write some comments leave me questions
send me an email and we're basically
finished with particle systems I'm gonna
look at a couple more topics and I think
they're gonna have two more videos so
I'm gonna make but I'm gonna stop
talking I'm gonna hit this button</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
