five a of my git and github tutorial
series I'm taking a break in this
particular video of focusing on git
concepts through the use of the github
website to talk about something called
terminal and shell commands and terminal
prompt and unix and that sort of thing
so why am i talking about this so the
goal of this video series now that we've
covered basic git and github concepts is
for you to work locally on your laptop
to work with get offline not through the
github website and that's going to be
very useful for a variety of reasons
that you will see as I get through that
these various tutorials now here's the
thing how do you do that I am using the
Mac computer system operating system you
know snow tiger leopard something or
other making the same joke I made 10
minutes ago but you don't know that I'm
doing that night shouldn't have done
that but I did it anyway it was better
the first time but I got to keep going
um so I'm using this uh Supra light at
that out I'm using this Mac Apple
operating system and so I could download
software that allows me to run get
through a visual interface but the way
that I work with git is by typing in git
commands to a terminal prompt and this
if I can bring this up is what a
terminal prompt looks like and this is
what a command looks like draw a circle
of course that's not a valid command if
I hit enter it's going to say bash draw
command not found so what is this bash
what is this terminal this is actually
emulating it says this is the types of
commands I'm typing in here are the same
commands I would type to a UNIX
operating system so this is Mac OS zyx
you might be using Windows UNIX is
another operating system that is you
entirely interface with through the
command line so if you want to do this
stuff that I'm going to show you in this
video on the Mac you want to open up
terminal if you're opening up terminal
for the very first time that's very
exciting you can find it by go just even
just going in and searching for terminal
and you can see there it is but it is in
application slash utilities as well if
you were on Windows I would suggest that
you download something called git bash
which include a link to downloading that
in this video's description you can
actually use there are various shell
prompts in Windows and I believe that
UNIX shells are coming to Windows
natively perhaps in the future or by the
time you're watching this video maybe
they're already there but a git bash I
know will work if you're following along
the stuff that I'm doing in this
particular video ok so what I need to
show you now are what are the basic
commands that you might want to type
here maybe there's a command called help
there is so you can see that there's
lots of things you could just come up
with type something see what happens and
this is a huge type couldn't make like a
hundred videos probably about things you
can do UNIX command prompt one that I'm
going to show you right now is you can
type clear and it just clears you right
back up to the top which is nice to sort
of clear what's been on your screen
previously but I'm going to make a list
over here the main thing that you want
to do learn before you go on to the next
video and again if you've already if you
know about UNIX shell commands you just
skip ahead to the next video is working
with working with your file system so
the main way to work with your file
system is actually one single command
called CD change directory just like you
might double click on a folder through
the interface CD is like changing the
directory that you're your command line
prompt is currently actively associated
with if there's also the command which I
use a lot called PWD print working
directory and then the results of the
command LS which lists lists the
contents of the current working
directory so these are essentially the
main ones that you want to use we saw
clear up probably as I start doing stuff
by accident use a few other commands but
let's just get comfortable with these
basic commands before we move on to
executing all the git commands in
terminal as well ok so I'm coming back
over here and now I'm going to just
start by typing in my first command my
first command is going to be PWD there
it goes oh whoa I'm in a weird place ah
clear I'm gonna do CD dot dot clear so
pretend that didn't happen I forgot I
was demonstrating some figure up there
but you might have you might have gotten
a little bit of taste there but I'm
gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna correct that
we just scratch that ok edit that out it
won't be edited out probably but I'm
going to type PWD PWD
look here I am in users processing so
this is the default directory that
terminal just sort of set me in
originally I can actually open this
directory directly in the finder by
saying open dot open the dot being like
this current directory open being
opening so if I wanted to open a file I
could actually put the file name in here
but I want to just open this directory
and you can see now in the Finder window
where what's what are what are the
directories here applications desktop
documents downloads if I were to now
type LS list you can see look it's
listing all of those here in terminal
prompt so this is just another interface
to your file system the same way the
finder on the Mac and the Explorer on
Windows is so let's say I want to like
put some stuff on work with some files
on my desktop I would type cd' desk top
and I'm going to misspell it with two PS
and it should say no such file or
directory exists if I spell it correctly
I should be there now I didn't get any
message but I could say PWD and you can
see now I have changed to the desktop
now I'm going to show you a little trick
now first of all let's say I want to go
back a directory dot dot will get me
back a directory so if I do CD dot dot
now I'm up one directory and I can see
that for sure users slash processing now
let's say I want to change the desktop
but I don't really feel like typing so
much if I take CD des I'm going to hit a
magical key now tab is a magical key in
the command line and what it's going to
do it's going to fill in the rest of
that now how did it know that I intended
to type desktop well there's only so
many things there's only so many options
there's only one that starts with de
desktop so tab is a way of Auto filling
in a file name and I'm going to use that
a lot as I do all sorts of stuff in get
hitting tabs like autofill in that's a
quick way of doing things so now I'm on
the desktop again another trick is the
up arrow up and down arrow allows you to
browse through previous commands so you
can see here I'm hitting the up arrow so
if I wanted to find like a command like
this I could just find it again hit
enter and now I opened my desktop and
you can see these are the various files
that I have on my desktop and you can
see I actually have
this is foreshadowing this is a
narrative device called foreshadow I
have this rainbow poem folder which is
actually my git repository that I
downloaded from github which I'll get to
in the next video more about that okay
I'm trying to think oh here's something
else that you really want to do so let's
say you want to activate a current
directory in terminal that is somewhere
deep bet in your computer so I'm going
to go I'm going to go back to the finder
and I'm going to go to documents and I'm
going to find data API is JSON 3 so this
is like some old example that I made
into a previous video tutorial let's say
I want to terminal to point to that
directory well it's slash documents
slash data underscore API site so a lot
to remember so something that I can do
is I can type CD space and now I can
just take this folder and drag it into
the terminal window and let go and you
can see it's going to auto fill in the
path so I can now hit enter I could say
PWD I can say LS and I can see that now
one thing I'll show you about LS that
sometimes I need is I can also do LS
dash all so unix commands can be often
modified with arguments this is one
argument - all which will give me more
information about those files and you
can see it's giving me information about
this is like file permissions the date
the size which user has control over
this file all that sort of stuff so you
know in this case hidden files will show
up this way that's not something to need
all the time but is particularly can be
rather useful so this is the basics this
is all I really need to do because
ultimately if I want to execute git
commands um with a particular set of
files I just need my terminal to be in
that directory so for example if the
directory as I know it will be and this
is kind of going into the next video is
this rainbow poem folder on the desktop
I will just want to type CD drag it over
hit enter type PWD to confirm and now
you'll see I am now ready to execute git
commands on the git repository that is
in this rainbow poem folder alright so I
hope you enjoyed this video about basic
UNIX stuff that you need for
get and commands via the locally on your
computer and in the next video I'm going
to move on to actually showing you those
git commands and how they differ and how
you work with github and all the stuff
that I'm going to get to okay thanks
