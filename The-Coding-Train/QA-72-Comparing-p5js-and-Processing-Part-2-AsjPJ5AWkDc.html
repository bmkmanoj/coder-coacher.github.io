is the difference between p5.js and
processing and in this particular second
part I'm actually just going to open up
processing and p5 themselves and look at
that look at how writing code and both
of them and what are some actual
differences syntax wise or feature wise
between the two okay and I'll see you at
the end of this video there'll be a
third part also we're going to make a
list of pros and cons if you missed the
first part you can also find in the
description a link to the first part
where I kind of did a macro view of the
bigger picture of these two environments
alright see you in a bit I guess because
I'm just hear me talking camera video
thing okay so I'm back here on two
websites if you're looking at p5 and
processing p5 is at p5.js org here's the
website here you can download the
library files and find some information
about how to get started with an editor
on this website and I'll talk a bit
about that once I open an editor
processing org this is the processing
website and you can go here to download
to download the actual processing
software editor environment for Mac PC
that sort of thing so I've already done
that I have both of those things here if
you have trouble with that you can write
something in the comments and hopefully
I or somebody else following the
comments can jump in and help but also
by the way actually if you really have
technical questions about processing in
p5 I would suggest you go and ask them
at forum dot processing Goerge so the
YouTube comments are a nice place to
give feedback and for me to hear from
you but it's not the best place to
discuss code or as technical questions
the forum is really the best place for
that you going to tweet me a link to a
post on the forum and I'll be able to
follow it and chime in there as well
okay so I'm gonna minimize the browser
here and so here I have what I want to
say I have both environments going but
this is actually the processing software
the desktop editor itself which is open
it's got a little window where I can
draw my where I can write my code it's
got the Run button up here it's got a
stop button it's got some stuff about
modes because something I can do is I
can actually switch to Python I can
actually do p5.js in the processing
editor as well the p5.js mode this these
modes won't necessarily be there for you
by default you'll need to go to this add
mode which opens something called the
contribution manager so which you can
add libraries and modes and tools and
and that sort of thing so this is
actually new interface for what's really
nice about having a desktop editor is
adding libraries or finding examples all
this can be done through the interface
itself with p5 the way that I'm going to
show you p5 right here is this is just
an editor called Adam Adam is made by
github it's open source it's free it
lets you type your code there's packages
you can install to like see your code
automatically in the browser or syntax
highlight in a different way or have
like special like keyboard commands but
any text editor I might suggest looking
at sublime or brackets or code pen which
is an online web editor and you know at
some point if people are interested I
can show make different videos with
different editors to see how different
people have those things set up so
that's the primary difference that right
in just sort of working in these
environments is processing my suggestion
is you just download it and use it with
p5 you want to find an editor that you
like or that a friend uses that they
recommend to you and work with it that
way and there's suggestions and
information about that also in the p5
Geoff's website and you can see that I
just have all the files associated with
the sketch right here there's my
JavaScript file which is where I type
the code there's an HTML file where I
can add HTML and if you dude my sort of
foundations of programming in p5 videos
go through what all those different
files do and then you know libraries
that I might want to add these are the
p5 libraries they're just JavaScript
files if I want to add other libraries
I've got to manually download them add
them to this folder or refer to them
libraries you can also refer to them
that on a web server somewhere through a
URL there's lots of different ways doing
it beyond the scope of what I'm doing in
this video
unlike processing we kind of have
everything all in one here now the other
difference is what happens when you
quote-unquote run your code so both of
these are a simple sketch both
processing and p5 are built with this
concept of setup and draw for an
animation program setup happens once to
kind of set up your program initialize
variables everything to start with draw
loops it's an animation loop because
most sketches and programs that you
might want to write you want an
animation and of course you can stop the
animation start the animation have no
animation do all sorts of different
other things but that's the sort of core
functionality so if I run a processing
sketch you'll see I get a window so
processing sketches are desktop
applications and actually I can go up
here
file export application and if I go to
export application what you're gonna see
is I can actually make a double
clickable application that I could
release or send for Windows Mac Linux I
couldn't make it
fullscreen I could in beneath Java to
run so here on Mac like if somebody does
it you can actually embed Java and
there's some goofiness with Apple and I
don't want to get into this but it's
definitely an issue with new operating
systems that Apple doesn't want you to
use applications that aren't like signed
and delivered and you know deigned
worthy of their operating system so to
speak so that can be a little bit tricky
but absolutely does work now p5 this is
just stuff that is web file so you could
put it on a web server on if you have a
web server cat you can watch have it on
your computer and open it up through the
browser and typically what I do is I run
a local server and I'm doing that
through terminal and I have other videos
that kind of walk through the steps of
that and then if I want to see the
result of my code I just go to the
browser and I have it here you can see
here I'm running a little web server
which then I can view the results of
that web server at an address called
localhost and my sketch is called QA
underscore p5 and 8000 refers to the
port and so at some point this is just
kind of like seeing how it works and
developing and then I might upload my
code and the URL would no longer say
localhost because my codes not on this
laptop but might be on my server
Schiffman net so that's a core
difference p5.js
is going to run your code and your to
see the results in the browser
processing it's gonna launch as a
desktop application there are some
things that actually make them quite
different then because for example I'm
gonna put fullscreen and setup and I'm
gonna say background frame count modulus
oh no no I'm not gonna write any crazy
code I'm just gonna say background 100
comma zero comma 200 and if I run this
processing now knows how to make a full
screen window automatically whatever my
resolution is and it's got this like
purple color so because if you're in a
desktop environment it's a little easier
I could say full screen I can actually
give it a number which is if I'm
connected to a projector it would go
straight to that projector and that sort
of
so but the main function you write in in
processing typically is size which would
make a window of 600 by 400 and when I
run that's what I've got here in p5 I'm
actually going to say create canvas
there's subtle differences the same
concept 600 by 400 and then I could take
this background code and I could put it
in here and that's identical and I could
now go and hit refresh and we can see I
have my whoops shoot I had the font
bigger here but I didn't want it bigger
there I could see and this by the way
over here is a JavaScript console that's
available as part of you under view
developer JavaScript console so this is
something I use a lot for debugging to
see error messages and so that's
something that you might want to figure
out how you get a console to see error
messages as part of your workflow as
well but I'm just using the chrome one
because it works pretty well yeah okay
so you can see that is this is the same
exact code but in two different
environments let's highlight some other
key differences Java syntax void
functions a Java is a typed language
meaning if a function I should say void
means it doesn't return anything if it's
going to return a number I have to say
what kind of thing in JavaScript I just
only ever say function same thing if I
want to add a variable float x equals
100 float y equals 100 and then I might
use the ellipse function ellipse X comma
Y 60 comma 60 right if I want to add
that code over here var X equals 100 VAR
y equals 100 add that here so you can
see very very similar but job because
here I'm writing in JavaScript so I
adopt JavaScript syntax over here I'm
writing in Java so I adopt Java syntax
Java is typed I always want to specify
float meaning it's a floating-point
number so I could say 100.7 that sort of
thing so now I can run this and we can
see I've got my ellipse and I can go
back to the browser and I can hit
refresh Oh what did I do
I forgot to hit save so I have to hit
tave and then I can hit refresh and I've
got my ellipse so you can see a lot of
the API is the same a lot of it a lot of
the API is the same but the syntax of
the language is different some things
you know variables are the same except
for type if statements are the same in
both if this if this no not this if
boolean expression else if else those
are the same loops for while are the
same objects and arrays are quite
different in both of those environments
and that would be beyond the scope of
what I'm doing in this particular video
but I do have tutorials on arrays in
both environments you could watch those
and sort n objects and sort of see what
the differences are at some point I
could come and highlight that sort of
stuff but so what I want to do so this
is kind of like a basic view of how
these two environments what I want to do
now is return to the whiteboard and and
what I want to do is return to the
whiteboard and make a list of sort of
pros and cons of each and talk about
speed or performance or features and
that sort of thing and kind of give you
a sense of why you might choose one
versus the other and then of course I
think it's also important to reference
some other programming languages
environments like C++ and perhaps open
frameworks or Python and some of the
data and number stuff and machine
learning kind of text working with text
and natural language processing kind of
types of things too and where you might
go outside of p5 the processing as well
so I'm going to get over the whiteboard
to have that discussion ok so what I
want to do now is kind of make a little
comparison chart between the two
environments and think about kind of
pros and cons of each and where you
might choose one for a certain project
or the other kind of depending on what
you're trying to do so I would say first
of all primary key thing here if you are
making something and you want to release
that thing on the web in a browser this
is where p5 excels p5 is a JavaScript
library you can publish your stuff to
the web in the way that you would
publish anything written in JavaScript
to the web you can integrate it with
HTML CSS you could do Dom manipulation
so in other words at
this sense I'll make another note here
which is GUI so four interface elements
if you want to have a text box that
people type their name in to interact
with your program or buttons and sliders
anything that you would natively have as
interface elements in a web browser you
can create those manipulate those work
with those using the p5.js library
there's actually a additional library
part of p5 which is p5.js then has a lot
of this functionality in it so that's
really a major major advantage here in
terms of the web processing you used to
be about exporting to the web with java
applets but now processing is really
desktop for desktop applications not
really for it you know you can still
make a java applet probably but i don't
know how much good that's gonna do you
that said there are interface libraries
for processing control p5 interface
there's probably some other ones but
they're they're often limited in terms
of how much you can style them or design
them or use them and it can be awkward
so and but but I will say an important
thing is though if interface is the
question you know this is both of these
environments have a drawing canvas so
you're only limited by your imagination
and time in terms of what kind of
interfaces you can invent but if you
want to prototype a quickie a quick
interface you just have like a text box
and some buttons you're gonna do that
much more easily in p5 you want to
invent your own design and style of
interface you know both these
environments will allow you to do that
simply by drawing it to the canvas so
that's kind of a key thing one thing I
would say here now perform but this is
also relates to performance so speed is
a big question here and I would say this
would go under the processing column now
there are certainly exceptions to this
you know speed and how performance is
always a complicated puzzle of many
different factors what are you doing
where's the environment what's the
computer but in general Java programs
particular ones that are iterating over
pixels are drawing many particles those
are going to run much faster in Java in
processing then they would canvas in the
browser a lot of that has to do with
the compiled verses interpreted language
you know how fast browsers are and that
all this stuff changes rapidly I'm sure
by the time you're watching this video
in the future from your floating you
know cloud car thing or whatever that
this will be truly irrelevant but but
this is something we're certainly if
what you're looking for is to eat as
much speed out of graphics itself
processing probably has a slight leg up
there now one big exception to that in a
way is anything that involves OpenGL or
3d so I'm gonna say OpenGL 3d now
processing has rendering environments
rendering modes called P 3d or PT 2d and
these make use of OpenGL rendering
OpenGL rendering is an engine that uses
the power of your computer's graphics
card as opposed to its regular processor
stuff to draw to your computer screen
and computers now have very fast and
powerful graphics cards so you can often
get a you could do 3d stuff and you can
often get a lot of additional speed by
drawing by using these rendering modes
now there is a something called WebGL
which is an implementation of opengl
stands for open graphics libraries for
the browser and there are there's a
wonderful library called 3jf which if
you're interested in doing 3d stuff for
the web you might want to explore p5 has
a WebGL rendering mode and so I would
you know I'm sure there's subtlety to
this but in many ways you would get
equivalent speeds in both of these
environments if you're using OpenGL
render because it all it does is really
depend on your graphics card but the
truth of the matter is WebGL is one of
the newer aspects of p5 and isn't fully
implemented yet prop as compared to P 3d
rendering and processing which has been
around for many years and has had a lot
of time to develop so for me I might say
if you want to do a complex
sophisticated 3d rendering system your
choices are you might want to lean
towards using process
but if you want it to be on the web you
might experiment with p5 WebGL mode but
you also might consider if you really
need to dive into more elaborate 3d
using something that's had more time to
develop and wait for this or come and
contribute to help make WebGL better of
course that you could all these things
are built on top of existing systems so
WebGL something you can just do natively
in the browser itself if you want to go
down that road and learn how that works
ok I'm pausing for a minute here where
we could probably edit out my thinking I
should go look because it probably gonna
it's certain point when I go look at
questions they have sure people have
specific questions I'm trying to think
of what would be worth mentioning next
ok so I'm gonna keep going now so
related to this performance thing and
related to desktop versus web is I might
add sort of in between here is like
installation based work I don't know
what I mean by that but like kiosks or
projection mapping or interactive museum
exhibits that sort of thing processing
is very geared towards that kind of work
now I showed you that it has the
function fullscreen which gives you high
speed fullscreen graphics you can
control very easily which projector if
you're connected to a bunch of
projectors spanning across them
processing because it now is desktop
application environment has access to do
all the sort of like high speed
fullscreen kind of stuff now of course
you can make your browser fullscreen and
so you could do all this stuff in p5 as
well but this is I suppose if I'm
thinking about I'm making a project and
I want it to live on the web for people
to experience then we've got a lot of
advantages to p5 I'm making a project
and I wanted to live in a museum
kiosk environment then you might have
some advantages to processing and I
should mention here that a lot of these
all the things that I'm saying a
processing another environment that you
might explore sometime related this is
something called open frameworks can you
actually see this and open frameworks
there's also environment called cinder
both these are actually just really
libraries they don't have an editor
associated with them so they have
tutorials and these are creative coding
open source frameworks for C++ and so if
you're looking to like squeeze every
inch of speed out you can like you know
processing nowadays especially using P
3d and a really fast computer I think
you're probably get a lot of comparable
but certainly working in C++ because
you're kind of have a lower level access
to the computer I talked about this or
Java Virtual Machine that layer limits
the performance you can get even more
speed and especially if you're doing
computer vision also there are so many
computer vision libraries that are
written in C++ so you have quick
integration with them and there a lot of
great examples and certainly 3d
rendering and all that stuff but a
little off topic but I this would seem
like an important point to mention
especially in the context of doing
installation kiosk based work so another
piece of this is integrating with
hardware ah
and how about data let's talk about data
first so data I would put right between
these two things because both of these
environments have features and
functionality for working with data so
both of them have a function called load
table I'm gonna write it over here load
table allows you to load a spreadsheet
and work with it in processing to
visualize or crunch numbers or do
whatever p5 also has that function but
I'm gonna write over here load JSON so
both of them have low JSON a load table
the reason why I'm putting load table
over here and load JSON over here is one
point that I might make is let's say you
have the massive data set and you want
to create this like big poster size
print about this like massive data set
processing being a Java based desktop
environment is probably going to have an
easier time loading into memory and
working with large data sets p5 just
running in the browser probably gonna
have easier time with smaller data sets
but because it's written in JavaScript a
lot of data comes from API said with
JSON file formats that's really easy to
work with in JavaScript because
JSON stands for JavaScript object
notation that's what javascript is made
for that's the same syntax so this while
you can load JSON that's Java syntax for
with JSON is quite a bit more awkward it
works so in that sense you could work
with data and certainly since you're on
the web and in the browser you know a
lot of working with API is if you find a
tutorial for like how to use this API
it's most likely going to be geared
towards working in a web-based
environment like JavaScript and so you
you know in that sense there could be
good reasons for working with certain
kind of web-based datasets
it's p5 there could be good reasons for
parsing and crunching there's a lot of
functionality features of how you can
manipulate data in processing and kind
of work with larger data sets so that's
I think an important aspect another
thing that I would put here is hardware
so there are because processing is a
project that's been around for over 15
years now there are so many third-party
libraries that you can add through the
interface that I showed you to work with
things like the Kinect or the leap
motion or in Arduino or you know a
joystick or some other like you know
Brayton sensor thing so generally
speaking if there's a Java interface
towards a piece of hardware there's
probably a way to do it
in processing and a lot of people that
with kind of common hardware interfaces
have encountered this and published an
open-source library for it now the thing
is you can also use hardware with p5 for
example the leap motion if you go to the
leap motion web sites there is there's a
JavaScript library so if you see a
JavaScript library you don't and this is
actually kind of a fundamental
difference if a Java library will work
with processing but you might have a
hard time unless someone's made a
processing version of that Java library
with an ax as a bridge you are there
ways around that of course but that's
but p5 if you find a JavaScript library
you could just plug it right in because
you don't really need a separate p5
library for the leap motion you just
need the leap motion JavaScript library
that you can use in your code but one
tricky thing about hardware is the
browser has so many security
restrictions so the browser can't read
fiery files on your fold on your hard
drive it can't just talk to your camera
without you giving it permission that
sort of thing whereas those security
restrictions aren't there for desktop
applications so a lot of hardware while
you can't access in both environments
you likely need something
it's an act in the middle and I'm just
going to write node here and there is a
project called p5 serial which is a node
server that you can run to get serial
communication from an Arduino to p5
whereas a lot of that stuff you can do
just more natively right here in
processing if I gone below and I'm at
the bottom of what you can see okay so
that I think is an important aspect of
this as well so I'm sure I'm sure I
missed a whole bunch of things here this
is just kind of what came to the top of
my head right now
so I'm gonna go and check the live chat
if you're watching this as an archive
video there's no live chat but I'm gonna
see if there are some questions about
and I'll answer some of those to sort of
wrap up or fill in some of the gaps that
I've got going here all right
