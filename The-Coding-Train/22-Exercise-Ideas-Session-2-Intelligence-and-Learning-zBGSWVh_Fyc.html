two of intelligence and learning a
course that I'm teaching right now in
2017 but you a alien of the future
watching I am Daniel chief mod human
being of Earth okay anyway um oh I've
got some sort of evolutionary problem
good absolutely
anyway you're here you could do a
homework assignment so there were so
many videos in this session did you
actually watch all of them if you did
thank you that's wonderful now I'm
curious to see what kind of creative
projects what's kind of interesting new
innovative or just experimental or fun
useless ideas can you implement by
exploring genetic algorithms and other
kinds of evolutionary algorithms
algorithms so one thing that you might
think about is starting with this
Shakespeare monkey example which made up
the first four videos of this particular
series and what if you were trying to
evolve as a target something that wasn't
text what slows music or perhaps imagery
what if you think of each character as a
vector path and like an SVG kind of
shape or even each character as a pixel
and there are some really interesting
ways actually I'm gonna just write here
in this video over to Google this
project evolved Monalisa genetic
algorithm I hope this is going to come
up with the right thing that I'm
thinking about yeah so this is a
wonderful explanation and I'm going to
actually maybe click it click on this
one I'm back I actually just found the
link while I wasn't making this anyway
you get the idea I did will edit there
so you could think about evolving a
image by having the genetic material
actually be a list of polygons with
certain colors positioned in certain
ways and look at this over time if I run
this for a while on this is example of
evolving an image to look like a Mona
Lisa of course you could pick any other
image to go to input and this is also a
oh this is implementation this this this
is a this is an implementation of Roger
all Singh's idea which I'm going to
click on this particular link and this
described
the process and how this was developed
so that's something you could explore
I've looked into a coding challenge
actually trying to implement something
like this but it you could explore that
and you've got the tools for doing that
right here in this in this particular
example okay some other homework ideas
that you might consider you might think
about improvements you could make on the
smart Rockets example maybe just adding
you know just simply from a design idea
like this is my smart my smart Rockets
example you know the design leaves a lot
to be desired and what are some other
more complex ways you could think about
the obstacles the target does the target
move around what's the design of these
rockets this is something you could
certainly explore and then really I
think how could you think about the
interactive selection problem so if you
remember my interactive selection
example it simply just these like really
crude designs of spaces with a couple
squares and a circle but what's how
could you take a design a font a shape a
drawing and how can you encode that
drawing and be virtualized digital DNA
and how could you have users then rate
those drawings those designs to evolve
towards some other and get new imagery
out of that so I think that's an
exciting possibility thinking about
music evolving music in that way our
user listens to music wait music just
even mini sequence those are things you
could you could try so anyway um finally
I would encourage you to think about I'm
going to go to this particular example I
would encourage you to think about
continuous systems and improvements that
you might make on steering agents
autonomous agents moving throughout
through space you know this is just food
and poison but what if you add a lot
more would get other elements to the
environment predators what if you add
the idea of mating so they have to be
near each other to produce a new
creature for the next generation there's
a lot of possible things that they could
explore so anyway this is me randomly
giving useful ideas of things you could
try if you mixed up please let me know
in the comments share them with me
shipment on Twitter and I will see you
in session three which will which
session three is going to be about
classification and regression so I'll
see you in those videos if you choose to
watch them okay good bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
