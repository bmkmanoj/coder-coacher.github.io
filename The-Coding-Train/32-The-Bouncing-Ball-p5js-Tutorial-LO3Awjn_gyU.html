to look at a kind of classic problem
that comes up in programming graphics
when you're first getting started that
requires a conditional statement you
really need an if statement for this
problem and the problem is this so here
I have a little bit of an example here
we can see there's one variable x equals
zero there's a canvas I'm drawing that a
circle at that X and X every time
through draw is increasing incrementing
by three what will the result of that be
this circle that moves across the screen
and it leaves and it never comes back so
the problem that we need to look at here
in this particular video is how do we
get that circle to turn around and come
back okay so I'm going to come over here
for a second and the topic if you just
watch the previous video we are looking
at conditional statements conditional
statements an if statement has this
format if open parentheses close
parentheses open curly braket close
curly bracket and some sort of boolean
expression true or false goes in here so
let's think about what is the condition
that has to be met in order for that
circle the ball so to speak to turn
around so this is the canvas here is the
circle it's moving along if the location
of this circle is at the edge that's the
condition so that's the condition for
which it should turn around so you might
think what's the name of the variable X
so if X is equal to width you might
think that this is where you want to get
started and this is not completely
illegitimate I mean this could work and
it's sort of the right idea if the
circle location equals the width of the
window that's when you want to turn it
or turn around
why I feel like I want to start this one
over again but I'm just gonna keep going
look it going that's starting over okay
so but this this isn't really good think
about it first of all I am in in the
program that I just showed you X is
going up by 3 each time x equals x plus
3 goes up by 3 it goes up by 3 it goes
up by 3 so if the width of the window is
like
200 it might not ever actually X might
not ever actually equal 200 it might be
at like you know 197 well they don't be
at 200 but you know whatever is
divisible by 3 up there near 200 so this
isn't really good we need a condition
that will no matter what catch that
circle before before it goes too far off
the screen and if you could think about
that a nice condition for that might be
if X is greater than you could use
greater than or equals but I'm just
going to use greater than if X is
greater than with what do something so
first let's just make sure this is the
right idea so let's come back over here
and now we can add hi back over here we
can add this to this particular program
and I'm standing in front of it too much
you scooch this over scooch this over
that's a little bit better so I'm going
to add if X is greater than with and
remember with with is a built-in
variable in p5 that knows inherently the
width of the canvas and where does it
get that value it gets it from here it's
used I could have put 600 I could put
600 over I'm looking I could have put
600 down there but if I ever change the
canvas size its you know then I don't
have to change the number elsewhere in
the program so using these built-in
variables a useful thing so I'm going to
you know you may not have seen this but
I'm going to add a print statement so
something you can always do in p5 is say
println which means print line I'm going
to print a line down here in the console
that's going to say off the screen so we
should only see that message print if X
is greater than width so let's run this
and we can see I don't see the message I
don't see the message I don't see the
message I see the message so you can see
our if statement works it only triggered
printing that as soon as it left the
screen so now you have to ask yourself
what what's the what's the thing we put
there what what do you put there in
order to have it to go backwards ok so
here's what here's what you might be
thinking it's not right here's what you
might be thinking if going forwards is x
equals x plus 3 then going backwards is
maybe x equals x minus 3 right so if X
is greater than width then go backwards
ok technical mishap
camera is working again now where were
we we were looking at this particular
scenario we need to get that circle to
turn around
we know it's moving to the right because
it's increasing by three every time
through draw so when it gets to the edge
it should decrease by 3 X equals X minus
3 now this is flawed logic but it sort
of has this almost intuitive idea that
it might be right we need to figure out
why is it wrong and what's the correct
way to do it which will hopefully help
you understand about how conditional
statements work even more so let me run
it and let's see what the problem is so
it's moving to the edge now that if
statement is true and it moves back by 3
but what does it do the next line it
moves up by 3 again then it comes around
this draw again is it over the edge yeah
move back by 3 and then move up by 3 so
this didn't really solve our problem I
just moved it back once and then this
line of code is still executing what we
need to do is figure out a way to
permanently have the the circle stop
increasing by 3 permanently stop
increase this decrease by 3 we need the
third number 3 to turn into a negative 3
for the next many cycles through draw
and how do we do that how do you need to
do that the way to do that is with a
variable so let's look at this again
let's say I say if I have a variable
speed equals 3 and then I say x equals x
plus speed I'm going to take this out so
X is always changing by whatever the
value of that variable speed is and when
the program starts that speed variable
is three it's three it's three it's
three is three oh what do we want it to
be willing to turn around what if we
made that speed variable negative three
now x equals x plus negative three is an
equivalent of x equals x minus three so
all I need to do here is say speed
equals negative three so at a certain
moment speed equals negative three and
when we get to the edge Beegle there
it's moving around and now it's coming
back and goodbye
so for you with this exercise you might
think about okay what if it's also
moving up and down how do you
the top and bottom edges how do you deal
just with the right and left edge how
might you have a change color or change
size how could you have other things
about the circle change every time it
hits boundary maybe it's speed even
changes so each time it hits it starts
going faster and faster there are lots
of little variations on this that you
could try that I might recommend doing
to kind of keep playing with this idea
of a conditional statement and in the
next video what I want to look at is
something that is kind of missing here
is what if I want to say if it's greater
than width do this otherwise do
something else so this idea of an else
or an else if it's thing we need to look
at we can also join boolean logic with a
and and an or you know if I'm feeling
nervous and scared then I don't know
don't make videos about programming um
or if I'm feel you get the idea and then
or so those are the things I need to
look at in the next video which I will
do so I'm going to hit stop here and um
you're going to not be watching it
anymore okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
