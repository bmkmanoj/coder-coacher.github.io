video this is a beginner video for for
those of you who haven't learned
anything about programming before we're
going to look at p5.js I discussed what
p5.js is a bit more about what this is
in the previous video in this video the
only topic here and this is a hopefully
a pretty easy one is a coordinate system
and shapes what does that mean so one of
the first things that I would like to
show you in learning to program is
drawing so there's a lot more to
programming than drawing in fact this is
a tiny piece if what you're interested
is is programming you know games or
animations a lot of that is graphics and
drawing but in terms of what you can do
on the web having different things talk
to each other interacting with the user
you know analyzing data all sorts of
tools just to you know do good in the
world there's lots more that you can do
besides drawing but drawing is a nice
place to start it's not for everybody
but if you are a visual designer or sort
of like to draw or like to do things
visually it is that it can be a useful
and easy way to start learning the
basics of programming so but hopefully
later I'm going to do a lot more videos
that just sort of look at the text and
data and that have a little bit less to
do with drawing for those of you might
be interested in that okay so in order
to draw we need a canvas so this is the
canvas now if I want to draw something
in the canvas that canvas on this board
I will take this pen and I will just do
this there I drew something now
programming is the act of giving
instructions to the computer to follow
so whereas I just kind of did some sort
of mojo in the moment thing with my mind
to draw that rectangle if we want if you
want that rectangle to appear on the
screen you need to write the
instructions for that so the instruction
that you need to learn get to give it as
a command
really what it is is a function and I
can't say this word function enough
because function
this idea of a function is completely
fundamental to the way everything works
in JavaScript so this is kind of our
first first view of the function there
is a function called rect so if we think
of that as command you say rect the rect
would appear there in the window however
in the canvas it will not because I need
to say where it should go and how big it
should be so so how do we tell the
computer how to draw that rectangle so
the way that that happens is through the
use of something called arguments so
when I issue this command rect
ie draw a rectangle I also have to
specify some arguments and the arguments
to that rectangle but there they come in
the form of numbers and are separated by
commas and enclosed in parenthesis with
the line being ended by a semicolon so
this is a moment that we have to just
admit something to ourselves which is
that syntax is a thing you have to deal
with with programming so with the human
language that we speak to each other in
my case it's English and is um broken
bad versions of some other languages but
we can say things very informally you
know draw a rectangle would you please
draw a rectangle kindly my friend over
there could would you make a rectangle
happen on the screen by moving your pen
around there's all sorts of different
ways we could say that you were I could
say that but here I I have to say in a
very specific way by missing a comma if
I'm missing a parenthesis it's not going
to work we'll get an error message I'll
show you how to get what happens when
you get that error message is how to fix
it but this is something that is
important that you're going to have to
start to get comfortable with that I you
know I don't know if I'm ever going to
be comfortable with but it's something
it exists so that's the syntax now what
goes in these blank spots so here you're
the things that go there and X location
a y location a width and a height so
this brings up a key point what what if
I mean by X location Y location and for
some of you that might be the most
obvious thing especially if you've done
stuff with computer
ethics before but for some of you it
might be quite new so what I would like
to do very briefly is take a look at a
different context this sort of middle
school or high school geometry class
context so this is this is a graph of a
Cartesian plane a name for Rene
Descartes the mathematician this is
what's known as the x-axis this is
what's known as the y-axis and if I have
a point over here I could describe that
point in terms of an x and a y what is
that points x and y well I can tell you
that the center right here is the point
0 0 that gives us a clue the x-axis
moves this way positively and this way
negatively so 1 2 3 so the x location of
this point is the number 3 and now we
could say 1 2 3 4 Y moves upwards
positively the Y location of that point
is the number 4 so this point has an x
value of 3 a y value of 4
now let's get this canvas again this is
our canvas the thing we're going to draw
on think that I'm I got something we
it's like it's my own personal pet peeve
to myself the thing that I've got to
draw on you might draw on whatever this
canvas how does this map to this canvas
well the truth the thing is computer
graphics doesn't work this way there's a
similar idea there's an x-axis and a
y-axis but zero zero at least for what
we're doing right now this will change
later is not in the center the top
left-hand corner of our graphics window
or canvas is defined as 0 0 and X moves
positively in this direction Y moves
positively in this direction so this is
the x axis and this is the y axis now
the other thing that sort of key here is
that use these kind of like hokey small
numbers and zoomed in kind of counting
and looking at it it's kind of not
relevant for the creative kinds of
programming things that I'm going to
show you in this canvas here because
typically speaking I'm going to say open
a canvas
that has a width of 640 maybe like a
height of 360 so I'm going to open a
large window with lots of pixels
millions of pixels so if you know we
could just sort of guesstimate here for
now but if I said oh an x value of 100
where's 100 going to be a little less
than a 6 of the way you know I don't
know maybe it's over here somewhere
maybe I say a Y location of 200 and it's
like down here somewhere maybe a say
with a 75 and height of 150 but you know
I end up seeing a rectangle like this oh
that's point but not drawn to scale so
you know the reason why I'm doing this
in a totally like messy I'm getting it
all wrong kind of way is I think a nice
way to like figure this out is just
through trial and error the key is the
syntax I need to know what is my
function name
what is the command I'm issuing
rectangle rect what are the arguments it
expects an X location a Y location a
width and a height formulate the syntax
and get it in the window now let's go ah
there's so much here now look at this
this let's let's actually just make that
happen so I'm going to say my canvas is
is 640 by 360 you can see that there
I've specified the size of the canvas
and now the rectangle is I said
something like 100 you can look at it
now I said 100 200 and then 75 and
coming back over here 75 150 so you can
see now I entered those in as the
arguments rectangle 100 275 150 so now
moment of truth let's hit this button up
here this button by the way this green
button right here this is what's known
as the play button it's kind of an
absurd thing to have a play button like
we're playing our code really what we're
doing is we're executing an application
we're launching the software that I've
written here this exciting piece of
software here that makes the canvas and
draws a rectangle but it's nice to kind
of have this model of thinking of it as
a media player so the next thing I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna press this button
and we're going to see here we go
so you can see now that this is what the
canvas actually looks like it's 6
pixels why sorry it's to 360 pixels high
and the rectangle is at 100 on the
x-axis and about 200 pixels down 75
across 150 down so you can kind of see
how that works you can see here that I
this was kind of incorrect my estimation
but you know over here now you can see I
got not really what I wanted I didn't
want the rectangle to go so far to the
bottom so I'm going to change it from
150 to 150 to 125 and hit stop hit play
again and you can see there it is
there's my rectangle in a different
location so this is really actually this
is kind of it for this first stage but
there's there's there's two more there's
a couple more pieces here I'm looking
how much time that I've taken there's a
couple more pieces that I want to look
at briefly one is there are more shapes
in life than a rectangle some that you
might look at just now if you're
beginning to learn is ellipse away if
there's a way of drawing a circle but
you can also you can draw this you can
draw this you can draw a nice circle you
might look at line you might look at arc
that's kind of a tricky one yeah those
are pretty good rectal itch I might look
at point there are a whole bunch of
these and they all expect some amount of
arguments and you you could guess to
give it like well rectangle needed an X
Y and a width and a height maybe ellipse
also needs an XY to width and height and
to draw a line well what could a line
need okay well a line is a thing a line
a bunch of pixels that connect two
points well how could I say how to draw
a line Oh what if I give the XY of one
point and the XY of another point that
would tell you how to draw a line so you
could guess all this but the point of
doing this is not to guess or memorize
there is a reference that will list you
what are all the possible functions and
what are the arguments it expects so if
I come over here the thing that I would
like to show you is I'm going to go now
to the p5.js website and this is kind of
where you should start look at this view
animation you should start by looking at
well there's a lot of places you could
start you might need to download the
editor which I think I showed in a
previous video maybe I did it there's
some tutorials here there's more under
learn under start but what I want to
look at right now is reference so I'm
going to click reference and what I
would like to look at is shape so I
think this is a good place for you to
start if you're looking for an
assignment or an exercise to do at the
end of this video
look at all these functions our ellipse
line point quad rect triangle and in
fact this is what I love about working
in JavaScript let's look at the line
function you can see here okay look
that's it this is an example for how you
draw a line but I don't even I can just
go and play around with this right here
and see how does that change it so you
can see here but this is what this is
what's important this is what matters to
you this is the syntax line expects for
arguments you can also call them
parameters get into the difference but
it expects for parameters X Y x1 y1 x2
y2 that's connecting a line it's
connecting two points the parameters is
here and here they are defined so this
is what you need to get used to doing so
you see sort of the basics I can open up
a project in the editor I can type code
in there I know I need to know about
syntax now I kind of have a sense of the
coordinate system but you've got to get
used to all of these different shapes
what are the shapes that you can draw
and and how do you do them so what I
would say on your own I think this is I
could go through all these but I think
it's much more useful to do on your own
to try all these play with and even just
in the p5 website itself but there's a
last people for a end this video there's
a last piece of something that I want to
talk about let me come back here I kind
of just glossed over this create canvas
thing and I also really haven't
mentioned that's what is this function
set up it was this function draw so
these are going to become much more
clear in future times in like the next
in a future video that I will spend a
lot of time looking at set up and draw
but the the deal is I said that
functions are apps
lutely fundamental to the way that
javascript works everything is kind of
come boy 'old down to a function and the
first functions that you are learning to
write oops sorry wrote it wrong look
like this so your code has to live
somewhere it has to live ultimately and
there's you know all sorts of there's
more to it than this but for now let's
think of this let's think of this
statement your code has to live inside a
function right now there are only two
places two functions to put your code
there's the set up function and the draw
function the set up function which you
say function set up and we'll get to
what these parentheses are these curly
brackets define the beginning and end of
that function the set up function is
where you do the things you do right
when your program starts like create
canvas so when you're to set up your
canvas to set up your key 5 sketch you
need to create a canvas in the setup
function then you want to draw stuff to
that canvas where do you put all your
drawing stuff inside the strong function
so there's more to it because we're
going to we're going to need to make
things animate we're going to need to do
something when someone clicks the mouse
and on how we handle different events
and how the program flows over time
we'll get I will get into this more and
more in a future video and we can look
back here we can see there it is setup
has create canvas draw has rectangle you
know try to make a design of a something
interesting for yourself and hopefully
this video was somewhat useful okay I'm
gonna stop down are so many different
stop buttons everywhere I'm gonna find
the one to stop this video
oh my mouse went dead okay here we go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
