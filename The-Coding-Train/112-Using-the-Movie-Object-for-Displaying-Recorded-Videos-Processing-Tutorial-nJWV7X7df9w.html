at a few key differences between using a
recorded file a file for a quartic movie
from a file versus a live capture object
from a live camera so um we saw that
there that we could make a new capture
object and we have to give a width and a
height of frames per second we've used
the keyword this all the same thing is
true with a movie object actually done
put another thing is the same thing is
not true we do have to make eight use
make a new movie object and we have to
use the keyword this but we don't give a
width and a height a frame rate what we
need to do is reference a particular
file so just like you could load an
image from your data folder you can load
a movie file from your data folder and
then this is a p image so you can use
the image function the tint function you
can look at the pixels but we need a few
more key pieces just like we had that
capture event what we need a movie event
where we're going to read images from
the movie as the movies playing let's
give us the current frame the current
frame the current frame but I think a
bit more important than that in terms of
the difference here is that there are
some functions like jump the jump
function allows you to jump to a certain
spot in the movie so if you want to
whenever the user clicks the mouse go
back to the beginning of the movie you
can do that by saying jump zero and this
is in seconds processing uses seconds to
to mark what point in the movie is a
floating point number so you could say
if your key thing happens at you know
103 point seven seconds you can jump to
that spot in the movie but the time
function gives you the current moment in
time where is the movie currently the
duration function gives you the length
of the movie in seconds which is a
useful piece of information to know if
you want to go to the middle you go to
duration divided by two and there's also
some functions like speed which will
allow you to speed up the playback so if
I
put speed and I put the number two in
here it's going to play back twice as
fast you can actually use a negative
number to make the movie play in Reverse
but only certain codecs codec being the
format by which the file is encoded how
that movie file was made support that so
there is some bugginess here with with
speed with with reverse with speed in
particular this often evens a little bit
of bugginess with using jump and that
sort of thing but for the most part you
can use these functions to really mess
around with how you playback a movie so
let's just let's just come over here and
kind of see that I'm using a sample
movie file that's in all the examples
that come with processing so if I were
to change this from capture to movie and
I'm going to say make a new movie and
the name of my movie file is called
transit dot move and I don't with a
movie instead of saying start you're
going to say play and better yet I can
actually say loop what loop will do is
when it gets to the end it will start so
if you want a video to loop and then
instead of capture event we've got a
movie event and then I should be able to
draw it so if I run this we should see
this video file playing back and as you
can see in the data folder there is just
a movie files in the data folder there
it is here it is being displayed in the
processing sketch and it's looping and
just to see a few of these features if I
were to say video dot speed 4 and run
this you should see that it's playing
four times as fast I could certainly try
doing something like you know have a
rate which map Mouse X between 0 and the
width between 0 &amp;amp; 4 and then I could say
movie speed R so this is me just
dynamically in real time oh it's called
video in this the variable name is video
here what I'm doing is saying like okay
well depending on where the mouse is
that's how fast I want to play the movie
so I can like slow it down or I can
speed it up you can see there's some
jumpiness it's not as perfectly smooth
here but this I this is the kind of
thing that you
and do play it back a reverse I could
mess with the pixels I could stop it I
could pause it I could start it I could
read anything you could do with other
images you could do with the movie file
- so I don't want to get let's just
let's just look at jump just put in a
mouse pressed here just to show that
that works I'm going to say movie dot
jump and at two three seconds wherever
it is in three seconds
let's call video I keep remembering that
okay so this now it's playing back and
whenever I click the mouse it should
jump to that point three seconds into
them to the file so you can see here a
lot of you know some basic manipulation
of a video file you can do in terms of
stopping starting and jumping around but
I just wanted to have a quick video that
demonstrates some of these key features
and you know as an exercise you might
just go back say I made some stuff with
static images I made some stuff with
live capture let me see if I can slot in
a movie and manipulate its pixels and do
try one of these those other examples
with a movie file as well okay that's
the end of this video which was only
five minutes and 30 seconds long
excellent okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
