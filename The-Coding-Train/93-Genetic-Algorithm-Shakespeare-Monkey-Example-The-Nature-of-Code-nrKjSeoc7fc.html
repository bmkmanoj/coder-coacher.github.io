genetic algorithms video series I'm
almost ready to like dive in and
actually start looking at all the pieces
of the code and how they implement the
actual genetic algorithm itself but what
I want to do in this example you can see
that genetic algorithm just ran and it
arrived at the phrase to be or not to be
what I want to do is just kind of run
this example a bunch of times while
tweaking various parameters of the
system and look at kind of what all the
pieces here of the example running are
so here's the algorithm I have it for
reference that we could come back to and
first thing I want to do is just run
this example this is this is running in
the browser this example is programmed
in p5.js I will show you at the end of
this video I'll just run the same thing
in processing to show you the Java code
as well and you can see in the talking
there in the talk am I talking it
evolved this system evolved to be or not
to be that is just to be or not to be
period so one thing you can see in this
example is that I'm kind of drawing on
the right side here all of the various
current elements of the population and
you can see those current elements of
the population at this point where the
program stops where one of them is the
exact correct phrase you can see here
what they look like and if i refresh the
page you can see you can see the
population itself started to get closer
and closer to that correct phrase and
eventually it's going to stop and here's
just sort of a selection of those
members of the population you can also
see over here I'm kind of having the
program always show you the current
elements of the population with the
highest fitness and you can see that
over here and you can see this is the
current element of the population with
the highest fitness eventually that will
be 100% fitness to be or not to be and
then I'm also showing you how many
generations so this happened in 514
generations
what's the average fitness remember the
fitness function calculates the
percentage of characters correct from 0
to 100% how many characters does the
phrase have correct you can see the
average pop Fitness goes up over time it
doesn't get to 100% because when one of
the phrases has the correct the correct
one of the elements of operations the
correct phrase the rest of them still
don't have the correct phrase and then
also showing you the total population
and the mutation rate so before I get
into the code I even just want to change
a couple variables here and show you a
little bit
about how the system behaves so for
example what happens if i take this
mutation rate and these the the maximum
population and the mutation rate are
simply just variables in the code
there's also a target phrase right so I
could actually just change this program
right now to be unicorn I've never done
this and run it again you can see how
quickly it only tip with a short phrase
when we took five generations to get
unicorn come up with your I'm going to
go back to to be or not to be I'm going
to take the mutation rate and make it
zero and now I'm going to run this again
now notice what's going on it's kind of
sort of settled into something
look all the members of the population
actually have exactly the same sequence
of characters the best phrase is not
changing and the total generation is
just going up and up and up and up and
up so this is a scenario where if there
is no mutation there was not enough
variation at the start to actually
evolve the phrase right there was no
initial member of the population with an
O as the one two three four five six
seventh character so this is something
you really have to be careful of this
mutation is route now one thing I could
do is just say well the total population
was only 200 so I could make the total
population a thousand and look we
actually got to the best phrase the
target phrase in 44 generations with no
mutation so with a population of 1000
elements there is actually plenty of
variation you know we can see what
happens by the way I don't know if I
just have a population of one well I
broke it let's give it a population of
two that broke it all so a ten right you
can see oh this me I love this this page
is in Norwegian
sadducees so with with only two members
of the population
we got a phrase that's in Norwegian okay
so you can see how this the size of the
initial population is quite relevant now
let me let's talk about something here
that's kind of important little factor
also let's go back to that population of
a thousand we can see I was able to
involve the correct phrase in forty one
generations very quickly now let me make
the population max of five thousand
twenty seven generations even more
quickly let me give it a little bit of
mutation one percent mutation rate it
took longer that time but this is sort
of randomly I'm getting it rather loud
noise there I'm getting it rather
quickly one of the I should mention here
is you have to remember this is an
artificial problem that I've designed to
demonstrate a genetic algorithm I'm not
actually trying to get to be or not to
be the fastest because I could do all
sorts of things like okay I know what
the answer is so when a when a member of
the population has the correct the
correct character I could actually just
use that correct character and make sure
I put that in the next year there's all
sorts of things I could do to actually
try to get to the answer more
efficiently
like just say print line to be or not to
be but so but what we want to do here is
just sort of look at how does the
genetic algorithm behave and perform
changing some of these variables but you
I kind of got off track there and I sort
of meant to talk about that later but
whatever it's fine um here's the thing I
could keep ramping up the population max
thinking it's going to be faster and
faster and now I have the population max
of fifteen thousand characters and you
can see that I was able to get to be or
not to be in thirty generations but look
how slow the kind of frame rate so to
speak of each generation the program
starts to run slower and slower and
slower like if I were to have a hundred
thousand members of the population I
think I might have just crashed I've
practically crashed the browser here
like I might be able to it's running so
there's a trade-off here having a large
population helps because you have a
larger Matt larger pool to start with in
terms of very
but once your population is so large the
computation can become rather slow that
it just takes forever to get there so
even though I might have gotten there in
25 generations it took much longer than
if I just said 1,000 members of the
population which you can actually crunch
through really really fast might take
more generations but actually happens
faster so that's another important thing
that's another important thing for me to
mention another thing that I should
mention here is that the mutation rate
itself but I haven't started looking at
the coast yet the mutation rate itself
is also a prime key factor you know more
mutation you think might help but what
if I say point one like 10 percent
mutation if the mutation rate is so high
that those mutations have been so often
it's almost akin back to that brute
force solution where everything's just
random in the first place for example at
50 percent everything becomes almost
completely unrecognizable in the sort of
like list of the population and if I
were to make the mutation rate 100
percent this is actually complete and
total randomness okay so thanks for
watching this particular video in the
next video I'm actually going to peel
open tert like pull open whatever this
like I'm going to open a suitcase or
pull a curtain something correctly look
at the code itself go back to this
algorithm what are the pieces of this
algorithm and where are those pieces of
code and how are the different
techniques working to make this
algorithm run</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
