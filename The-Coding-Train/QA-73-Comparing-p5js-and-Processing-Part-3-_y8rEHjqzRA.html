video about the differences between
p5.js and processing and in this video
I'm going to make a list of pros and
cons I have to admit the list is gonna
be kind of a complete mess a terrible
diagram maybe somebody on the internet
will make some kind of group editable
document diagram thing that looks much
more beautiful that we can all share it
enjoy it like look at but in any case
I'm gonna go through kind of pros and
cons and kind of features of these
environments and where it might make
sense to pick one over the other
and that sort of thing and there's no
hard and fast rules here I'm going to do
my best in LA i'm also going to answer
some questions from the chat so I'll see
you maybe at the end of this video maybe
I'll see you in the middle maybe I don't
actually see anybody because I'm just
looking at a camera but you're a real
person
thanks for watching so question number
one that came from the chat is what
about auto completion just processing or
p5 have Auto completion well first thing
I should say is p5 in the sense that
I've shown you as like find your own
editor it's really about does the editor
that you're using have a plug-in or
feature that does auto completion what
is auto completion auto completion is
when you're typing like ellipse or
background and the editor itself gives
you a suggestion to kind of fill that in
for you and processing 3 does actually
have this as a feature so if I go to the
preferences we can see here that code
completion with control space so if I
were to enable this I could get code
completion and let me give that a try
right now so I'm gonna check this and
we'll see if I have to restart
processing which I don't think I need to
do so and I could say something like F I
and then say control space and you can
see now I'm getting suggestions of do I
want to type in fill filter or finish
and I want to do fill so I type it in
and it actually would give me commas
there if it had multiple arguments and I
can say I want to make it some color and
I could run it again and we can see
there we go now I have it green so there
is code completion in processing but p5
you know this this one let me publish a
web editor we could discuss like does it
have it doesn't it have it but this is a
feature that's part of the processing
editor question for a potato kaboom is
asking about eclipse and processing so
one thing that you can do is you can
you make processing sketches and use the
processing libraries outside of the
processing editor and you can do that
with any Java editor like IntelliJ or
eclipse or NetBeans is one I think I
happen to use eclipse quite a bit and I
do intend to make a video to show you
how to make processing sketches in
Eclipse and it we'll get to that soon as
part of this sort of series about these
different environments
hng hng skj in the chat rightz what
about shaders so shaders are really a
shader is a program of g GL Sol graphics
language shader language GS I think I
got that right
whatever this is something that's part
of WebGL so processing as part of the p3
rendering mode natively has a way to
load shaders and change properties and
shaders maybe open with one of the
examples p5 shader support in WebGL is
coming soon as a feature that's in
development if you're a shader or WebGL
expert want to contribute to that jump
on to the p5 github and you can sort of
try to find search in the issues for
WebGL and you probably find where that
is so let me at least briefly just show
you here if I go to file examples in
processing and I go under shaders here
under topics I could pick one like I
don't know it's a good one
let's let's try a glassy fisheye that
sounds like fun and so if I run this
particular example you can see that
there are these P shader I'm standing in
front of it I know these PA door objects
and you can see what this particular
every time I click I guess it changes
some properties and so this is using a
shader so
shaders itself are beyond the scope of
this particular video but I certainly
would love to come and do some tutorials
about shaders or have a guest do that at
some point soon turkey Turkey in the
chat asks about mobile so this is I
completely forgot to add that here here
is something we can really put we can
put in both columns but the wonderful
thing about working in a browser-based
environment is you've got mobile
essentially for free because what you
program to run on a browser on a desktop
computer can run on a browser on a
mobile device so p5 sketches will just
work in both places that said there are
certain kind of features and function
now
that you might want that are different
for a mobile environment and p5 is part
of the library has an array to track
multi-finger touch events it has
variables to keep track of the phone's
acceleration and rotation so there are a
lot of features of the Peetha of p5
itself that allow you access now you
might want to ask though but can I
actually make an app like yes I know I
could send people a URL so so p5 doesn't
have any features for you to do that but
there are systems I think probably the
most one a commonly used one thing
called Cordova and Cordova is a
framework that allows you to take a
webpage and turn it into a native
application and that actually will allow
you more access to certain hardware
things on the phone that you wouldn't be
able to just through the browser itself
processing because it's built on top of
the java programming language you can
actually make processing sketches in
android and there is something called
processing android i believe you go to
android processing org you can add that
as a mode to processing there are
tutorials there so you can build with
processing native android applications
this is not something i personally have
a lot of experience with but it is out
there and i know it's always a project
that always needs help with maintaining
and you know androids always changing so
if you're interested in that and want to
contribute to that that's great too
final Ektron exposing the chat asks what
about exporting and boy this is another
really big thing that i missed from this
list and i don't really have a lot of
room left so i'm just gonna like write
it here in the middle
exporting exporting so one thing that's
really good in terms of processing is if
i'm not in the frame one thing that's
really good about processing is if you
want to make something that you're
exporting to another environment for
example what if you want to render a
high resolution PDF that you can print
to a giant poster what if you want to
export out and render a movie file that
you import into After Effects for an
animation what if you want to make a
standalone application that someone can
double click and run
so there are a lot of ways to
essentially export out your
from processing to other environments
this is a bit harder to oh I'm in the p5
side I wrote this totally in the wrong
place
that's supposed to be over here over
here the diagram is a mess p5 it's a
little trickier to do that
there's functions that exist in both
like save which allow you to save what
you drew as an image and in p5 there's a
function allows you to save what you
draw as an image but unlike you know
file management this also goes into this
category file management loading files
from that like if you have a directory
of a thousand images processing very
easily can just like open up the
directory read all the files in it no
matter what their name stick them in an
array load the ball p5 as a
browser-based thing doesn't have access
to your hard drive so you have to kind
of have images preset in a certain way
so to speak they can be part of the
sketch it this is a longer conversation
here but working with file systems is
certainly a bit easier to do in
processing in p5 you'll need a
server-side framework like node or
something to go along with it to have
that piece of that puzzle there and you
can save files out save JSON save save
image but all that's a little trickier
browser will just trigger an automatic
download to the Downloads folder so it's
a little trickier to manage all that
sort of stuff but certainly possible I
should mention that also processing has
a lot of features over here has a lot of
features for and libraries for exporting
3d models so if what you want to do is
generate algorithmically some
three-dimensional form to 3d print it
that sort of thing you can do that you
can save STL STL files natively and I
believe there were libraries for doing
OBJ's and that sort of thing I'd have to
look into that and do a separate video
about that but that's certainly another
aspect of this also that came up in the
chat is sounded video which I don't need
to right here but both of these
environments actually have sound
libraries and ways of capturing live and
recorded video and I think there are
kind of pros and cons of each certainly
what's kind of amazing what you can do
it with Web Audio these days and the p5
sound libraries written on top of that
and there's also a processing sound
library so if you're interested in that
maybe there's a separate whole video or
discussion about that but both of them
have both processing and p5 have
libraries where you can get access to a
camera or or the microphone or play
sound files generate sound synthesized
sound that sort of thing and I have a
bunch of tutorials for p5 at least about
sound so thanks for watching this set of
videos about processing and p5 and the
differences between them I didn't really
get to talk about Python at all but
certainly if you're interested in number
crunching at data science and natural
language processing Python is a
wonderful language to explore as well
and maybe someday I'll have some guests
on this video channel I'm sure you're
gonna have follow-up questions you can I
don't know what were the best place to
compile them is maybe on that github
issue that I posted in the chat you can
ask follow-up questions there and I can
come back and answer those on a live
stream someday so thanks for watching
this video and I will see you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
