ideas that we had from the previous one
about images and and just move it one
little step further so if you remember
at some point I think we probably had an
example that looked something like this
very basic idea of two bubble objects
the bubble objects have some functions
like ascend which makes them float up
display which draws them to circles and
top which I guess stops them at the top
so if I were to run this program again
we can see we have these two bubbles
floating up to the top we have a bubble
clasp the klaich bubble has an x and y
diameter blah blah blah so the point of
what I want to talk about here in this
video is how do we take something like
this but instead of drawing these shapes
have the bubbles be an image perhaps an
image of an ice flower so this time I
look my lesson from the last video and
if I go to the data folder in here I can
see that I have an image of a flower so
I want this flower to appear instead of
those circles since it actually that
difficult of a problem to solve but
let's do it together step by step and
just see how this works and then you can
kind of take it and do a little bit more
with it afterwards okay so the first
thing we know we need to do is make ap
image variable I'm going to call it
flower then in setup I want to load an
image and I have the path to my flower
so now I have a global variable called
flour that flour can be used anytime
anywhere I want
it could be displayed on the screen I
can for example just draw it image
flower zero zero so now I run this
program I'm going to see the flower is
back there and the bubbles are floating
in front of it
I can do one thing I might do is say
image mode just to emphasize this Center
and then draw the flower in the middle
of the screen we can see now I have the
flower in the middle this again is just
using an image kind of as a static
background which is probably a little
bit less interesting than than actually
having
be this sprite if you will this this
this this replacement for a shape that
we may animate rotate changes color etc
so let's think about it now I don't want
to display the image here where do I
want to display I want the image to draw
itself for each bubble what each bubble
has a display function each bubble has a
display function if each bubble has a
display function this is where I need to
go in and start changing my code what do
I do for the bubble I draw an ellipse
now what do I want to do I want to draw
an image I want to draw an eye and here
I want to keep that image mode Center
and I want to draw the flower at X Y
let's run this now and look I've got a
flower floating up oh I got some sad
things going on number one you could see
the sort of rectangular edges even
though it's white this is what I was
mentioning maybe it would have been
better if I had downloaded a PNG with a
transparent layer so that only the
flower pixels would show through but
these are all things that can be solved
you know this is not the crucial
component here now I do have something
else going on which is that Oh each
bubble had a diameter variable which was
controlling its size so why not use
diameter diameter to be the width and
height and only comment out and now I
have look at this I have my two flowers
floating above and out now I'm lucky
because these aren't overlapping so I
don't really see I don't really see
those hard edges anymore of course if
they were to overlap if I were to go
back to this part of the program and
start them kind of closer to each other
you can see that I'm seeing this problem
so this you know I don't want to spend
too much time with this because for me
again the exciting interesting stuff is
what we're going to start looking at the
pixels of an image and how do we make up
our own images and mix the pixels around
and do an inventor on image processing
algorithms but this is something you
might take some time to play with in
practice for example go and find
yourself an image with some transparency
maybe just try actually you know a quick
and dirty solution might be that I'm
just going to give it a tint with
keeping the color at full but give it
somehow
and let me go back and put them closer
to each other again you know not great
but a little bit better at least they're
kind of like semi blended together but
that's not such a great solution but I
don't know why i buyed shove it to you
but I know I want it to be back to what
it was um so some of the things you
might think about doing are give the
objects color so that you can tint them
differently could you apply translate
and rotate to the image of the flowers
spin perhaps that would be an
interesting thing to try another thing
you might think about is I got kind of
lucky if I go and look at my flower my
flower happens to be if I find the
resolution right there it happens to be
a perfect square it's 300 by 300 so this
was kind of lucky in that in my code
when I changed the size of the flower I
could just change the width and height
to be the same value but what if you had
an image that you needed to keep the
ratio of the width and height the same
how might you change the size might have
different images larger and smaller
width but keeping that that core
resolution intact give you a secret you
might be able to not a secret but you
know you can get the width of sorry you
can get the width of that image by
saying the name of the image dot width
so one thing I could do is say flower
dot width times 0.5 0.3 0.7 I guess I'm
giving you the solution but give that a
try and see it what happens there the
other thing that I think is a really key
element and maybe I should make a video
actually just about this but we really
did something which is a bit of a
problem that I don't think I should
point out this P image flower is a
global variable and the bubble object is
just accessing that global variable and
actually you know what the next video I
have in mind the looking at this so
we're gonna bring that back into the
next video this perfect so the next
video will solve this problem but really
what if I want I want a whole lot of
different flowers and every time I make
a bubble I make it with a random flower
image I can't just have a global
variable flower that the image is kind
of
happens to be getting when it's time to
draw itself I need each object to store
perhaps its own image each objects
should know which image is it display
and how could you solve that problem I
get something you give yourself a little
try to and up in the next video which I
want to talk about having an array of
images we'll look at a solution to this
okay this wasn't so bad I think this was
okay it could be better but that's what
it is
okay I'm going to turn this off and I
got a guy got don't you got him do the
next one I don't have a lot of time here
okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
