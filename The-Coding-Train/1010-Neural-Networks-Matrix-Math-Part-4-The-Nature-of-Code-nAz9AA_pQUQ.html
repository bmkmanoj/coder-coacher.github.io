I mean there's lots more of matrix
there's lots more to matrix math and
again let me encourage you I will link
to in this video's description to check
out three blue one brown's youtube
channel which is a whole series about
linear algebra i'm just kind of
implementing the minimum that I need for
this neural network example that I want
to build in JavaScript so the missing
piece and I just talked about at the end
of the last video is to transpose a
matrix transposing a matrix means take
all the rows and make them columns so
ABC this row becomes the first column
ABC this row becomes the first column -
yeah now this is yet another function
which requires me twitch which requires
me to make a new matrix so I'm not
actually taking the matrix it's I mean
it could take the matrix that redo it
but I think what I'm gonna do is make
let's just write this function transpose
and the first thing I need to do is make
a new matrix which I will call result
again equals a new matrix and it has the
number of rows that it used to have
columns and has the number of columns
that it used to have rows and I should
be able to just say now it should be as
easy as it should be as easy as if I was
like ever going through the entire
matrix and I should be just saying that
the results matrix I J equals the and
actually I should say the results matrix
J I equals the the this matrix I J we
see this now it's possible I got this
backwards but it should be if I'm
writing over all the rows and columns
every row column position should become
the column row position so I should be
able to just say J index I equals the of
the new matrix is this matrix I come
i J that should work so and then I need
to say return again return results okay
so let's test this out could I really
have done this this quickly very
unlikely oh why am I saying plus equals
should not be plus equals it should just
literally be equal and if I go into the
sketch that I had and all I need is a so
I'm gonna have this random one and then
I'm going to say let B equal a dot
transpose and then I'm going to say
console dot table a and console table B
all right let's take a look I'm not
accounting for the number of rows and
columns differences I think that I am
hold on let's take a look probably get
this wrong whoops and of course I need
to consult the actual matrix object to
see it try this again six seven four one
zero nine six one seven zero four nine
six seven four six seven four one zero
nine one zero nine all right I think we
got transpose correct so that's great so
we did this we're done we're done with
the matrix math videos and it's the next
one that will the next thing I need to
do is actually start thinking about how
does this feed-forward algorithm work if
I were to write a feed-forward function
and I were to give it some input by word
you feed some input how do I
ultimately return some guests so this is
where lots of matrix math needs to
happen so again if you're interested I'm
also going to link to three blue one
Brown's video what is
a neural network it's an excellent
animated explanation of a lot of the
things that I covered in the earlier
videos in this playlist but what I'm
going to do is try to write the code for
the neural network right here once we
have that done I think I'm going to just
try doing a couple tests like I'm going
to solve a problem called XOR which is a
really simple problem and I'm also going
to look at the EM NIST data set which is
kind of like the hello world of machine
learning with this neural network and
then oh then with the idea of just
seeing if it works so that I can then
once I know that it works I can do some
more creative stuff with it okay so
thanks everybody and see you in the next
