and what I would like to try to do
attempt to do in this video is
demonstrate uploading a p5 sketch from
your laptop to a server so that other
people could go to their own web
browsers type in some URL and see the
marvelous wonderful work that you've
done so before I go to the computer and
demonstrate the steps what I would like
to do is discuss all the different
pieces at play here and this is actually
kind of a simple thing in a way I think
probably not over complicated but let's
let's give this a try you could just
shut this off or speed ahead like five
minutes if you just want to get to that
to the guts here okay so what is what's
happening you are working on a laptop
and you have the p5 IDE you're working
in the p5 IDE which if we zoom in on
that you're writing some code and that
code is JavaScript you're writing code
in JavaScript there's a play button
somewhere in that IDE and you hit play
when you hit play you see another window
open up that window is actually a
browser window and you'll see the result
of your code whatever's you've written
in your code draw a circle draw
rectangle all that stuff it's there in
this browser so all of this is happening
just locally on your laptop here's the
thing that you might not consider our
thought of there's in that step when you
hit play what happens launch a server
there's actually a server that's running
on your machine your laptop so why I'm
assuming you're using a laptop but
that's what I'm using these days so
maybe you are too but that server is
launched behind the scenes which serves
up your sketch and allows this Bruegel
browser window to see it and so what we
want to do is we want to find another
server one that's not sitting on your
laptop but that's actually out in the
internet you know the cloud I think I
said this is a different video still
there's no clouds under
bunker somewhere but a server somewhere
that other people could connect to lots
of other laptops they could connect to
through some URL and they could see your
beautiful circles and squares on their
screen because you don't really it's not
really realistic at this point for your
laptop for this little server to
suddenly serve out to the world and have
everybody connect to you although you
know this is possible but that's another
story for another day
so what you need to do is take this code
and put it on that server and figure out
what that URL is and then everyone else
will be able to see your beautiful whole
circles and squares that you spent you
know you so much time thinking about
where to put them when colors they
should be purple blue and I don't know
the colors are the rainbow it's a nice
thing to think about
so so this is the steps that we want to
do now here's another piece you were
writing we said JavaScript code here so
you'd think like all I need to do is
take my JavaScript code and put that on
the server but what's happening in this
p5 IDE is in addition to the JavaScript
code which might be called there might
be a file called something like sketch
j/s that's where your code is sitting
behind the scenes and annual in some
other video or somebody else will talk
to you or I don't know when but I'm not
going to get into this too much right
now in this moment there is another file
called index.html and when these
requests are made this is really the
file this is the core file that gets
sent back from the server that gets
loaded into the browser and this file
refers to your JavaScript code so in
turn your JavaScript code is seen in the
browser but so these are the two files
in there two other file you might have
later you might have you know images and
sound files and there's something called
CSS which will add some styling and
layout different things but ultimately
you need at least these two files I
forgot something okay but you need these
two files and need to send them to the
okay what did I forget there's also
going to be a folder called Lib and that
folder called Lib is going to have other
things in it like a file called p5.js
that's the p5 library you know there's a
longer story here of okay well you don't
actually have to have the p5 library
here you could refer to it from the
Ralph's but for the for the for the sake
of today just so we could get through
this video the way that the ID and this
is how the idea works so it makes the
most sense to just look at it this way
your project is your code it's the HTML
file which refers to your code and then
also the p5 library which allows you to
write all those functions like rect
ellipse fill stroke that sort of thing
in your code and also by the way the
index of HTML file is going to refer to
that file too so you've got to get all
these things up on the server then
you've got to know you know what's your
URL well presumably you have a host you
register for an account with some
company and they given you lots of
information and you know what your URL
is it's you know blah blah calm and
depending on what the if you make this
into a directory then maybe it's going
to be something something so well I
guess when I show you on the computer if
you're still watching they this will
become in toward you top but so how do
you get this stuff to a server there's
lots of ways to do that all sorts of
interesting strange ways I have a
personally like using this thing called
github pages but I'm not going to do
that in this video and I probably
shouldn't have mentioned that both edit
that out later except I'm not going to
edit that out later because I don't edit
these but so you need to do something
called FTP and this is where books I'd
say that I actually think I think I know
what that stands for mostly a File
Transfer Protocol because we want to
transfer these files and we need some
protocol for transferring those files
and in fact most likely what you
actually need is s FTP it depends on
what kind of host or server or whatever
you have secure fire trans File Transfer
Protocol because you don't want anyone
to hack in and see your precious pink
and purple rainbow colored shapes that
you're uploading
to a server okay so so this is the
picture of it I went on for too long
about that now let's - oh by the way I
haven't tried this yet so so now we're
going to go over to the computer and
actually a walk through the steps and
look at how to do this I'm gonna go over
here now
see this works oh okay well my computer
went to sleep come back ah there we go
okay ah so um what do you need now so
you need some software you need saw
father you are you
I'm me you're a camera I guess you're a
person that's at some point but you need
some software the software that I am
using is I mean like zoom in on this
it's called cyberduck this is FTP
software it allows you to FTP files but
you know Google FTP software find your
personal favorite ask your friend who
loves to ftp on the weekends or whatever
but you might as well get cyberattack
it's free and it works so now but okay
so and I also have the p5 IDE if you
don't know where to get the p5 IDE you
want to go to the p5.js website that's
p5.js org and you want to go to download
and then you want to scroll down and you
want to download the editor the Mac
version or which is really exciting
because like a month ago that didn't
exist so so I've already done that so I
don't need to do that and hello so I'm
just going to launch cyberduck and
you're going to see here the thing that
I need to do is I would like to open a
connection I need to open a connection
to my server oops
I don't know I made that fullscreen I
don't want to do that view shoot get out
of that there we go open a connection
and now there's some information here
first thing I want to do is I want to
change this to SFTP and it wouldn't it
be nice if I knew what's or address this
is something you're going to have to
know I should like just pause this video
but I was there's nothing nothing I
could do I look I I had this set before
Schiffman dot
I am NYU ad comm it's like what's the
chance that that's right dee Shipman my
password very secret I'm not gonna say
what it is what's the chance that this
works oh I'm a genius okay so I think I
don't really like it
so sorry about that but I somehow
remembered that that's really lucky okay
so this is my URL it's this a bit of a
strange URL most likely you're going to
have something and I this this host the
web host I don't want to like plug
anything here but the web host I'm using
is a dream host this is an account
that's actually set up through NYU it's
a long story
but you most likely have something like
you know funky website calm or whatever
your URL is so you're not going to have
this strange sub-domain thing but it's
up to you whatever you've registered
with your host that's what you're going
to do and then your host is going to
have different setups there's there's
you know a bunch of once you do that you
can see a bunch of directories this is
the directory of files that actually are
publicly viewable on the web so your
server is sitting there and you can have
all sorts of files on the server but
there's usually a director some
directory sometimes it's called like
public HTML there's usually a directory
that's specified for whatever you put in
there those are the files that you can
actually see by making these requests
okay
so am i back here I am so okay so we've
logged in that's good I'm going to leave
that over there
I'm going to open up p5 I'm going to
make a sketch and say create oh boy I
need to do something about making the
font bigger I'll just zoom in for now
and say create canvas 400 300 or that's
my favorite that's my favorite kid this
resolution what's yours I'm going to say
background zero and say fill 0 100 255
and I'm going to say ellipse 200 150 100
100 that's my favorite kind of ellipse
I'm going to hit save this is very
important I'm going to hit save now
where do I say wherever I save this
that's where these files these all these
extra files are actually going to end up
so I'm going to save it to the desktop
I'm going to say I'm going to call it
Schiffman week one referring to my name
and it's week one of my semester this
may not be your scenario I don't know if
anyone else is going to watch this
besides the people who were like or
required to to figure out how to up with
her homework for the class but okay so
I'm gonna hit save
I even test my code I should test my
code and hit run we can see that it
works I have my beautiful circle it's
blue I don't know if that's my favorite
color but it works for today and now it
hit save again and then I'm going to I'm
going to look look at this directory
right here this directory if I look in
that directory whoa where'd that go I've
now you can see I've got those files I'm
talking about
I've got sketch j/s which is my code
I've got index.html which is that HTML
file you can look inside and see what's
in there and make changes to it if you
wanted to play around and then you can
see here are the libraries p5.js is the
only one I'm actually using but included
also as p5 sound which allows you to
play sounds and do all sorts of amazing
sound stuff p5 Dom which allows you do
some other interesting things that have
to do with the Dom but you know I don't
to stop this video at some point so now
what I'm going to do really I should
just started here I'm going to take this
whole folder ok edit on the disk I don't
know maybe if you want to ask something
weird happened I don't care I'm going to
take this whole folder and I'm going to
upload it and I'm going to click allow
and if we look we can see there that
folder is in there shifting week 1
either some other stuff from like some
other thing they did at one point a few
months ago
but now if you think about it where will
my where is my URL Schiffman dot I am
NYU ad comm slash Shipman underscore
week 1 ok let's try this
ok 10/10 time I'm going to go to
shipment IM nyu ad comm slash Schiffman
underscore week 1 oh that worked very
excited
you look and now all you have to do is I
don't know put this on your twit Twitter
or your Facebook or your email to your
friends or honestly just go and edit
that github wiki that's for class and
and Link it to your homework so this is
a thrilling day for me that I recorded
this video and that there's a circle
here I doubt this is a weekday for you
but I will see you again at some point
in another video maybe maybe not I have
to stop this now oh I don't have a mat I
can't stop it come on Mouse okay bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
