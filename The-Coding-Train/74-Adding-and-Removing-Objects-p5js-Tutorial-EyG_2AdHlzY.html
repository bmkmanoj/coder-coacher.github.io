the constructor function thank you for
still being here and watching the next
one because that was a little bit rough
maybe you actually watched the
rerecorded one that I hope to make
someday to kind of try to do a little
bit of a better job here but I have a
promise to you which is that I'm going
to put my energy into this video and I
think this particular video is going to
let you do some really interesting
things with an array that weren't
possible before if you haven't looked at
some of the other functionality that you
can do with an array so what is that
functionality that I'm talking about
notice this example so what's wonderful
about working with objects in an array
is again I have a single number right
there I change that number to five I run
the code there are five bubbles I change
that number to five hundred I run the
code there are five hundred of them but
what if I want to click click click
click click and delete them or what if I
want to click click click click click
and add them how do I resize dynamically
add or remove things from that array
then one of the nice things is right
here no matter what I do to the array
this loop will only ever iterate over
the current state of the array right
because that length will dynamically
always store the value of the array
itself so that's a great thing that's
the good news and then in order to add
and subtract things from the array a
nice technique for doing that is with
two array functions so one array
function is called push another array
function is called splice now the truth
of the matter is there are many array
functions and I will try to remember to
include in the description below a link
to a JavaScript documentation page that
one's through all these functions it
might be little scary weird looking
links maybe you should look at it but
these are just two functions that I'm
going to demonstrate to you now the
other thing that's a little bit weird is
what a function for a what write an
array is this right nums equals 5 to
negative 30 71 right what do you mean a
function to the array I could say nums
index so this is 0 1 2 3 if I said nums
index 4
equals 21 it's like I'm taking the end
of this array and adding element 4 to
the array and making it one longer so
this is a way to add an element to the
array but it only works because I happen
to know what that index value is I
happen to know though that in that the
length of that array so a more
convenient way might be to no matter
what you say append it to the end or add
it to the end and the push function does
that if I say nums dot push 63 it will
say whatever the size of the array is
extend it by one more and put the thing
you just pushed on to it there and I
might have run out of space up there but
I think you can see it now this is
what's weird yes you can initialize an
array yes you can refer to individual
elements but you can call functions on
it what is the thing that what's what is
the thing you normally have but you say
something dot execute a function an
object so this is one of the things
about JavaScript I know how we made an
array of objects well guess what an
array is also an object so and by the
way we've seen this already it has a
property the dot length property so this
is what we normally think of as the
array itself and we're working with the
values in the array but there are the an
array happens to be an object and there
are special functions you can call on it
push being one of the most you know sort
of convenient ones or useful ones for
you right now and I'll show you splice
in a moment which allow you to take
stuff out of the array so let me come
back over here and now that we know that
I can do something to this code right if
I can add the mousepressed function and
here in the mousepressed function I can
say bubbles dot push and what what do I
want to push into that array right
before if I just had an array of numbers
I could just say push this number or
push some random number or push some
whatever this is just numbers here what
I want to do is push a bubble object how
do I make a new bubble object that was
what I spent all this time we're really
driving my hardest
in the previous video the job of making
objects is left to this constructor
function which is being eaten by the
blue blob this constructor function it's
job is to make an object how do you
trigger its action to make that object
by saying new bubble parenthesis so
right here all I need to do is say hey
push a new bubble into that array so now
you're not really going to notice though
they popping up there but let's start
with just two bubbles and I could click
and you can see every time I click a new
bubble is being added to that array but
unless I want to do better than that
like what I want to do is I want to
click right here and I want to see the
bubble being added right there
how do I do that well let's look at how
is its initial X&amp;amp;Y picked its initial x
and y is picked randomly now the truth
of the matter is I could just replace
that with mouse X and replace this with
mouse Y but I'm using this as an excuse
to show you something a little bit
tricky about constructor functions but
ultimately rather useful functions can
accept arguments you can pass things in
to a function I want to draw a line from
this point to this point I want to fill
with these particular RGB values I can
say I want to make a bubble with this
argument I want to make a bubble that is
big or a bubble that is small or a
bubble that is red I want to be able to
modify the bubble as I make it and in
this case I want to say I want to make a
bubble at mouse X at Mouse Y so let me
come back over here hi erase my
constructor function but let's take a
look at let's take a look at this syntax
a little bit because this is really hard
so I want to say new bubble and right
now I'm gonna say instead of now sex and
mouse Y I'm going to say 50 comma 25 so
this is the line of code I'm executing
right and remember the constructor
function looked like this now it didn't
have anything between the parentheses
I'm going to add something in a minute
and then I said this dot x equals
something and this dot y equals
something what I want to do is I want to
get this 50 into that X and I want to
get this 25 into that X Y when I make
the new bubble object I want to make it
with these values 50 should be its X
property 25 should be the value of the Y
property how do I do that well when you
pass arguments into a function those
arguments get received by that functions
parameters so I need to add how many
parameters here two parameters and x and
a y I can actually call those whatever I
want but a nice way that I might call
them is I might call them X and a wine
you know why javascript won't get
confused because these are called x and
y because these are referring to this
bubbles X and this bubbles Y and these
are just a plain old X and a plain old Y
so if 50 goes into X X now has the value
of 50 X can go into this X if 25 goes
into y Y naught has the value of 25 and
Y can go into this comma Y so these
particular x and y parameters to the
bubble function they simply act as these
like handoffs they're just here like
waiting okay give me a value I got the
value you take the value that's all they
live for that's their entire purpose in
life in terms of this codes just receive
that value 50 and immediately handing it
off because this is the X that really
matters that's the bubbles X this is the
Y that really matters that's the bubbles
Y these are just temporary just here to
receive the value it and pass it off so
let's come back here I'm sure you have a
question but you can't ask let's come
back over here and let's look at that so
I'm passing in the mouse X and the mouse
Y and coming down here I need to add
those parameters to receive that Mouse X
and mouse Y and you need to assign those
parameters to this X and this dot Y so
this is exactly what I went through
before you can see now Mouse X goes into
X which then goes into this tun X now
house Y goes into Y which then goes into
this that Y okay here we go stop start
and now when I click the mouse click the
mouse click the mouse click mouse click
left mouse look at that oh that is
lovely
it just works you know I could do
something like I'm sorry but I just have
to make this a little bit nicer
like units give it like a little bit of
a some sort of color you know some alpha
and what what I just realized though is
what's we look at this for a second
shouldn't we have like two hundred
bubbles to start with there's no bubbles
to start with look at this even I wrote
the bubble constructor to expect
parameters but I didn't get any up here
didn't get an error message or maybe I
did but I can't see the RMS no there's
no error message so the thing is it
tried to do it but it didn't have the
argument so we don't see those bubble
objects so this is important if you
provide argument parameters to your
constructor function you've got to use
this so you know I don't know what I
want to do up here I could put all of
these starting ones at 100 100 so
they're all right there I could put all
these starting ones at a random location
right I could pass the random location
in and I could do that and now I kind of
had what I had before but ultimately I
think what I want to do in this example
is just take this out like now I have a
program which just starts with no
objects it's fine to have an empty array
I can loop through that empty array you
know how many times are going to loop
through that empty array 0 times and the
only time I'm ever going to add a new
object is if I click the mouse because
when I click the mouse I'll make a new
bubble object at Mouse X out Mouse Y and
push it into the array so that array
grows so I can click click click click
click click click and something I could
do that's kind of fun is I could change
I mean fun if you're me yes but I could
change that from mouse press to Mouse
drag which is sort of a nice little
effect meaning I can kind of like draw
with this and notice this is this kind
of answers that question you might have
had in your head a long time ago which
is what if you know if I don't draw the
background I get this nice trail right
because I don't erase the previous
shapes that I've been drawing here now
I'm erasing the background but I'm using
an array to keep track of the history of
everything I ever did with the mouse and
I'm making a new object for what every
one of those points and you can see even
though you could probably come up with
more interesting motion than this even
though I start with this pattern that
pattern quickly goes away as these
objects start to move randomly around
the screen so I
think okay but I was gonna say this is a
great exercise for you I think using
this model can you create an object can
you create an array that stores the
history of the mouse as you move it
around and what types of kind of motion
or changes of color or things can you do
now if you have a drawing program that's
actually retaining to all of those
locations in an array rather than just
leaving them as pixels on the screen but
before I go any further let's add one
more thing to this what if I only ever
want to have 50 like I want to delete
the I want to do it I want to delete the
oldest thing from the array right what I
mean by that is if this is the array
right the push function always add
things to the end so first it adds like
a bubble to the beginning then it adds a
new bubble to the next spot then it adds
a new bubble to the next spot then a new
bubble to the next spot
and once I get to a certain number what
if I want to delete the oldest one shift
everything down
delete the next oldest one shift
everything down and keep adding so the
way to delete something from an array is
with a function called splice it's a
little bit confusing though because this
splice function expects two arguments
the first argument is the index of what
you want to delete so if I say index two
and this was my array zero one two it
would remove this element and all of
these would kind of shift down into the
appropriate spots this second argument
is how many so actually if I said 2
comma 5 it would delete this and the
next four elements but in this case I
just want to remove one at a time so I
want to remove the element but but I
want to remove the oldest one so if I'm
adding to the array the oldest one is
always in the first spot so I want to
delete the first element and just one of
them okay so let's come back here and
when do I want to do that like right now
I could say like just just for the sake
of argument keep rest bubbles dot splice
the first element one just that one
element so you can see now I'm going to
add a whole bunch of them and now we'll
start
the key you can see it's removing them
in order of what the how they were added
but maybe what I really want to do is
say something like okay if the bubble
array ever gets greater than the value
50 then delete that first element so
what's that going to do I'm going to
keep making bubbles until suddenly I
have 50 of them I can keep making more
but keep deleting the older one so if I
ever have 50 delete that a new one
delete the previous ones so you can see
it's I sort of get this trail that kind
of winds following me so push adding
things to the array splice deleting
things from the array now let me give
you a challenging problem and I really
should make another video with the
solution to this problem I actually have
one somewhere but it's it uses
processing so I need to make a
JavaScript one with this but what if you
don't want to remove these objects just
based on their age like when I get to 50
but what if you want to remove them if
they ever happen to wander off the
screen okay so look at this here's a
bunch of objects leave them there
or remove them if they if they hit the
edge of the screen or if you click on
them so how do you pick specific objects
to move based on some set of condition
that's a pretty difficult problem this
sum has to be inside of the loop but you
got to watch out if you're looping
through an array and modifying this the
elements are there at the same time
weird things can happen so that's
something you could think about as a
future problem but just to get started
right now I'm like you know again work
with this model see what you can do with
the object that sort of keeps track of
an array that stores a history of what
you've done with the mouse or maybe you
have something moving independently
randomly and you're keeping track of its
history of its location okay so
hopefully this helped you with a little
more about objects and arrays and I'm
going to finish this video off now
oh this was 15 minutes long that was
long come on Mouse I got hit stop</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
