particular video I am going to talk
about I'm going to answer this question
now you might notice on this github
repository that it was this person whose
name is Shipman who asked this question
so I you know somebody asked me this
question I get this question a lot and
so I I just added this to the github
repo but I would like to point out if
you're watching this video and you're
interested in asking me a question then
I might answer in a future video find
the link to this github repository in
this video's description go there and
ask your own question so the question
for today is what is the difference
between p5.js and processing and I'm
gonna answer this by the way I haven't
prepared anything so it's gonna be kind
of stream-of-consciousness here but I
may answer this in a sort of broader
sense so one of the things that's
happening right now this very week for
me is that I am teaching a class at ITP
which is a program at Tisch School of
the Arts New York University called
introduction to computational media this
is a class for people who want to learn
to program who have never written any
code before whatsoever in their life and
this is another question that gets asked
a lot oh hey I'm interested in this code
stuff I want to write some code what
should I learn what should I use now I
don't I don't even for a brief
millisecond pretend to actually have the
answer to that question I don't you know
that the answer to that question is
different for a number of reasons but
you know your personal preferences
background interest that sort of thing
so many languages frameworks tutorials
etc I can only sort of speak from my own
experience in the sort of smaller scope
of one of the things that I'm interested
in and work on personally which are
tools that allow people to get up and
running with programming very quickly
and sketch out ideas in particular
creative ideas often ideas that have a
strong visual component now and the
tools that I enjoy for these kinds of
projects and for learning code and
sketching out these kinds of ideas
Arvind just happen to be coincidentally
p5 GS and processing so I want to talk a
little bit out the history and and this
is really now a video that is in some
ways I'm focusing oh I already have this
URL open on something called the
processing foundation so processing
foundation is a non-for-profit United
States 501c3 tax-exempt corporation
very official and like ominous
processing foundation but and and it
exists to maintain software platforms as
well as develop and administer education
community and diversity initiatives
around code and creativity and you can
read about the processing foundation on
the website and encourage you to get
involved and I'll talk a little bit
about how you can get involved at least
in contributing to open source maybe
more towards the end of this particular
video so encourage you to check out the
processing foundation now let me talk
through for those of you who might be
interested my sense of the history
history teacher ok my sense of the
history of processing and what it is and
that these and what p5.js is and also I
want to talk about processing dot PI or
py oh there's also pressing for the
riser so much let's start small so 2001
I think I actually have done a lot of
this in another video but I'm kind of
repeating it just to kind of give some
context here so 2001 processing and it
was recently actually the 15th
anniversary of processing itself Ben
Frey one of the creators are processing
tweeted out a link to a workshop up try
to find that and put it in this video's
description it's not coming to me this
moment but other words of what the first
kind of public workshop using processing
was in August of 2001 if I'm correct
about that
so the co-creators of processing Ben
Frey Casey Ries and processing itself
came out of their work at a place which
still exists of course which a lot of
you probably heard of called the MIT
Media Lab and their professor at the
time named John NIDA world-renowned
designer artist luminary thinker former
president of RISD professor at the MIT
Media Lab John mighta apologized to
mispronouncing the name at all anybody's
name throughout the course of this video
so the group was called the aesthetics
and computation group that was the
research group at the time and you know
it would be great to have Ben and Kasey
just as sort of like bobbing heads here
they don't need to
bobbling but that's actually talk here
but well you know there's I think a
reason why processing came into
existence on the one hand you're a
person whose name happens to be Ben
friar Casey Reese in 2001 you want to
teach people about programming what do
you use there there was a piece of
software known as design by numbers at
the time which was created by John Maeda
and this this was a software platform
that was designed for graphic designers
to code and so a lot of the ideas of
processing came out of design by numbers
and of course so many things came before
that we can think of the logo
programming language and turtle graphics
and you know hyper card and the work of
Seymour Papert and all sorts of various
other types of kind of historical
precedents for this idea of creativity
through coding but the idea here what
might be really long-winded about this
ok I'm just gonna keep going I can't see
the chat now maybe everybody's left 563
viewers has gone down to like 15 but so
this is kind of where everything came
from this idea of ok number one a tool
that let's say I'm the person who's
going to create processing why am i
doing it one I want to make my own work
so I need something with which to make
my own work I also want to teach others
to make creative work I need something
to teach others so one of the things
that's been there from the very
beginning with processing is walking
this fine line between a kind of
beginner friendly easy to get started
platform that you can use right from day
one and write code and get stuff going
in a simple and friendly way as well as
a platform that you can actually use for
larger projects commercial work artistic
work creative ideas sketching out ideas
as you get more and more knowledge
through code so it's something that can
give you a full journey so the question
then in this time is well what what is a
good programming language to build
processing with and build on top of now
one of the limitations of design by
numbers was that all it really lets you
do if I'm correct about this is make
interesting algorithmic geometric
graphics through code but what if you
wanted to connect hardware or talk to
the network or have your graphic sketch
visualize data or you know Hardware
being other types of car I was the
camera but that's Hardware so one of the
reasons that processing was built on top
of Java is that suddenly if you have
this simple friendly environment with a
simple drawing API but you build it with
the language Java you're going to get
all this other stuff for free it's going
to be extendable you can write other
libraries for it you can pull other Java
libraries into it
there was also at the time something
called an applet and one of the key
pieces of processing has always been the
key sort of philosophical principles has
been shareability so I've been make
something on share it with my friends
quickly easily instantly and the web is
a great platform with which to do that I
hope everything's still working yes okay
now so applets were the thing in 2001 if
you have this animated graphics thing
that you made and you want to put it in
a webpage you put it with a Java applet
as you know anybody watching this now
you either have never heard of an applet
or the your only sense of an applet is
like a frustrating moment where there's
some webpages trying to load a Java
applet and get like 50 different error
messages try to restart reinstall Java
like three times and it still never
works
and eventually give up and do something
else so this is kind of where processing
came from so let me show you now over
here I'm back over here we're taking a
peek at the chat people are asking about
Arduino which is kind of interesting to
bring that into the picture as well but
I'm gonna run the current version of
processing right now it's it and I'm
gonna open it and so this is what
processing is and in in its form today
come on processing
if it would come up I could then have
this applause did it cut what that what
happened there oh it's there
there it is so this is what processing
looks like and I can do something like
just say background Owen let's make the
font a bit bigger and I can do something
like this and I can say and I can run
this sketch and there we go and I have
my first bit of code so the idea here is
that I am writing code in Java but a lot
of what you would normally have to do
your first day of a Java programming
class where you need to like have a main
thing and the class thing then set up
your environment variables and open up
something called eclipse baby or command
line all of that is done for you inside
of the processing development
environment self so processing is both a
library of functions and classes you can
call and do stuff with like background
here's a nicer of a pink background
ellipse which are also circle on the
screen and a development environment
itself and this development environment
has come a long way in 15 years there is
a console here there's a separate errors
pane when you have errors you can see
here if I forget my semicolon suddenly
you'll see missing a semicolon on line
number two and a little red squiggly
here and if I then put the semicolon
back the red squiggly goes away there's
even a debugger over here I think I made
a video tutorial about the debugger
that's on the processing website there
are I can go to sketch import library
add lot whoops there's a whole
contributions manager so if I go here I
can find countless libraries to do
various things with cameras and other
pieces of hardware and color and GUI
elements and physics engines so there's
a lots and lots of things I could do
with processing I'm getting text
messages which I was worried for like
everything is not working okay so um so
this is processing now I'm gonna I
really should just scrap this and start
over because I could answer the
difference between processing p5 just
rather quickly
instead I'm going through the sort of
history thing so let's fast let me come
over here you know if I were in an
actual classroom with people I would get
a read of the room of I people would
raise their hands I would have a sense
instead I'm just speaking to this this
thing which is like a little circle here
and it's a nice little thing but it's it
doesn't really talk back to me okay
so let's think about let's let me talk
about a little bit what's what's now
happening so there are so okay so the
prospect this is what this is this is
really this history now has many many
years from 2001 all the way I would say
a brown I believe around 2013 was when
one of the first conversation started to
happen around
what if processing the way you could
think of this question is what if
processing started over so instead of
thinking about okay so there have been a
lot of projects to port processing to
another environment so take a literal
translation of the entire API by API
need all of the functions and things
that processing can do and translate it
to another language notably I'll mention
two of them one of them is called
processing dot py which is a Python
version of processing and in fact if I
come back over here I can access that
instantly up here under Java I can
actually switch here to Python now I
don't think this Python will show up
here by default you have to first go to
add mode and then add Python but if I
switch to Python I can suddenly type
Python code in here and run processing
sketches using the Python programming
language and access the entire pipe
processing API there is another project
called processing dot j/s and this
project is very confusing because all
these
processing this was a project first
created by John Resig which does
something even more magical than just
taking all of the processing API and
translating it into JavaScript for a
canvas element in the browser what John
Resig was able to do is not only port
processing to JavaScript so you could
write call make processing calls in
JavaScript but then this also has an
engine to take your processing code and
translate it behind the scenes for you
into JavaScript essentially so you don't
you could write your processing code in
Java and have it run in the browser in
JavaScript through an auto magical
process now so this processing is a
project maintained by the foundation
itself processing dot py is also a
project being maintained by the
foundation crossing Jess was a separate
project as I said created and started by
John Resig I believe it's now also used
as an engine for the Khan Academy a lot
of the Khan Academy tutorials I believe
if it's still the case that John Resig
does work with for Khan Academy and at
one point then proceeded jess was taken
over by some folks who work with them
Zillah foundation and I've kind of I
don't know if I have all the pieces of
the history of that directly into my
head I haven't been as involved with
that particular project but this
question in 2013 came up what if
processing were to start over and
someone that I would like to mention
here it is Lauren McCarthy processing
found one of the things we do as a
foundation is we offer fellowships small
stipends to people who won't who propose
a project around a code library and
education initiative a diversity
initiative and at the time Lauren
McCarthy I believe was one of them I
don't know what are the first processing
fellows to think about and answer this
question and so the question what and
I'm not saying this question was
actually posed but I'm thinking about
this way for now just for the sake of
argument you know there's a lot of
different paths that you could take I
think and you could make good cases for
all of them but this idea of
shareability
the idea of simplicity back to the sort
of design by numbers core ideas of
simplicity for withdrawing and
shareability on the web everything came
back to JavaScript again and again and
again so on the one hand you could say
okay processing j/s already exists what
is the reason for having yet another
JavaScript version so to speak of
processing and I think what Lauren said
and what Lauren did and now many others
have done and contribute to beyond just
Lauren Lauren who started this project
was to say well this project called
p5.js and I want to talk about the
little P in a moment this project called
p5.js is not just about saying
processing is this thing that people
like let's poured it to JavaScript but
let's not port the code or the names of
all the functions or how everything
works
let's port the goals the philosophies
the principles behind processing
openness friendliness accessibility
design visuals art let's port all of
those kind of core principles and ideals
of processing and take those and design
a new platform around those ideas in a
new environment because if you're in the
browser it doesn't necessarily make
sense to do things the same way they've
worked in what's now essentially a
desktop application development
environment processing so and you know
what I'm realizing this video that I'm
making is kind of a history of
processing in p5 GS and I'm gonna make a
separate video which just looks at the
differences between the two and I'll
make some code examples that go back and
forth so I'm not actually answering this
video but that's fine so um
so this I think is really the idea and
JavaScript is such a different place
than Java and being on the web is such a
different place than being in a desktop
application so many things are different
most notably 2002 things right now one
is that in addition to all the drawing
functionality that's part of processing
p5.js has a Dom manipulation library
what I mean by that is
and I've kind of made this crazy map
here I almost like don't want to erase
anything so I'm just gonna use this
little corner over here if this is your
processing window that you're drawing
your lovely spiral pattern in that's all
you get in processing your graphics
window if this is your web browser and
you're working in p5.js and you create a
canvas where you draw your spiral in it
you get that in p5 just as this canvas
but you also get more because the canvas
is just one element sitting on the
webpage and you could have some
paragraphs you could have an image you
could have like a little like audio
player you can create so much more
around the canvas on that webpage and
that's what p5.js also offers it's not
just as processing is to Java it's built
on top of Java p5.js is built on top of
JavaScript but it also has hooks into
HTML so here I think you know really
Java there's also hooks into HTML CSS
and JavaScript ok
so I'm kind of wrapping up this
discussion of the history here since
this is you might be watching this just
as a video I don't know if you will but
maybe you will I'm gonna check now this
is at the moment happening as a live
stream so I'm just looking to chat to
see if there are any questions or
Corrections so if you're watching this
down you said something 15 minutes ago
in the chat but was important maybe add
it again
so and so here I come back over here and
I'm going to look so I think perhaps I'm
going to wrap up this video and what I'm
gonna do in the next video is I'm going
to actually look at processing in p5
just side by side and see how they work
together and have some of the code how
the code is actually different and
similar and what some of the
capabilities are what's faster here
what's slower here what works better
here
that type of thing yes javascript is
slower okay so thanks for watching this
video a little bit about the history of
processing and people I forgot something
important so I want to talk about the
little P because um
javascript libraries actually if you'll
notice often start with a capital P and
I'm gonna have to find you have to bear
with me for a second I'm gonna go to
github.com slash processing p5.js I'm
gonna go under issues I'm going to
search for capital P p5 with a capital P
and I want to just read this to you
because I want people to hear this and I
Lauren I hope we'll have have a good as
a guest you can read a great interview
with Lauren that was just done by
cadenza and I'll try to link to that in
this video's description I can have her
as a guest to make these statements
herself but since I'm here on YouTube
right now I believe strongly in the work
that Lauren is doing and that the
processing foundation is doing to make
these open-source environments more
inclusive and accessible and so I want
to just essentially read this statement
to you which is a little bit of weird
thing to do a YouTube channel just read
something into the github issue you know
if you want to click and read it
yourself all right you can stop this
video now but there was a github issue
thread that started p5 with a capital P
and you know the question was sort of
posed like hey there's like this is kind
of a little bit of an advanced thing if
you have a program before that you'll
see new p5 is a way of doing this kind
of crazy make an instance of a p5 sketch
and a sort of JavaScript standard might
be capital p5 right if you're making a
new instance of a JavaScript library you
might say it with a capital P and Lauren
wrote this response which I think which
is really I think speaks to some of the
goals and principle hodja hodja project
okay totally here you indeed namespaces
in jsr generally capitalized this is a
good point
however we chose the lowercase P to
indicate that we were breaking with
tradition a bit with this library that
is breaking the tradition of
capitalizing but also trying to break
with a tradition of many open-source
projects that are male-dominated lacking
diversity and privileged experience
developers in discussion over beginners
and so to this end we are explicit in
the community statement and the github
Code of Conduct so I highly encourage
any of you are interested in open source
and proud
in p5 chess to go to this issue and
click on and read the community
statement and the github code content
and are really trying to see what
happens if you build an open-source
toolkit founded on core values of
diversity and inclusivity and this
relates back to something here which is
that this question that I that I asked
at some point of this video which is
what if processing started over and this
is something that Lauren said to me
which I think is a key principle of p5
yes the question isn't just what is it
that we should be doing right now to
make a creative coding platform
technology-wise that's not the question
it's not about make sure we support es6
and the fanciest new like whatever thing
that's in the browser now what's
happening in the world today how do we
make something that responds to the
lance the cultural landscape of today
that that that that breaks with some of
these kind of traditions and open-source
development that have excluded a lot of
people of varying backgrounds and skill
levels and genders and etc so that's
really sort of a key core principle
that's it's it's not just about the code
it's not this thing diversity and
thinking about diversity is not a thing
you do after you write the code it's
something you have to do right from the
beginning of a project itself we are
really trying to see what happens if you
build an open-source toolkit founded on
core values of diversity and inclusivity
letting all design decisions flow from
there and there's a lot more but the and
Lauren writes for me the lowercase PC P
suggests a new tradition of including as
many different kinds of people as
possible in the project and and I like
this I like the word plucky plucky
little P plucky little community and
there's some more discussion here which
uh and this'll also I'll mentioned this
is a nice little tid bat for tidbit to
bat tidbit for those of you which is uh
which is that where does this p5 come
from so actually when processing was
first created
there was a URL which was process I like
to say process of fighting because
processing wasn't actually available so
it had
two fives in it instead of s's and which
became p5 for short so processing has
always has often been referred to as p5
for short and now little lowercase P
with a 5j s for a JavaScript
okay so boy this was a very long video
that if you watched and enjoyed I
appreciate it I see in the chat room
asking to talk about network programming
but you know I got to get through this
stuff there's a more interesting
discussion here so thanks for watching
this video about the history of
processing a little bit about it I'm
sure I missed some important things I'm
sure I missed some important people's
names and so if you have comments and
thoughts about it please add them in the
comments send me a tweet and I'm gonna
do one more video that's really back to
this QA thing about that sort of like
technical differences between processing
and p5 GS</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
