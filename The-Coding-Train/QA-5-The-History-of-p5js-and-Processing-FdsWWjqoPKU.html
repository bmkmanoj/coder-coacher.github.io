particular video I am going to talk
about I'm gonna answer this question now
you might notice on this github
repository that it was this person whose
name is shipment you asked this question
so I you know somebody asked me this
question I get this question a lot and
so I I just added it to the github repo
but I would like to point out if you're
watching this video and you're
interested in asking me a question that
I might answer in a future video find
the link to this github repository in
this video's description go there and
ask your own question so the question
for today is what is the difference
between p 5 GS and processing and i'm
going to answer this by the way i
haven't prepared a few things so it's
going to be kind of stream of
consciousness here but i may answer this
in a sort of broader sense so one of the
things that's happening right now this
very week for me is that i am teaching a
class at ITP which is a program at Tisch
School of the Arts New York University
called introduction to computational
media this is a class for people who
want to learn to program who have never
written any code before whatsoever in
their life and this is another question
that gets asked a lot oh hey I'm
interested in this code stuff i want to
write some code what should I learn what
should I use now I don't I don't even
for a brief millisecond pretend to
actually have the answer to that
question I don't you know that the
answer to that question is different for
a number of reasons but you know your
personal preferences background
interests that sort of thing so many
languages frameworks tutorials etc I can
only sort of speak from my own
experience in the sort of smaller scope
of one of the things that I'm interested
in and work on personally which are
tools that allow people to get up and
running with programming very quickly
and sketch out ideas in particular
creative ideas often ideas that have a
strong visual component now and the
tools that I enjoy for these kinds of
projects and for learning code and
sketching out these kinds of ideas arfin
just happen to be coincidentally p 5 GS
and processing so i want to talk a
little bit out the history and and this
is really now a video that is in some
ways I'm focusing oh I already have this
URL open on something called the
processing foundation so processing
foundation is a non-for-profit United
States 501 c 3 tax-exempt corporation
very official and like ominous
processing foundation uh but um and and
it exists to maintain software platforms
as well as develop and administer
education community and diversity
initiatives around code and creativity
and you can read about the processing
foundation on the website and encourage
you to get involved and I'll talk a
little bit about how you can get
involved at least in contributing to
open source maybe more towards the end
of this particular video so encourage
you to check out the processing
foundation now let me talk through for
those of you who might be interested my
sense of the history history teacher
okay uh my sense of the history of
processing and what it is and that these
and what PFF jess is and also i wanna
talk about processing pi RP why oh and
then there's also pressing for the
risers so much let's start small so 2001
i think i actually have done a lot of
this in another video but i'm kind of
repeating it just to kind of give some
context here so 2001 processing and it
was recently actually the 15th
anniversary of processing itself been
fri one of the creators of processing
tweeted out a link to a workshop up try
to find that and put it in this video's
description it's not coming to me this
moment but other words of what the first
kind of public workshop using processing
was in august of 2001 if i'm correct
about that so the co-creators of
processing been fri kc reese and
processing itself came out of their work
at a place which still exists of course
which a lot of you probably heard of
called the MIT Media Lab and their
professor at the time named John NIDA
world-renowned a designer artist
luminary thinker former president of
risky professor at the MIT Media Lab
John mighta apologized to
mispronouncing the name at all anybody's
name throughout the course of this video
so the group was called the aesthetics
and computation group that was the
research group at the time and you know
it would be great to have been in kc
just this sort of like bobbling heads
here they don't need to
bobbling but that's actually talk here
but well you know there's I think a
reason why processing came into
existence on the one hand you're a
person whose name happens to be been
friar Casey recent 2001 you want to
teach people about programming what do
you use there there was a piece of
software known as designed by numbers at
the time which was created by John Maeda
and this this was a software platform
that was designed for graphic designers
to code and so a lot of the ideas of
processing came out of design by numbers
and of course so many things came before
that we can think of the logo
programming language turtle graphics and
you know hypercard and the work of
Seymour Papert and all sorts of various
other types of kind of historical
precedents for this idea of creativity
through coding but the idea here what
might be really long winded about this
look I'm just going to keep going I
can't see the chat now maybe everybody's
left 163 viewers has gone down to like
15 but um so this is kind of where
everything came from this idea of okay
number one a tool that let's say I'm the
person who's going to create processing
why am i doing it one I want to make my
own work so I need something with which
to make my own work i also want to teach
others to make creative work i need
something to teach others so one of the
things that's been there from the very
beginning with processing is walking
this fine line between a kind of
beginner friendly easy to get started
platform that you can use right from day
one and write code and get stuff going
in a simple and friendly way as well as
a platform that you can actually use for
larger projects commercial work artistic
work creative ideas sketching out ideas
as you get more and more knowledge
through code so it's something that can
give you a full journey so the question
then in this time is well what what is a
good programming language to build
processing with and build on top of now
one of the limitations of design by
numbers was that all it really lets you
do if I'm correct about this is make
interesting algorithmic geometric
graphics through code but what if you
wanted to connect hardware or talk to
the network or have your graphic sketch
visualize data or you know hardware
being other types of harvesting camera
but that's hardware so one of the
reasons that processing was built on top
of Java is that suddenly if you have
this simple friendly environment with a
simple drawing API but you build it with
the language Java you're going to get
all this other stuff for free it's going
to be extendable you can write other
libraries for it you could pull other
Java libraries into it there was also at
the time something called an applet and
one of the key pieces of processing has
always been the key sort of
philosophical principles has been
shareability so I've been make something
I'll share it with my friends quickly
easily instantly and the web is a great
platform with which to do that I hope
everything's still working yes okay um
now so applets were the thing in 2001 if
you have this animated graphics thing
that you made and you want to put it in
a webpage you put it with a Java applet
as you know anybody watching this now
you either have never heard of an applet
or your only sense of an applet is like
a frustrating moment where there's some
webpages trying to load a Java applet
and get like 50 different error messages
try to restart reinstall Java like three
times and still never works and
eventually give up and do something else
so this is kind of where processing came
from so let me show you now off over
here I'm back over here taking a peek at
the chat people are asking about Arduino
which is kind of interesting to bring
that into the picture as well but I'm
going to run the current version of
processing right now it's it and I'm
going to open it and so this is what
processing is and in in its form today
come on processing
if it would come up I could then have
this applause did it cut one that what
happened there oh it's there there it is
so this is what processing looks like
and I can do something like just say
background Owen let's make the font a
bit bigger and I can do something like
this and I can say uh and I can run this
sketch and there we go and I have my
first bit of code so the idea here is
that I am writing code in Java but a lot
of what you would normally have to do
your first day of a java programming
class where you need to like have a main
thing and a class thing dead set up your
environment variables and open up
something called eclipse baby or command
line all of that is done for you inside
of the processing development
environment cell so processing is both a
library of functions and classes you can
call and do stuff with like background
here's a nice for a pink background
ellipse which are as a circle on the
screen and a development environment
itself and this development environment
has come a long way in 15 years there is
a console here there's a separate errors
pain when you have air as you can see
here if I forget my semicolon suddenly
you'll see missing a semicolon online
number two and a little red squiggly
here and if I then put the semicolon
back the red squiggly goes away there's
even a debugger over here i think i made
a video tutorial about the debugger
that's on the processing website there
are i can go to sketch import library
add lot whoops there's a whole
contributions manager so if i go here i
can find countless libraries to do
various things with cameras and other
pieces of hardware and color and GUI
elements and physics engines so there's
a lots and lots of things i could do
with processing i'm getting text
messages which I was worried for like
everything is not working okay so um so
this is processing now i gotta i really
should just scrap this and start over
because I could answer the difference
between processing p5 just rather
quickly and instead I
I'm going through the sort of history
thing so let's fast let me come over
here you know if I were in an actual
classroom with people I would get a read
of the room of I people would raise
their hands I would have a sense instead
of just speaking to this this thing
which is like a little circle here it's
a nice little thing but it doesn't
really talk back to me okay so let's
think about let's let me talk about a
little bit what's what's now happening
so there are so okay so the prospect
this is what this is this is really this
history now has many many years from
2001 all the way I would say a brown i
believe around 2013 was when one of the
first conversation started to happen
around what if processing the way you
could think of this question is what if
processing started over so instead of
thinking about okay so there have been a
lot of projects to port processing to
another environment so take a literal
translation of the entire api by AP i
need all of the functions and things
that processing can do and translate it
to another language notably i'll mention
two of them one of them is called
processing dot p y which is a Python
version of processing and in fact if I
come back over here I can access that
instantly up here under Java I can
actually switch here to python now I
don't think this Python will show up
here by default you have to first go to
add mode and then add Python but if i
switch to python i can suddenly type
python code in here and run processing
sketches using the Python programming
language and access the entire pipe
processing API there is another project
called processing dot J s and this
project is very confusing because all
these
processing this was a project first
created by John Resig which does
something even more magical than just
taking all of the processing API and
translating it into JavaScript for a
canvas element in the browser what John
Resig was able to do is not only port
processing to javascript so you could
write call make processing calls in
javascript but then this also has an
engine to take your processing code and
translate it behind the scenes for you
into javascript essentially so you don't
you could write your processing code in
Java and have it run in the browser in
JavaScript through an auto magical
process now so this processing is a
project maintained by the foundation
itself processing py is also a project
being maintained by the foundation
crossing jess was a separate project as
i said created and started by John Resig
i believe it's now also used as an
engine for the Khan Academy a lot of the
Khan Academy tutorials I believe if it's
still the case that John Resig doesn't
work with for Khan Academy and at one
point then proceeded jess was taken over
by some folks who work with them Mozilla
Foundation and I've kind of I don't know
if I have all the pieces of the history
of that directly into my head I haven't
been as involved with that particular
project but this question in 2013 came
up what if processing were to start over
and someone that I would like to mention
here is Lauren McCarthy processing found
one of the things we do as a foundation
is we offer fellowships small stipends
to people who won't propose a project
around a code library and education
initiative a diversity initiative and at
the time Lauren McCarthy I believes was
one of them I don't know what are the
first processing fellows to think about
and answer this question and so the
question what am I saying this question
was actually posed but I'm thinking
about this way for now just for the sake
of argument you know there's a lot of
different paths that you could take I
think and it could make good cases for
all of them but this idea of
shareability
the idea of simplicity back to the sort
of design by numbers core ideas of
simplicity for withdrawing and share
ability on the web everything came back
to JavaScript again and again and again
so on the one hand you could say okay
processing jas already exists what is
the reason for having yet another
JavaScript version so to speak of
processing and I think what Lauren said
and what Lauren did and now many others
have done and contribute to beyond just
Lauren Lauren who started this project
was sort of say well this project called
p5 Jas and I want to talk about the
little pea in a moment this project
called p5 Jas is not just about saying
processing is this thing that people
like let's poured it to JavaScript but
let's not pork the code or the names of
all the functions or how everything
works let's port the goals the
philosophies the principles behind
processing openness friendliness
accessibility design visuals art let's
port all of those kind of core
principles and ideals of processing and
take those and design a new platform
around those ideas in a new environment
because if you're in the browser it
doesn't necessarily make sense to do
things the same way they've worked in
what's now essentially a desktop
application development environment
processing so and you know what I'm
realizing this video that I'm making is
kind of the history of processing in p 5
GS and I'm gonna make a separate video
which just looks at the differences
between the two and i'll make some code
examples that go back and forth so i'm
not actually answering that question
this video but that's fine so um so this
i think is really the idea and
javascript is such a different place
than java and being on the web is such a
different place than being in a desktop
application so many things are different
most notably to mention two things right
now one is that um in addition to all
the drawing functionality that's part of
processing p 5 GS has a dom manipulation
library and what i mean by that is
and I've kind of made this crazy map
here I almost like don't want to erase
anything so I'm just going to use this
little corner over here if this is your
processing window that you're drawing
your lovely spiral pattern in that's all
you get in processing your graphics
window if this is your web browser and
you're working in p5 j/s and you create
a canvas where you draw your spiral in
it you get that in p5 just as this
canvas but you also get more because the
canvas is just one element sitting on
the web page and you could have some
paragraphs you could have an image you
could have like a little like audio
player you can create so much more
around the canvas on that webpage and
that's what p5 Jess also offers it's not
just as processing is to java it's built
on top of Java p5 jess is built on top
of JavaScript but it also has hooks into
HTML so here I think you know really
java there's also hooks into HTML CSS
and JavaScript ok so I'm kind of
wrapping up this discussion of the
history here since this is you might be
watching this just as a video I don't
know but hope you will but maybe you
will I'm going to check now this is a
good moment happening as a live stream
so I'm just looking to chat to see if
there are any questions or Corrections
so if you're watching this down you said
something 15 minutes ago in the chat but
was important maybe add it again so and
so here I come back over here and I'm
going to look jack so I think perhaps
I'm going to wrap up this video and what
I'm going to do in the next video is I'm
going to actually look at processing and
p5 Jess side by side and see how they
work together and have some of the code
how the code is actually different and
similar and what some of the
capabilities are what's faster here
what's slower here what works better
hear that type of thing yes javascript
is slower okay so um thanks for watching
this video a little bit about the
history of processing and people I
forgot something important so I want to
talk about the little pea because
javascript libraries actually if you'll
notice often start with a capital P and
I'm going to have to find you have to
bear with me for a second I'm going to
go to github com / processing p 5 jf I'm
going to go under issues i'm going to
search for capital p p 5 with a capital
P and I want to just read this to you
because I want people to hear this and I
Lauren I hope we'll have a good as a
guest you can read a great interview
with Lauren that was just done by
cadenza and I'll try to link to that in
this video's description I can have her
as a guest to make these statements
herself but since I'm here on YouTube
right now I believe strongly in the work
that Lauren is doing and that the
processing foundation is doing to make
these open source environments more
inclusive and accessible and so I want
to just essentially read this statement
to you which is a little bit of weird
thing to do a YouTube channel just read
something into the github issue you know
if you want to click and read it
yourself I you can stop this video now
but there was a github issue thread that
started p5 with a capital P and you know
the question was sort of posed like hey
there's like this is kind of a little
bit of an advanced thing if you have a
program before that you'll see new p5 is
a way of doing this kind of crazy make
an instance of a p5 sketch and a sort of
JavaScript standard might be capital p 5
right if you're making a new instance of
a JavaScript library you might say it
with a capital P and Lauren wrote this
response which I think which is really I
think speaks to some of the goals and
principal hosna hajek project okay
totally hear you indeed namespaces in
jsr generally capitalized this is a good
point however we chose the lowercase P
to indicate that we are breaking with
tradition a bit with this library that
is breaking the tradition of
capitalizing but also trying to break
with a tradition of many open-source
projects that are male dominated lacking
diversity and privileged experienced
developers in discussion over beginners
and so to this end we are explicit in
the community statement and the github
code of conduct so I highly encourage
any of you are interested in open source
and
in p5 chess to go to this issue and
click on and read the community
statement and the getup code content and
are really trying to see what happens if
you build an open-source tool kit found
it on core values of diversity and
inclusivity and this relates back to
something here which is that this
question that I that I asked at some
point of this video which is what if
processing started over and this is
something that Lauren said to me which i
think is a key principle of p5 yes the
question isn't just what is it that we
should be doing right now to make a
creative coding platform technology wise
that's not the question it's not about
make sure we support es6 and the
fanciest new like whatever thing that's
in the browser now what's happening in
the world today how do we make something
that responds to the lance the cultural
landscape of today that that that that
breaks with some of these kind of
traditions and open source development
that have excluded a lot of people of
varying backgrounds and skill levels and
genders and etc so that's really sort of
a key core principle that it's it's not
just about the code it's not this thing
diversity and thinking about diversity
is not a thing you do after you write
the code it's something you have to do
right from the beginning of a project
itself we are really trying to see what
happens if you build an open-source tool
kit found it on core values of diversity
and inclusivity letting all design
decisions flow from there and there's a
lot more but the and Lauren rights for
me the lowercase p suggest a new
tradition of including as many different
kinds of people as possible in the
project and and I like this I like the
word plucky plucky little p plucky
little community and there's some more
discussion here which ah and this'll
also all mentioned this is a nice little
tid bat for tidbit to bat tidbit for
those of you which is I which is that
where does this p5 come from so actually
when processing was first created there
was a URL which was processed like to
say process iving because processing
wasn't actually available so it had to
I've zanette instead of s's and which
became p5 for short so processing is
always has often been referred to as p5
for short and now little lowercase P
with a 5 j s for a javascript okay so
why this was a very long video that if
you watched and enjoyed I appreciate it
I see the chat below asking talk about
network programming but you know I got
to get through this stuff oh there's
more interesting discussion here so
thanks for watching this video about the
history of processing a little bit about
it i'm sure i missed some important
things i'm sure i missed some important
people's names and so if you have
comments and thoughts about it please
add them in the comments send me a tweet
and i'm going to do one more video
that's really back to this q a thing
about the sort of like technical
differences between processing and p 5
