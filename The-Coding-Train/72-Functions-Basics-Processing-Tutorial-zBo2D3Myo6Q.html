talk about functions and what do we mean
by functions do we know what functions
are is this something we're even
familiar with in fact yes let's just
begin here no simple little place in a
simple little place where we just wrote
something like this background zero this
is us calling a function we at one point
we might have called it a command but
really it's a function we're calling a
function of what function are we calling
it has the name background it needs
arguments maybe we say background zero
for a black background 255 comm zero
comma zero for a red background etc etc
this is the function where a color
where does that function come from well
it comes from processing but it doesn't
just sort of exist by magic or just
because well of course you say
background you get a background it
exists because somebody somewhere
perhaps who goes by today that's right
define this function somebody define
what it means what code should be
executed when you the processing user
the programmer the person writing your
crossing code call the function
background what would happen if and then
the same thing is true for if I wrote
rect rect 0 0 100 100 how does this
exist because somebody defined the
function rectangle rect okay what if I
were to write this flower flower 320
1010 1010 that must be nice we could
write that code and then we get a lovely
flower in our program wouldn't that be
nice let's go in fact run this for a
moment and see what happens going to
make a new sketch here we still have our
little bouncing ball we'll come back to
it I'm going to make a new sketch here
and say ok
no I could say background zero and now I
could say flower 100 100 I'm really
looking forward to seeing this beautiful
flower gonna be lovely okay of course we
know a little bit of time wasted there
because you knew what was going to
happen the function flower int int does
not exist it does not exist because no
one has to find that function I am here
today to say to you this is the moment
where you can begin to define your own
functions right we can start to say we
don't nobody wrote a function for how to
draw a flower processing I'm going to
write that function and how do we do
that well here is the syntax for how we
do that we want to write the flower
function we need to say this well okay
so the way a function is defined is by
saying first we have to give it a return
type then we have to give it a name of
the function then we give it some number
of arguments oh this is terribly
disorganized the way I did this
whiteboard right now we're just gonna
have to live with this okay then we need
an open curly bracket and then a close
curly bracket this is the syntax for how
a function is defined return type the
functions name some amount of arguments
perhaps and then a curly bracket and
open curly bracket this might be a
little bit cut off by the camera I
apologize in a closed curly bracket
this syntax might actually look a little
bit familiar to you I mean first of all
we recognize this a block of code has an
open curly bracket a close curly bracket
if statements loops set up draw all
these things functions that we're
defining have our blocks of code open
curly bracket close curly bracket
interestingly about this this looks
perhaps quite a bit like
void draw parentheses parentheses open
curly braket close curly bracket return
type is void the name of the function is
draw parentheses for arguments no
arguments open curly bracket close curly
brackets Oh incidentally we have been
defining our own functions we've been
defining the function setup and draw
sometimes mousepressed events keepers
and the thing about this these are
special functions these are special
functions that processing asks us to
define to control the flow of the
program we know a lot about this
processing starts with setup draw Athens
it loops over and over again these are
functions that were asked to define and
processing calls them for us what we're
now doing is defining a new function say
called flower that we want to call okay
and also by the way we now we're at this
very exciting moment where we are going
to learn what the word void means even
reading it all in your code wondering
what that is well what is void void is a
functions return type in fact when a
function has no return type you say void
so we're going to ask ourselves Inc to
videos from now what it would mean for a
function to have a return type but
having a return type a function has
where triplet gives something back for
example if you want to random number
from processing you say hello which
would say hello you call the
schism no you should always say hello
it's just polite but unfortunately the
Pilar well no that means but in any case
you say a float R equals random that
function random returns a number back to
you the function rectangle does not
return anything background does not
return anything
it performs a task so functions that
perform a task that excuse of code
without returning an answer so to speak
at the end of have a return type of void
I'm sorry for kind of going off on that
a little bit we're going to get to the
specifics of that in a video
which will be all about return types for
now we can say we're running functions
without return types they have a void
return type so to write that flower
function void flower now I'm going to
simplify things and say just for the
moment now but we're going to deal with
functions that have no arguments
clearly it's useful to have a function
with arguments draw a black background
as opposed to just saying draw a
background get a black red blue etc draw
a rectangle here with this width and
this height that's much more useful than
just say draw a rectangle but we're
going to start with a simpler case with
our function all it's supposed to do is
draw a flower this is how we would
define it all of the code for drawing
that flower should go inside the open
curly bracket and the close curly
bracket when we get to this line of code
in our program this line of code it
looks a background in the processing API
because it's predefined in processing
this line of code will clip rectangle
the crossing the API because it's
predefined and processing this line of
code will now look in here right it's
going to say ah I got a call that
function where is the function
definition here is the function
definition where do you write that
function definition in your code well
you can write it really anywhere you
want I'm going to put it right here when
I say anywhere you want it could be in
between set up and draw to be above set
up typically you put it below set up and
draw that might be sort of the standard
the key thing is flower the function
flower is its own block of code there's
its own block of code it cannot be
inside draw cannot be inside these are
distinct blocks of code that are
separate and when we run this program
now tada 200 at the bottom right-hand
corner here we get a flower no we don't
so we don't get anything because we
didn't actually put any code in that
function but if I were to give us a
little bit of a size here so the wind
a little bit bigger and say I know our
flower is going to be this beautiful red
circle now obviously this is somewhat
pointless in the sense that we don't
really have something that looks like a
flower but you could imagine if you were
to invent a very complex sophisticated
algorithm with several lines of code you
could make it modulus modular piece that
all lives inside the flower function and
is then called from draw it's allowing
you to really just organize your code in
a clear way this now this video went on
a little bit longer than I expected so
what I'm going to do in the next video
you can actually try this for yourself
first is take something you've written
in processing before and see if you can
figure out okay well this part is the
part that draws the flower pattern this
is the part that makes the flower
pattern bloom can you write a draw
display flower function can you write a
bloom function can you take your
programming divide it in two parts and
separate those parts into distinct
functions that you write below draw but
call them and draw give that a world I
haven't shown you too much as to how to
do that
but the next video is going to very
specifically to take a program and
divided into parts okay
and with that I say I bid you farewell</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
