I can come up with a new name for this
YouTube channel it's like you just in
your name and what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna generate one using an algorithm
called the Markov chain now if you watch
the previous video then I spent a lot of
time talking about what a Markov chain
is and building the code for a Markov
chain from scratch one thing I didn't
know how to do however which this video
will focus on is how to use a Markov
chain to generate a short phrase so in
this sense what I'm gonna feed into the
Markov chain is many many examples of
that short phrase so you could use city
names or character names or thesis title
ideas or course title ideas I think if I
like school stuff because that's where
my brain is that but you know YouTube
channel names so here are a bunch of
YouTube channel names that came in
suggested from the viewers through a
Google Form now I could actually connect
to the Google forum directly and I have
a example that shows you how to do that
but I think for right now for simplicity
sake this is just in a text file called
names txt so I'm gonna go to the Markov
chain code no longer do I want to have
the hard-coded text about the unicorn or
the theremin instead what I want to do
is I'm gonna make a variable called
names I'm going to add the preload
function so in p5 the preload function
is a function where I can preload data
files like images sounds and other kinds
of data files and I'm gonna say names
equals load strings names dot txt
so if I do this and I'm just gonna say
console.log means I'm gonna get lots of
weird errors because I took out a bunch
of other things I should see oh I don't
see any this I do I'm gonna see this
array of all of I have an array of all
the names that people suggested and
there's some other errors so now what I
need to do is I need to do this so this
engrams remember this engrams variable
stores the table of everything so what I
need to do is instead of having one
piece of text that I feed into the model
the Engram table the barcode model the
table
good call it I need to do that through a
loop so what I need to do is I need to
put an outer loop so I'm going to say
for VAR j equals 0 J is less than names
length J plus + and I'm going to put a
loop around all of this and then what
I'm going to do is this inner loop is
the thing that adds stuff to the in
Graham's model what I'm going to do is
save our text equals names index I so
I'm going to add each line from that
text file one at a time to the model the
reason why I want to do this is I want
all of that to be part of the possible
possibilities however one thing that's
not built into my code is well how does
the name begin a name could begin with
seek Co d jo Y Co D th e o de wo n so I
want to keep a separate list of actual
possible beginnings for the generation
process so in the one hand I'm kind of
done here like it um the thing that
won't work let me run this cannot lead
read property length of undefined sketch
J s line 17 let's see what the error is
ah hmm
Oh names index J boy that's bad and J
plus plus so remember the outer loop is
J so I'm looking at each there is no I
so that worked and you can see I'm
getting a nice big list with all the
sort of possibilities that table is
working if I hit generate though I'm
gonna have an error and that error is
txt is not defined because how I was
able to how I started the generator was
with just the first three letters or
whatever the order is of that seed
phrase now what I think that would make
sense to do is I need to I want to
create I'm gonna call it beginnings I
don't know if I've mentioned this by the
way that this most of all the code that
I'm writing is based on Python code
written by Allison parish and I'll make
sure to credit her in both the previous
video and this one I guess I'm
mentioning it now I should have
mentioned it in the first one so Thank
You Allison for that code that at some
point I looked at a couple years ago
when I first started doing this stuff
okay so hey that was implanted in my
head two years ago and it's coming out
right now I guess there might be some
differences okay
so I what I want to do is have an array
called beginnings which are what are the
possible beginnings so each time I look
at a name
the first gram is a possible beginning
so if if I equals zero
beginnings dot push gram so I want to
keep track of an extra list of all the
possible beginnings meaning here is the
table of all of the engrams and possible
outcomes and if I look at beginnings
here is an array of all of the possible
ways that a name could begin and again
there's redundancy here then why are
they all two characters instead of three
Oh Jeff my end must be to the end is to
okay that's right I was gonna start with
three so if I do this again and hit
beginnings we could see yes so these are
all the possible ways that a name could
begin and there's redundancy in there
but I like that because I want my name's
to begin with the same probabilities as
my input data so now what I'm going to
do is down here the current Graham just
needs I just need to pick a random
beginning so random beginnings so I just
pick a random beginning and that's where
I start and then I let the algorithm
just go so let's run it and see what I
get
coding codes and unit colors coding time
rainbows shiffman's rainbow coding
peratis and just Brett trim of colored
orange yellow code kitschy on that in
that code so you can see have we found
something yet I think first of all a
couple things one is I should probably
limit the name to about maybe 15
characters I don't maybe let's limit it
to 20 and maybe let's make the order too
because it's making too much sense
coding blander seeand a yuna coding
happy recode i coding pitchy code cod
the keyattr drove got me coding in hop
bearden ode that's yon reading see so
you can see here that this is working
but what the order is is really going to
affect
affect the sort of the vista show coding
balloon coding meter al meteorological p
happy jumping dancing codes and so that
order might be too high i might only be
getting literal the sort of literal
names and another thing here to point
out is this would be much more probably
interesting if i had a data set of a
hundred thousand names that i could use
you know something you might try is to
you know what's your input data come up
with what the thing you're trying to
name see if you can find a really big
data set maybe have a slider where you
can adjust the order so the the user can
actually pick what that order is i'm as
as the user is generating text from it
so i don't know if we've come I really
thought that at the end of this video
I'd be able to do this and now the new
name of this channel is you know let's
just say it's okay hold on let's make
the order three is that's kind of in
between let's just say it's for the rest
of today
the name of this channel is drumroll
joy of light appearing D hashtag joy of
light appearing D few all in another
video I I saw more stuff that I need to
talk about which is looking at
generating Markov chains for longer
pieces of text perhaps as well as on the
word level I think would be worth taking
a look at as well okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
