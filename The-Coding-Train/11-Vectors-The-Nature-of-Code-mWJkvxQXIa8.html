people life and what you've been looking
forward to but I I for one have been
looking forward to this get past some of
these introductory videos we're here I
feel a little more comfortable you feel
a little more comfortable we are getting
ready to talk about this building block
the building block of all of the
examples that we're going to look
through it after this entire video
series we're going to look at physics
simulation steering behaviors fractals
genetic algorithms all sorts of stuff we
need something to start with and the
topic that is sort of the build the
foundation for everything we're going to
build on is vectors so I want this video
to really just answer one single what to
two single questions a pair of questions
if you will what is a vector and the
second question really is why do we even
care
why if we are people who live our life's
live our lives walking around and
sitting down and doing stuff and eating
food and then sometimes getting at a
computer and programming graphics why
should we care about a vector so the
first question what is a vector I'm
supposed to answer that question okay so
um yeah this is not the easiest question
to answer first of all it has a lot of
it's kind of hard it's complicated but
you know let's simplify it for ourselves
let's talk about a vector in
two-dimensional space for a moment I
know that we don't live in
two-dimensional space but we program a
lot in two-dimensional space and we also
have two-dimensional space
this is kind of a two-dimensional space
right here I'm doing weird things to the
whiteboard hello anyway so I just forgot
to start the timer but so how long I've
been going with oh it's been a minute
but we're gonna get to this question I
feel awkward about it because I don't
want to give the wrong answer let's just
try let's try you together um okay so
what is the vector okay let's draw a
vector for a second we can represent a
vector in two-dimensional space as an
arrow
it could actually represent into
three-dimensional space as an arrow as
well but let's look at this this
is our vector let's think about this
more a little more substance of detail a
vector is something that has magnitude
at a key concept here and two direction
with an exclamation point to emphasize
that point a vector has both magnitude
and direction now looking at this arrow
I think this stuff might be so long I
think you want to figure this out
already what is the magnitude what is
the magnitude of this vector the
magnitude of this vector we can say is
the length of it or the size this is the
magnitude of a vector is it a long arrow
is it a short arrow what is the
direction also perhaps a somewhat
obvious question the direction of this
vector is the direction that it's
pointing in right and arrow points in a
particular direction we could formalize
that right we sort of formalized
magnitude by saying needle length like I
could get out a ruler and measure it and
that's actually the magnitude of that
vector we could say perhaps the
direction is perhaps an angle relative
to some axis like if we think of having
an x axis a horizontal axis a line here
the direction could be represented by an
angle and I'm going to use the Greek
letter theta somebody's knocking the way
it looks enough it eventually okay okay
we cut seen back and we're back sorry
for the little interruption there so
let's think about vectors for a moment
in a slightly different way let's say
you were giving directions to somebody
from how to get from point A to point B
you might say look you're looking to
leave this place that you're in and run
away and escape it's not very far the
door takes five steps forward let's say
four steps forward because it's not that
far one two three four turn 90 degrees
to the right and take three steps
goodbye one two three well I could draw
that out of the board as one two three
four steps turn to the right and one two
three now if we look at this
I started in point any and I ended up
in point B and here is my vector this
arrow describes how I get from point A
to point B and this is on I keep looking
at it gotta turn it off because I would
like to look at you it this is just just
us here this strange I don't know place
that we are okay um so this vector has
four steps over here and three steps
over here it turns out by the way what
does this look like to you it looks like
a right triangle with a right angle you
might remember this thing called the
Pythagorean theorem a squared plus B
squared equals C squared the 3 4 5
triangle the length of this arrow is
actually 5 we're starting to see
something here even though a vector
conceptually is just this idea of an
arrow it has a length and it has a way
that it's pointing the magnitude in the
direction we also start to see here
thing there seems to be some type of
math related to this that has to do with
things we learned in geometry and
trigonometry and we can make an angle
here we start saying sine of the angle
is opposite over hypotenuse and cosine
is well adjacent over hypotenuse
hopefully I got that right
what's going on here well a vector can
actually be separated into its
components the X component and the y
component we can see that over here here
is the X component that length and this
length here is the Y component so even
though a vector K is expressed as an
arrow length and magnitude it can also
be expressed as a pair of numbers and x
and a y now you might be that might
sound familiar to you right when was the
last time you wrote a processing sketch
where you didn't just stick at the very
top of your program float X float Y and
this is the moment where we have now
answered our second question why do we
care about vectors because we do this
all the time we have x and y for
position we've XP and wisely for
velocity maybe we have X acceleration Y
acceleration X wind Y wind X friction Y
friction X blast y blast either you
could come up with any variable its X Y
this X Y this and then when you go into
3-2 your X Y &amp;amp; Z and X speed and Y is
beans these mean you're just this pile
and pile
variables but you can't get control over
and you're doing the same stuff with
them over and over again a simple thing
you do with them over and over again is
x equals x plus XP y equals y plus y
speed right
but then when y speed changes by gravity
and then when X P changes by wind you
just have all of this stuff happening
over and over again and there might be
there's lots of mathematical functions
that this is what I've just said this
three times this is why we might this is
why with we can rig very almost like
prideful little the very first way of
understanding why we care about vectors
it's just to say I don't want to have
this in my code I want to say instead of
float X Y I want to say P vector
position now P vector is a class in
processing that makes an object which is
a vector and we're going to get into
that I think I think this video it just
needs to end and we'll move on to the
next one you can just watch them
continuously but in the next video we're
going to get into the code more more
deeply so let's actually just go before
we go to the next video walk I don't
walk over here to this blank space
because this computer would sleep I know
magic okay so look at this this is the
bit of the pristine example of exactly
what I'm talking about we have a
processing sketch where this ball moving
around the screen oh come on seriously
computer well you can imagine little boo
doo doo doo the ball bouncing around the
screen this is so sad soul there we go
okay um where where this processing
sketch has an X to the Y for position
and X being and y speed for essentially
what we're going to start calling
velocity the velocity vector of this
object of the shape that's moving around
the screen so what I would like to do
for us your give you as an exercise
before you move on to the next video is
go and find a processing sketch sketch
sketch it's like a skit and a sketch can
you make a prosthetic skip like program
a skit that would be kind of interesting
would it be entertaining to watch I
don't know find a sketch that you've
made that were you model motion
somewhere
where you have X's and Y's and X B's and
Y's needs go and find that sketch
because in the next video we're going to
look at how we actually instead of just
having x and y everywhere how we start
using the p vector class describe the
position of an object and the way that
position changes over time so that's
what we're going to do in the next
sketch I'm going to dominat I'm going to
walk through this particular example
then you if you you'll have found yours
then you'll try to add P vector into
your sketch and then hopefully we will
figure out some way that we can
communicate to each other and you could
ask me some questions and I could answer
some questions because you are not a
person you are just the strange lens
staring at me in this creepy strange way
I must stop this video now okay so I
think this is good for now thank you for
watching I really appreciate it if
you're still watching I'm kind of
shocked and amazed actually but
hopefully you're learning something if
you're not you could just email me a
complaint I would that would be fine I
will accept all complaints okay I'm
going to there's a button after press
over here to stop it okay goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
