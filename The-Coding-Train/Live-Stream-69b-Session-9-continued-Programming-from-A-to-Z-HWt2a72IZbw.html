where I recorded a couple guests
tutorials with Sarah Dresner and Val
head those will be published sometime in
the next week they're super exciting one
was about springs and p5 j/s and one was
about a framework that I never heard of
before today called mo j s so um
anybody's actually watching this in the
chat I'm so I'm very tired it's been a
very long day it's about 640 p.m. i
already did a two hour livestream and
then recorded two guests tutorials and I
was doing office hours all morning so
this has been kind of an epic adventure
of a day but I really wanted to come
back because the coding challenge that I
started earlier I ran out of time wasn't
able to finish and since I won't be
doing another live stream until sometime
next week I really wanted to make sure
that was finished so that it could be
published mo in the chat wants a shout
out otherwise mo will not feed Mo's baby
nephew and I really don't want any
babies to go unfed so I'm well I'm I
need you to refill this water which was
stupid than I didn't do that before i'm
starting let's see how I do so um i'm
just gonna kind of keep an eye on the
chat and my battery level of the
microphone and i'm gonna get started
everybody wants shoutouts ciao Lola key
wants a shout out Oh Australia what time
what I would like to know is what time
is it same when watching this in the
middle of the night right now and 640
p.m. I'm not doing my usual
introductions that I usually do in these
live streams because I did all that in
the previous one I did today although
probably when these get publish to
youtube they'll be separate videos some
of you might just be watching the
beginning of this but such as life okay
so let me figure out where I was before
Here I am so this is what I ended with
Jacobs gonna cry all you guys are really
pulling on my heartstrings Jacob is
going to cry all night if Jacob does not
get a shout-out midnight in the UK hello
UK okay
so um this is okay I'm gonna I'm stop it
with the shout out so now I'm going to
look at the chat too much I'm going to
finish up this tutorial so I'm going to
try to figure out where I left off so
this is what I have so far I have a web
application that allows you to doodle
into a canvas click Save and it saves
your drawing to a database and then it
shows all the drawings that have been
saved here okay so I'm now going to
Matua if you're watching this now or
later I am going to move into the part
where I'm going to just report end the
pickup as if this is one video I don't
know how easy or hard that will be but
I'm going to give that a try if it has
to be it could be two parts but I think
this will just be like one long tutorial
which I think it's fine oh sorry so just
in case people are new it didn't watch
this afternoon I did two introductory
fire-based tutorials this afternoon and
those haven't yet to be published I they
were available live and now they're kind
of hidden on youtube in the archives but
once those files get cleaned up and
edited they'll be the raw archive and
edited versions of those that will
appear online and actually something
that I really forgot to mention which is
a retrieve and we just once firebase
this should pull it up this I should
have mentioned this in all of the videos
but we'll put it in as a link in the
descriptions but this is the reference
page read and write data on the web so
this reference page shows kind of all of
the stuff for what I'm doing but there's
sort of more to it in terms of all the
authentication stuff which I'm totally
glossing over I should have mentioned
that there's so much more things to talk
about can't get to everything okay and
deleting data all that sort of stuff
alright i'm skipping I got something I
gotta like learn this promise stuff and
do some tutorials about that okay so I'm
checking out the chat hello Brazil okay
and I ran out of water okay while people
are oh my god so many people have just
joined
while people are joining I'm going to
refill this water because I really do
need I shoulda done that before I
started soundcloud whoops System
Preferences sound multi hallways of an
algorithm the actual random algorithm
itself those numbers aren't related at
all you pick like I'm thinking red
numbers between zero got in here the day
to Sally right back 6 194 8 9 to 13 I
think nine a lot apparently but with
Perlin noise I might pick numbers like
this two three four three four five six
five four five six seven five six seven
five six seven eight nine eight seven
six these look like pearls and noise
performance part 89 two one three two
three four three four five six five
these are like birthing noise
performance apart 576
with curly noise I might pick numbers
like this ok I'm back oh did I did I
actually put on the correct music I have
no idea did I have no because I couldn't
I catch the other audio of what was
playing I just funded through the live
stream so i have no idea if that was
this sad song i would but we're past
that now ok welcome to everyone who is
just joined i am continuing my tutorial
series from this afternoon i'm hoping
this will just take about 15 or 20
minutes um it was not sorry everyone oh
well hopefully that was a Creative
Commons license music wow the my keying
is really off today but what am I gonna
do I'm gonna move over here that should
help a little bit ok so i am now here
and firebase console is here boy what's
and drawings are here and okay so i'm
gonna go to yeah first thing i want to
do is add a clear button okay okay
everyone sorry I'm on my brain is
totally fried as I said before it's been
a very long day but I really want to
finish this example so I'm just going to
dive right into it right now so
apologies for those of you who are just
tuning in tonight this i'm continuing an
example i made earlier today which is a
drawing web application that stores
drawings in a firebase database so you
if you'll be able to go back and watch
the other stuff that i'll publish from
this afternoon earlier which will be the
beginning part of what i'm going to do
now ok so here we go ok so i'd like to
add a couple more features to this web
application before i finish up one is I
need a button to like clear the drawing
because once there's a drawing here
there's no way for me to start over a
new drawing so the first thing that I
want to do is just add another button
and I'm going to go to index HTML and
I'll add
button call it a clear button and I'll
say clear and then I'm going to refresh
the page we see the clear button is
there so now what I need to do is in the
JavaScript code what I need to do is
find where I'm doing stuff with buttons
and I'm going to use the same technique
by using the p5 Dom libraries function
select to select the clear button and
then the clear button will get an event
called clear drawing and remember the
drawing is just this array so if I want
to clear the drawing all this is like a
very simple thing to do and I know I
could just put an anonymous function
here but for clarity I'm kind of just
doing this I don't know if it's actually
for clarity this might be worse but i'm
going to i'm going to go destin bottom
like code and write this callback
function clear drawing and all you need
to do there is reset the array to
nothing so now I can draw something
right da da da I can hit clear I can
start over smiley face I can hit clear I
could load up one of these drawings I
could hit clear and start over or I
could load this and I could start up on
it so you're starting to think there's a
lot of possibilities here of some kind
of exquisite corpse style collaborative
drawing editing thing so you know I
don't have color I don't have there's so
much you could add to this if you want
to like build off of this and make some
sort of exciting thing I hope you do ok
so now we have the clear button what's
another feature I want to add well one
thing that's a bit of a problem is I'm
gonna add another drawing I love hearts
so I'm going to just do some more hearts
I'm gonna do a drawing with three hearts
now watch what happens when I hit save
it updates the list but it's really hard
to see because again if you're gonna
work on my work I would renate out add a
name field and add a name for all these
but what you're seeing here is that it's
duplicating all the whole list again
when i add just one so something that I
need to do and I did this in another
example recently is I want to find where
I'm creating that list which is right
here and I want to give every one of
these elements a class and I'm going to
just call it a listing so this i'm going
to give this and this is
again p5 Don library as a class function
that gives it a listing class and then
when I when I oh I'm sorry I'm in the
right place already so this is the part
where I create that so before I create
it I want to and there's probably more
efficient way to do this because I could
just sort of requests from the database
just anything new or I could be more
thoughtful about this but I'm just going
to kind of do this thing where i clear
the whole list so so I'm going to just
make a variable called ELT four elements
and I'm going to do select all and i'm
going to say dot listing and then i'm
going to loop through all of those
elements and call the p5 dom library
function remove which removes the dom
element from the page so before i
generate the list i'm going to clear it
because i'm going to get all the data
from the database again so now we should
have i refresh the page we can see here
are all my drawings and now i'm going to
clear and make another drawing which i'm
going to try to make a cube my kids love
to draw 3d cubes it's like sort of this
like fascinating thing for like little
kids ok so i did that hit save and we
can see now that's just there so
dynamically added to the page so we
really really really gotten far along in
a way this is done I could say like okay
well I want to do something to add a
feature to edit a drawing update a
record in the database delete of
drawings in the database those are
things I'm going to leave for you to
investigate you know again all the
documentation for this is at this URL
firebase like google.com / / / read and
write so this is where you can see where
these functions on value that sort of
thing but what I want to do oh you know
what I realized I did something which I
really should probably change there's
two more features one is this is the
function i wrote earlier to show one
individual drawing so whenever I call
ref dot on like i did with all the data
I'm tying an event to that record in the
database forever so if that record ever
changes this event will trigger again
and a lot of times you want that but in
this case I might want to just only get
the data from the database just once
I can actually change this from on to
once so once will not tie that event
forever but just one time so now I'm
going to hit ribbon on the wrong page
I'm going to hit refresh that's
hopefully this still works and you can
see this still works but if i add a
drawing i will refresh the whole thing
okay so we're still in the Sun but
something that would be really good to
add to this what if I what if what I
want to do is be is be able to share my
drawing with somebody else well right
now the only way to do that is to is to
sort of email somebody the ID and then
tell them to go to this page and click
on the ID what if I could encode into
the URL something like ? ID equals my
drawing and so what if each one of those
drawings can have a permalink where you
could share that permalink and the
drawing would show up so here's how I'm
going to start doing that the first
thing I want to do is just create that
permalink so when I'm making these
listings in addition to this link that
dynamically updates the drawing on the
page I'm going to do exactly the same
thing again i'm going to say create a
but instead i'm going to say ? ID equals
plus key that's the link and then what I
wanted to say is I'm just going to say
permalink and then what I'm going to do
so let's do this and we should see now
oh and I need to parent it also oh and
this should be I'll just call this a
perma and I'm gonna say / MoDOT parent
Li so it also goes in that list and you
can see now enough you can see now I
have the this this and then also these
permalinks now the spacing is also
obviously with CSS and thinking about
styling and be more thoughtful about the
HTML I'm just going to do something
quick which is like perma dot style this
is a p5 Dom library for adding some CSS
styles I don't maybe if I just add some
padding will that do it make it I can
differentiate between those two yeah so
now I can see I have the permalink and
the actual so this is now showing me the
drawings and now if I click on one of
these it goes to the page where the
drawing does not show up but look what
happens it you are it creates a URL
query string
with ID equals this so i can have the
page read that URL query string how do i
do that well there's lots of ways you
could do it but since I'm using the p5
jazz framework there is a p 5 GS
function for this so i'm going to go to
the p 5 GS org slash reference oops
that's the website a reference and I'm
going to have to look for this URL ah so
get URL params so there's three
functions here but I can actually just
get the parameters that are on the page
in an object so if i look at the
reference for this all i need to do is
call get URL prams so i'm going to do
that in setup so I'm going to come back
here to set up and I'm going to say well
I'm going to do this right at the
beginning actually and i'm going to say
params equals get URL params with this
right and i'm just going to say console
dot log params so i'm going to go back
to the page here i am into the the code
i'm going to open up the console so i
can see it I'm gonna hit refresh and you
can see this is what came in an object
with a field ID which is the key from
the database that's all I needed perfect
right so and you can see that if i
delete that from the URL path and just
go i'm getting an empty object so what I
can actually do here is I can say if
params ID exists if that object has an
ID then what 20 first of all this has
got to happen you know this has got to
happen after i connect to the database
so I'm gonna do this down here and then
didn't I already have a function that's
like show drawing right this shows a
drawing for a particular key now here's
the thing I kind of I should probably
give this an argument so I'm going to
put argument here so if I already have
the key if I don't have the key right
this is a way of having a function
optionally take an argument so on the
one hand it's an event that comes from
that link and it gets the key from the
dom element but i can also just call
that function with a key so I can say if
I don't have the key
then key equals this otherwise though if
I just create it with the key and so
where do i do that in in in I'm sorry ba
in setup right so much scrolling right
here if I have an ID I can just say now
show drawing with with params ID so this
should now and let's let's see if this
works let's do console dot log params ID
so make sure that this actually goes
here so let's just look to the I'm now
loading it and it's empty so I don't see
anything and I can still ups alright
first argument was an invalid path so I
messed up that function somehow let's
see what happened here oh you know what
it must have arguments when it's as the
callback so this didn't work what a nice
idea let's let me let me actually figure
this out and I've been make this video a
little bit longer but I think it's going
to be worth it let's look at the
arguments array you can always say
arguments to look at what are the
arguments for a function in JavaScript
whether you've specified them as actual
parameters in the function definition or
not so what I want to do is do this
click on here so the argument it passes
it a mouse event so and so the first
element is a mouse event so i can
probably say something like if key is
not an inch an instance of this is
really silly what I'm doing when I could
just write a separate function but let's
see if this works I don't know if that
actually is going to work if key is an
instance of a mouse event let's see what
happens there oh that worked so what I'm
doing now is I'm using the repurposing
the same function for two different uses
on the one hand I want to be able to
call the function with a key on the
other hand I want this function just to
happen as part of a mouse pressed event
and key what I call it with a key will
actually be a key otherwise it might be
a mouse event so I'm going to override
whatever it is by getting it from H
so now we can see I've got the blank
object and everything works but I can
now go to the permalink which refreshes
the page and get that because the key
comes in permalink so every time i
refresh this page it comes up with that
particular drawing and I could once
again oh I'm gonna say that again every
time i refresh the page it could come up
with that drawing and I could add
something to it like it could make this
a weird alien face or something and I'm
going to hit save and now I have all
these drawings here are all my drawings
I could click on and let me make this a
little smaller so you can see then I can
click on all the drawings and I have a
permalink to all these drunk so how do I
control click or option-click it will
open in a new note command click it will
open it in a new tab so I'm command
clicking on all of these and we can see
their separate pages that load these
drawings from the database automatically
so this really brings us to the end of
this tutorial this is a p5 GS sketch
that allows users to create their own
drawing you i can write a message to all
thank you i was going to try to write
thank you for watching and it's going to
take me way too long plus my doodling
Mouse handwriting is terrible thank you
i can make a drawing i can hit save it
adds it to the database i can on the
same page click between the drawings and
i can also get a permalink so this page
anytime i refresh the page starts with
that drawing i could obviously make a
separate page I could make them here's
what you should do if you're watching
this in one do an exercise grab this
code will be in the description linked
the code for this will be linked on
github obviously you'll have to create
your own firebase database I'll probably
take out the keys I guess but rework
this to make a separate view that shows
like a gallery of all the drawings and
you know there's been a lot of wonderful
collaborative drawing applications on
the web I'm thinking of Aaron Koblin
sheep market I think a link to that in
this video's description as well as you
can see as a kind of nice inspiration
for this kind of project so thank you
for watching and I don't know if this
might ended up being a long video I've
lost my bell but that concludes the
database p 5 j s sketch for
saving a drawing into a database and
having a gallery of drawings example and
if you make something with this please
share it with me on twitter at Schiffman
please share a link in the comments ask
your questions in the comments and i
look forward to seeing you in another
video tutorial soon ok bye bye ok how is
that everybody that was ok yes any
questions so it is 7 p.m. I have live
stream for a total of almost two and a
half hours today which is quite a bit
but I do need to get going in the next
10 or 15 minutes but I would be happy to
try to answer one or two questions in
the chat very hard for me to like read
the chat especially when it's got a lot
of people in it but I'll try to keep an
eye on it but while I am waiting i will
also just mention again i want to
mention to you guys the processing
fellowship since i'm here applicata
singh foundation is a non-for-profit
organization that I work with to emit
develops processing and p5 just like it
has a wonderful mission statement I'm
like too tired to like explain
everything about the processing
foundation but we're running a
fellowship program and you can read
information about it on the website
processing foundation org slash
fellowships it comes with a stipend to
work on a project in the spring so check
that out a look at the questions now I
have my own YouTube programming channel
can I use this same format as a video as
you are using also on my channel I don't
see why not I don't have any ownership
over this idea of using a green screen
so if I can inspire people to think
about making progress to trails I think
that's great and I encourage you to do
so oh do a video showing your studio you
know this is like the most requested
thing and I keep forgetting to do this
so I don't know how to remember or when
to carve out the time to do this but you
guys should all keep asking about that
I'm looking at the chat
it's nice to see all these lovely
messages of support I really really
appreciate it I'm just checking my phone
here ah so people are asking about
translating the videos so also there's a
question of word that I learned so let
me answer both of these questions one is
I learned to program a couple different
times I did actually learn when I was a
kid in middle school i programmed a
little bit in basic and I used logo
programming language tutorial graphics
languages was kind of like in the 80s
and I then really started programming
when I became a student at ITP so that's
ITP nyu edu and edu and that's the
program where i teach right now i first
discovered processing there when through
a JT nimoy who did a workshop on part
one of the first public workshops on
processing at ITP in 2003 and also a
meet pitar ooh who taught a class called
code in me at ITP and those were some of
the first instances of processing and
then I started like working with
processing from from seeing their work
and just never stopped what do you
recommend to start with what programming
language this is 0 this is a great
question i don't have an answer for it
so the answer is which everyone looks
good to you i think doing javascript is
great because you can publish your stuff
on the web really quickly python is a
super friendly language processing has
tons of video tutorials that I've made
and is a great community especially for
interested in art and visual design and
processing is built on top of Java so
all of these things I think are great
choices but really if you just found one
that you like and you found a tutorial
or a book or a friend who's willing to
teach and work with you then that's the
one you should use oo translating and
captions I know I'm sorry that I'm
missing some of your questions and I
will try I apologize for that but I've
one day I'll get a system for me getting
these things submitted in advance then I
can kind of read through and moderate
them better so one thing I mentioned I'm
on YouTube is you can I don't know how
to looks pull this up I'm going to open
up my channel but if you're looking for
so this is be live right now
if you're looking for a way to
contribute or you have a way that I
could actually even like pay for this
kind of service in a kind of reasonably
priced way I would love to have all of
my videos captioned in English to make
them more accessible as well as
translated to other languages and you as
a user can actually submit captions
online and i have a link i'll put it in
this video i think if you're on a video
there's a place i haven't enabled where
you can just I don't want to look for it
right now where you can just add a
caption so and that YouTube has an
interface for you doing that so please
if you want to do that you all have
permission to do that I mean I'm getting
the benefit of that so you might thank
you for volunteering but I also don't
want to ask too much of people's time
just to volunteer and do something for
me for free so if you think you want to
spend a lot of time doing this I want to
get in touch I figure out a way to do
that what that makes sense to but I
definitely take voluntary contributions
ah watched your get videos how do I
merge branches with conflicts huh very
very very very very very carefully it's
not really I don't really have a great
answer to that I definitely need to do a
video sort of demonstrating that when I
have a conflict what I do is I actually
open up the files manually in a text
editor and I kind of like just go
through it manually do my detective work
to figure out what went wrong and
they'll usually show you here's code
it'll be like they're these weird like
lots of like dashes and extra characters
that are part of the indicating there's
a merge conflict here and if you add it
that file and clean it up and then do
another commit that's kind of the way I
work there are tools that help help you
with this but that's generally the way I
do it if one were to translate what
series do you recommend I guess I prefer
people to start with the beginner series
that i have and my beginner playlists
are these javascript ones one through
six and then these as well and then the
learning processing ones so a lot of
these have been captioned already but
any of these I'm you know it's kind of
if one interest you and you feel like
watching it then you might as well
translate it or caption it an English
you know translating is great but it
often the reason why i asked for english
captions is it also makes the
translators job so much easier
they're already English captions so if i
could get everything English caption
then people can translate it more easily
oh I did so a dyslexic llama I don't
know if I printer asks can you do a
github for beginners video I have that
so right here I wish I had a better way
for people to find my videos but here on
my channel I have git and github for
poets and these are total beginner
introductions to get and get up you
don't need to know anything about it
whatsoever and I have more to do but you
can see these are these are some of my
lesser watched videos so that I'm
certainly encourage you to watch that
have you made a tutorial on how to
install p5 j/s that's a great question
Scott um this is a tricky question
because unlike processing which really
is a desktop application that you run
even though it also pressing is also
just a library for java p 5 GS is just a
library for javascript so there's
actually nothing to install because you
can code it in any text editor coding
environment whatsoever let me go to the
p 5 GS home page and show you what i
mean by that so if i go to download this
download will will download all of the
library files and an example project but
will not come with a code editor so this
example project is something that you
just need to open in sublime text adam
editor text edit notepad anything and
then run like a witless local web server
to like see the result in your browser
and i have a couple videos that
demonstrate how to do that on a mac at
least and you'll find tutorials also on
the p5 jess wiki page there's a website
wiki page for running a local server if
you google like local server p 5 GS
those will probably come up you could
also get the individual library files
and then there is also an actual editor
so this is an editor that you can
download and run as an application and
it will have it will sort of like make
your project for you and has a little
play button that will launch like a
little browser window but don't get you
should not be misled by the fact that
you don't need this to do javascript
programming but this is a place that
makes it easier to get started I'll also
mention that coming soon we're going to
release a web editor you should just go
right to a website sign up for
and right p5 just code right on in a
browser itself so that's that's kind of
coming soon and we're phasing out some
support of this desktop editor until
we've got a web editor in shape and
maybe we can return back to it so that's
kind of my answer to that question you
can also use code pen I think I did a
tutorial about code pen and p5 Jess at
one point and there's lots of other web
editors as well I do have a cellular
automatic Conway's Game of Life video
already I would love to do that again
though so ok so it's I pretend to use
Adam editor sometimes it is sublime and
I use the p5 GS editor i use everything
I i love the processing IDE I mean it
can't your JavaScript it actually can do
javascript in it so here's another way
you could do it let's see let me show
this to you real quick because Ben Frey
made this and this is going to take me a
minute because I think I want to make
sure I have the latest processing I
don't think I do I real i can't pay I
cannot bear to I cannot bear and by the
way processing is a non-profit
foundation so feel free to we love tete
if you're if you're able to to donate to
help support fund these projects to
processing which will prompt you when
you go to download i'm going to download
this version and let's see oh it's
coming in real fast Oh brackets is great
too sorry that's a great example of an
editor I've used that as well okay so
i'm going to show you something that was
you should thank Ben Ben underscore fry
on Twitter for this wonderful thing that
he did which I have actually not tried
yet so this is exciting and I probably
should make this like a video tutorial
but I'm too tired it'll just be found
here in the archive of this live stream
so I'm going to move this to the desktop
here replace and I'm going to run the
latest version of processing if no idea
what's going to happen this is exciting
yes I want to open this so processing by
the way is a java is a there's so much
to say about processing processing or
I've too tired talk anymore ok so I'm
going to open up actually I'm not going
to open up an example I'm gonna go here
processing has modes so you can actually
in processing which is java-based it
also has a Python mode which allows us
to write code in python has an android
mode which allows you to publish your
pressing sketches to android and add
this ad mode p 5 GS mode so this is
another way you can work on p5 jazz
sketches I'm going to add this mode and
hopefully it'll install I hope this
works I'm going to switch to p 5 GS mode
and look at this it already put in
function and draw oh anna has any next
on HTML but this is amazing oh my god at
Ben underscore fry on Twitter this is
awesome I'm going to just write some
code great canvas 400 400 and uh
background zero ellipse actually you
know what I'm going to get I'm just
going to I'm going to just go copy paste
something so i'm going to get my
phyllotaxis phyllotaxis example which is
under coding challenges in my github
repo challenges phyllotaxis p5 j/s
whoops sketch jas raw let me copy paste
this copy paste this here it's save file
oh I'm just gonna put this on the
desktop a testing p 5 j s mode and now
i'm going to run this what happens when
I hit play look at that that is
fantastic so it mate runs a little local
server and if I were to do something
like just to change something real quick
like let's um I don't know change the
size of these ellipses and give them a
little bit of alpha and hit save if i
refresh this yeah and now there you go
so hopefully I'm not hypnotizing
everything so that's great why I should
use this more in like video tutorials
this is fun what happens if i have an
error it's worked somehow i don't know i
mean i didn't save off to investigate
this more but that's so great to see ok
so now it's been a half an hour I've
been over two and a half hours today I
do need to get home and get some sleep i
have two classes doing our final project
presentations i probably have a zillion
emails from students with questions so
i'm going to take a look at those and
get home thanks for tuning in everything
that i did today will be
published will be published on my
channel so subscribe if you want alerts
about that it'll come in the next week I
expect to do a live stream again next
week but I don't know what day yet and i
will announce these things on twitter at
schiffman and i also do have an email
list that i sometimes send announcements
to which you can sign up for at coding
rainbow com and of course if you also
want to support the work that I'm doing
absolutely only if you feel so inclined
I do have a patreon that you're welcome
to subscribe to if you feel so inclined
but I'm just glad that you're watching
and that you're here and maybe if you
give some feedback whether it's good or
bad in a nice and constructive way I
also appreciate that okay so i will see
i will see okay so i'm gonna answer
three quick questions I plan to do
neural network tutorials this spring I
studio is not in my office at NYU I
teach at ITP nyu edu it's here at the
school for poetic computation which is
an independent artist run school call
sfp cio if you're in the new york city
area the show of the students work is
actually happening this weekend so you
should come and check it out and what
version of processing that Jas is kind
of caddy be used so I'm not exactly sure
about this Khan Academy has their own
staff of developers who tends the stuff
I'm pretty sure they use something
called process yes i know that's very
confusing this was a project started
originally by John Resig and it's
another it's a JavaScript version of
processing that actually has hooks in it
to auto translate your processing code
to JavaScript I don't know if they're
shifting to p5 Jess I'm curious I'd be
curious about that as well though both
of them both environments are great and
I know that proxy address has worked
really well for them okay github is a
great place for code challenges okay I
am 43 years old okay so I answered all
these questions and now I am going to
say goodbye I will play you out with my
cringe-worthy intro video and I will see
you all next week okay
I hope to see you someday in a live
stream or in a video or in a comment or
on Twitter sometime and maybe i'll meet
you in person and give you some stickers
ok goodbye
encoding with you really rough throw
your hands up in the air and saying
nothing up do you want to learn to code
and make some awesome stuff then anyone
can when you're coding with Dan
whether you're a power this is all
brand-new Bernie overarching concept as
a bunch up to and with Dan is your guide
come along for the ride
make a crazy pixel mirror to reflect
your face you can make it jump to
Lightspeed into outer space you can
generate a maze that can go on for days
you can make your own terrain and some
purple red you can make a retro game to
see how it's done and then tweet cookies
to make it yours for everyone make some
freshly trees or Twitter but if you
please and when this is Sonia
right the colours of code you can follow
the road</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
