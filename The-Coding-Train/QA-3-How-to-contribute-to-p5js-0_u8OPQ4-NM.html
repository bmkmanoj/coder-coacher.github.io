creative coding video in this video I'm
going to answer a question from Michelle
Michelle writes on helping with p5
development I'm still beginner II but is
there a way I can contribute to it I was
thinking about contributing to the
inline examples might be a way a via
this page and there's a link to a
particular page that I'll show you in a
minute
are there certain examples which might
be a good one to keep in mind as a
reference ok so you're asking the
question let's say the Michelle is
asking question I'm gonna generalized
question a bit more I I like p5 I'm
interested in it how can I contribute so
the first thing I want to say is that
there is a wonderful set of video
tutorials that are being created by
Luisa Pereira and they are called
looking inside p5 and you can see
there's part one and there's also a part
two she also has both of these tutorials
in Spanish so they're both in English
and in Spanish now I would play it for
you right now but you can go the links
will be in this video's description and
you can go and watch them on your own
but what's wonderful about these video
tutorials is they kind of explain to you
this is let's say you want to contribute
to p5.js this is where you will land
this is the github repository page for
p5.js github.com slash processing / p5
yes there's all this stuff there's a
source folder and a Lib folder in a docs
folder in this bill tasks and tests how
is this organized how does it all work
Louisa does a wonderful job of going
through all of these things in her
tutorial videos so rather than do that
here I'm gonna refer you to those
particular videos so what I'm going to
do here is show you a bit about how you
might other places and how you might
sort of get involved so one thing is is
the first thing that you can do is just
kind of go and look at some of the wiki
pages so here they might look through
there's some tutorials and different
things but there one thing that I would
look at here first is this development
wiki so this development wiki gives you
a nice kind of set on ideas and things
about what you can do in order to get
started getting contributing so you can
look through the github issues there's
links to that here you could think about
implementing a new feature there's lots
of stuff here there's instructions of
what you need to do to set up and
download it
this stuff might look a little bit
intimidating or a little bit scary but
p5.js
is a friendly and open place it doesn't
matter what your skill level is we want
you to contribute we want you to help so
come and give it a try and see where you
get stuck send me a tweet post on the
processing forums there's various place
where you can where you can get help I
also have a bunch of video tutorials
about github that you could take a look
at now Michelle had asked Michelle I'd
pointed out this particular this
particular wiki page which was called
the development checklist and the
development checklist is kind of a
checklist oh I wish I had looked at this
for my webgl video earlier but you can
sort of see here a bunch of things that
are kind of in progress or being
developed that you can think about
contributing to and one of the things
that you can look at that she had
noticed here the data
okay I'm gonna find it more quickly is
the in line in line example okay wait
hold on what am I looking at here sorry
reference sketches sorry so these are
sketches and things that are for the
reference now you can see that some of
them are not crossed out meaning they
haven't been done yet ID class so let's
look at how that works and I'll show you
a little bit about how you might do this
so oh these aren't links so let's say
you want to create something for the the
ID function in p5 Dom how would you do
that
so let's go and I'm gonna show you
actually I'm gonna go to p5.js I'm gonna
go here to source and actually I just
realized this is all the source for all
the stuff that's in the p5 just library
itself and all it gets compiled together
into that big p5.js library but the p5
Dom function the p5 Dom library is
actually different and it's right here
in Lib Adams add ons p5 Dom Chasse so
you can see here is actually all of the
source code for p5 dom j s now and what
I want to do is go back to that
development checklist that's not showing
up
if I there we go that's what I wanted to
show up and let's look back under DOM
and we can see that for example position
is implemented so right here we can see
that position is implemented so I'm
gonna look for the position function so
I can see actually this is the source
code for the position function in p5 Dom
so what position does is it takes a Dom
element and gives it an absolute
position on the page I don't have my not
looking at my chat and I'm worried that
something's not working okay so now
here's the source code for it but up
here is a quick little example create a
canvas and call canvas top position and
look how this is formatted it's
formatted at example with a div with
code class equals no render because the
code isn't rendered or maybe it should
be rendered I don't know and then close
code tag close div tag so I'm gonna go
here and I'm just gonna copy paste this
so now what I'm going to do is I'm let's
look for the ID function so i'm gonna
look for ID equals equals function i
gotta find it
oh you know why it's not here tricky
tricky tricky back I couldn't find the
function that I want to edit here in
p5.js and actually what I didn't realize
is the function ID is a function that
assigns a specific ID to a Dom element
and it's not actually in the p5 Dom is
function sorry add on it because it
comes with core p5 it's actually part of
core p5 and for that I need to go to
source and then I'm looking for p5 core
p5 element Jas and here it is so I want
to look for ID equals whoops ID equals
and now here's that function
and you'll notice that function does not
have an example so let's just do this
right now we're gonna live on YouTube on
the air make an example and submit a
pull request and my logged in when I'm
logged in as Schiffman that's going to
be a bit of a problem that's fine so I'm
gonna hit edit because I have privileges
to make changes so I have to make sure
so now I want to look for ID equals and
I'm gonna go right here and I'm gonna
paste that in oh I lost it so hold on I
got a I got to get back to lib add ons
p5 dumb and I'm going to search for what
was one that we liked position position
here it is I got to get this example
stuff right here I'm going to go back
here and now I'm going to zoom in here
so you can see what I'm doing I'm gonna
paste this in here ooh
so I need to fix this so that the
spacing is right you know I could be
more thoughtful about this
and then I need to make sure this is
closed so now you can see I've added the
code for an example but this is the code
for the position so what I want to do is
do make given an ID and I'll make that
ID my canvas and then what this does is
I'll write account assigns a CSS
selector ID to the canvas element so I
don't know if anybody so this is now
adding a quick little example that shows
you how you can use the ID function and
then oh this german going on in the chat
now and then i'm going to go down to the
bottom and i want to create a new branch
and start a pull request so adding in
line example for ID function I'm gonna
write I'm live on YouTube demonstrating
how to make a pull request and add an
inline inline example so once I do that
I'm gonna click proposed file change and
there's some guidelines for contributing
that I could click at and I want to see
and I'm going to create this this you
can see my change is just in this one p5
element it adds just this code and I'm
going to say create pull request and
it's gonna do some checks to make sure
things are okay and we'll see on
Thursday this Thursday is coding rainbow
the there will be a mystery will
discover was this pull request merged or
was it not merged stay tuned to be
continued oh I need a sound effect for
dun dun dun
is that okay I won't look for that right
now okay so again I kind of went off in
a little bit of tangent of showing you a
very specific thing but basically what
you the p5 as an environment is designed
to be both something they could
beginners can use to learn to program
and also can learn to contribute to an
open-source environment and the place to
do that first is github the problem with
github is it doesn't appear that
friendly to you so I would encourage you
to check out the wiki's in the
development page I would encourage you
to tweet at p5 XJS on twitter to post on
on the processing forum form processing
org and you can go down to the p5.js and
here our p5 jest development questions
if you post it there and are looking for
help on how to contribute post there
send me a tweet so I can look at your
posts and help answer it as well as I'd
recommend checking out Louis's videos
and also something you can just
literally do to be a part of the the
contributions is go to the issues page
this is the issues page read through
some of the issues scan through them if
there's something that you think should
be a feature or something you're not
sure about if it works correctly
contribute right an issue file issue
do not worry about filing an issue
correctly hey you incorrectly you cannot
file it incorrectly the act of filing an
issue is the act of filing it correctly
and if there's ways if you need to close
the issue in Rio and open a new one all
of that is possible and fine so please
come and join and contribute to p5.js
and yes dramatic chipmunk that's the
name of the sound effect I'm looking for
and hopefully this video was somewhat
useful about a little bit about how you
can get started contributing to p5 Jess
