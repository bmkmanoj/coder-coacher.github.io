to talk in this video about what is the
difference between p5.js and processing
I'm probably in a moment gonna say
exactly that same thing because I'm
actually just after the fact recording
an intro because I went on for so long I
decided to drop to divide this
particular discussion into three parts
so the first part I'm just going to kind
of talk about the thrill bigger picture
of these two different environments and
what programming languages they're built
on and kind of how that plays a role in
their features and the ways that you
work with them and I'll diagram that on
the whiteboard the second part I'll
actually show the two different
environments and type some code
side-by-side and look at the editors and
see some pieces of that and in the third
part I will make a list of pros and cons
of why you might want to use one versus
the other or where where one environment
excels over the other environments and
as well as take some questions from a
live chat about things that I missed so
that's going to be these three videos if
you find them interesting please watch
them if you kind of don't please don't
watch them and I'll see you maybe in the
second part hello welcome to a coding
train Q&amp;amp;A video in this video I'm going
to answer a question that I get a lot
about the projects the software projects
that are maintained by something called
the processing foundation the processing
foundation was founded in 2012 its
mission is to promote software literacy
within the visual arts and visual
literacy within technology related
fields and and I would say primarily
also to make these fields make this more
accessible to diverse communities and I
encourage you to read more about the
processing foundation's initiatives and
projects and mission all on the Preston
carnation website but I'm not here to
talk about the processing foundation in
this video because I have this habit of
doing that all the time
the question that I get a lot and this
question comes from someone named
Schiffman okay so I posted this question
but it's only good people tweet and
email it's me all the time but you can
actually ask your own questions here on
this github repository in the issues
which I'll link to in this video's
description but the question here is
what is the difference between p5.js and
Pross
and the last time I tried to make a
video you'll see it in this playlist
answering this question I really went
into the history of these projects and
why they exist and that sort of
philosophy and principles behind them
and then and and some differences in
accent but but I didn't really get to
what I think was important and on a lot
of people's minds which is the technical
differences what are the Lang what are
their underlying programming languages
behind these environments
what kind of editors can I use with
these environments what kind of projects
what kind of features do they have what
kind of cook what's the difference
between the syntax and features of both
of these frameworks and that what I want
to discuss in this particular video okay
so I'm gonna come over here to the
whiteboard for a second over here at the
whiteboard down and let's so here's the
thing processing and p5.js are I would
say open source frameworks software
projects that are there's going to broad
projects that involve different aspects
and so each one let's think about each
one as sort of like three in three
categories so each one of these projects
is both a is all three of these things
in somebody's a library they're built on
top of a programming language and then
for each one of these that you might use
you need some place where you would sort
of type your code and figure out how to
use it and editor so let's think about
these three categories for a second so
p5 and processing let's start with
processing so processing is built is
written is a library for so these are
really kind of one thing I guess I kind
of thinking of - it's really not sorry
it's really two processing is a lie it's
processing as a library for the java
programming language okay the library
that things that processing is adding or
building on top of our giving you
features for our things like like
drawing data hardware
sound right so processing so maybe this
is a good way of thinking about it
processing and I could I could have add
more things here so it's a library
meaning it's really ultimately what it
is one of the aspects of it it's a
library of code that you can call
functions from and it's built on top of
the java programming language there is a
editor for for processing which I'll
call say is like a desktop editor
okay so processing has a desktop editor
that you can download it use p5 is a let
the language that p5 is written in and
that it is a library for is JavaScript
and it has libraries also for drawing
and data and sound but a primary and I
could keep going with the end hardware
but I could keep going with this list
but the primary thing that I might add
here HTML CSS or maybe more importantly
Dom because because it's JavaScript that
I'll get to this and a bit more there's
a big component of P 5 in which
involving the web so now where do you
create projects using p5 here's the
thing processing which is a project that
started in 2001 right if you in 2001 if
you wanted to write and compile and this
is a sort of aspect of this as well and
create software sketches you would need
a code editor most code editors were
difficult to download install maybe you
need to use command line if you're just
using a text editor or you have this big
giant complex environment like Eclipse
or so processing really the idea of
processing being an editor is really
fundamental to the project you download
this editor you open it up and you type
code in it
you hit a play or a run button you see
the result of your code you know easy
peasy so to speak so just as much as
processing is both a library with all
these functionality a place to call
those functions in an editor is very
fundamental to the project p5 in many
ways that's a little bit less the case
because of the world that we live in now
where you can program for the web you
know name your favorite editor everybody
has theirs you can use atom or sublime
or brackets or code pen and some of
these are web-based editors or some of
these are desktop editors you could just
have a you can just use any text editor
you can run a server so there's all so
this is less a little bit less of a
fundamental piece of the project now
there was and I'm gonna make a separate
video about this I think there was a
p5.js desktop editor that was modeled
after the processing one many
similarities many differences as well
but this idea of the simple thing you
download you type your code you press a
play button you see the result this has
now been deprecated hopefully a desktop
editor will come back at some point
in lieu of developing an entire
web-based editor so the web-based editor
is currently in development there's no
public release of it yet but certainly
when it's released I hope to have people
who are working on it come and presented
on this YouTube channel
Kassie target tark tear occasion is that
is the lead developer of the p5.js web
editor and the work that she is doing is
just phenomenal so I'm very excited at
some point that we'll be able to have
that have a public release it's there's
no this is not a new idea there are many
web-based editors simple code pen
jsfiddle these are places where you just
go to your web browser you see a place
where you can type in code and then you
can see the result of the code you could
save it you could share it this is very
powerful so while there are a lot of
options for web editors that you can use
we've decided to try to make one that's
kind of geared towards PJs specifically
and highly tailored to a beginner so if
you are a teacher and you've got a group
of you know ninth graders on a Saturday
afternoon for a couple hours you want to
teach them the beginning of learning to
code what would be the easiest way to do
it open up the browser everybody sign up
for an account type in your code hit
play save share that's kind of in p5 GS
or all the libraries are configured and
set up for you that's kind of the goal
of this this particular web editor
project so this is the landscape between
these two things so now here's I think
this is worth exploring for a second and
then I'm gonna then I don't kind of want
to two things I wanna do is just show
you these two environments and like make
the same program in both of them to see
highlight the differences and then I
also want to make a list of pros and
cons of why you might want to use one
versus the other but let's let's spend a
minute here on Java and JavaScript and I
don't like to say vs. so I'll just put a
little heart because I love these
environment
is like not a thing anymore but it's
used so widely and people don't like
Java but you I like
all programming languages it's a place
that you can write some code and express
yourself and make something interesting
it's a good place to be it might not be
your favorite but let's not be so mean
about Java so Java is a programming
language I think it was started in 1991
but really more formally launched
probably in 1995 everyone in the
comments can correct me and the idea of
Java the big exciting thing about Java
was right once run anywhere I think was
the acronym right
once run anywhere anywhere whoa-oh-aah
wara and that doesn't really doesn't
have like a good ring to it but the idea
is if you were writing your code and C
or C++ you would have to rewrite your
code entirely if you move from a Apple
computer to a Windows computer to a
Linux machine to a mobile phone to a
toaster and the idea of Java the magic
was you didn't actually write code
that's native to that computer you wrote
code in this very generic way and then
you would have something on that
computer called a java virtual machine
so as long as the java virtual machine
was part of this device then your java
code could run on it the java virtual
machines essentially job is to translate
your java code which turns into java
bytecode to that machine's specific
machine
so this is what this was the exciting
and powerful innovation and Java really
adopts most of the same syntax as C++
and it is also a highly object-oriented
language for better or worse it can be
very very wordy and tedious and kind of
ugly in many ways are beautiful and
elegant depending on how you look at it
but what processing a lot of what
processing did with Java is when you're
working in its desktop environment a lot
of the wrapper code does sort of extra
code that you need to put at the
beginning and end of every program in
Java processing kind of for you behind
the scenes so that makes it a little bit
simpler and some people think of it
isn't really Java it's it's it's is it
or is it but it really is Java however
you are allowed to a not have to live by
this like very formal object-oriented
way of thinking although you can of
course do objects and you don't need all
of this extra Java stuff that looks very
intimidating and upsetting in a way on
your like first day of learning to
program to have to have all this
confusing stuff that you don't know what
it means so that's really what's going
on what happened with processing now
processing was also and this is what I
spend a lot of time in my previous video
which I guess I'll try not to harp on
too much here Java made sense because it
could connect to a lot of hardware and
libraries for data and networking but it
also at the time there was something
called applets which were part of early
browsers javascript in many ways was
named to to complement the fact that
javascript might be a programming
language of the browser that would
complement applets but a way of running
your processing sketches in 2001 when
Preston was creating you could export to
an applet and share it on the web can't
do that so much anymore
so JavaScript actually what start
started being developed around the same
time a little bit after it had other
names like mocha and maybe like live
script because Netscape and various
companies that were developer
organizations that were developing early
browsers realized you needed something
to that you could write code right in
the browser in your HTML and your files
to like control the behavior and
chicken things that are happening on a
web page and that's where JavaScript
came from now JavaScript obviously is
very different now in what year is it
2017 than it was back then it's there's
been many different specifications for
the language there's there's an
organization called ICI ma is that what
it is anyway we're on version like
there's like es6 now you hear all these
terms
I haven't adopted some of the new syntax
in my video tutorials of JavaScript just
yet you're very long time to get to
showing you these environments
but-but-but-but so it's quite different
than it was back then but it is it still
is fundamentally the language of the
browser a key difference however is that
while this is compiled code you have to
write your code and then run it through
a process that converts it into you know
zeros and ones so that it can be
executed as an application javascript
doesn't work that way javascript is
what's known as an interpreted language
meaning the browser just reads your code
and execute it at the same time which
allows for a lot of flexibility and
exciting things like live coding or
changing code the fly or running it
typing your code in the browser and
hitting grunt there's all sorts of
possibilities that you can explore
because it's interpreted or on the fly
and can change as it's running over time
as opposed to sign has to be compiled
and finished but and so in that sense
these are very different programming
languages the name is just there because
of this thing that applets were there
and JavaScript was supposed to
complement that and so but and there's
some of the syntax for while is the same
but the actual quality of the language
javascript has a more functions are Java
everything's about objects javascript is
that can be object is object oriented
but functions are sort of this primary
thing and there's lots of kind of nuance
to that of course but that's sort of the
primary thing so p5.js is just a library
for JavaScript so if you are
quote-unquote learning p5.js what you're
learning to program is JavaScript and
the libraries the functions that you're
calling to maybe draw or do things come
from p5.js
if you are learning process
you're learning the syntax of the java
programming language and how it works
and getting access to all these
libraries from processing to draw and do
that type of thing so and in truth at
least in my experience these people say
well I don't want to use a framework
because I really want to learn the real
thing well guess what the real thing is
learning how to use different frameworks
so if you learn how to use p5 GS maybe
you'll learn how to use three Jas or
paper KS or you know matter Jas or
fill-in-the-blank Jas different
libraries and different frameworks for
these languages okay so that's kind of a
rather long-winded summary of all of
this and what I want to do now is just
show you the two different environments
and how the syntax looks between them
and then make a list of pros and cons
between the two</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
