really made it through that entire last
video here we are again and we're going
to take a big leap now we're gonna do
something even more exciting than we
thought was even ever possible in the
previous video okay so yeah Here I am I
got to get myself situated here what do
we got we got a processing sketch with a
variable Clair at the top it's given
initial value 50 and now we're drawing
that circle at 50 at 50 at 50 at 50 at
50 X 50 at 50 right
forever and ever go that's why that
circle is always there we now want to
move that circle we need a new
assignment operation we have an
assignment operation that's in setup
that's giving it its initial value now
we need an assignment operation and draw
move the circle one pixel right if the
circle is at pixel 50 move it to 51 if
it's at 51 move it to 52 right increment
the circles X location by one how we
going to write that code how are we
going to write that code okay we're
thinking we're thinking by the way one
of the most relaxing activities you can
do in your life is it's a little better
when you're by yourself not recording in
videos just quietly and like thoroughly
clean the whiteboard anyway okay so we
have draw it's looping over and over
again run this code go back to the
beginning run this code and we have this
circle that is right now being drawn at
pixel location 50 which is the value of
circlex what we want to do is want to
say hey every time through draw
let's give circle X a new value what
should its new value be it should be its
current value plus 1 now this assignment
operation this expression might look a
little strange to you almost as if it's
some sort of weird paradox like no
nothing can equal itself plus 1 that
doesn't make any sense but we have to
remember what an assignment operation
does is evaluate the right
side of an equation this pen is
squeaking like crazy I have another one
I had another one out here we go it's
evaluate the right-hand side of the
equation and take the result of that
value how much better and store it in
the left-hand side so if circle X
currently has the value of 50 we
evaluate 50 plus 1 which becomes 51 and
then that gets stored and circle X is
now 51 and if what's happening in that
beginning of draw we are drawing circle
at we're drawing an ellipse at circle X
then we come back here and draw it at 51
then 51 plus 1 is 52 then we come back
here and draw it at 52 then increment
that by 1 this is the process this is
the type of thing this is like such a
simple little like basic scenario all
it's doing is moving a circle left or
right but this is the foundation of
everything you might ever possibly want
to do it's coming up with an algorithm
what is the logic behind what I'm doing
and implementing that through code so so
let's take a look at put adding this
into our program so where are we going
to do that so we could all we could say
like Oh should I put it up here uh maybe
I should put it at the bottom it
actually in many ways doesn't really
matter one thing that I often like to do
is separate out we can say like this is
my drawing stuff and this is my like
logical manipulation I don't know what
like moving variables I don't know what
I'm saying
I really had an idea but drawing stuff
plus I'll just kind of like logic over
here we'll just call it logic for a
second you don't have to separate this
but I'm gonna do that just for kind of
keeping our code nice and clean so I'm
going to say circle x equals circle X
plus 1 semicolon we're going to run it
and look is the circle spoofing of so
nice and lovely good good it's gonna
leave it's gonna be sad cuz you know
it's plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 and plus 1
it's still actually incrementing over
and over again going further and further
so processing by the way it doesn't
matter you can tell it to draw something
at a pixel value that is not within the
window it's won't see it up here it's
not like suddenly appearing on
here on the in our computer screen but
but it is sort of being done in the sort
of mind of processing so we can see look
at this circle x equals circle X plus
one we did it now we have animation okay
so there are a few additional items here
that I want to discuss number one is
what if we want it to go twice as fast
that that's pretty easy circle x equals
circle X plus 2 let's move to pixels
every frame what if we want to go ten
times as fast circle x equals circle X
plus 10 now we're going 10 pixels per
frame we can see it's zoomed right off
the screen what if we wanted to go half
as fast okay circle x equals circle X
plus 1 what is half of 10.5 we run this
an ok look at this look at that message
cannot convert from float to int this is
what we mean by using a strictly typed
language all of a sudden we introduced a
floating point value 0.5 a decimal
number but yet we declared our variable
a type integer and an integer cannot be
1.5 to 2.5 however we can make this work
by changing the value of circlex to a
float now you might just suddenly feel
like awesome diver I didn't run it let's
do it but if you really think about this
for a moment you start going to start to
think like something is horribly wrong
here what what what's happening I mean I
have a window in the computer there is a
window in the computer and we said I can
draw something at like pixel 50 comma
180 right and we put our circle there
and there it is
pixel 50 comma 180 what if I said to you
draw this circle at pixel 50 point 5
comma 180 well you would say like no
absolutely not I shall do no such thing
there's no such thing as pixel on 50.5
there's pixel 50 and there's pixel 51
but there
no pixel 50.5 right just I can't
accounted those pixels on the screen
there one two three four five right but
here's the thing even though there is
technically no pixel 50 and a half pixel
50 0.8 processing allows you to use
floating point values when you want to
draw something in the window and what it
does secretly is it just locks off the
decimal point so if you asked to draw
something at fifty point five you will
get it at really at pixel 50 now why is
this so useful let's think about this
idea of a circle moving quickly or
slowly okay these could be its values
every frame pixel 52 51 52 53 445 right
what if we wanted to move faster 50 then
55 to 60 the 65 right move 5 pixels per
frame but what if we do this 50 50 point
five fifty one fifty one point five
fifty two fifty two point five right it
won't actually be drawing the circle at
pixel 50 point five it will just draw it
at the pixel 50 twice but if it's
running 30 frames per second and we draw
it the same location twice it's going to
appear as if it's moving more slowly now
we could implement all sorts of crazy
logic we could try to sort of change
there's a function processing called
frame rate which will actually slow the
frame rate of the entire application
down but this is not what we want what
if we want one thing moving really fast
and one thing moving really slow we need
to manipulate the locations and sizes of
things using floating points allows us
to have more precision over the speed
and kind of a nuance of how things
happen visually in our program so that's
kind of like a long explanation but what
I'm saying with that is that that I
would suggest to you right now that for
the time being just use the float for
everything there are cases where you
absolutely want a whole number but in
the case of drawing a pixel of drawing
shapes at locations drawing sizes of
shapes manipulating those sizes we
really want to use floats and let's take
a look at that now over here so once we
have flow a float and I run it we can
see that's moving
fast and if I say no point one you know
it's really moving really slowly but
it's moving and but you can't tell that
it's really sitting at the same mean if
you kind of like look at it really
really carefully maybe you can but the
frame rate is fast enough that it just
looks like it's inching its way along
and you can even do stuff like a point I
don't know I'm kind of going crazy here
zero point zero one we could say like
okay it's moving but it's moving so
slowly we can barely perceive it so but
you know if we went you know if I went
to like take a walk around outside for a
little bit clear my head come back it'd
probably be quite a bit further along on
the screen okay so floating points allow
you to do a lot okay
this is good place to stop we've done
quite a bit here even though it seems
like we've barely done anything we just
have this little circle moving what I
would say to you right now is go to your
sketch you have variables you declare at
the top make them floats give all those
variables initial values and then try
manipulating those values how can you
make something grow can you make
something shrink and you make something
change color what can you do with
variables at this point and in the next
video we're going to look at how we can
actually give things random values to
create a certain other sort of
additional variation in our programs and
then of course at some point in the next
set of videos we need to figure out how
to get this thing to turn around when it
hits the edge right how do we have a
conditional condition into our code in
our code how do we say if that circle
reaches the edge turn around and move
the other way right instead of saying
circle x plus 1 now say circle X minus 1
how do we make that happen that's where
we're going towards here but at first we
just want to get used to having
variables storing data and that sort of
thing
okay um actually hello but I forgot to
say was a simple exercise you might do
with this is just add the Y component to
it right take this program add Circle Y
add sir give Circle Y an initial value
and give Circle Y and initial speed as
well
increment circle Y by some value and see
if you can get to move in addition to
the x axis along the y axis</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
