and your sound seems to have froze yeah
okay am i back now yes okay and I think
we're broadcasting but how do I get the
link of where we're broadcasting if you
go to your your page and you yeah but no
oh it's muting my mic because I'm typing
so I don't know how to send this to
myself can you see it like if I cut up
what do you want that URL okay yeah the
URL if you're oh you chatted it I just
put it in the chat yeah okay thank you
so now voice it's going well so far
here so I also have okay I'm gonna leave
Oh
soiled by my power I only have one power
cord Oh No
and I have two laptops go I can't lift
to switch back and forth okay cuz the
Hangout like is sucking the battery okay
okay sure I can bring stuff in there
I'll come help you
well there's trust you can't even open
the door because I moved all the
furniture to the corner it's fine this
laptop has 33 percent battery
so we just sort of charged back and
forth all right hello I have a chat room
here Oh
Antonius is in the chat room hi okay
he's also the Google hangout antonius
okay welcome this is a test of the
emergency processing Broadcasting System
and what's happening here right now is
that in the in the fall I'm planning to
do regular live broadcasts from this
office and allow people to call in or
send questions and help people with
processing programming questions and in
this chatroom here oh I'm hearing myself
because shoot all right are you hearing
yourself
yeah where'd that come from I don't know
where that came from
okay and let's see how many viewers do
we have does it say if anyone's actually
watching the problem is this is going to
record it back well I feel like the last
test went better than this one err on
this side I mean it says off-air huh
casting let's see no it's there it's
showing up something is broadcasting
okay so we the I was saying something
really important but just this is just a
test this doesn't count what we really
do it they'll be like music and you know
credits and an opening speech lots of
things like that so the goal is to sort
of attempt to see if how can work to
answer people's processing questions
programming questions either via yeah
prop up Alan Partridge writes in and
says maybe the sound came from someone
else's computer and I think that's quite
likely thanks Alan um I believe you're
watching the broadcast you're actually
watching like a few minutes I feel like
something's gonna light on fire in here
cuz it's much hotter than it normally is
but anyway I'm just gonna keep going
alright so um so where you see what
happens with people asking questions
live we're gonna see what happens if
people ask questions over the chat as
well as perhaps even questions on
Twitter which maybe I'll try to check so
Antoni Ziggy's still there yeah I'm here
Oh awesome okay so can you I you you
wrote in a question with a nice diagram
can you ask it and I'll try drawing
yours diagram well I would like to wrap
a sine wave around a circle but then I'd
like to transform it to a different kind
of wave like maybe sawtooth or triangle
wave smoothly so I'm drawing this poorly
but something like this right yes you
have this wave pattern around a circle
and it maybe can undulate it can do
things that can transform to another
pattern transform back exactly okay
that's very strange I don't know what
I'm doing okay so I have an idea for how
this could work so first I think before
we can even approach this problem so
this is probably by the way a question I
think okay I want to look at I gotta
turn this off
have the instinct to look at the screen
over there which is where I see in
Antonius his face and other people's
face but really they cameras where I
should look so the first thing I think
we need to establish is simply how we
would draw a pattern around the outline
of a circle so for example how do we
even know we know we can draw a circle
by saying ellipse right in processing so
we know we can draw a circle by saying
ellipse but what is a circle other than
a series of points on a radial path that
are connected and depending on the
resolution of those connections the
circle might look more like a polygon
versus a nice smooth circle so one of
the things we can do is we can use polar
to Cartesian coordinates you know in the
context of doing these videos it's an
interesting question of like okay well
what you know people watching might have
just started using processing they might
use it for two years but at this moment
we're gonna have to just assume kind of
basic knowledge of understanding polar
coordinates polar coordinate is a
coordinate that is defined by an angle
known as theta and the radius which is
different than a Cartesian coordinate
which is defined by some amount along
the x axis and some along Y axis
Antoni so you're familiar with polar
cartesian coordinates can I say si we
can move on yes yes okay excellent so
now if I come over here if I can wake up
this computer I think what we'll do is
make a little simple sketch for a second
that implements this so here I've got
processing 2.0 and what I'm going to do
is I'm just gonna write setup' and I'm
gonna make up some size and I'm gonna
have draw and I'm gonna have a black
background and what we need to do is we
need to say okay let's make a loop where
we walk around and look at every single
point where we where we walk around and
look and find every single point along
this path and draw it on the screen and
the way that we do that is we might say
hey we need a loop that goes
for every angle an angle called a all
the way up to 2 pi where we go up by
just like some small amount and we have
some radius and we can now we can use
that polar Cartesian coordinate
transformation let's see what this does
and let's looking at the weight bar down
thank you
we can just draw a little circle there
if we run this let's run this little
piece of code and okay so we can see
we've almost got something right right
we kind of like we have a bunch of
circles that are kind of in the pattern
of a circle but we forgot they're all
around the corner so one thing I'm going
to do just with this sketch is used to
translate method to translate to the
center of the window and we can see now
that we've drawn that circle / hey but
and we could see the resolution is based
on how you know how how how fast we
increment that angle around we can see
here's a bunch of points right angle
zero point five point one point one
point excited problem etc etc etc so
this is where we're starting right we
need to draw a bunch of points to create
this circle we haven't even I think
there's like a big question I'm now
realizing it's gonna take some more
practice figure out how to make this
stuff work okay so one thing that we
need to figure out how to do is to at
least connect those so I can use begin
shape and end shape and say stroke 255
no fill and instead of drawing a circle
there I can then say put a vertex at
each one of those points so now we can
see we have this circle that's connected
we've connected each one of those points
that we've calculate around the path of
a circle we have now connected with the
line okay so we want to say close here
at the end I think I want to say stroke
weight too so you can see it a little
bit better and then we want to make the
resolution a little bit better
we can see what have we finally gotten
we've drawn a circle manually now we now
actually have that circle by connecting
each one of those points I was kind of
gonna like time this and figure out what
I'm doing here
okay so let's think about where we are
now okay so he Antonis you in the way
you asked the question you may have
already been that at that at that point
already I don't know if that's the case
or not but let me ask you a question do
you have did you did you get this far
did you figure out how to turn drawing
this circle path into a sine wave no I
did not
okay good excellent so this is a really
interesting question who list let's ask
ourselves the question now what is the
difference between say like yeah there's
only three sections of hey you know
you're broadcasting this
I Scott here muted hi how are you
alright alright the one issue one I
don't know Shawn what we can do about
this because whenever anyone new joints
they hang out it immediately
resets my machine and like logs me out I
have to log back in Wow so I killed your
broadcast yeah that's okay it's trust me
this thing is like a long-dead okay so
we were discussing and Tony summers
discussing Scott you can pipe it at any
point that you like is Shawn still there
I'm sure hope see how I'm just looking
at the screen they gotta turn that off
okay we were discussing the fact that
one of the things about drawing this
circular path is that every point along
this path the distance from the center
to that point which we think of as the
radius of the circle is the same so the
radius is identical right if we think
about the case of like a sort of
squiggly circle or a sine wave a
circular radial path this radius value
is going to be different might be 10
might be nine might be twelve might be
eight so the Bajor first step in kind of
implementing this kind of circular
radial path that is a sine wave wrapped
around or a square wave or Perlin noise
or whatever randomness is oh hello I'm
over here now is the fact that the
radius can't be constant so if we look
at this code you can see here we have
this radius of 100 for example if I were
to just write in here say radius equals
a random value between 50 and 100 you
can see what we're getting already does
that come through that's really cool
that's really awesome that's exactly the
direction I need to go to great so but
you don't want what you don't want is
random here you want sign so one thing
we could do is we could say hey let's
use the sign function we already have an
angle well it's map side of that angle
which goes between negative 1 1 to a
radius between 50 and 100 and the thing
is that angle is probably not going up
fast enough so it's x 5 good sir see now
we have that pattern kind of doing this
somewhat haphazardly let's multiply just
by 2 let's not make it as extreme I
guess for was good anyway you can see 5
looks good making 12
so you can see do you see how this works
what we're doing is we're having a
variable radius so as you go around as
as you're kind of marching around here
sometimes you're out here sometimes
you're here sometimes you're there did
we get this wave ok so that's kind of
step one to this problem and I think I
don't know how far like Twitter of the
chatroom I don't know maybe we just need
to shut this off but let's go let's go a
little farther so so let's ask the
question I don't know from the audience
I suppose let's all discuss what's the
next step let's say we figured out like
oh we like this pattern and we also like
I'm going to do another one I'm gonna do
Spurling noise so I'm gonna use Perlin
noise of that value perla noise goes
between 0 and 1 I'm going to set that
between 75 oh I need to map the noise
value sorry and we're gonna make this a
much more extreme right so now he is
Perlin noise right so I got this with
perla noise it's kind of random but a
smoother and miss we get this kind of
globbit' igloo pretty cloudy there right
I think it's an island what I think it's
an island it's an island yeah
so with this line of code with this
Perlin noise line of code we get an
island within a slide phone we get a
nice like flower like shape with a sine
wave how do we how would we smoothly
transition from one to the other to the
interesting question
I hope move over here I await your
response
Antonius is showing us his oh I can't
see it okay thanks Dan I got through the
sine wave circle Bart oh then I have to
head out there but I'm gonna keep
working on it and see if I can figure
out how to transform it smoothly
excellent thanks so much thank you for
participating and Tony Stewart very nice
thank you for that sir chef men okay
I'll see you later bye oh wait should I
not logout or is it gonna destroy your
oh you can log out it's we need
to know what go what happens when people
log out anyway so hey Dan can you show
the code again yeah says there's six
viewers six viewers it's massive we've
really hit the big time now there's five
people in the chat and hang out I only
see three people in the chat anyone
there see what's on Twitter here oh so
sure you were able to invite somebody
yeah I invited Scott oh that's
interesting that's really good so there
could be somebody in theory somebody
who's so thanks me hello hello
there could in theory be somebody who's
like job is to like manage the Hangout
invite people right right well you're
gonna need the person's email address to
do that yeah yeah I think the Google+
hey hang out it feels I mean I you know
Google hangout has served me beautifully
on many an occasion but it feels kind of
clunky for this yeah
I can't get the glass to join this
because we don't have this associated
with a real name and Google destroyed
our profile Scott do you have any
questions about processing you're late
uh at the moment no let's see what we
got
you'll excuse me for a moment Oh mutant
you can use it yeah well I don't know if
they made it for you but he made it for
me okay so looking at Twitter and I
don't see I don't see anyone gave anyone
is out there watching wait
Josh lots of people a chat here Oh Josh
what Davis is there ITP burns and
Richard Gill yeah or you write this down
Shep info / channels slash processing
that cut off good you can also tweet at
Schiffman no it's the part of the show
where I juggle like we need a puzzler do
you have any do you have any challenges
for the audience so we I should continue
with this because we didn't finish this
discussion okay so he where we were
before is that with this one line of
code we've got this pattern with this
second line of code we have this pattern
now what we need to do is figure out how
to interpolate between the two now there
are the you know there's probably a very
kind of advanced sophisticated way of
doing this which is we should make these
shapes objects and they keep ArrayList
of vectors which are all the points then
we have one set of points in an
ArrayList and another set of points
between the ArrayList we can interpolate
between those two and this is actually
how I would probably do it but we could
kind of do it in a much simpler way
right here
for example what if I just call this r1
and this r2 and then I said you know
float R equals r1 plus r2 divided by 2
anyway what would this resulted Shaun it
would it would give a little bit of
noise to the sign right so they would
average an average between the two we
get we get halfway between the two but
there's no reason why we couldn't just
say like hey give me 10% of one and 10%
10% of the and 90% of the other one
right right much more of the noise and a
little bit of the sign when you do it
the other way processing has a function
for this called lurk so let me give the
value in between r1 and r2
so with lurk this is really what this is
this is a wonderful thing to talk about
this brings me enormous joy hey I have a
question can you wait with work the way
you did you can wait with lurk okay you
mean wait like w e IG HT right yeah yeah
so that's exactly what we're doing we're
going to with lerp we're gonna have
value r1 we're gonna have value R to it
we could say hey give me sort of the
value in between there give me the value
over here give me the value in the
middle and now if we slide back and
forth we're gonna see us where you see
interpolated we're gonna see this sort
of transformation between those two
shapes so let me let me put a value here
like if I put zero point zero no Swiss
sorry if I put zero point zero and lurk
we have the sine wave oh if I put one
point zero we have 100%
r2 if I put 0.5 we have 50% of each now
watch this
so I'm going to call this
I don't know it's called huh coughs okay
I think of a variable name a percentage
call it percent and at the top of the
code here I'm going to say percent
equals math mouse X which goes between
zero and width between zero and one so
I'm going to use mouse X to set a value
between zero and one and use that value
in lerp but now you can see here let me
move back and forth it's transforming
between those two different waves hey
this is actually the question that
Antonia's fast and we did it we saw that
in this code I gotta save it and put it
somewhere I don't know how to do that
hey 90s let stand for learn linear this
camera shut off back on lerp stands for
linear interpolation so it's a linear
interpolation between two points meaning
if these are the two values we are we
are somewhere in between them in a
linear fashion supposed to like an
exponential interpolation or cosine
interpolation or something well somebody
answered the question there that's nice
on the chat in the chat and ah okay I
got a question over Twitter yes sorry
I'm sure what Davis has a question in
the chat okay I don't see it how come I
don't see it and Richard Gill wants you
to save the files yeah it definitely
will how come the chat is not showing
for me this may be this Joshua just go
ahead and ask the question in in the
chat and I'll relay it to to Dan
like I will do dance moves
Taichi or some sort of like breakdancing
while I'm waiting it's weird how I don't
see any messages in the child hmm maybe
you need to refresh I did refreshing it
cleared everything but there was a
question on Twitter which says how would
I make a discs this is from Knoll Murphy
at VDU hey Dan question for you how
would I make a disc spin like a record
deck using mouse down and drag to spin
the disc reverse okay this is
interesting so if I understand the
question correctly we're asking if we
had some type of thing on the screen
that looked like a record how would you
make it spin and then how could you
control the spin by like moving turning
it like kind of like I guess like
scratching like a DJ with like this like
that right okay so let's think about
this for a moment yeah see it really I
feel like what this show office hours
broadcast needs is people's live voices
right right right people people what we
need to do is have them enter into the
into somewhere we can invite them to the
Hangout right or does not use a hangout
but yeah like you need to enter their
names into a field anyway okay yeah all
right let me I guess I'm going to talk
about this spinning thing so one thing
that you need actually is you need to
know something about there's two things
that you really need to understand to
make this work one is you need to know
something about transformations so the
first thing that you need to do is use
translate because you're going to
translate to a certain X Y which is
where you want the center of this
spinning disk to be so if this is your
processing window and this is the point
101
you could translate to 100 100 and then
draw that disk however you're going to
draw a circle a polygon an image you're
going to draw it at 0-0 with some width
and height right because what translate
does is it moves the origin it
translates the origin which always my
default starts the top left to a certain
location on the screen in this case
we'll have 100 and you can draw that
ellipse the reason why you need to do
that that's because to have this record
of spin you're going to want to use the
rotate method the rotate method will
rotate the trance that the view this
trip transformation space what you're
the draw in context will rotate it
around the point of origin so if you
want the disc to spin around in the
center you move the origin to where you
want to draw the disc rotate by some
amount and draw that disc at 0 0 so this
is really the first piece of information
that you need to implement this the
second piece of information that you
really need to understand is this idea
of angular velocity and also I would say
angular acceleration right because
what's gonna go here you're gonna rotate
by some angle why is that angle bit of
change over time maybe it's spinning at
a constant rate it's spinning at some
speed or velocity
maybe it's speeding up as you flick it
it's accelerating maybe it's slowing
down it's decelerating so you need to
figure out these concepts and actually
its lucky for anybody who might be Oh
techno techno somebody just saw it's
very sad I looked over here it's a 10
viewers and then Emilia's up 9 viewers
very sad if this comes back on oops
Here I am over here if I go to I believe
rather than try to make an example from
scratch right now off the camera showed
off the hijinks by the way there's so
much stuff in this room like I can't
walk anywhere I believe if I go to
in-processing examples under books
nature of code chapter 3
gonna look in here I'm gonna find a
angular motion example and that's gonna
fix a few things up I thought I updated
these I'm gonna fix a few things up
about this example and run it so you can
see that's really what's going on here
we have this line in these two circles
and it's spinning and look how it's
getting you know maybe faster and faster
over time that's because there is an
angle that is being that you're rotating
by some value that angle is being
changed by some angular velocity and so
for example if I take out this idea of
acceleration and I just give it a
constant angular velocity I write you
can see hey it's spitting it but angular
velocity of point two 0.05
it looks like this but this idea of
acceleration is pretty interesting
because one thing I could do is I can
again Matt I can create a dynamic
acceleration where I just map the
mouse's value which goes between zero
and width to something between like 0.1
and 0.1 if we run this math mouse X
what's wrong with this line of code
oh it's angular acceleration if I run
this okay that's way too big values
spinning out of control so you can see
now I can kind of slow it down it's
pretty hard for you to see probably
they're going to make this even smaller
you can see that now depending on where
I move the mouse I can kind of like
decelerate it and have it started
accelerate back in the other direction
slow it back down so I can now sort of
get gain control over how fast is it
spinning it in what direction I have
this angle which is the actual rotation
at that moment of the angular velocity
which is how fast is it spinning at that
moment and acceleration which is what
the change in
velocity is it speeding up is it slowing
down and I'm just controlling that and
your velocity arbitrarily through the
mouse here in this particular example so
that's the spinning disk question hey do
you want me to relay the question from
Joshua Davis yes
he said he's using he's using the Kinect
okay and he's noticed that the left hand
and he's got two transparent PNG I guess
mapped to his hands uh-huh in the left
the left hand the transparent area the
PNG knocks out any info on the
background whereas the right hand the
PNG transparency is fine so one of them
is knocking out part of the background
and the other one is not oh I see so
there's one image and transparency is
working and there's another image and
transparency is not working like that I
my guess is to try adding let me go
this is where we need to call Andres
Calibri I probably am p.3d I would
assume I mean obviously a lot of this
depends on but it tries to do with like
Z depth sorting in terms of the order of
stuff that's being drawn and if I go to
man I think this one yeah
try adding try having this water covered
what this says is if we read the
comments from this processing example as
it says right to the depth but but my
fur that is disable to avoid rendering
artifacts you know the facts that the
particles are semi-transparent but not Z
sorted so I'm pretty sure that this will
help I think that this hint will kind of
like fix the rendering if you're not
drawing the stuff you're driving proper
of Z sorted magic way
so I don't know it if you're probably
watching the stream and this you're
gonna like see this moment after I said
it and then try it I mean you could type
another message in to see if it works
I'm gonna try going into the chat again
just with a new window you have shown
when you look at the chat how many
people do see in the chat 8 and it's
Channel / processing oh you know what
you show shut redirecting me to Channel
/ ITP so but I don't see anybody in
there either oh I see you now in ITP
yeah state stayed there you'll see
Joshua Davis says he posted some images
so you can see oh I see the chat
normally thing
that's his image and he says see how it
ghosts the actual transparent area but I
want z-depth I don't know what that did
for me I can't handle it what is the OSI
depth from connect I guess ok now I see
the chat again this is very confusing to
me how long have we been doing this by
the way oh they're 13 viewers our
viewership just going through the roof
you could do a filibuster this way I
just keep going yeah ok so we have some
nice questions let me check Twitter how
I feel ridiculous whenever I say that
Cheers
oh thanks oh good so hopefully I don't
know if it's Noel or an old but
hopefully I answer that
question in a way that was helpful does
anyone want to join the any wants to
join the hangout you can type you I
guess you could type your Gmail address
into the chat and Sean can invite you
then you can actually talk and speak
otherwise you could go back to some of
my juggling tricks they're not very good
though
it's very hot in here don't have any
water can't get to the dorks I'd bring
you things but I can open the doors and
um all right so wait there were other
questions hold on there were questions
in the there were questions in the gist
too many we kept arms um how do we bed a
sketch on a web page was an interesting
question that came up but I really just
realized like oh my god I can't believe
I'm about to go down this road but hold
on let me find I'm just gonna show you
yes okay perfect so um I want to do uh
since that question was asked you know
the world of processing that is is a
complex and interesting place but I'm
going to show you a URL which I highly
encourage you to take a look at if
you're interested in this topic but I
lost my internet connection no but
muscle power over here so Aaron Sherwood
who is a second-year ITT students worked
last year last year to create a really
nice tutorial that showed you the basics
of okay you have um standing in front of
it I should make it a little bigger
actually yeah we can't read the URL yeah
okay so the URL is there we go there's
URLs Aaron Sherwood Aaron - Aaron comm /
processing.js and I guess um
you know I'm more just pointing out this
tutorial exists to the world hello world
is tutorial exists I think it's great if
you're interested in kind of figuring
out what it means to you've got some
basic processing code you want to embed
it on a web page here's some of the
stuff you need to stick in your HTML
file here's what that all looks like
here's what the sketch looks like
running in the browser but Aaron goes on
to show you quite a bit more which is
actually how you can start to have a
sketch interact with a web page so these
are actual Dom elements I'm clicking on
and that are actually changing what's
happening in the sketch so you can
communicate between the the processing
place you could communicate between the
processing sketch itself and Dom
elements as well as I think even maybe
in the bottom of this tutorial
goes on about how you can use html5
audio in combination with pressing yes
so if you're interested in kind of
advanced level we have processing which
is Java you know it's a desktop
application
writing code it's compiling it's
screaming your desktop crossing MJS for
the core processing API will allow you
to run that core drawing stuff in a
browser canvas anything else you want to
do you know beyond what the core drawing
API does we've got to dig into HTML CSS
etc JavaScript eccentrics are yourself
but um there's lots of things that are
possible and errands tutorial is a nice
helpful place to start I think what
might be useful is if I have an actual
like agenda actually the teleprompter
the script so does that does that
processing j/s tutorial that's only for
JavaScript
what about embedding of a Java skit
applet well that you know I you can do
that it's I don't know that I would
recommend doing that any more it sort of
Java applets are not well supported
across operating systems and browsers
but you can there's a tool that you can
get um there's a little known fact about
processing is that this
Goodin yard for you see but up here in
the same way that a lot of you might be
familiar with the fact that you can add
libraries so there's Coraline they've
built in libraries there's libraries you
can in with the contribution manager you
can go to add library and see this
really nice list of all these libraries
that are out available that you can just
install right through the IDE itself the
same is true of tools
I could go to add tool and I don't think
maybe you can't see what I'm doing
because I don't know what I'm doing and
there is a tool right here called a
flick maker so if you're interested in
like nostalgia ancient technologies you
can still export applets for processing
that get bedded into a web browser okay
I think you know we this is almost an
hour I feel that this was on a scale and
uh I would rate this show from one to
ten we'd give it a two point three no I
think it was actually pretty good yeah
maybe it gives a like a four or five but
so any case if you're still listening or
if you're interested in this kind of
experiment this was kind of the last
test for the summer once we get back to
September an ITP is in full swing we're
gonna try doing this every week
hopefully we could polish it up a little
better we can figure out better ways to
let people call in or that's using still
using the Hangout or custom develop our
own fave more text chat or using Twitter
I'm not so sure but I'm going to try to
do this once a week probably on
Thursdays for one hour every week and
you'll be able to submit questions in
advance or ask them live and I would
guess that with the school semester
starting that maybe there will be more
people out there with kind of beginner
level questions which I think this
format this may be more well suited
towards it's not so well suited towards
I got this big complicated processing
sketch and I went out like it has a
problem that I need to debunk that
really needs you know kind of quiet
sitting down and walking through things
like little simple questions are little
drawing ideas or how do I do you know
especially those things
like motion animation physics that tends
to be what I know a little bit better as
well okay so before I sign off before I
do the ending song or every week I'm
going to just check and see if there's
any other messages in your chat um I see
Josh like Davis is probably maybe trying
to install hangout okay that's sad that
thing that didn't work twelve years I
were just eleven viewers people are
signing off now I'm just gonna wait
until it goes to zero just stand here
and wait until it goes to zero
well okay back to twelve again I almost
don't want to leave but it is okay I'll
still be here but anyway okay so thank
you you're very kind and you're a lovely
person I like you very much and I
appreciate the time that you spent here
in this mediated space and thank you
Sean for helping figure out how to make
all this work and for asking all the
questions and participating Thank You
antonius for calling in live for scott
scott fitzgerald everybody everybody my
mother and father thank you don't forget
a leaky and okay I'm gonna I'm gonna
just I guess what I have to do now to
sign off is hit and broadcast everybody
