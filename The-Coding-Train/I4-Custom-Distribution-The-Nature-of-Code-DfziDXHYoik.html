probability and random numbers we are
moving along we've got a bunch of videos
to get through but we're well I have a
list over here and a couple more and
then it says vectors intro once we get
to vectors we're really going to be
dealing with some of the exciting stuff
really looking at motion behaviors which
is going to carry us for a long way
through this journey but okay so what
have we done so far
we looked at we know we have this random
function okay random awesome it gives us
an even distribution of random numbers
every random number has the same chance
as being picked as any other random
number we looked at Gaussian we use the
random class the next Gaussian function
and and we saw that this would give us a
Gaussian or normal distribution of
random numbers where we have most of the
results that are picked cluster around
the mean and then there are some
outliers depending on what that standard
deviation is but what if we want
something totally custom totally custom
like this is our distribution of random
numbers you know this this random number
should be picked a lot it's not so often
this really not too often this a lot as
well this a medium amount what if we
want something custom like this so you
know this may seem like well just this
kind of abstract discussion of
probabilities and random numbers but
this is really going to be relevant to a
lot of the simulations that we're going
to do for example way down the road at
the you know the really at the end of
this video series there will be a video
about genetic algorithms how do we
simulate that process of evolution in
code one of the things we'll need to do
in an evolutionary system is pick
parents pick parents based on their
quote/unquote fitness we want to map
that Fitness to a probability of being
picked to pass genetic material down to
the next generation that's going to
involve a highly custom set of random
numbers if you imagine this is all sort
of all these parents all these members
of populations some will be more likely
some will be less likely to be picked
now there are a bunch of different
strategies for doing that one strategy
that's actually employed in the genetic
algorithm examples which if you sure
the video doesn't exist yet if I had
looks I have made them all you can just
skip ahead and go look at it
is this what I'll call the bucket
approach imagine we have a bucket and
what I really mean by a bucket is an
array or an ArrayList we're going to get
into these data structures in more
detail when we start to look at particle
systems but for now we can think of a
bucket of stuff what if I just put some
numbers in it what if I put 0 a bunch of
zeros a bunch of ones a couple twos and
if a few a few ones a couple twos a
couple threes and one for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
8 9
whoa 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 that's
way too many things let's put a few
let's let's take out a few items okay so
home 3 6 8 9 10 right great so what is
the chance that we will pick a 1 from
this collection of numbers well I tried
to make it a 10 total so you can see
there's three ones there's a 30% chance
we'll pick out a one so this is one way
if we sort of know what our options are
we can create a list of those options
and add certain elements multiple times
to make them more likely to be picked we
could easily also do this within a
regular array if we look at our array
with five elements in it you know we
pick a random number from this where 40%
is 40% chance of picking a zero and I'm
sorry an 80% chance of picking a zero
and a 20% chance of picking a one right
four out of five chance of picking a
zero one out of five chance of picking a
one so this might be something that you
know just try building this in code is a
little quick exercise make an array pick
a random element from the array see how
that maps to probability um this would
be a quick exercise you could do for
yourself but the technique that I want
to look at now rather than the bucket
approach is the picking two random
numbers approach so let's look at this
picking two random numbers what do I
mean by that so let's say we're back to
our meerkats I must draw this strange
meerkat them I know this is pretty
unnecessary taking of time okay that's
hardly your cat right sorry
um we want to pick heights for that
meerkat what if this is the probability
not a bell-curve anymore the probability
distribution for our meerkats is this
we're much more likely to have tall
meerkats than short meerkats
we still might have short meerkats but
we're more likely to have tall ones so
let's say we're doing the following we
are picking two random numbers float r1
is a random number and I'm going to say
between 0 and 100 just for sort of ease
of thinking right now in the example
you'll see I always pick a random number
between 0 &amp;amp; 1 because that just sort of
normalizes everything to a range between
0 &amp;amp; 1 but right now let's let's let's
pick two random numbers between 0 and
100 now I'm going to write something
that looks a little odd to you if r1 is
less than or actually I don't know I
like to think of it in Reverse if r2 is
less than R 1 you know happiness and joy
and we have got a vine random number
otherwise sadness go back and pick a
random number again what we're doing
here is we're trying to find a
methodology for which we accept the
random number we pick we pick a random
number that's the random number we hope
to assign I lost my meerkat to the
meerkats height but we have to find out
does this random number qualify and the
way we do that is by picking a second
random number how often will our to be
less than r1 well let's say r1 just for
the sake of argument is 50 we pick 50
now we're picking another random number
between zero and hundred how likely is
r2 to be less than r1 50 percent of the
time we'll get a number less than 50 if
we pick 90 90% of the time we'll pick a
random number less than 90 if we pick 10
only 10 percent of the time when we pick
a random number less than 10 this second
random number allows us to check if it's
less than the first one then it's okay
we've got a random number otherwise we
don't want to use it we need to pick
another random number this makes it
really easy for high numbers to qualify
because the quality ram number will
often be good low numbers will be very
hard to qualify because ii Lando number
will often be higher than it so this
methodology can be quite good if and the
thing is this formula here is y equals x
we know the formula for this line
we're just determining is the value we
pick below that line but we could have
we could do something exponential if you
have some crazy binomial paranal
polynomial grafting math function you
can use that to figure back the
probabilities so you could also have
this be line segments and you could use
some simple math to determine if of
values below the set of line segments so
there's lots of ways you could go
farther with this but in very simple
level this is this and so we kind of
went on for a long time here but let's
walk over press this button to this
example where you can see this in action
so this is actually a graph of the
random numbers we picked and we're
seeing this look at this curve what if
you could guess right now actually look
at the code before I ran this so I'm
going to guess I think that's y equals x
squared not y equals x right we're
exponentially even more likely to pick
higher numbers so let's take a look at
the code what are where are we doing
this we're picking a random number I
don't feel the need to put this here
we're picking a random number here float
n equals Monte Carlo called it Monte
Carlo it's like a Monte Carlo simulation
where you're gambling kind of picking
lots of numbers over and over again if
only we were gambling would feel a lot
more fun and you're just talking about
picking two random numbers but anyway um
so if we look at this function now we
can see aha we pick two random numbers
here's our math function y equals x
squared if the second random number is
less than Y the first round of numbers
squared then we found one and we can
return that random number otherwise
we've got a loop back we're looping back
at picking red numbers over and over
again until we find one that's okay
there's a little extra coded here which
just counts you know if we did this ten
thousand times oh we didn't find a
random number that was qualified like
maybe there's a problem we don't want to
be stuck in an infinite loop by accident
but truly you know a
probability-wise we should be okay you
know this is it this isn't perfect
science here but this this will do in
this case and then of course you know
we'll just return the value zero if
we're having a problem so this is a
technique you might sort of try to what
I would say is an exercises you might
even try to come up with your own custom
distribution whether use the bucket
method or this method and see if you can
assign those random numbers to some
system you're just helping some design
well there's just you know heights of
objects shaped colors of objects how can
you see the system with some custom
distribution of random numbers and that
is the end of this video next video
which I'm going to do right now to press
a button stop press the button again
start recording we're going to talk
about Perlin noise and actually after
perla noise we are done with the
introduction to the nature of code we
will be moving on to the material for
chapter 1 which is all about vectors ok
I have to hit a button that stops this
