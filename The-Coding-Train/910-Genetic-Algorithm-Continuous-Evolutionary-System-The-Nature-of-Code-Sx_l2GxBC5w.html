about genetic algorithms this probably
won't be my last video ever about
genetic algorithms because I do have
some more in my head that I'm planning
to do at some point but this does kind
of wrap up a bunch of the range of ideas
that I've been talking about in this
series of videos that you may or may not
have been watching so far but I want to
talk about sort of a fundamental flaw in
the examples that I've been showing to
you so this is a the smart Rockets
example that I built as a coding
challenge kind of playing out and what
these Rockets are doing is they're
evolving a kind of path from the bottom
of the screen to this target and they
have this DNA built into them which is a
lot of vectors forces to can push them
around the screen and over time they're
trying to get around this obstacle and
make their way and hold and if you run
this for a while eventually you'll get
there but let's think about how this
system works as compared to the real
world that you and I live in so let's
say these aren't smart Rockets but they
are monkeys and these monkeys are
evolving it's the scenario that we have
here is kind of like okay let's have 100
monkeys all born at once then let those
100 monkeys live for exactly 200 frames
of animation then all 100 those monkeys
immediately have 100 children and die
and then the next 100 monkeys live for
200 frames that name all if exactly the
same time all die but have 100 children
first so this idea of this sort of cycle
of generations of a generation all
growing up exactly together then the
next generation growing up exactly
together doesn't really mirror the way
that a fluid system a continuous system
like our actual natural biological world
works so something that you might think
about for a creative project if you're
doing a fish tank simulation or some
type of other type of simulation of kind
of creative imaginary creatures living
in an ecosystem is how might you create
an evolutionary system that is
continuous and I have an example of that
for you I'm not going to build it from
scratch here and and this is a system of
bloops and this has actually been
running for a while and each loop I'm
calling the bloops being this circle I'm
saying bloop is if you know what a bloop
is I don't even know what a bloop is but
let's talk about this so here's how this
system works there's this idea of a
bloop
and it is represented on the screen as a
circle and each bloop has DNA and the
DNA is an array but it's actually I'm
making you a very very simplistic
version of something that you could
adapt and expand on and that DNA has a
single number between 0 and 1 in it so a
single floating-point number
so here might be a bloop that has a
number point 1 there might be a bloop
that has a number 0.5 there might be a
bloop that has a number zero point 9
this one might look like this this one
might look like this and this one might
look like this so the DNA it's a single
property is mapped to its size smaller
medium big from 0 to 1 but it's not just
back to its size it's also mapped to its
speed so the smaller it is the faster it
can move the larger it is the slower it
moves and I'm going to come back over to
the program and you can see this has
been evolving for a time and you can see
the kind of like magic here's that wart
the system evolved to is like medium
sized objects but I'm going to refresh
this you can see at the beginning
there's a lot of little things squirting
or moving all around the screen really
fast and there's big ones kind of moving
around the screen rather slowly you can
see they're fading out so the difference
here is that these bloops just live out
a life they have a timer built into them
if I look at the bloop object right
there's a bloop object and it has as
part of its as part of its a variable a
health parameter that health parameter
just counts down there happens to be
food there happens to be food around the
screen so here's the thing something
that small is able to move around the
screen very very quickly but because
it's small it's less likely to bump into
the food something that's big moves
around kind of slowly so it's less
likely to find the food but if the food
is anywhere near it's going to likely
bump into it medium it kind of moves
medium speed with a medium size and so
this system tends to optimize towards
medium objects objects that can move
with some speed and are big
- by accident find the objects and the
motion here is not that interesting it's
just kind of random wandering purling
noisy type motion but what you'll see
the sort of key factor here is that when
an object dies it fades away and it's
gone how does the genetic information
get passed from one generation to
another
I don't just put in 100 have them all
live have a score at the end and they
just each one as its living out its life
we can see there is a function in the
bloop object called this dot reproduce
and what I'm going to just delete some
of the comments here so we can look at
this more easily what this reproduce
does is it just every single frame of
animation it picks a random number and
if that random number happens to be less
than zero point zero zero zero zero
point zero zero zero five then a child
is born so this mirrors more closely of
course it's not exactly like our
biological world but something that
lives a longer period of time has more
chances to perhaps find a partner to
mate with to pass genetic information
down to the next generation now in this
case these bloop objects are just
cloning a version of themselves there's
no there's no two coming together to
crossover genetic information it just
makes a copy with mutation but so the
longer it lives the the more likely it
is to make a copy of itself so we can
see here as if I run it again you can
see these little tiny ones speeding
around the screen they're just going to
fade out without having a lot of chances
to reproduce the big ones are going to
kind of fade out without having a lot of
chances to reproduce but the
medium-sized ones are going to last for
quite a while some other strange
artifacts happen actually when one of
these objects dies it leaves a piece of
food right there so sometimes you can
have a cluster of the big objects all
sort of dying leaving food and then like
kind of eating the leftovers so that
some sort of interesting things can kind
of happen even in this like really
really basic simulation but I think the
things for you to think about are what
might be a system like this where the
rules that govern the motion of these
objects are more interesting you could
go back and look at some of my video
tutorials about steering behaviors how
what might be other rules that govern
the way things find food or
around or escaped predators in an
ecosystem simulation what might be a
system where instead of just every frame
of animation there's a small chance an
object might make a copy of itself what
about every time two objects come within
a certain distance there's a chance that
they might perform crossover mutation to
make a new sort of child object so
there's a lot of possible ways you know
what can you have can you make an object
with more than just a single property
what about its design could you see
different colors being passed down from
generation to generation certain color
ticking over so there's all sorts of I
think possibilities in working out a
system like this so this system it has
crossover a mutation it has genotype and
phenotype the thing that it doesn't
really have is a fitness function there
is no fitness assigned to any of these
objects Fitness just just something it's
not survival of the fittest here it's
survival of the survivors the things
that survive longer have a more likely
chance of passing their genetic
information around to the next down to
the next generation okay so I'm sure you
have questions about this ideas about
this please write them in the comments
and you know I'd love to see if you make
something from this or create an
interesting idea out of this and I will
perhaps do a follow-up video if there
are some new ideas that come out of this
particular one of some new techniques
and things that I can demonstrate for
you okay thanks for watching oh and the
code the code is you'll find it in the
description of this video too okay good
