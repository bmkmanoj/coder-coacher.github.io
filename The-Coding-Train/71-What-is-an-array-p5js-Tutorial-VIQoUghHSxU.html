another little little series of videos
inside a larger series of videos and the
topic here is a raise an array in
JavaScript what is an array why do you
want to use one what's the syntax for an
array what kind of things can you do
with an array and ultimately I have a
goal with this so if you remember
recently in a previous video it's
actually a couple weeks ago when I
recorded it but who knows how you're
watching these I recorded a video where
we looked at making an object an object
as this collection of properties this
thing that maybe has an X a Y and a
color and a size and then this idea that
you could put a function inside the
object so that thing that has a bunch of
properties could also you could issue
commands to it like move or draw your
self or change color and so if you can
get one object like this object which
I'm now telling it to move and bounce
and display itself as a circle if I
could take that single object how can I
easily duplicate that object every time
I say click the mouse click click click
click click the idea here and I have
this list of videos that I'd like to
make all the way up to number 4 which
will really go through all the pieces of
this so how does an array even work to
have a list of these objects how do you
how do you then have the object in the
array how do you deal with making
multiple copies of that object in the
array how do you deal with adding the
objects of the array one at a time these
are all the pieces that I would like to
get to and then I have a few other
topics like clicking how to like how to
interact with an object by clicking or
moving the mouse or how to have two
objects interact with each other so this
is a full scope of videos I'd like to
make there are six of them I'm hoping
they'll each be about 10 minutes and I'm
going to get right started right now the
first one what is an array so let's move
this out of here
and I'm going to come over here to my
trusty whiteboard very friendly to me it
talks to me basically I'm talking but I
talk to a whiteboard now that's what I
do camera I used to talk to a camera now
I talk to the whiteboard okay so what is
it a right why do you want to use one
well let's let's style ourselves back to
a happy warm and comfortable place I
could say something like var num equals
five it's very hot at all high on this
wipe over I think you can read it this
is comfortable I have a variable the
name I made up for it is num and it's
value is five so if I wanted to have a
second one I could add a second variable
but here's another way I could have a
second number that I'm storing var numbs
equals square bracket 5 comma 3 and
square bracket semicolon so an array is
a list of values in separated by commas
embedded inside of open and close square
brackets this is not that dissimilar
strangely enough to this idea we have an
object which is a collection of name
value pairs right inside curly brackets
so both of these are collections lists
in a way lists of name value pairs lists
of just values and that distinction I
think will become more and more clear
you know it seems like a little
confusing right now why to use one or
the other as I as I start to show you
more and more uses of them in different
examples let's see what that distinction
is but the key distinction right now
that's super important is that the order
of this list the order of the array is
what matters
elements in a rate have an index they're
the first element they're the third
element or the last element or the
element in the middle that ability to
have the elements in an order is the
sort of crucial key aspect of an array
so for example this is element well it
looks like it's the first element right
because it's the first thing in the
array and that's the second thing
but in programming often it's the you
have to start counting I'm like it's
stuttering here because I'm afraid to
tell you this news but you have to start
counting from zero actually it's a
wonderful thing to count from zero
everyone in lots of sodium we should all
just count from zero it brings joy to
the world but it also brings a little
bit of confusion so this is index zero
and this is index number one it's kind
of not that great of an example let's
make a bigger array 50 70 112 yeah I can
put a negative number in there negative
22 right this element now has how many
this array sorry has how many elements
four elements what are its index values
0 1 2
three so this is important an array
might have four elements in it but the
index values go from zero to three so
the total number of elements might be 4
10 20 100 if there's a hundred elements
the index values go from 0 to 99 let's
practice that so right I have an array
with ten things in it zero one two three
four five six seven eight nine if you
count from zero you end with nine you've
got ten things total seems silly to keep
saying that but it's something that you
some mantra you repeat to yourself to
get used to this idea of counting from
zero with an array so this is this index
now let's go and put this syntax into an
actual p5 example and see what we might
do with that okay I'm back over here now
and I've am at like five minutes so it's
good I see let's see how far I can get
so ignore this example I'm making a new
project I'm going to move it over here
and I'm going to save it as a raised one
okay so at the top I'm going to save our
nums equals 125 12 72 so there are four
values in my array up there and I'm
going to make a canvas that's 400 400
and just for comparison's sake I'm going
to add a regular variable now that has
the number 23 in it and something that I
might do the regular variable is just
say ellipse at 100 200 and I might use
that variable for its size so you can
see here I have now have this variable
with the value 23 that variable is being
used for the width and height of the
ellipse and that ellipse is drawn there
with a width and height of 23 pixels so
the next job that I would like to do
here is how do I get one of the numbers
from the array and use one of the
numbers from the array in something like
the size of an ellipse the location of
ellipse the color of the lips how do I
pull values out of an array so that
comes back over here to the indices
indices the index values so if for
example this is the array var nones
equals this
in my code I ever say nuns and then I'm
referring to the entire array but it's
not that often that you refer to the
array as a whole more likely you refer
to the individual elements of the array
one at a time so the way to do that is
again with square brackets so if I say
num is index two that means I'm
referring to this value 12 and this
evaluates to the number 12
just like num evaluates to the number
five so again this is a list of
variables each one of these you refer to
the array name and it's index okay now
back over here we can now do that so I
can say let's draw a second ellipse a
little bit over and let's draw it at
nums index two nums index two now which
one is indexed to not the second one in
the list it's zero one two it's 12 let's
make it a little bigger let's make that
one 46 that's a nice number it's an age
I will be someday some kind of suit not
that soon but to edit whatever it
doesn't matter okay so you can see this
now I have a second circle with a width
on height of 46 pixels as opposed to the
first circle with a width and height of
23 wonderful wonderful wonderful
wonderful okay uh I forgot a whole video
which is uh I've got to look at how to
do this with a for loop but that'll be
the next video so this is one example
and I think I'm going to make another
example right now well then we'll come
back to this one in the next video so
one of the things to realize here that I
think is exciting and interesting about
arrays is that this number does not have
to be the index value that I'm using
into the array it doesn't have to be a
hard-coded value it could be a dynamic
value something that's picked randomly
or through some algorithm so let's take
a look at that and I'm going to say I'm
going to save this as arrays to and I'm
going to change this to words and I'm
going to make some words like rainbow
and heart and
what are some other nice worse purple I
like and friendship and this is this is
all I can think of so I have an array so
it first of all the the thing that I'm
emphasizing here is you can put anything
into an array you can put strings text
into an array numbers into array objects
into a gray that's what I'm getting at
soon enough so what what might I do with
this array well I might say all right
fill 255 use the P 5 text function I
want to draw some text onto the screen
and I'm gonna say draw like for example
if I just say draw rainbow onto the
screen at you know 212 and maybe I make
it a little bit bigger so we see it 32
pixels the font size you can see UPS I
don't know where I put that 200 pixels
over I meant to put it like 12 pixels
over and 200 pixels down you can see
there's the word rainbow appearing in
the sketch wonderful so oh look at this
I made a blue mass there whoa magic
so the III just hard-coded rainbow here
now I want to pull something from the
array so what I want to say is AHA what
I want is words index 0
I want that first index into the array
there we go I have rainbow now if I
change this to 2 I see the word purple
so the point that I'm making is this
number could be a variable what if I say
VAR index equals 0 and put index here
and now what if I say function
mousepressed index equals index plus 1
so camera just went off so hopefully
this one's not going to go off in a
second but so right so what happening
now the value of index is 0 so I'm
seeing words index 0 I'm seeing rainbow
but as soon as I click the mouse index
will become 1 and I should see part and
then I should see purple and then I
should see friendship and then I should
see up an error message right so this is
a key thing no one's going to save you
if you try
to access an element into an array that
doesn't exist if I say words index 27 it
doesn't exist it's no or undefined or
some for JavaScript thing that doesn't
exist yet and you won't be able to draw
that on to the screen and you'll get an
error so it's up to you to build logic
into your code to protect yourself for
example I could say hey you know what if
index equals 4
maybe I should reset index back to 0 so
as I'm and it's not for right oh yes it
is for right because zero exists one
exists to exists zero exists one exist
to exist three exists but not four so
now if I run that you'll see it cycles
back to zero every time I get to four
but what if I go up here and add a you
know love into this array so I don't
ever see love because I stopped myself
at four and now there are actually five
elements in the array so how do I deal
with that problem well one way to deal
with that problem would be to just
change this number four to the number
five but an interesting thing that will
come up again and again is that arrays
also store properties about themselves
so in addition to be able to access
individual elements of the array we can
access other information about the array
itself such as the current length of the
array so that the length actually can
change as the programs running for
example what if we got user input
started filling that array with words
from the user so one thing I can do here
is actually dynamically check if the
index equals the length of the array
right remember we're going up by one so
if there's for the valid indices are
zero one two and three but the in zero
one two and three but the invalid index
is four there are four elements but zero
two three or the right index knowledge I
have to repeat this to myself because
you know it hurts it hurts a little bit
to have this little minor point of
confusion okay so let's chest this and
see if this works
one two so what I might suggest to you
is do this same thing make a list of
words what if you have them picked
randomly each time you run the sketch
each time you click the mouse try to use
an array of colors could you pick a
random color for a bunch of different
shapes you're drawing on the screen so
what's a kind of list of information
that you might use for an element that
you're drawing and what's a way that you
might pick from that list either one at
a time or randomly or two at a time come
up with a little exercise for yourself
and in the next video what I will show
you is how to march through every
element in the list
how would you display all of the words
how would you use all of the values for
the size of the ellipse okay so this
marks the end of this first video about
arrays and there will be more like the
next one I'll record in just a minute
okay stop</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
