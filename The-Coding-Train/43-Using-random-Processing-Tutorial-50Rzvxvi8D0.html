just kind of got this idea we did
something so small but so meaningful
which was introduced this idea of a
variable now you might feel a little bit
sad with just this gray circle moving on
the screen and there's not really a lot
happening and you want to have more
splash pizzazz to your program let's
look at something that will get us
practicing with variables a bit more and
allow us to convince a much more variety
into our code and that is the use of the
random function I think this is really
important for several reasons number one
is that we we learned about that we now
know that we have two kinds of lines of
code that we can write we have a
function call like line from a bunch of
values to two other values and we also
know we can have assignment operations
where we take a variable and set equal
to something we can even take a variable
and set it equal to itself plus
something we can create all sorts of
mathematical expressions that allow us
to assign a value of a variable but
there's another way we could actually do
both of it crazily we could do both of
these in one line of code and I'm going
to show you what I mean by that we can
say something like x equals random 100
now look at this this is both an
assignment operation a sine X a value of
I have added 250 with anymore assign X a
value and it's both a function call this
is a function as a name it has arguments
and four inside of parenthesis but
what's so interesting about this is
random is a different kind of function
than line and we could think of it this
way when I call the function line I said
I issued a command decree in a way draw
a line when I call the function random
instead of issuing a decree I'm actually
asking a question Oh function phantom
could you please give me an answer to
this question what does a random number
between 0 and
one hundred and the rainbow picture will
say aha here is a random number between
0 and 127 and it will give me that
number back and we're going to store it
in the value X this is incredibly useful
and in fact there are lots of methods in
processing I think we're going to make a
video just for this one that worked this
way there's a function called map
there's a function called constrain
there are lots of functions that
manipulate values for you and return
back the answer to a question in a way a
random number between some minimum and
some maximum how is this useful to us so
let's look at just how so first of all
let's just be a little bit more specific
about how the random function works the
random function can take one argument so
that argument let's say I put a hundred
in here is the maximum random value this
will give us a random value between 0
and 100 the minimum and the maximum it
can also take two arguments 50 comm100
for example this is the minimum and this
is the maximum it will always give us a
random number between 50 and 100 now the
other thing that I should point out
about this is it's not giving us 51 52
53 54 55 the random function actually
gives you a floating-point value back so
in fact it almost is giving you an
infinite number possibilities we're
going to get values like 59 point two
three one seven eight nine we're going
to get you know 79 point zero zero three
five one two but we're going to get
floating point values this is fine for
us if we've declared our variables as
floats we can get a float from random
and everything's okay there are some
cases where you need to take the result
of random and convert it to an integer
you'll see that in examples in the
future then we don't need to worry about
that so much right now so this is how
the random function works let's go take
a look at that in our program we walk
over here awkwardly okay so for example
one thing we could just do really
briefly really quickly to say let's
random
zero comma I'm going to say zero comma
the width so I actually want to give
circlex a random value between zero and
the width of the window and I'm going to
do something else I'm going to turn off
the circles motion by commenting out
that line of code this is often very
useful if you want to keep a line of
code kind of in reserve but you want to
deactivate it right you can just comment
it out so it's commented meaning the
compiler will ignore it when it runs so
we run this program look there's our
circle it's had a random location let's
run it again woah that was like the same
location twice what's the odds of that
let's run it again and really hope we
get something pretty different okay I
feel better now
there it is over there we will get a new
random value each time the program runs
now you might ask yourself is it really
random like how random is it you know so
the one thing we should just briefly
mention is this random value comes from
something known as a pseudo-random
number generator it's a mathematical
function invented by people perhaps you
could spend your life kind of developing
pseudo-random number generators you
could write you know you could years of
study but we get one for free in
processing it is not perfect randomness
in the sense that what you might find in
some occurrence of nature like I don't
know if you heated up some gas and
watched how the particles moved around
in the gas you might be able to like get
some sort of more pure random out of
that but it will exhibit some kind of
pattern over time but we aren't we
aren't we're writing you know sketches
that draw little circles and colors on
the screen it's plenty good random for
us right now but it it is coming it's
just a mathematical function written
into prospect that gives you a random
sequence of numbers and there's other
controls we can impose over that random
as well which are more advanced that I
would love to discuss with you sometime
if you'd like to talk about that okay so
now that we have that that's pretty good
but let's let's let's think of something
a little bit more interesting let's have
our circle start in the center of the
window so the circle should start at
with / - oh I got something for you
remember how I was saying everybody just
wants
like give circle X's initial position of
initial value up here because this is so
much more convenient just do it in one
line of code but I just want to give you
a warning this will not work for you now
this will fail because the width has not
been established until size has been
called this is why you want to be
careful about initializing all of your
variables up here sure it's more
convenient and it's less code less
typing and it's most of many examples
you'll see do that but this is a nice
instance where drop my pen where where a
circle X should be initialized here and
I feel very uncomfortable unless I know
exactly where this pen is okay so okay
so now sorry we've established circle X
is going to be in the middle we're going
to move circle X again right it's moving
by one but what if I said this move
circle X by a random value and I need a
little more space here between negative
2 &amp;amp; 2 write a random number between
minimum values negative to the positive
values plus is positive 2 sorry the
minimum value is negative to the maximum
value is positive 2 instead of saying
circle x equals circle X plus 1 every
time through draw we're going to turn a
circle x equals circle X plus 1.5
sometimes negative point three and
sometimes point eight and sometimes
negative point eight and if we run that
think about what it's going to do if we
run it look what's happening zoom in on
that whoops circle what is it doing it's
moving randomly each frame at a
different a different direction so it
gives us this jiggling like quality what
if you had its size change randomly each
frame it's going to have this almost
like you know we're programming like a
credibly nervous looking circle on the
screen and and be nice maybe we could
think of some ways to calm it down and
soothe it and you know be more gentle to
it but this is this is kind of
interesting
random allows us a lot of possibilities
beyond just give it a random location
where it starts and this is giving us an
inkling of that of how you can start to
create behave
here's personality in a way to the
shapes that you're drawing on the screen
so another thing that I just thought
that I would briefly show you I'm going
to save this as random - I guess what I
might do is all these examples are
essentially in similar to other examples
that I'm linking to but I might some
typing them out here and they're
slightly different I might put them
somewhere else with the link of good
download I don't need to be telling you
this right now but okay so let's just
look at one other thing that up so so
here's that's an exercise that I might
give you which is use random to effect
the X the Y the width and height of a
shape and see what type of personality
you can give it here's another exercise
to see if you can use random to
essentially create a painting on the
screen up and let's think what we can do
let's do a pointillist painting so the
first thing that I want to do here I'm
going to get you started on this is add
Circle Y and the second thing I want to
do is draw circle I draw the circle at
that location and I'll give them both
initial locations and I'm going to take
out this line of code completely and I'm
going to run this program and what did
we get we get a circle that's in the
middle of the screen it's x and y with /
- height / - there it is now what if
instead of assigning the initial value
in setup I give it a new value every
time through draw and I say hey give it
a random value between zero and width
okay phone ringing give it a random
value always airplane mode before I make
these videos give it a rag funny to
answer it but not that funny okay a
random value between zero and width and
circle Y a random value between zero and
height now we're doing that every time
through draw instead of giving it a
random value once and it sticks there
now we're giving it a random value every
time through draw look it puts it at a
different location every time but what
if I owned I took the background out and
only draw the background once in setup
now we're seeing the circle appear over
and over again at different places what
if I gave those circles a little bit of
alpha what if I made the size of the
circle random what if I made a random
for the color of each circle could I
create some type of painting where all
these random colors are blending could I
constrain the randomness could I say the
red is just between 50 and 100 and the
green is between 150 175 to kind of
create a palette of colors so this is I
think it's a nice exercise for you to
kind of play around with a can you
control the motion and of a singular
shape through random and also could you
create kind of this painting this
collection of stuff piling up with
random as well and create I use alpha
and color and size to really create some
type of pattern and you know use lines
rectangles other shapes beside circles
so that should get you kind of going
with some stuff to play with in terms of
using random and that's what I got to
say about that I'm going to go and
listen to that voice mail and I'm
banging the microphone so I apologize if
there was a popping sound or something</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
