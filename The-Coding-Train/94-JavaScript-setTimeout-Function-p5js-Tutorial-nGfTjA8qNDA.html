this moment in time it's going to happen
though I'm planning to talk about the
JavaScript functions these are
JavaScript native to the browser
JavaScript function set timeout and set
interval I will be looking at how to use
these functions in the context of a
JavaScript framework called p5 but
really the focus is these particular
functions set timeout and set interval
what are these functions oh how do they
work what's the syntax for using them
and why might you use them at all so
let's begin right now so first first let
me come over here to the whiteboard and
I'm just going to take a moment to
meditate and breathe and then write the
words on the whiteboard here set time
out this is a function in JavaScript
that accepts two arguments you are asked
to put two arguments inside this
function the first argument is another
function now if you've watched any of my
videos before which maybe you have or
maybe you haven't or if you've done any
JavaScript programming before this idea
of passing a function as an argument to
another function is it a new thing this
is very common functions are in
JavaScript are just variables or just
things that you could declare that you
can execute and that you can pass around
as functions so what needs to go in here
is a function for example I'm going to
call this function rainbow so the
function is called rainbow and it might
have some code in it which means set
timeout should reference that function
that's the first argument I want to set
timeout the rainbow function the second
argument is time a moment of time in
milliseconds
what does milliseconds mean one second
equals 1000 milliseconds milli is being
4,000 I think somewhere in Latin or
something comes from that probably so if
you want something if you want to
reference one minute you would be saying
60
or 60,000 milliseconds so time goes in
here so for example if I put two
thousand here as my second argument that
means two seconds so set timeout the
rainbow function mm what does that mean
it means I want the code that's inside
the rainbow function to execute two
seconds from now this is just a
marvelous you know it's this is like the
Gestalt of everything that happens in
JavaScript it's you know it's callbacks
an asynchronous method things I have
this block of code I'm going to specify
what it should happen and then somehow
it will just happen then based on what I
specified so this really like represents
everything there is to be about the
programming language JavaScript all here
now I should briefly mention before I
start writing this code and making
something happen in the actual code that
this is often not written this way this
is often written as what's called an
anonymous function so right I said set
timeout requires two arguments a
function like this function rainbow and
a time when that function should be
executed like two thousand or to $2,000
second or two seconds later from when
this function was called however you
could actually take all of the code
that's here and just stick it right in
where this is not Mel demonstrates that
to you when I type stuff out for for
teaching and kind of legibility I find
right now I find it often useful to
break out the function definition into a
separate place sometimes that's actually
necessary depending on what you're doing
code wise but in many cases it's often
convenient especially if this function
is just one line of code to embed it
anonymously in here what do I mean by an
anima spot the way like is why would a
function be anonymous so what I mean by
that is this functions name is rainbow
and we need the functions name so that
set timeout can refer to that particular
function but if we define the function
right in here it wouldn't actually need
a name because we don't need to
reference it we're just sticking it in
there so you could write in here an
anonymous function would look like this
can you see that hopefully you can see
that so this entire block of code with
something written in here to actually do
could be inserted right there so guys a
little bit long-winded but this is the
basic idea of set timeout so now here we
are Here I am at least and maybe you're
still watching or maybe you've gone and
watched a stampede cat and a Minecraft
video instead totally bored by b-but um
or like never mind I was gonna think of
some other interesting things you can
watch on YouTube I guess you have your
own interests separate from mine that's
one of my interests but putting that all
aside what do I have over here so what I
have over here is a JavaScript program
it's a p5 sketch it has some code
written to it already so if you're
familiar with p5 there's a set up
function there's a draw function set up
is where I'm creating a canvas that
appears in the browser and draw is this
thing that's just automatically
happening over and over again so there
already is a sense of time in this
particular example and time is managed
for us for me by the p5 library but I
want to do something different so what
you might have sometimes seen in
processing programs or p5 GS programs or
any kind of program that anyone's ever
written in the history of programming
from the universe is like an if
statement in here if a certain number of
milliseconds is passed or if the number
of frames that have been animated then
do this
so this using set timeout is a way that
I could say you know what I want
something to happen five seconds after
the program starts without having to
check inside of draw when is this how
many times to draw what time is it that
sort of thing so let's look at how what
let's come up with something so I'm
going to write my function called
rainbow I don't like with the Bowa
capital V and in that function I'm just
going to say create P rainbow so my my
variant you should make my non-existant
colorful rainbow is going to be replaced
by just a paragraph of text with the
word rainbow in it so you can see right
here if I were to just execute that
function in setup and run the code again
you can see in addition to the canvas I
now have the paragraph rainbow it's been
the rainbow function was called right
when the program start and the paragraph
was created so now let me say instead
set time out rainbow and then I'm going
to say 3000 whoops 3000 so I'm going to
say 4 3 set thousand
okay 3,000 milliseconds later or well
three seconds later create that
paragraph this is going to be very
exciting here we go are you ready ready
a count one one thousand two one
thousand three one thousand there we go
see
so 3,000 milliseconds later that code
gets executed so you could imagine if
you want to script a whole bunch of
things to happen at various points of
time you can make it of it now this
isn't to say that this has to just
happen in setup for example what I can
do now is I could you know add the
generic I you know I probably should
make a button or something but I'll just
add the generic kind of global mouse
press function so anywhere I click the
mouse on the page right I could count to
three all I want but I'm not going to
get my rainbow until I click the mouse
but when I click the mouse I'm not going
to get the rainbow until that was that
perfect I mean and now I'm going to do
it again oh shoot so close okay
you get the idea though right so this is
what time set timeout does it allows you
to trigger a particular action at a
given moment in time and interestingly
enough I could do something like if I
call this in the in in the rainbow
function let's see what happens here
whoops I'm gonna put this back and setup
and I'm going to make this 1,000 and I'm
gonna run this again rainbow rainbow
rainbow rainbow right every second I get
a new rainbow you got a rainbow you get
a rainbow you get rainbow you get a
rainbow everybody gets a rainbow so I've
really got to stop this video now that
I've started acting like Oprah but um so
anyway so that's the pie thing you get
it I think this was good it's like it's
almost like too easy there's not very
much I like I'm so used to like wanting
to make a five minute video and it takes
15 minutes that I made this way too long
and I'm only at eight minutes so there's
more to this than that there's more to
that than that there's more to it than
this so I've shown you the very basics
what I want to do I'll make a couple
more videos one I'll show you set
interval which actually will do
something much like this where I've
sorta nested the the call to set time
out every 1000 seconds 1000
and then I want to look at what happens
if you want to create different
sequences of things happen bait like
what if you here's a scenario that I
think would be worth looking at what if
you had an array of musical notes and
you wanted those notes to play in a
sequence each one of those notes with a
certain amount of time essentially to
play a melody how might you do that with
set time out to specifying the time for
each one of those notes so I'm hoping to
make a video with an example like that
okay thanks very much and I'm gonna hit
stop now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
