tutorial now in this particular tutorial
what I'm going to show you is the
process for you are working on a project
that project exists on your laptop
you've been working on it for an hour a
day a week a month and suddenly you want
to turn this project this folder of
files into a git repository and then put
that git repository on github this is
different than what I showed you in the
previous video right I created the git
repository on github and then I brought
it down to my computer worked on it on
my computer and pushed it back up you
know it doesn't really matter honestly I
often just work that way it's a little
bit easier I just make something on
github pull it down and then put files
into it but useful to know this other
way of doing it and the key command that
you need to know we come over here to my
white board is I don't do I have it here
anywhere no I do not is a new one I'm
adding getting to be a mess down here
but it's in it so this command get in it
is crucial for this particular video now
I'm making this video series without
source code whatsoever but if you're a
programmer most likely you have a
directory of code files I instead of
having a directory of code files have a
directory of instructions for dancing
this is the rainbow dance which is step
left step right jump up move it down to
the rainbow dance step left you don't
want to see me do this to you
probably not okay so this is the rainbow
dance and if I go to my desktop and I go
to this rainbow dance directory you can
see that files in there again this could
be a directory of tons of files but just
one file so what I want to do is turn
this into a git repository it is
currently not a git repository let's be
sure about that so I'm going to terminal
and I'm going to say CD up tolet let me
adjust the size here a little bit and
I'm going to say CD and I need to go to
that directory so the way I can go to
that directory is just take that
directory and drag it here now I'm in
the rainbow dance directory let's make
sure by saying PWD I definitely am now
I'm going to type git status not a git
repository so by default any directory
on your computer is not a git repository
but I can turn it into a git repository
by saying get in it that's all I need
initialize empty git
repository so now I have an empty git
repository fantastic
now what if I type git status now it's
saying so it's saying untracked files so
this is something that we haven't
actually seen before you might not have
realized this but I secretly with the
wave of my magic my hands are very magic
I guess but I have always just been
working on pre-existing files that were
made on github I didn't add a new file
and this brings up a very strange thing
about commits and git and saving things
oh there's this erasing is not working
very well let's try this other eraser
but you're just gonna have to bear with
me
messy whiteboard makes me very
uncomfortable but I think life will go
on so let's talk about workflow with git
and commits and we need to before we can
get this new git repository onto github
we've got to deal with something else
the ad right I'm going to put it up here
ad so let's say you have a file dance
dot txt if you make a chain if you're
forgetting about git for a second if you
make a change to that file you're just
going to hit command S and save it the
file saved your changes are saved what
we saw was like a commit is when we were
on github a commit was basically the
same as safe these were like the same
things if you're working locally however
if you're working locally however the
first thing you do is save that's just
saving the actual file on your file
system but it's not actually committing
the change to the git repository so the
second thing that you do is actually
come in so save and commit our separate
steps I'm saving the file but now I'm
also committing it to the repository now
the strange thing is there's actually a
third step called add and add this is
required if you have new files so git
has this concept of a staging area
where you can think of like um let me
let me redraw this diagram up here right
you have a bunch of files and these
files are being manipulated there is a
staging area and then there is the
action of committing so if you're with
one file this almost seems ridiculous to
talk about but if you have a lot of
files that a lot of things are changing
this could be useful because let's just
say you have dance txt and then one txt
to dot txt three txt 40 XD 5 ft and
you've made changes in all of your files
and you want to do a commit but you'll
actually only want the commit to be
associated with changes that are in
these files but there are changes in
other files so the things that you
actually want to commit you could put in
the staging area you can also remove
them from the staging area add add is a
way of putting things in the staging
area so that when you call when you when
you execute commit those those are the
changes that are actually committed so
for us for the 99% of the cases you saw
that I said git commit dash a that does
add and commit all in one fell swoop
that's what I did in the previous video
git commit dash a just says add
everything and committed any changes I
made anywhere commit them but in this
case I can't do that right now there
might be your way but I want to
explicitly add the new files and then
commit them I need to do I need to put
stuff in the staging area and then
commit them so let's do that I'm going
to come over here and what I'm going to
do is I'm going to say git add dance txt
now let's do something actually just to
be a bit more explicit about this I'm
going to do making a second file dance
to dot txt and you can see get status so
now you can see there are two files
there so if I only want to add one I do
that I now added that to the staging
area and let me actually let me clear
and say git status again and you can see
look this file is going to be committed
and I can say get removed - - cashed the
file name - unstaged a k-- this file
won't when I say commit it's still just
a new file that get recognizes there but
it's not actually part of the history
yet so now if I were to say get commit
adding a new dance that's now been added
and oops and I can say gibbsite hip caps
lock by accident I can say get status
again and you can see it's showing me
the only thing it's is this new file now
if you've added a lot of files and or
you just want to add everything you
could always just say get add dot so get
add dot it's kind of like get add
anything that get to text as a change or
a new file and then I can say get commit
adding a second dance whoops I forgot my
- M git commit dash and notice I'm not
saying - a anymore
because I'm doing the add and commit a
second separate steps and now I've added
a second dance I can say clear I could
say git git status and on branch master
master nothing to commit working
directory clean it means no files have
any new changes in them and the droop
and the directory doesn't have any new
files in them so now we're done I made a
new repository
I had an existing directory of files I
turned into a repository added those
files now what I want to do is put that
on github so right I should just say
what I said before git push origin
master right that'll push it to github
my I hit the table Backson there was no
I got an error message but I'm not angry
about it at all I deserve that error
message
origin does not appear to be a git
repository because why let's say git
remote nothing get remote - V nothing
there are no remotes so if my repository
started on github and I brought it down
to my computer a remote is already going
to be attached to it but if I'm starting
my repository
doesn't have a remote associated with it
so I need to add that remote so the way
to add that remote is I have to go now
to github and I have to make a new
repository so I'm going to call this
repository rain
dance and some public prostate now
here's the thing I don't want to
initialize this with a readme right now
I could and there's a variety of ways I
can deal with that if I do but this is
actually going to make a completely
empty repository with no files in it
that's what I want I want it to be empty
I'm going to make it a remote and then
push my repository to it so I'm going to
say create repository and actually if
you look here it's going to tell you
what to do on your the command line but
I already did this get in it get add git
commit first commit but this this is the
the new thing that I need to add I
actually need to make the URL for this
repository on github
the Origin remote for this particular
repository so the commands for doing
that are git remote add origin I want to
add a remote named origin and by the way
I don't have to call it origin I could
call it github if I want or I could call
it rainbow if I want it doesn't matter
what I call it but origin is kind of a
convention for the sort of origin web
server version of this repository so
it's a git remote at origin and then
what do I need I need the URL for this
git repository which is conveniently
right here I'm going to copy it and I'm
going to paste that in here and then I'm
going to hit enter and now I should say
git remote you can see it's there git
remote - V and you can see it's there
okay now we're cooking and I'm gonna say
git push origin master Oh
whoa it just worked so interestingly
enough remember how I had to type my
username and password in before well I
didn't this time the reason why I didn't
is that my machine just sort of like
cached it somehow so I've a feeling if I
like restart the computer or quit
terminal come back it might ask me for
it again but it's nice to see that you
don't have to continually enter that
username and password if you're kind of
in the same session so but if it does
enter your username and password so you
can see I pushed all that stuff there
and now if I hit refresh you can see
there it is dance and dance dude now
incidentally I'm going to go to this
file I'm going to hit edit and we're
going to change the rainbow dance step
left step right jump up and down twirl
your hands let's add that twirl your
hands
and then I'm going to hit a commit
making a change on github you know if
you guys can see this
I'm just scroll down hit commit changes
I just want you to see that now if I go
so I made a change now on github
I made my repository in my computer I
pushed it to get up I made a change on
github now interestingly enough if I say
git status nothing to commit working
directory clean I feel like sometimes it
tells me if I'm behind
maybe after do get maybe it I have to do
get fetched fetches another command
anyway sometimes it tells me I'm behind
but doesn't know but I could say git
pull origin master and you can see that
it actually brought those changes here
and now if I go back to my dance
Oh silly text edit doesn't like auto
update the file but you can see it's
there now twirl your hands and do the
rainbow dance yay okay so just to recap
here in this particular video what I
looked at is I have files on my computer
I've turned those files into a git
repository then I created an empty
repository on github linked it together
push the files up made a change on
github pull them down so now I have a
way that I can just work locally work
remotely so the thing that we're really
missing here so far is the collaborative
feature so what if you want to work on
somebody else's repository but work on
their repository locally on your
computer what if you want to do that in
a separate branch so that's what I will
get to in the next set of videos there's
a lot more I think there's a lot more
concepts to sort of cover of how to do
all those things locally and a few other
little tricks like a get ignore file and
a bunch of other little things that I'll
get to in other videos as well okay
thanks very much and see you hopefully
in another video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
