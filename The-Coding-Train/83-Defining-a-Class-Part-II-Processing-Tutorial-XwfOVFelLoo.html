had a bunch of stuff here on the
whiteboard that sort of magically went
over here and it's now here in a
processing sketch so we have the
beginnings of a processing sketch now
again there's this sort of funny thing
going on here have we written this
program in Reverse like if I were to run
this right now what's it going to tell
me can I find a class or type name
bubble that's what it says down there
can I find a class or type name bubble
well Oh am according am i okay am i
recording sound yes madam summary okay
keep going and just I thought I maybe I
forgot to hit record okay um
cannot find a class or type name bubble
well of course it can't there's no
bubble built into processing this is a
new type that we are defining that's
what we need to define in our class but
so normally you might think of your
watch would write the class and then I
can use the object or should I make be
out but what we've done here is kind of
an interesting thing this is now giving
us the instructions for how we have to
write the class we know the class needs
to have these functions in it so this is
a sort of design question that you want
to think about as you're working on
something do you want to figure out what
the object needs to do first then write
the class to inform that or vice versa
it's an interesting question and you
might try doing it both ways
truly what we've done here is first we
wrote a program that was without any
functions at all and a lot of stuff in
setup a lot of stuff and draw then we
change it to a program that was with
function so a lot of variables some
initialization and a bunch of functions
in draw we've now moved that to our next
stage which is saying forget about all
the inner workings of a bubble how does
the bubble even work we don't even know
we just know how to control a bubble you
know we're going to have a bubble we're
going to have a new bubble and we're
going to apply these three functions to
it so how then do we define the class
how do we have an actual but how do we
get this to stop saying can I find a
class or type name but here's how we do
it we need to define a class class
bubble open curly bracket close curly
bracket we're using the full height can
you see that on your screen yes you get
we're using the full height here we are
now we have a new block of code this is
a big block of code just like with a
function setup but conditional a more
sane open curly braket close curly
bracket everything about how a bubble
works is going to go in here again this
is not an actual bubble object this is
the bubble object this is the bubble
that's actually going to be in our code
this is just what it means to be a
bubble what does it mean to be above
well one thing we know is that we have
to have a function call to send we have
to have a function called display and we
have to have a function called top so
that means inside of the bubble class we
need some function definitions for
example I could write void display and
how is a bubble displayed by the lips
name in ellipse and XY within the size
of 64 right this is now a function
inside of a class all bubble objects
have the ability to execute this
function they have the ability to say B
dot display now this this now should
open our eyes to something else I said
draw the bubble add a lips XY well where
does that XY come from in our previous
version of this program there was there
were global variables XY this is the XY
for the bubble there just here above
setup is that where they should say
absolutely not but Ashley should not say
that when we're saying now is there's no
such thing as a global XY there's a
global at what XY for this program there
is there are only XY z-- for bubbles a
bubble that's next why every single
bubble will have its own XY how we
define that by defining X&amp;amp;Y here float x
float Y what is a bubble what is an
object it is something that has both
data and functionality
I believe we discussed this in a couple
videos ago this is the whole innovation
and excitement of object-oriented
data and functionality together at last
been beautiful this is it inside of the
class we have the data for the bubble
and the functionality for the bottle we
need to add move I mean descend we need
to add top etc but really we have
everything here we're missing one
important thing let's go put this in our
program real quick we have a couple more
minutes before I feel like this video ok
so here we are
ah oh my good oh my goodness whoa we got
something new so it's coming up here ok
what's going on
we're we going to write this class where
we're going to put this in our code what
we could as we have done before say new
block of code down here right there's my
new block of code I have a set up lock
my draw block down on you to class and
put it down there
processing this is fine but processing
gives you a nice little feature here up
here new tab I can make a new tab
meaning I'm going to call it bubble um
meaning I can actually write my class
over here now should you really get that
excited about this maybe not but this is
just a really nice way to organize box
your programming so right it's just so
much more comforting to be able to know
here's my main program here's where I'm
using my objects and I'm making them and
they're doing stuff and then where do
they define where the inner workings of
them how do I manipulate and make those
objects better oh that's in the other
tab that's where I'm gonna work on my
bubble code in each bubble again needs
to have an X in each level Y and it
needs a display function which maybe
says stroke 0 bill 127 and an ellipse XY
6464 there we go so interestingly enough
okay let's go here so we know that we
didn't write the assign function and we
didn't write the top function but let's
run this
it actually works I can close this old
one put this new one over here where I
stand again idea it actually works
what's going on where's that bubble it's
sort of stuck up there in the top left
why
where did we say where the bubble should
begin I wanted to begin in the bottom in
the middle the bottom in the middle
where do I say where it should begin
well here's where I declare the
variables is that where I should give
them their initial values I could well
we need to do one thing one thing better
remember we said this in the previous
videos that B equals new bubble is
calling something called the constructor
the constructor is the place where the
object is born it is a beautiful shining
moment but truly it's just like it's
like setup for the object just like our
program have things that happen after
the beginning things that happened over
and over again objects have things that
happen to them at the beginning what are
their initial statics is it a blue
bubbles in a bubble in the middle of the
screen is it a big bubble what are its
initial conditions we need to write that
constructor the syntax or the
constructor is a little bit odd it's not
like something we've done before Bumble
parentheses parentheses open curly
bracket close curly bracket so it kind
of looks like a function it has a name
it has a space for arguments and has an
open curly bracket in the close curly
brackets the thing that's different is
that there is no return type this by the
way just to complete this beautiful
diagram is the constructor it has no
return type in truth what is the return
type the return type is actually bubble
it's returning an object right it's
saying make a new object and store it in
the variable B right so that's what
controls returning but and its name must
match the class name so this is where
you can initialize things like I could
say it should start in the middle and at
the bottom let's add that indoor program
okay in the class I'm now going to add
the constructor and there is where I
want to say I want to be
in the middle and at the bottom and we
can just write that a send function
really quickly all right say why - - and
we can put it back in and run it and
there we have our bubble ascending now
we didn't write the top function so it's
just going to float up and off the
window but now we see that here we need
when we're going to make a bubble we
need to add all the variables we need to
add the constructor we need to add all
the functions we intend to call and all
of those things are in a clot in a bitch
own block of code with the beginning
curly bracket and end curly bracket we
have the data we have the constructor
and we have the functions this is the
syntax so what I would say to you as an
exercise
is two things one is you can grab this
example again we'll have some system
hopefully for graphics you soon and you
see if you can just add that top
function to it or add some other
functionality to it actually here you go
what if this is a tough one boy this is
a hard one but it's a good one
how could I mean how could I do
something where when I click on the
bubble it pops
or maybe just changes color see how
would you write that into the class
itself in other words what if I want to
do this ooh boy we're out of time this
video is going to shut off any second
now so you shoot here together let me
give you as much of a clue and
eventually this vid is going to fit in
just I have a time limit okay
so what if I were to say something like
B dot hop and better yet I might want to
do something like if I click on it but
whatever this is just a simple thing
write a function when you click the
mouse
it pops above it disappears it changes
color or something like that see if you
can do that as an exercise okay great
and in the next video we're going to
also look at how to make more than one
bubble
this was still going in the next video
we're going to look at how to make more
than one bubble</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
