presentation episode thing of the coding
train so this is a special episode it
actually is an archive of a live stream
I'm recording this introduction after
that happened because I had a bit of
some sound problems during the actual
live introduction you didn't miss
anything trust me but I'm really excited
I'm always happy when I have a guest
onto with a different voice different
point of view to talk to you about
something interesting and meaningful and
so today I'm very pleased to introduce
to you serrano yet Barik Saran I met
first when I think I was a guest on her
amazing podcast called code newbies is
it code newbies or code new be called
newbies sorry code newbie so code newbie
is I really recommend the podcast
there's you know it's been how many
years now over two years there's tons of
episodes to go back listen them all the
thing that I like the most about it is
there are so many different stories of
people's journeys through learning to
code discovering to code and I think if
you picture in your head what you think
a programmer is and then you listen to
the code newbie podcast you're gonna
have a different picture after you
listen to a lot of episodes so I really
would recommend that podcast surin is
also organizing a conference April 20th
21 22 in New York City it's called code
land oh it's right behind me oh my god
it's right behind me April 21 22 this is
the URL and so there's still tickets
available and so what I asked her to
present about or the idea that she had
was you know what is it what how do you
put together a Tech Talk you're
presenting at a conference you're
presenting at a lunch at work or
whatever it might be what are some ways
to think about putting together a Tech
Talk and I know that I struggle with
this all the time and with pasting
slides together so anyway I'm talking
too much I enjoyed this presentation
there is a small sound glitch during the
presentation it's just about four
seconds long but hopefully it won't
affect your enjoyment of it at the end I
answer some questions from the audience
and then if you also have questions you
can ask on Twitter you can s Iran or me
on Twitter check this video's
description and of course you can ask in
the comments below okay thanks and now
I'm going to travel backwards in time
for a Sirhan's presentation
hi everybody my name is Ron I'm super
excited to be here this is my first live
stream YouTube thingy so let's both
cross our fingers and hope this works
out so as Dan mentioned today we're
gonna talk about your perfect Tech Talk
and does it give you a little bit of
context about me I'm Saran I'm the
founder of code newbie we are the most
supportive community of programmers and
people learning to code we do a Twitter
chat every Wednesday we have a weekly
podcast every Monday we have a slack
group I think we've reached nine
thousand members so far we're all over
the world who really excited to code and
one of the things that I'm super super
pumped about is a conference that we're
doing it's our first conference and I
talk a lot as the screen says I do a lot
of speaking I've done keynotes I've
spoken all over the world and my
favorite part about putting this
conference together is getting to work
with other speakers a lot of first time
speakers and helping them put their talk
together and really craft it so as I've
worked with I think we have about 30
speakers I've come up with some really
good patterns some ideas that I think
will help you so that's we're gonna dig
into today so if we think about the
different stages of putting a talk
together there are four parts
there's the ideas and the brainstorming
there's the content the structure and
the delivery we're not going to talk
about delivery because that gets
or we dig into these individual parts
it's super important that we define what
a Tech Talk is now you're thinking sir
on obviously this is a talk about tech
things sort of right I think the more
helpful way to define a Tech Talk
is to talk about what it is not so what
isn't a Tech Talk
it is not a lecture can you remember
being in college or being in school and
actually enjoying your professors
lecture of course you don't it was
boring you probably skipped a lot of
them it is not a lecture do not bore
your audience number two it is not a
soapbox I see this all the time where
speakers use the opportunity to have a
mic and a stage to rant and vent about
the latest JavaScript framework that's
pissing them off let's not do this and
it is not a blog post if you think about
a blog post it's a lot of content
it's very maybe there's some pictures
maybe there some videos but you don't
really get too emotionally interact with
the blog post it's a lot of content that
is usually very useful but there's no
human element to it if I watch your talk
and I think to myself I could have just
gotten this reading a post it's probably
not a great Tech Talk so what is a Tech
Talk a Tech Talk is a performance you
have a state do you literally have a
stage you have a mic you have an
audience this is more theatre than it is
anything else it should also be
informative that's the the tech part of
the talk right sharing people your
technical knowledge or maybe some
opinions maybe some expertise if you
feel like you have some and a Tech Talk
is emotional and this is one of the
things that I really learned from
watching a lot of other talks and
thinking about the ones that stuck with
me that I literally play back over and
over again in my head to this day there
are the ones that didn't just tell me
information or give me a timeline or
throw some tech terms at me these are
the ones that said Wow I felt this way I
really struggle through this I was
really excited about this and that
emotional connection optimizing for the
fact that you were a real person
physically there with your audience is
huge so now that we've gotten all of
that out of the way let's talk about
phase one the idea ideas are super super
hard and they're even harder if you're a
beginner because you generally think
well I don't have
idea I don't have anything that I feel
like I need to share with anyone and
they're hard if you're a first-time
speaker because even if you've been
coding for a million years and you're
the CTO of this and that you may feel
like well I still don't have an original
idea because it's already been written
about it's already been talked about and
the other thing that makes speaking and
idea generation really hard is that a
lot of times we assumed speakers or
experts I think that's kind of a problem
we don't want to view speakers as
experts we want to view them as
storytellers and we'll get into stories
a little bit later so when I try to
think about the ideas that I want to
share and put into a talk I ask myself a
couple questions that really help out
one is what is something that I'm proud
of what's something that I've done no
matter how small it is or how big it is
that I can look back on and go yeah I
did that next I think about what have I
learned every time I learn something I
usually call my mom and tell her this
new technique that I solved she has no
idea what I'm saying that's okay she
pretends that's why she's awesome but
what is something that you've learned
and you were excited about it enough to
share it with a friend the significant
other a co-worker and the third thing is
what's a project that you've struggled
with the thing that I find so
interesting about Tech Talks is we view
it as a platform for expertise but some
of the most popular talks are really
about failure one of my favorite talks
by I can't resume I think it's Jacob
Kaplan Moss I hope that's correct who
helped open source Django is he did a
talk I think it was something like I am
NOT a good developer that was the whole
thing it's got thousands of views on
YouTube because he spent 20 minutes
talking about how much he sucked so
talking about your struggles and your
failures can actually be very very
powerful and if you're a beginner if you
don't feel like you have a lot of
expertise that can be a really great
idea source for you so you may notice
that these three things what you're
proud of what you learn what you
struggled with have one thing in common
it's about you which gets to the real
source of this what is something that
only you can tell me about only to keep
that in the back of your mind so
everything we've talked about so far is
super theoretical it's all very high
level and everything is wonderful and
easy when it seems you know theoretical
we don't have a real example so we're
going to dig into
an example and I really just want to
warn you for this part this is a this is
really exciting so if you're not sitting
down you may want to take a seat for
what I'm about to show you this is the
cookie dough ice cream cone no it is not
cookie dough ice cream it is just cookie
dough there is a store I believe it's in
New York City that sells different
flavors of cookie dough if it's like
it's safe to eat and all that stuff and
you just scoop a whole thing of cookie
dough and you put in a cone and you eat
it that's amazing this is also known as
happiness that that was me I decided to
just call it happiness and if we look at
this awesome video can I play this video
I can't play it it's okay
it's just someone scooping cookie don't
think it's fine and if we look here we
can see that it comes in different
flavors there's even a Nutella flavored
cookie dough ice cream cone it's magical
so you as a very amazing developer you
know real problem solver you hear about
this cookie dough ice cream cone and you
think to yourself the world really needs
a map they need a map to find out where
all the places where they can find this
cookie dough ice cream cone so you
decide to do a little data visualization
project you decide they're gonna make a
really cool map and you're gonna use
something called leaflet which is a
JavaScript library to make interactive
maps and you realize that it's a very
simple map because there's only one
store and only one data point but you've
never usually flipped before you're
super excited about your first
interactive map and you want to talk
about it so the idea that we're working
with is how to map cookie dough ice
cream cones that's the idea so now let's
look into the content the problem with
that idea is it's really boring if you
think about the technical aspects of it
a map with just one data point is not
the most life-changing exciting
technical feat in the world it's
actually very boring so you might be
tempted to look at a couple different
angles a couple different ways that you
want to talk about it because you're
still really excited the first way you
might present this topic is you might
want to do a collage you might want to
do three cool map projects using leaflet
that's helpful
that's informative but do you need to
give that talk can anybody give that
talk can that be in a blog post if so
why are you the right person to tell me
that story the next idea you might have
is how to use leaflet to map cookie
dough cones this one's a little bit
better because the cookie dough cones
part makes it a little more exciting
makes it a little more personal but at
the end of the day this is really just a
tutorial now would you rather have a
tutorial in a talked format where you're
sitting in audience you're sitting in a
row you don't have your laptop out you
can't follow along you can't pause it
you can't ask questions is that really
the best way to show how to technically
accomplish something probably not that's
a great candidate for our YouTube video
or a tutorial on a blog post so let's
think about a third angle for this how I
made a map of cookie dough cones oh
that's more interesting because the part
about that that is interesting is not
the map it's not even really the cookie
dough cones although if you're me that
is really the only thing that matters it
is the how I made that's the part that
makes it about you that's a part that
makes it about your journey and that's a
story that only you can tell right okay
so we are going to focus on that idea
and we're gonna talk about the way we
might structure that angle so let's talk
about structure now there are three
parts to a talk one is the technical
junk all the the tools the technologies
and the buzzwords there's the story
there's also the lessons learned now one
thing I've seen especially working with
a lot of speakers and going to a ton of
Tech Talks myself it's people really
like focusing on the lessons learned
that's the thing that people get really
excited about and the thing is nobody
cares nobody cares about your lessons
learned the only person who cares about
your lessons learned are you that's it
because the lessons learned are the
things that you walked away with they're
the results they're the solutions those
are the wins but all of those lessons
learn without any context doesn't mean
anything and the interesting thing about
lessons learned is they end up sounding
super generic the lessons are things
like communication is very important you
though
it might be things like debugging is a
skill that takes patience I think we all
know that it might be read the errors
these are all great lessons but when you
present that as the forefront you're
gonna get a lot of yawns in your
audience and we don't want that so the
second thing is a developer you might be
tempted to focus on is the technical
part all of the buzz words and the
jargon and all that
now the thing with that is that can be
great depending on your audience if you
have a super technical audience that
might be what they're really into but
more than likely you'll have an audience
who isn't quite familiar familiar with
your exact set of tools so you're gonna
end up either boring them or they'll get
really intimidated and just kind of
check out of your talk and we don't
really want that
but really a thing about technical stuff
is nobody cares again nobody cares about
leaflet until they know why they're
using it we'll problem they're trying to
solve the technical stuff only matters
in the context of your story so if we go
through these three points we end up
with the story lessons learned and
technical stuff only matter in the
context of the story which brings us to
the question what is a story now this
seems like a very obvious question but
based on a lot of answers I've gotten
I'm gonna go ahead and say that we need
to review this together stories are
about conflict I think an easy way to
think about stories is oh there's a
beginning middle and no no screw that
that's not what matters what matters is
there's a problem I come to you I say hi
I'm Sarang I'm doing this thing I ran
into this problem here's how I fix it
the moment you can get to I ran into
this problem your audience will sit up
they'll think oh how did you do that oh
my goodness I have had that problem
myself how would I solve that it
immediately becomes interesting as soon
as you introduce that tension so if we
think about these three components this
is kind of the order that we want to
structure our talk in we want to start
with that story we want to present that
tension that conflict right off the bat
as soon as we can and then we want to
get into the technical part because it
is a tap talk we want to introduce those
tools the the terminology the framework
that kind of thing and then we want to
end with the lesson because the lesson
is the resolution that's how we solve
the problem and that's how we make sure
to never have that problem again
crossing our fingers so this means
that you are gonna be tempted to have a
story section then a technical section
then a lessons learned section now let's
think about that if you structure a
40-minute talk in these sections you
will have spent the first was at 12 and
a half I was heading at 40 I'll do 45 45
minute talk that means you'll have
structure the first 15 minutes telling
awesome stories in which case I'm I'm
excited I go oh goody this is great and
then you'll spend the next 15 minutes
talking about all the tech things and
throwing a lot of words at me that
hopefully I understand and then you
spend the last 15 talking about a list
of lessons learned and if you remember
the Tech Talks you've seen a lot of the
technical section stuff and lessons
stuff ends up just in bullet points and
both points aren't the most exciting
thing to look at for 15 minutes instead
what you want to do is you want to take
that story and you want to divide it up
generally stories work well in groups of
three I think those things work well in
groups of three so we're going to divide
our story up into three parts part one
will have its own story its own conflict
will introduce the technical components
and then we'll share the lessons learned
part two same structure story technical
stuff lessons learned and then part
three story technical lessons learned
and if you think about the structure in
this way the original the the more
common definition of a story having a
beginning middle end and the falling
right in line part one is your beginning
part two is your middle part three is
your end now if you do it this way
you'll have a couple benefits number one
is you have one cohesive story those
three parts even though they have their
own conflict their own tension really
there are three parts of the same
journey the same narrative and that
makes me feel like I'm not being
interrupted
it gives me an incentive to keep going
that cohesion is really really important
the third thing that really works out
when you have that three-story structure
is you're introducing a new adventure
every question is that like 33% right
there anything worth darnit 33% of the
talk so you present a problem and maybe
as an audience member I go oh I can't
really relate to that I'm not really
that understood that's okay
33% of the way in I get a new problem I
get her new tension I get her new
conflict that we're going to talk
through so it gives me
an entry point a ramp an on-ramp for
your talk at three specific points which
is very nice and the third thing is that
all these lessons instead of stacking
them at the end when you interweave them
throughout your whole talk you have
context for that so this goes back to
one of the things that we talked about
the very beginning of this video which
is that your talk is a performance when
you position things as a story you're
optimizing for that performance feel you
can in use inflections you can use
gestures you can bring people up you can
bring people down you can really be a
little more theatrical when you have
that content structured as a story it is
still informative by making sure we have
a technical component in each part of
our talk we're able to make sure we're
giving people real information and
ideally some next steps and some tools
to walk up afterwards and when you
structure your talk in this way you are
optimizing for emotion you're optimizing
for the fact that I'm not reading a blog
post I'm not watching a video I am
physically here in front of you and I'm
sharing this story with you the more I
can make it about me and my journey the
more able I am to connect with you and
that can be really powerful and all this
is really just a bunch of building
blocks and a bunch of tools to optimize
for how people will remember you because
no one will ever remember what you said
I'm sure a month from now you won't
remember most of these points but
hopefully I will have excited you and
made you feel like you can do a
technical talk and that's the thing that
I want you to remember people don't
remember what you say they only remember
how you made them feel so the more you
can excite them the more you can bring
them on this journey the more you can
make them feel resolved at the end the
more likely they are to remember your
talk and hopefully remember you so these
are all the lessons that I wanted to
share with you and my own takeaways from
putting on Tech Talks
if you are interested in coming to
Colton and would love to have you it's
specifically for people who have less
than two years of professional coding
experience but hopefully you'll hear
some really great stories and talks
because we'll be using a lot of these
tools to work with our speakers you can
get tickets and learn more at
really come back into the fray I'm gonna
microphone okay first of all thank you
so much what you guys don't realize this
surin is really big great here there's
like a classroom next door there was
like music coming in I don't think a
good hearing that but a lot of
distraction so that was really wonderful
and you know for me I'm this is great is
particularly I was actually just working
on some slides for a very short
presentation at code land and to be
honest I wasn't really thinking about
the story fit that much it just kind of
like well interesting the show and this
be interesting the show yeah so this is
very helpful for me personally so I have
a bunch of great people are saying the
weird guy is back yes I should I have
some some great questions from the chat
first of all there was a really nice
comment since this was a Tech Talk in a
way I just want to say there was a nice
comment that said I like how saurons
presentation use short informal
sentences and bold sentences and it
makes it sort of feel powerful so that's
like you sort of thought about when
you're yeah putting together yeah that's
the thing you know I am the very first
talk that I did I actually did a full I
did all these original cartoons and I
drew them and I inked them and I put
them up and it took a dick ulis amount
of time so the next time I did talk I
did nothing I put as few slides up with
very very simple colors and I realized
that people actually liked it better
when it was simple and punchy and short
so that's enough when something can make
a lot yeah it's interesting because I I
do see a lot of talks and answers no
text and it's all just image image image
and talking over at verses you know it
didn't really occur to me now that was
all text yeah you know it's very simple
and powerful in that way so one question
from extra roadie how often do you get
nervous before a talk and does it get
easier now that you've done maybe more
than one talk that's a great question
I get nervous all the time I was nervous
on my way here oh my god my first love
something something old girl I get super
nervous I think the interesting thing is
when I
little nervous I actually do better
because it's my way of of caring and
putting a little more thought and love
into what I'm doing so I think the
nerves is totally not a bad thing some
more like practical tips on nerves try
not to eat a lot before I usually have
like dry toast and maybe some tea and
ginger ale but my stomach and my bowels
get a little kind of fun but yes I get
nervous all the time I've talked all
over the world and I'm still getting
nervous so yeah it's not just you it's
all of us I'm just nervous whether I'm
giving a talk or not although more
nervous when giving before giving I
think during a talk I don't feel nervous
anymore
that is true all the sort of anxiety
building up to it once you're kind of
there and if you couldn't remember that
maybe it'll help yes and and one one
thing story that I'll share just to
really make you feel better
the first talk that I did I realized
that I was so nervous that I was
clenching my butt cheeks to the point
where my left one started vibrating so
yes I get nervous it's amazing okay I
will go on to another question two of
these questions are kind of similar but
let me let me start with this one which
is so this is really since you know
Copeland is a conference for people
without a lot of experience in code code
newbies is a podcast that's really
accessible and friendly to beginners
what if you are a beginner with little
experience
what's it how can you give a Tech Talk
how can you present yourself with you
know just being a beginner yes yeah I
love that question one of the the things
that I've learned is again we we think
of speakers as experts but if we think
about them as storytellers I think that
makes things a lot easier one of the
most famous things well those popular
talks that I gave it a ton it to get
them that talk 15 times was about
reading code and it was the story of me
graduating from boot camp just getting
my first job and feeling like I really
know what I was doing and so as a tool
to help me learn I got a bunch of
friends together for one hour every
Sunday and I would read about a hundred
lines of code and we'd read it together
and we'd go through it and we'd have a
discussion and my 20 minute talk was
just about that it was about the process
of reading code as a tool for being a
better developer I thought the talk was
super boring to this day I hate the talk
I think it's like the worst talk ever
but people really liked it and they
not because reading code is a new idea
or because you know I have years of
experience but because I positioned it
as you know I started in this place I
was a beginner like a lot of you I
really wanted to become better and
become an expert here in the steps that
I took here are the things that kind of
went wrong along the way and people
really enjoyed the journey so I think if
you focus on what is a journey that I've
had right and journeys about stories are
about conflict so what's a problem with
something you solve what's something
you're excited about I think you'll
realize that you have a lot more to say
than maybe you think you do know great
people are telling me that my mic is
rustling little by the way this is like
a very new day here I have two
microphones and somebody wrote in the
chat like but now I'm commuting my
microphone when I'm not talking we'll
see if that helps
okay so I have two more questions what I
think it's a really interesting question
from oh and I forgot to say who asked
that previous question which was Tomas
bark which I'm sure but a Ben Jay habit
because you know you talk so much about
framing the talk as a story and in a way
like a personal story but what how do
you approach giving a talk if maybe the
work that you're presenting is from a
company or in something it's like sort
of comes from yourself it's may be
directed by others oh that's a good one
so I love hearing the the company side
of things because I'm always wondering
if you work for really tech a really big
tech company how did you do it you know
who did you have to work with how many
people were involved so even in that
context I think there's still a story
you know the story might be as simple as
why did you decide to implement that
feature what are some issues you had
along the way or the salespeople really
as bad as everyone thinks they are on
your team you know what are some of the
behind-the-scenes things that you can
share with us that take us again on that
journey with that conflict on how you
did stuff I love hearing those things I
remember a rails comp talk that upworthy
did in 2014 and I still remember it
and they talked about how they went I
think it was from a monolith to having a
bunch of micro-services I think and I
loved being able to hear how a company
that I really enjoy you use
using their website how they did that
how they broke it up and the problems
they had and the you know internal
conflicts they had amongst team members
and how they're able to eventually you
know untangle that we hear that problem
and that solution a lot of how do you go
from model with to micro services having
someone say well this is exactly how I
did it was awesome okay so I have one I
think we're gonna wrap it up soon
certainly if people I know there were
some more questions posted in the chat
hard for me to follow everything but I'm
sure if people have additional questions
you can ask them in the comments one two
this video is posted and also you could
probably at saranya bar for doing
laughing and uh there'll be a link to
that in this video's description as well
so I think this is a good kind of wrap
up question which I'm gonna rephrase it
but it came from Cody fueler which is so
I guess the question that I have I think
is how do you get how do you get like
let's say you want to give tech talks
and you want to speak at conferences how
do you get started how do you find
opportunities is there like a you
implied you network do you go to
conferences first like what what is that
process sure so a lot of the bigger tech
conferences will have a CFP we had a CFP
as well I think we had about 200
applications for our CFP for like 20 to
30 spots but a lot of conferences will
have CFPs
I highly encourage you to submit to them
it never hurts to yes you will be
nervous and terrified when you submit I
literally cried but the first time I was
I was typing it up I hit this into my
head and I'm just crying and my
husband's in the kitchen like why are
you probably like if I don't know thank
you do it so it's totally fine it's an
emotional thing it's cool that's one way
the other way is meetups meetups are
really really great place to get started
meetups are almost always looking like
actively looking for speakers to come in
and give a short lightning talk five
minutes ten minutes lightning talks are
a great way to kind of see how you feel
you know standing in front of people
when talking without a huge commitment
you know without a 20 40 minute
commitment so I think meetups are a
great way to do it
also if you're working at a tech company
in a tech role if your company does
brown bag lunches that's a great
opportunity to speak and if they don't
do brown bag lunches you should start
one and you should offer to coordinate
them and to you know give talks in the
office as well those are some really
good places
okay thank you everybody I know this is
a bit of a shorter livestream than my
usual ranting and raving for like three
and a half hours about some problem that
I can't debug but this is great I know
it's always awkward to like come and do
this like you're talking to a camera and
you know what's going on here and it's
hard to present in this context and this
was really great and I hope that people
take something from this so again I
would really recommend that you
subscribe to the code newbies podcast
and check out the code land conference
if you have follow-up questions you can
ask me on Twitter you can answer on
Twitter though but that stuff will be in
the video's description and again if
you're watching this live right now and
you missed it just check back I would
say tomorrow afternoon by then hopefully
we'll have thinking out of turn here but
sometime later this week sometime soon
we'll have an archived version of this
video available and perhaps even with
that archived version I'll edit out this
weird part now I feel like Roger behind
you and like like a button over here
because there's no other way to say
goodbye oh also I'll be back on Friday
let me just mention sorry I'll be back
on Friday for my usual coding tutorial
thing about the one thing that might
this different just check back up it'll
be on youtube or on Twitter it might do
the afternoon instead of the morning
based on my schedule so that's what's
coming up and see you later okay thanks
everybody
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
