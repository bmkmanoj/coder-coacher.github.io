strangest videos I've ever made
I've actually hated yet but I see into
the future
this but I found a strange bug issue in
p5 Jeff I just don't know what to do
about it at all so I'm kind of filing a
github video issue I will type an actual
github issue but this might be useful
for some of you wondering about open
source how it works where things are and
there's probably a lot of stuff I'm
gonna gloss over here but maybe you'll
find this useful we'll watch maybe you
won't but let me give you some
background here I was making a simple
p5.js sketch I am going to I'm doing
this in sublime with could the Chrome
browser all this sketch is doing is
creating a video element and what I
wanted to do was look at the pixels of
this video but the video by default the
video by default is 3 well we'll see in
a second is if I rerun this is coming in
from my web camera at 640 by 480 but I
want to shrink it down and I want those
pixels to be shrunk down so I call the
p5 size function and once I call the p5
size function it shrinks the video and
the pixels should also shrink so let me
show you what I mean in the chrome
console here I can say video dot load
pixels this is a function that would
then make the pixels available of that
video now so I've loaded the pixels now
if I were to look at the pixel array
where all the pixels are you'd think I
would have a an array that has this many
spots in it for every single color there
are 4 spots in the array red green blue
alpha the width of the video image now
is 320 the height is 240 so the total
number of pixels should be 320 x 240
times 4 which is this particular number
300 7200 however if I say video dot
pixels dot length I get this weird
number
well that's not what should have
happened hold on a second here everybody
just relax and by everybody I mean me I
think I might have messed something up
so I just need to very quickly make sure
I'm using the actual oh this video is
ruined
let's compare at skip at skip ahead I'm
gonna I'm gonna make sure I'm getting
the most recent I I was fussing with the
Dom library and I probably made it do
something it shouldn't have done so I'm
going to go and paste this in there then
I am going to refresh this and I'm gonna
do the same exact thing video pics
pixels length you can see that's of
course a zero because I haven't called
load pixels yet once I do that yes okay
so I had already futzed with the Dom
library begin trying to debug this but
now I'm using the actual current state
of the Dom library look at that
particular number right
remember we said it should be 320 x 240
times 4 which is that number what is
that number that number is 640 by 480
times 4 because even though I've resized
the video the pixels are still at the
original resolution which is not what I
want the p5 library to do why is this
happening so what I could do is actually
go in I'm actually this is actually
build p5 Dom library it's a ton of code
we could be here for like the next 4
hours going through all of it I happen
to know that buried deep in this code is
a place where when I call load pixels
this thing happens where it makes it
behind the scenes canvas and the canvas
is made with the video within the video
height I want that canvas to be made 320
by 240 now a long time ago I don't know
when I can look it up here I actually
posted a gif up issue so now I'm on
github I'm in the p5.js repository on
github and there was a particular issue
I posted called p5 media element size
and this is I'm
writing a description Lauren McCarthy
and I just talked about blah blah blah
blah blah and I noticed that there's a
problem where the canvas is being set to
video within video height where it
actually should get the Dom elements
width and height and this somehow like
fixes this problem and in fact we could
say oh thanks for catching this Lauren
this is the wrist of something tricky
with this lauren made a commit that
changes it we can actually look at this
commit right here whoops sorry right
here and I can pinpoint this is the
commit it used to be video with video
height and it used and that got changed
to width and height so let's go and make
that change in the actual code I'm gonna
go here right I could just check them
and change that to width change this to
with change this to height and I'm gonna
run my sketch again we can see what if I
call now video dot load pixels okay I
called that and now I say what's that
number what's that number
it works of that fixed it that line of
code for this particular thing that I'm
trying to do should be width and height
not video within video height which are
still 640 by 480 because they're
referring to the original video width
and video height now strangely enough
that commit if I go back to the browser
right that commit happened on January
15th what's today's date March something
boy that was March 29th what the date of
my watch here that's March 29th Tuesday
March 29th so I did some investigation
and I went through and strangely enough
I found another commit look at this this
commit is 26 days ago early in March
where this got changed back also by
Lauren McCarthy well why did this happen
so this is closing issue 1274 here's 12
74 somebody else keith o'hara posted an
issue they were running into problems
using get blah blah blah so for some
reason that changed caused another
problem then it got
verted forgetting that that would cause
some other problems so we're in this
like purple circular problem gun so what
do we do now I don't know the right
answer but I had spent I spent at least
two hours today
not two hours I spent a lot of time
because looking through digging through
trying to pinpoint the exact commits
where this has happened so I think live
on air by from the school for poetic
computation this sounds very grandiose
it's not grandiose I mean I'm just like
a person typing at a computer but I
would like to contribute to this
discussion and see if we can figure this
out so I don't know there's a couple
options here
I could reopen this issue that might
make the most sense this was the
original place where I was discussing
this and this is where this exact I'm
showing this exact change needs to
happen so this might make the most sense
I could just comment on this particular
commit there's a place here I could
comment on the commit I could also like
reopen this issue and say hey I think
this caused a problem with another issue
I don't know we're the right places and
by the way this is something that
happens when you're like trying to file
github issues you'll always feel like
you're doing it wrong and someone's
gonna yell at you and then this actually
happened because people sometimes aren't
they just start thinking and maybe
typing tone is lost or sometimes people
are just like not nice actually but I
want to say to you that p5.js is a place
where anybody in the world can post a
github issue and there's no way to do it
wrong so post away and if someone tells
you you did it wrong come and find me
because there's no way that was possible
but it's a welcoming place that anyone
should be able to try to participate in
this open source stuff so let me I don't
I'm also not entirely sure the best way
to do this but I'm gonna I'm gonna just
try reopening this particular issue so
one so one thing I'm going to do here is
type into this box here and you guys
could type with me or not type with me
I'm gonna think okay this particular fix
was changed back due to issue so now I
need to refer to this particular issue
which is number 12 74 12 74 you can see
how this commit which was this one which
has this commit one thing you can always
do is like see these like crazy numbers
that github makes these are like hash
numbers it's like a unique identifier
for that particular change so I could
copy that and I can put that into my
comment this changes and if I do a
single tick by the way that makes it
like code formatted changes video dot o
video dot with no no this start with so
hold on this is this Alt dot with back
to this dot ELT dot video with we seem
to be in an endless cycle of changing
this code back and forth can how do we
how do we best resolve both of these
issues so I think AHA and making a video
about this exact issue and when I upload
that video I will post a link here what
else would be helpful in this github
issue so just to be clear again the code
that makes this issue that resolves this
issue is so one thing you can do if
you're going to add code into a github
issue is you can do three ticks and then
if you want it syntax highlighted you
can write the language there JavaScript
and I need to grab this makes
this makes this work the code that
resolves the other issue was 1274 1274
is and then I can code looks like this
can we how can we resolve both what code
would resolve both okay so I think now
one thing I can do is I can hit preview
and you can see here I can reread this
get a little bigger this particular
fixed was changed back due to issue 1274
and no longer works maybe I should say
you can see how this commits this commit
how the commit let me let me fix this
this particular fix was reverted and the
pixels array length is does not match
the specified size anymore you can see
how the commit you can see how to commit
this changes this dot LT dot width back
to this that you'll see our video with
we've seen be an endless cycle changes
code back and forth how do we best
resolve both of these issues I'm making
a video about this this question I'm
making a video about this question and
when I upload that video I'll post a
link here just to be clear in color
resolves this issue the color is on this
which what code were resolved both
alright I think that's good enough I'm
gonna hit reopen and comment and see no
I'm afraid like I'm afraid someone's
gonna yell at me but no of course no
one's gonna yell at me because for the
whole world should be a welcoming place
but sometimes on github it can feel a
little intimidating or confusing I want
to say again p5
is an open community that welcomes
everybody whatever your level or
knowledge is there is no way to post a
github issue incorrectly and so we
should just give it a try and somebody
will will tell me if I if I there's a
better way I could have done it or
something like that I'm gonna press this
button and this concludes this
particular video I'm just going to check
by the way because I have a live chat
going this is a recording and see if
anybody is has any comments yep okay
nobody has any comments so I'm gonna hit
stop and this concludes this video see
if this follow-up
Welbeck will follow up in the comments
and the threads in the description if
this issue gets resolved</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
