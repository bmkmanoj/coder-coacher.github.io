about variables I hope if I could keep
my brain working and churning and making
sense with the language and the speaking
thing this will work okay so what did we
look at in the previous video we made
this kind of big leap in our programming
lives right we established the fact that
there is a flow to a program what is
that flow there well there's at least
four if p5.js which is the environment
that that I'm looking at in these videos
the flow is defined by two functions set
up function which happens once and only
once
draw function which loops over and over
again typically a thing that you might
do in setup is create your canvas that
happens just once when the program
starts typically what you might do in
draw which loops over never again is
draw stuff and we establish the fact
that if instead of using a number a
hard-coded number we put in a variable a
word that stands in for a number then
each time draw executes if that number
changes something different might happen
and that's how animation happens on the
screen the ellipse is drawn where the
mouse is then the mouse moves and strong
with the mouse's then the mouse moves so
this was an exciting first step into the
world of variables and but but here's
the thing there's going to be a lot more
that you want to do besides just move
things with the mouse and even if there
are there's other built-in variables
that you can you can know how many times
has draw executed there's a built-in
variable called frame count but
ultimately what you will need is your
own variables variables that you make up
that you define that you bring into this
world you're gonna bring variables into
this world and that's going to open up a
lot of possibilities that you didn't
have before so for example right this
circle is moving across the screen
according to the mouse what if you want
that circle like I'm not even touching
the mouse I'm anyone say that I just
opened my program and that circle just
moves on
magic right so this is our first step
this is what we want to do instead of
using a built-in variable we want I want
to use our own variables so how do we do
that so we need a couple steps step one
is to declare the variable I have to
declare I declare I do declare solemnly
on this day the third of September 2015
that I declare that this variable will
exist number two is we need to
initialize we need to say AHA in
addition to the fact that I declare this
variable I will give it an initial value
and then the third step is I guess this
it optionally used the variable although
it wouldn't make a lot of sense to
declare and initialize a variable if you
didn't intend to use it so how do we do
this declare is actually something quite
simple all you have to do is write the
term var var which stands for variable
this is how you do it in JavaScript
other languages it's different var so
this means I am now about to declare a
variable the next thing I have to do is
give that variable a name and that name
can be absolutely anything I choose
rainbow is a nice name for a variable
but ultimately what you want what you
want to do is you probably name it with
something that is a term that is
associated with what what you might
intend the variable to do so what I
intend to do with this variable that I'm
declaring is use it as the exposition of
this circle so I might say Circle X is
the name of my variable I'm just going
to use the word circle exit typically
I'm just kind of being long-winded I you
could even just name it X there's a
bunch of rules like you can't start a
variable name with a number and you
can't use strange characters in a
variable but you'll sort of figure that
out through trial and error mostly you
just want to use words in you can't have
any spaces so declare and name our
declare is saying var in the name so now
I could say
Circle X instead of Mouse X so ax ax
that to use so I've done step one and
I've done step three use the variable
but if you think about it I need a
semicolon here if you think about it
there's a huge missing piece here right
because if what's the value of circlex I
mean it could be anything it's right now
it's actually technically in JavaScript
the value is undefined I think I'm right
about that someone will correct me if
I'm wrong but it's undefined because I
never gave it an initial value this is
important it's not gonna be able to draw
circle X anywhere unless we give it an
initial value and so I could right here
and setup I could say circle x equals 50
so this is giving it initializing it and
look at this statement this is called
this is something totally new the only
thing if you've only been watching my
these videos and this is all your
favorite programming all we had were
function calls create canvas background
lives now we have something new this is
what's known as an assignment operation
we are assigning the value 50 to the
variable circle X and we would not have
been able to do this if we hadn't
declared our intention to use circle X
and notice our declaration is at the top
of our code and our initialization is in
setup the truth of the matter is even
though I showed you is these as two
separate steps I kind of showing this
too because it's kind of interesting
I've looked at something else that you
might do in setup the beginning of my
program I want to have this variable
value equal to some initial value but
the truth of the matter is most of the
time and in all the examples you're
going to see step one and two will be
combined and so I'm now going to rewrite
this chicken scratch sprawl is one line
of code so I can both declare and
initialize the variable instantly by
saying var circle x equals 50 okay
so we've done something we've declared a
variable saying var giving it a name
we've give an initial value we're using
it to stand in for something in our code
let's go take a look at this actually
work over here okay so here's a little
program if I run it you can see what
exactly what we have we have a ellipse
being drawn
only ever at location 50 so it doesn't
move so now let's add that stuff to our
program so at the top I'm going to save
our circle X and by the way you can
declare working to see later that you
can declare variables in other places
but for right now it's I think as a
constraint I would like to say like all
the variables they all get declared at
the top let's just use that as a
constraint right now then I'm going to
give it an initial value equal to 50 and
right here instead of saying ellipse 50
I'm going to say ellipse circle X and
I'm going to run it look at that same
exact program only instead of just
typing hard-coding 50 there I have 50s
up here okay now let's just prove that
this is actually working I'm going to
say 150 and stop and start it look that
circle is a little bit further now I'm
going to say 250 and look that circle is
even a little bit further over so
whatever the value of circlex is that's
where that ellipse will be drawn okay so
at the beginning of this video I don't
actually say this but the beginning of
this video in my mind was I would like
to make that circle move by itself
across the screen you're watching all
these videos and all you get is a little
circle that moves across the screen but
it'll lead hopefully to bigger and
better things how are we going to do
that so let's come back over here for a
second okay what I want to do is the
following
I want the circle first to be drawn at
circle x equals 50
so remember draw which is this function
is looping over and over again it's over
and over again it happens once it
happens another time it happens other
times so first I want to have draw it at
50 then maybe I want to draw it at 51
the next time maybe I want to draw it at
52 the next time when we be 153 right
each time draw loops execute it again
I want the circle to be drawn one pixel
over from the previous time so if I if
you had to write an instruction to do
that each time to draw what would you
say you might say increment circle X by
one you know circle at take one add one
to circle X you might say add five to
circle X and we'll move from zero to
five to ten to fifteen to twenty right
so how do we write that with code here
is a way remember we had an assignment
operation circle x equals 50 something
there's something weird you can do is
write it's not that like the most common
thing in programming but at first it
might seem a little weird circle x
equals circle X plus 1
now look at that state Adam for a moment
you might look at that and think that's
like a like a paradox that's impossible
like a number can't equal itself plus 1
5 does not equal 6 7 does not equal 8 20
design equal 21 but this is not what
we're doing I am NOT testing for
equality here this is an assignment
operation what I'm saying is take circle
X and set it equal to the value of
itself plus 1 so if Circle X is equal to
50 50 plus 1 equals 51 now assign that
value to circlex circlex is now 51 now
run through draw again take the value of
circlex 51 add 1 to it 52 assign that
value back to circle X so in an
assignment operation the right-hand side
of the equation is always evaluated and
then assigned to the left-hand side this
is an incrementation operation we're
just taking up variable and adding 1 to
it over and over
again because draw loops so let's go
over here and see first let's start
Circle X at zero so I just changed
circle X starting at zero and you can
see there it is at zero and now I'm
going to add that line of code circle x
equals circle X plus 1
ready circle x equals circle X plus one
every time through draw circle X will go
up by one yeah it's moving that okay so
that really worked so you know I know
this is like incredibly simplistic and
basic in terms of the result but this is
the foundation upon which you can build
lots of interesting things because
there's a lot more math there's a lot
more ways you can change a variable
besides just adding one to it there's a
lot more places you could put variables
besides just in the X spot so what I
would say to you right now is why don't
you try making a variable for the Y
position why don't you try making a
variable for the size of the circle can
you make the circle grow can you make it
shrink can you make a color change see
if you can like make up more variables
declare more variables at the top and
put them in different places and try to
do stuff to them the truth of the matter
is in order to get kind of more
interesting results you're going to need
something that I'm going to talk about
in a future video conditional logic
because you know here's the next logical
thing right that certainly first let's
let's make it go a little faster like
circa lexical circle X plus 10 like I
was that circle no no no go away come
back come back go back back back
it's never going to come back but if I
made some conditional logic like if it
gets to the end and turn around and come
back you know that's something I'm going
to do in a future video but for now just
try to add a bunch of variables and see
what you can get okay that's good and
but I'm going to there's going to be
another video in a moment where I'm
going to show you a different way of
organizing your variables I'm a little
skeptical about whether this is a good
idea or not what I'm going to do it ok
this was 12 minute video and I've done
recording it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
