video we're going to focus on a Gaussian
distribution of random numbers now why
is this something that matters to us
okay so we were looking at the random
Walker and that random Walker made its
little random movements all around the
around the window and we even began to
kind of take a little step with that and
say oh we could kind of adjust
probabilities instead of it having an
equal probability of going in any
direction in any moment we could say
it's going to be more likely to go to
the right or more likely to go up or
less likely to go down could start to
control could get control over the
randomness in our life right control
that's our goal here but really what are
one of the things that I want to say
that in the sort of section before we
get into the real motion and physics
stuff we're going to do in this video
series is eliminate eliminate randomness
from your life not forever but as an
exercise to yourself randomness might
have been a bit of a crutch to you maybe
maybe you just you learn how to draw
stuff and processing you learn how to
move things around the screen you said I
don't know it needs to be more dynamic
let's just make it all random random
colors random shapes for into positions
random speeds what we're doing here is
saying is there a more thoughtful
approach we can take how can we get
control over randomness so we can
control the distribution of random
numbers we get or how can we create
algorithms to generate numbers in such a
way that we have a more organic set of
random numbers Gaussian Perlin noise we
look at a way of customizing
distribution of random numbers of the
monte carlo scenario so we're gonna look
at a few different things just as kind
of again we're just getting started here
getting used to back into using
processing if you haven't for Ohio
before we get into the real motion stuff
so Gaussian distributions of random
numbers so before I started this video I
drew this little meerkat I only spent
about 45 minutes on it but I can't draw
so this I think is pretty good but um
the meerkats owner came up in a previous
video let's say we're trying to make a
population of meerkats that's our
simulation and we need Heights for them
so we said float H equals random 100
comma 200 I'm picking a random number
between 100 and 200 that's going to be
my height well what's going to happen I
actually have an example here
that I want to run and what this example
is doing is it's picking a random number
associated with an x position on the
screen and every time it picks it the
the rectangle starts growing up and you
can find this example it's introduction
on example number two random
distribution so these numbers are go up
these these these bars are going up and
up you can see we have an even
distribution of random numbers there's
randomness built in there but we're
getting this if we think about this now
in terms in terms of the meerkat that
means if we were to graph all of the
meerkats heights from 100 to 200 if we
picked random numbers a perfect random
number generator over an infinite amount
of time we'd get this graph but this as
we stated before it's perhaps not how it
is in nature or art there are a problem
actually I don't know again I don't know
anything about meerkats but if you look
at human beings there's you know most
people are about the same average height
and there's some people that are taller
some people are shorter very people that
are really tall very few people that are
really short there is a normal
distribution of heights that word normal
also we use the word Gaussian for the
mathematician this is a distribution of
random numbers that we find often in
nature or in testing apparently the bell
curve you might have heard it up there
will be this one this will be on the
test there will be no test should there
be a test maybe there should be a test I
don't know why I drew that as dotted
lines so this is what that graph looks
like we want a lot of meerkats that have
a height around the average otherwise
known as the mean and then very few
outliers but some they're still always a
chance so how do we rewrite this code
well one thing we have to do is we have
to at the top of our code import a class
and actually we might add Gaussian
random numbers into processing which
just which I think would make sense but
for right now you have to import this
random class it comes from Java once you
import that class you can declare a
random object I'm going to call it a
generator Jen for short a random number
generator and it would as with any
object we've got to initialize it as a
new random a new object this generator
is now responsible for our random
numbers so instead of like float H give
us a random number we could say float H
equals gen dot next Gaussian now let's
actually put this into it let's make a
little simple sketch for ourselves let's
put this in and see how far we get
okay now I'm going to make a new
processing sketch this is fun live
typing and we're going to import
java.util random this laptop is on a
pile of books it's very unstable I need
a laptop stand okay and we're going to
declare a random generator and make a
window size oh boy this is very hard to
type I'm going to have to fix this setup
and here we go background 255 so I don't
know let's pick let's see let's say
float H equals generator dot next
Gaussian and I don't know what's just to
see what this does
let's tie this to the size of a circle
that we'll put in the middle of the
window ah I know say this is something
somewhere okay I don't have a system for
this yet
Gaussian test sorry okay so this is
maybe I'm standing in front of it the
whole time I I knew I was forgetting
something oh this is terrible this video
was going so well I thought but okay so
I'm just gonna move this over fancy or
fancy system failed us okay so you can
see I typed into a basic stuff now this
gives me I like when I lean against the
wall Hall here gives me this like chill
scratch like nails on chalkboard okay
can get that out of my system okay so ah
so this didn't work cannot convert from
double to float so this is a little bit
of an unfortunate thing which is that
the Java class gives us a double instead
of a float so I'm just going to convert
this to a float really quickly and then
run this and it says ah it doesn't want
to do that for a double because
processing does
really have anything to do with doubles
so okay here we go so I'm just going to
change that to the casting syntax and
now we've got it okay oh I see a little
dot up there so what did we get is that
a normal distribution they're all seen
the same it's the same it's drawing it
over and over again is it random is it
not random hmm what's going on okay so
the thing that we have to understand is
what are the numbers that come out of
this function well we did I got a shoot
I'm over here
the thing we gotta remember is what are
the numbers that come out of this
function okay so here we gave ourselves
a range between 100 and 200 we didn't
give a range here what this does is it
gives us a Gaussian random number with a
mean equal to zero and a standard
deviation equal to one now mean we may
perhaps we understand already mean is
the average right this is that that
Center maybe we want our average to be
150 that's our average height that we
want but what a standard deviation mean
now we could go through some formulas
and we could look at how we calculate
standard deviation standard deviation we
take all of the heights we we get the
difference of the height from the
average we square those we take the
average of all the squares then we take
the square root of that and and that's
our standard deviation bla bla bla so
but why I'm going to give you some
resources to done you if you go look in
the nature of code introduction chapter
it goes through how to actually
calculate the standard deviation but for
us right now what I want to just get
sort of the feeling of standard
deviation because we can just kind of
play with it in our code and see what
kind of results we get so what is the
feelings first
what does standard deviation feel like
to you here's what it feels like to me
let's draw that bell curve a number of
different ways I don't know that's
probably pretty good we can see this
graph has a very small standard
deviation because just about everything
clusters around the mean and nothing
varies from the mean very much these the
lot of elements vary from the mean a lot
of elements vary from the mean a lot
about more
it's very from the mean when you have a
large standard deviation you have a lot
of tall and short meerkats when you have
a tiny standard deviation you don't have
very many tall short ones you just got a
lot of average ones so we can use this
number to play around with how how much
we're spreading out from that mean how
random are we really getting how much
more are we clustering around that mean
so how do we adjust for that well if so
okay so if this gives us a mean and
standard deviation of one we can always
adjust by saying h equals h plus what we
want our mean to be right so we can only
say if the mean is zero but we want
everything to cluster around 150 we
could just add 150 to every single
element now if we want to spread or
shrink this standard deviation spread it
out a shrink it what we should do before
that is we should multiply by our own
I'm going to make a variable called
stdev standard deviation so once we get
this Gaussian random number out of
processing with a mean of zero and a
standard deviation of one first we
stretch it or compress it by adjusting
the standard deviation by multiplying
and then we shift the whole graph over
by adding the mean to it if this is
confusing to you which maybe it is you
can think of it this in steps so let's
look at this this sort of gotten this is
zero and maybe maybe it gave us this so
first what we do is we take this is our
get Gaussian random numbers first thing
we do is multiply let's say our standard
deviation is two and our average is 100
so first we multiply every number here
by two and what we get is a slightly
wider graph we just multiplied it so
this number this is it just pulls out
because everything is multiplied by two
then what we do is we add 100 to it so
adding a hundred to every number we just
shifted it over I kind of widened it as
well so that the average is around 100
so this is the process we can get that
Gaussian random number out stretch it
move it adjust the standard deviation
adjust the mean let's go take a look at
this now in our example if I walk back
here
I can say H equals it equals H times I'm
have a standard deviation 210 and I can
say H equals H plus 100 so the mean is
100 and we can see here we're getting
some random height random sizes but this
is very different than just random is
you can see they're kind of clustering
around one value just up just to pull up
another example of this which I want to
grab from the introduction here so this
example is of course AK forgot to have
the import statement in here this
example is picking a X location with
every frame and you can see it's then
layering those over top of each other
and it gets darker and darker around the
center but you see the outliers there
all do get picked every once in a while
and if we look at this we go into the
code I can't use this computer today we
can see that here we have a mean of the
middle of the screen and standard
deviation of 60 so if I were to change
that standard deviation to 120 we now
see we're getting we're getting more and
more outliers getting pics if I change
that standard deviation to 10 then
everything's really getting picked right
around the center so you know that could
be a variable it could stretch shrink
there's lots that you could do with that
so so I think we're wrapping this up
this is actually a 12-minute video which
is a little bit longer than I imagined
but this is a bit of a tool and you can
try to think about so where could you
apply this for one maybe think about
making a design for a face and use
Gaussian distributions to design all
those elements so that's the nose the
size the position how could you make
random faces but all kind of appear
within this or with a Gaussian
distribution of values another thing you
might look is at the random at the
random Walker is there a way you could
use a Gaussian distribution of random
numbers to pick how a random Walker
moves around the screen and what would
that sort of visual result look like so
try to have try to look for something
where you used random in your code and
instead of using random use Gaussian
maybe another thing that just occurred
to me is you could think of if I were to
splatter paint here onto the wall would
most of the paint spots splatter in the
center and then there'd be some outliers
could you
Gaussian random numbers for that and
that didn't just occur to me I thought
of that beforehand but anyway it
occurred to me now to think of it to say
that okay so this video was a bit longer
than I'd hoped and it was not nearly as
good as I'd hoped but I'm just making
them and someday I'm going to remake
these and maybe you're going to email me
and tell me you should really remake it
okay I'm going to press a button and
it's going to stop now okay here we go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
