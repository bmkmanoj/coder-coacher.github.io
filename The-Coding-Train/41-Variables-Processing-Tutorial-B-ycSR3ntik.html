already but yet so little we have so
much more to go but today is a moment a
big moment if you were waiting to do
something real to really sink your teeth
into programming this is the moment
we're really going to do that we are
going to talk about in this video
variables now why do we need a variable
well first where are we so far even
we've we've kind of got the idea we can
write these functions issue these
commands to draw stuff to the screen
based on numbers we now understand that
there's a flow where the program begins
then it runs and loops over time we also
understand that we can vary what we draw
each time right we could say hey draw
something at the mouse location but is
this really what we want to do let's
give ourselves a new goal if you thought
we were gonna have an exciting goal and
in many ways perhaps it is but okay so
let's take a look for a second this is
ultimately I'm gonna run this little
application that was made in processing
take a look at this beautiful processing
sketch so nice and just cute it's simple
and fun and well whatever I don't know
what I'm saying okay so here we go uh
what's happening there's a white circle
and it did bouncing around the screen
this is our goal now now the first thing
we should notice about this is I'm not
moving the mouse right I don't have the
mouse here trying to like move it around
it is moving autonomously but we know we
need to vary where we draw it each frame
draw it here draw it there draw it here
draw it there draw it here draw it there
right draw it this X Y then this X Y
then this X Y we need some mechanism for
dynamically storing for storing the
dynamic value which is its location this
is a variable mouse X is a variable it's
a a word a name that stands for the X
location of the mouse now we need a new
variable Circle X we'll call it that
stands for the current location of this
circle but if I go into a processing
sketch and this isn't this is not the
code for that bouncing ball but this is
the code we're going to start with right
we have this we have this catch
that all it does is draw a circle at 0
comma 180 over and over again what if I
go and type in right if I go and type in
Mouse X this is where we've been right
no problem now it's where the mouse is
uh-huh if I go and type in circle X
first of all doesn't turn pink
processing is no idea what circle X is
and if I run it it says at the bottom
can't find anything can't cannot find
anything named circle X this saddest
error message ever to happen in our life
processing the caitiff doesn't know it
needs our help it needs us to say this
is what circle X is this is where how
I'm going to use it go and be happy and
draw your circles at circle X so that's
really we're going to go what is a
variable a variable is okay technically
speaking a variable is like a computer
has this thing called RAM this is going
to be my brilliant drawing of the
computer's RAM RAM stands for a random
access memory it's the memory of the
computer you some you might think of it
as the brain of the computer though
that's quite flawed in many ways but
it's a place where information is stored
somewhere in the computer's memory is
the value of Mouse X right the computer
is always storing where the mouse
currently is because lots of programs
need access to that what we want to do
is create our own variable Mouse X is a
built-in variable we can think of this
as a built-in oh I'm totally off see I
need a new I need a new a piece of tape
to show me where I can draw but mouse X
is known as a built-in variable meaning
processing just knows what it is almost
magically of course that was implemented
by somebody what we need now is a
pointer to some place in the computer's
memory that we're going to call circle X
that we're going to store some value and
what is this we're going to call this a
user-defined variable so we learned
about built-in variables
from the timer run but a few minutes so
far and now we want to talk about user
defined variables we are going to make
up our own variable and if we can make
up one variable that means we could make
up a thousand variables 10,000 variables
we can start to create enormous Li
complex programs that are storing vast
amounts of information for tons of
things but we're going to start with one
variable for one circle's location okay
so whenever we're going to use a
user-defined variable in our program
again why to store information we talk
about this data of a program locations
of things colors of things a score level
all sorts of stuff we need to do this in
three steps where am I going to do this
the first step we'll just do this over
here we're going to say is we have to
declare the variable do you see that yes
you can declare that our intention is to
have a variable the second step is to
initialize the variable meaning we're
going to have a variable and this is
going to be its first value the value
that it's holding on to that it's
storing when the program begins and the
third step use the variable now
technically speaking I would suggest I
would argue that this third step is
optional I mean it's all optional none
of us have to do any of this if we don't
want to or don't need to in our lives
but certainly if we've decided we've
made the choice that we're going to
declare a variable to initialize it it
would make sense to use that variable
it's kind of like if a variable is
declared and initialized in the forest
but is it used does it make a pixel on
the screen I don't know where that's
going but um but but but but certainly
we cannot use a variable without having
to clared it and there are some cases
where you know well let's not get
let's just I you so sometimes I would
like to just sort of start over but I
just I'm on a mission which is to just
record no matter what these these these
lessons so um you know also there are
some penises where we don't have to
initialize the variable maybe it just
gets a default value by accident but I
think it's very good practice if we're
going to say we're going to use a
variable to always know and declare and
initialize exactly what that first
values going to be okay so these are our
three steps we're doing this very slowly
right we know we want eventually to be
able to do something like this to draw
our ellipse at Circle X draw our lips at
Circle X and Circle X is our variable
this is in a way step three this is
using the variable but we missed the two
most more the two important steps we
need if we're using the variable we must
declare and initialize okay so how do we
let start with declare how do we declare
a variable well we say we've written
Proclamation this is our variable we
have to give it two things we have to
give it a type and the name followed by
a semicolon so this is the syntax for
declaring a variable a type followed by
a name now what is this thing we're
saying is a type we mean by that data
type now some languages and in fact this
is perhaps one thing about writing and
processing which is Java which makes
getting started a little bit harder is
that it is a strictly typed language
meaning when you're say you're going to
use a variable I need to say I'm going
to use a variable of this type meaning a
number a bunch extra-- you know but
we're a string of characters
all sorts of possibilities a lot of
languages allow you to just say here's a
variable put the stuff in it you know
you don't need to know what type it is
you'll know what type it is when I give
you the value it'll be of this type but
we have a strictly typed language we
need to always declare the type what are
some possible types int is a possible
type meaning integer or a whole number
like negative 3 0
14200
91 etc that is a possible type float is
a possible type meaning a decimal number
a floating-point number a decimal number
something like 2 point 3 so 9 3 1 7
that's a great that's a lovely one of my
favorite floats a negative zero point 1
1 1 1 1 3 right these are all possible
floats and you know what there's a lot
of other data types too there's car for
a character byte which is a value
between 0 and 255 I could keep going but
we don't really need to worry ourselves
with all the possible types you could
look them up in the processing reference
we're going to start just by thinking of
two possibilities int or float this will
kind of get us get us going I mean the
truth of the matter is when we're
beginning in this beginning process of
learning to program graphics and
processing all we really need is float
and we'll see that in a moment but for
now let's think about in tinfoil and
let's start with integer so type the
type of our variable int and now we need
an e so what is that name that name can
be absolutely anything your heart
desires
striped kitty cat that's the name of my
variable a Cleopatra that's the name of
my variable a blueberry pancakes that's
agree with my variable you see everybody
can be anything you want but most of the
time you want a variable name that that
works with what it is you're using it
for so we know our intention is to
create this variable that's going to be
used to store the X location of our
circle so we're going to pick the
variable name circle X we might have
picked just the name X there are very
few rules in terms of what names you can
and cannot use you must start your
variable names can have letters and
numbers in them but you cannot start
with a number other things are the
convention is to always have your
variable name be lowercase and the other
thing you probably want to do is avoid
using words that are obviously key
words for other things in processing
like perhaps you don't want your
variable name to be set up or draw or
Mouse X for example because those are
reserved essentially for other things in
processing but circle X is a perfectly
lovely variable name makes us very happy
and it's not too long to type it says
what it's doing it's an integer or in
good shape so now we can walk over to
our program and we need to figure out
where do we where do we put this
variable declaration well the answer
that question right now at this moment
for us is going to be at the top of our
program so the true the truth is we're
going to see as we create more and more
complex programs variable declarations
can happen in all sorts of places but
for now we're going to say hey all the
variables we intend to use they all
become they all are they're all declared
at the top of the program I list of my
variables circle X circle Y circle with
circle height circle speed all these
things that I might start using to store
the data of how this circle is going to
move and be drawn they would all be up
here at the top ok so that is step one
step two is initialize the variable we
need to give that variable an initial
value this by the way is a new kind of
line of code we something I didn't
really mention I really feel like today
I'm totally just talking to myself
it was check this is recording but um
something like that that you might have
noticed is that we've been writing lines
of code all of our lines of code have
actually been function have been
function calls this is a kind of line of
code that we have been writing a line
150 200 100 right this is a function
call function named argument semicolon
we are about to learn about a new kind
of line of code that we can write so far
all of our programs have only had
function calls sighs background line
fill stroke we are going to write a line
of code
known as an assignment operation an
assignment operation is something equals
something semicolon we are going to
assign the value of something to some
other values and that's what we do when
we initialize a variable circle x equals
50 we are assigning the value of circlex
we are assigning v we are we are setting
circle x equal to 50 we are assigning I
did try to have trouble trouble use like
the word assign in the sentence here I'm
sure like you could just Baz many more
like here's what it is but we are
assigning circle X's value to 50 okay so
um this may seem like so obvious but
it's move important to realize that
we're not we're not sort of asking like
is Circle X equal to 50 we're not
calculating something circles we're just
saying whatever is over here store that
value in 50 and in fact we could have
done we can do in assignment operations
mathematical calculations here so I
could say 50 plus 5 times 2 right now
why would I do that
I would have just written 60 if I wanted
to do that but we're going to start to
see sometimes you might want to have an
assignment operation with a more complex
thought okay but I digress a little bit
as I am have to do here and we are now
this is our initialization we are
writing an assignment operation the
circle X is set to the value 50 so let's
go look at where we want to write that
line of code in our program okay we want
circle X to begin its life with the
value 50 look at their flow of our
program we have a declared variable
setup happens once draw happens over and
over again we want to initialize circle
X's value in setup that's where we'll
give it its first value circle x equals
50 we run this program oh my goodness
this is super amazing and wonderful we
have a user-defined variable we declared
it we gave it a type we gave it initial
value now we're using it in the circle
is that the value 50 this is going to
open up huge amount of possibilities
this is fantastic okay a bit oh that's
probably making weird
to the microphone okay so a bit but
again any questions when I do this live
you can ask a question okay so um I want
to mention there's a few things we need
to mention here number one is look ah
look these were we we separated these
two steps we declared this variable in
seta at the top of our program we
initialized it in setup and as we see
we're using the variable right where we
said ellipse circle X comma etc we're
doing that in draw so this is sort of
like a really nice simple scenario it's
it's as simple as it gets
declare the variable give an initial
value draw something at that value but
the truth of the matter is these how
these things are happening is going to
be a lot more flexible as we look at
more complex examples now let me say a
couple things here one is one thing I'll
say is it you know this these first two
steps can in most cases be combined into
one line of code right I don't need to
say int circle X and then circle X
equals 50 I can write this all out as so
steps one and two combined this is what
you're going to find you're doing a lot
is int a circle x equals 50 right so
this is just doing all of that in one
step declaring that have a variable
named circle X of type int and its
initial value is 50 great now so now
we've seen that that's one thing I
wanted that was that's one thing that I
wanted to say okay so let's uh we can
change that in that your the thing is
though you can do that I kind of like it
this way because you know I'm the anal
retentive processing programmer
apparently but there are some scenarios
where you want to do something more with
your code that's happening in setup and
you need to actually initialize the
value separately from declaring this
obviously is not that case okay so where
are we on somebody again will please
I load this and edit I think you
probably take three or four minutes out
of this video where I lose my train of
thought but okay where are we doing we
want to have that circle move that's
what we're going to look at in the next
video we are going to take this circle
and start to move it start to assign new
values to it and draw we're going to
look at how we can use random to do all
sorts of other things we're going to
start to see what happens when we
manipulate the value of variable in draw
so what I would suggest to you as a
little exercise I mean this was kind of
a long explanation just of the basics of
what a variable is and setting it up go
to your program make set yourself up
with a simple sketch a sketch that has
you know one or two shapes and think of
what the parameters of that shape is its
location its size its color and see if
you can start to declare some variables
make two or three variables at the top
of your program set the initialize those
variables use those variables when you
draw those shapes and run it make sure
you have no syntax errors see if you get
used to that now we didn't do floats we
didn't actually look at we can have a
variable event of type color which if
you look through the processing examples
you'll see some of that so that's
something I should probably fill in in a
video at some point but in the next
video we're going to start to see a bit
more about manipulating the values of
variables in draw by moving that circle
and also by using random okay thanks and
I'm going to stop this now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
