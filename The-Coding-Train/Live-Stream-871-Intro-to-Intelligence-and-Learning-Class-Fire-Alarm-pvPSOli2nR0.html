New York City at New York University I'm
a little bit concerned about the audio
today because when I was trying to
monitor it there was a little bit of a
glitch but I'm seeing lots of green bars
move up and down as they're supposed to
so please as soon as you see me and hear
me and there's no audio problem let me
know in the chat really tired today so
um what's happening this is my name is
Dan this is the coding train it is a
weekly live stream on YouTube where I do
a variety of different things from that
range from showing projects that other
people have made having guests doing
tutorials coding challenges on various
other things everything's good and so I
have a big project that's coming up and
i think i may have improperly mislead
people that I was really getting started
with this project today and I'm just a
little bit behind or I was kind of wrong
about the dates but let me let me pull
up let me let me talk about what I want
to talk about here so I'm teaching a
class called intelligence and learning
it is part two of a course that just
finished up which was about physics and
animation and this class is you know
ostensibly about machine learning but
I've been thinking about this a lot
reading a lot of stuff we come over here
for a second okay so there is the term
artificial item of intelligence that's a
term there was the term machine learning
and then there is also the term deep
learning okay maybe that artificial
maybe there's something
this I don't know that may be right I
feel like I was either watching a video
or reading somebody's paper for they
heard making a similar diagram know who
to credit this from but I probably got
it wrong anyway but so one of the things
that I want to do in this course is not
simply focus on any one of these
particular topics this is not a deep
learning course which is only about you
know say tensorflow and deep neural
networks and deep deeper and deeper and
deeper neural networks this is not a
course just about machine learning this
is not of course just about artificial
intelligence for me this is part two of
the nature of code and the central theme
of the nature of code is looking at the
beauty and wonder of things in the
natural world and creating pieces
writing code that emulates those things
for art interaction you know etc fill in
the blank and so I want it for this
course I want to continue as that thread
and in many ways I'm not so concerned
with accuracy and I'm more you know my
goal in this course is not to create a
to teach how to make a self-driving car
that works perfectly but to a way of
creating software agents that have the
appearance the illusion perhaps of
having intelligence of making decisions
so there's a lot a lot that goes with
that so I don't know it's going to sew
all most like the illusion it's very
similar to the approach that I take with
Craig Reynolds steering behaviors which
is this idea of creating agents that
appear lifelike and improvisational and
so if we can give these things we
program and move around the screen a
brain to make decisions they can make
smart decisions they can make not so
smart decisions they can make random
decisions what is a wide range of
possibilities so this is the central
theme of the course I'm hanging up right
now because my plan was real
starts next week and I think I said I
said next week last week because nyu has
a spring break this week and so my
course doesn't actually start this week
in my mind it was next week but there's
a pretty good between so I got a little
confused then there was this big
snowstorm and I know everything and I
got all this you know everything is gone
haywire in my brain and in my schedule
in my time but this is what I'm thinking
about now what could be a first step to
this I'm just jumping right in know how
I always spent all this time doing on
this introductory stuff I'm actually on
a little bit of a tighter schedule today
and i only have until like 12 or 1230
this is a shorter shorter session
although I think I've set myself up like
I've sent wrong expectations my plan was
always like this is one or two hours
every week now suddenly I do these like
three hours then come back for like last
week I had live street I live stream for
five and a half hours on Friday this is
not sustainable much just as much fun as
I have doing that so anyway today's
gonna be a little bit shorter there's a
possibility that i'll have a bonus some
bonus time but but anyway I'm here right
now so this is this is the sort of
central topic now what could be a place
I'm coming over here what could be a
place to start so here's what everyone
is requesting and asking for always from
in in messages I get everybody seems to
be the most interested in this topic
neural networks I hope I mean I think
what why is that well number one is
there has been an explosion in the last
few you okay I'm not even kidding you
right now can you guys hear that hold on
that's the fire alarms going off I'm
gonna have to leave by the way I gotta
get my phone
I don't know if I should just leave this
streaming and like leave the mic on for
as long i agree i can stream from my
phone can you guys hear that okay you
probably can hear that now and in the
hallway Shh alright alright guys I
cannot believe this but I I'm gonna have
to just turn this off I don't think I
should leave the streaming computer on
and so i guess i will be back at some
point later today I'm gonna it keeps
like stopping but it's going i'm gonna
turn off my I assume it so what time's
it 1115 it's probably a fire drill but
anyway I'm turning off my mic maybe I'll
live stream from my phone or I'll come
back at some point later today I'll
follow me on twitter i got to stop
talking follow me on twitter at
Schiffman ok goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
