probably watched some videos about
variables and some videos about
conditional statements and in this video
we are going to somehow combine those
two in an interesting new way and we're
going to look at what it means to have a
variable of type boolean right what is a
variable the variable is a type like an
integer it is a name like we might make
up the name X so we might give it an
initial value so this is a totally
reasonable variable the integer X that
you can't exactly see clever too I would
imagine X equals 100 let's this is crazy
I'm totally out of sync here but let's
make a variable now it has a type
boolean boolean going equals false this
is the type of the variable is not a
number it is not a string it is not
other types of variables that you may or
may not have learned about it is a
boolean that means it only has one
possible two possible values true or
false you can use an integer in many
ways and have the integer be either 0
for false or 1 for true but there are
many other numbers of that that piece of
data could be in this case the piece of
data can only be false or true and if
you remember a conditional statement is
an expression if some expression
evaluates to true execute some code
guess what the boolean variable
evaluates to true or false right this
boolean going is false so if going that
means it's not we're not going to
execute this code because going is false
but if I change it's not either true
then this code will become executed so
let's look at a way that we might use
this in an example here is a very simple
example it has a circle moving across
the screen size background an ellipse
Tron at X x equals x plus 2 what if I
don't want this circle to start until I
click the mouse well you might think I
would do something like ah
if mousepressed and run this and now the
circle is not moving if I click the
mouse it's moving if I let go the mouse
it stopped but what if I want just the
event of clicking the mouse to trigger
the circle to move from now and forever
going forward so to do that what if I
made up my own variable like going and
we say boolean going equals false gonna
run this code it's not moving now if I
change the value of going to true it's
moving because going is true so this
code is being executed so now all we
need to do is change the value of going
from false to true the moment that I
want the circle start moving when I
click the mouse so in this case right
here let's start with going as false and
then when in mousepressed this is an
event that's triggered as soon as the
user clicks the mouse let's set going
equal to true it bothers me that you
can't see all the code here so I'm just
gonna make this fit here now we can see
okay going is false so it's so we run it
it's not moving it's not moving because
going is false but now when I click the
mouse going becomes true and it moves I
would stop it click the mouse up no
matter what whenever I click the mouse
now going is true what if I want going
to become false here's a neat little
trick ok we have time for this I think
it's time you have time for the type
somewhere I have to be but I'm making
this video anyway okay so in
mousepressed we are saying going equals
true but what if I want going to only
become true if it wasn't true and if
going was already true I want going to
now be false in other words I want to
say if going then going equals false
right if going is true set going equal
to false otherwise set going you
cool - true so if going is true set
equal to false otherwise if it was false
set it equal to true let's go implement
that ok so I'm down here and I'm going
to implement this if going and by the
way you could I could have written it
like this if going equals true if going
is equal to true but that's really
long-winded going is just true or false
and a boolean expression evaluates to
true or false so I can really just say
instead if if going is equal to true I
can just say if going either way if
going equals false is the same as saying
if not going that exclamation point is
not if not going my font your body a
little bigger here hopefully could read
this ok so remember it going if it's
going then going should be false
otherwise let's say going is true let's
run this now right so going is false
right now so when I click the mouse is
going true it's not so otherwise set
going the true now if I click the mouse
again going is true go ahead and set to
false what what a magical thing that
just happened ready okay start stop
start stop it's going to leave the
screen okay but if you thought this was
all there's one more piece of this this
the vine and good and perfectly
reasonable is rather long-winded right
we as programmers sometimes our whole
life is just about trying to make things
shorter although that's not really any
point to that you might as well just
make things along it's good for things
to be clear readable but anyway if we
want to make that shorter let's examine
this statement going equals not going
this seems like it must be some sort of
illegal code that you couldn't possibly
write in the self referential and
circular in some way that's not going to
work but in fact this is exactly what we
want in this particular case let's think
about this again let's say x equals y
plus Z if we have a statement like this
remember we evaluate this side of the
equation
and store the result over here so this
frame is the same thing here we're going
to evaluate this side of the equation
and store the result here it's kind of
like how we when you say x equals x plus
1 this seems a little strange it equals
itself plus 1 but it's no big deal
if it were 5 5 plus 1 is 6 so now I
equals 6 this is an operation that
increments x over and over again 5
becomes 6 becomes 7 talking way too fast
in this video but here let's say going
is true what is not true not true is
false let's say going is false what is
not false true so going equals itself
not itself just takes the value of going
is if it's true and turns it into false
if it's false and turns it into true
this might give you a little bit of a
headache but I think as you start to
think about it and write it down and
think about it again it will start to
make more and more sense so let's go
back over here and let's look at what we
can write here now going equals not
going going is currently false so as
soon as I click the mouse going is going
to equal not false which is true and
then I click the mouse again going is
going to equal not true which is false
so this is just a little bit of an
inkling of what it means to use a
variable who's that
with a type of boolean it's just a
little bit of a helper if you can store
it's kind of like we can store the value
of a switch in our program we can always
know is that switch on or is that switch
off and at any point we could act upon
that if the switch is on do this code if
it's off do this other code and we can
also change the value of that switch by
turning it on setting it to true or
turning it off setting to false usually
at the end of these videos that
occasionally gives some sort of exercise
you can pick one right now but why don't
they do what you might do is go and find
some program that you wrote and see
where you might store a value of true or
false and act upon that that could be
something that you could do I'll think
of something better later but we put it
in the notes ok I'm going to stop this
video and you're going to enjoy the rest
of your day come over
here and I'm going now my going is true
