a lot and really excited to talk to you
about this today is community projects
what does it mean for people watching
videos on YouTube learning about code to
collaborate together on a project so I
have two community projects and I also
and that I want to talk about so the
first one I want to talk about relates
to processing day I've mentioned this
before processing day is an event that's
happening October 21st at the MIT Media
Lab it is a day to celebrate the
community that develops and make stuff
with processing and p5.js
and related things you can see all the
people who will be presenting and
talking I especially want to encourage
you to submit a if you're coming to
submit a lightning talk to present a
short demo at processing day but one of
the things that I've been I am planning
to do something live so the thing that I
have thought about him thank you to to
you and for suggesting this the
organizer of processing Community Day is
to make an algorithmic design for name
cards so anybody who signed up to attend
will get a name card and one of the
ideas was to put names and on a cloud so
if I go to github.com slash coding train
and I might be able do a walk-through
later of this and I go to community
clouds and thank you to me I am so me me
I am so me is helping me now to maintain
a lot of the github and code related
stuff for the coding train Channel and
me I am so me created this really nice
system to submit your cloud idea so the
idea is that can take this as your
inspiration how would you design a
generative cloud in p5.js
so ultimately I'm probably port the code
to processing to generate the SVG files
and these are going to be printed with
thin black lines so this is not about
making a colorful image but rather an
algorithmic outline and the names will
actually be written in calligraphy so so
if you are interested in this take a
look at this repository I'm gonna click
here on it it this repository controls a
github pages site and the what you can
do is you can submit your cloud you can
either work on somebody else's cloud
idea or you can in to submit one by
writing a function and naming it and it
will turn up in this menu so me I am sue
me invented this wonderful system that
I'm excited about to use for future
collaborative projects and if I just
show you really quickly if we look at
this code here generators j/s all you
need to do is go to this file and write
your own functions so you can see this
function draws a rectangle oh and then
look at this it's even so sophisticated
that you can then return some values
that about where to draw the text but
that's an extra fancy feature I love
that feature but really you just need to
write your own code here write a
function you know I you know maybe you
want to try using Perlin noise so you
write a function called Perlin noise
cloud you register it and you register
it with a name and the author and then
you call this register if you add this
register function you submit as a pull
request and it will appear as one of the
cloud options so everybody maybe I
should do a cloud as the coding
challenge but that's what I'm going to
do it process the community day so so
that's one thing I wanted to mention all
you need to do is have a github account
and hit this edit button now I'm not
signed in so saying it must be signed in
and of course you know if you're
wondering what's get what's github how
could I possibly do this you can watch
my video tutorials about that
topher is asking what and the name is
what drives the cloud shape so this is a
good question I'm I have to figure we
have to figure this out I think the idea
if I'm really thinking about it is just
a system that generates a different
cloud every time you run the code and
the cloud has enough space for somebody
to hand write a name in it so you can
think of it as like there's a bunch of
hello my name is sticker name tags that
have a nice little generative cloud
printed on them and you write your name
inside the cloud it might be something
slightly different than that but that's
a good way of thinking about what it is
I'm asking for people to create and
so on the one hand this is a
collaborative processor maybe have a
community designed cloud but you can
also sort of submit your own design and
you know obviously if we try to make
figure out some appropriate way to give
credit to those who have submitted code
in the actual cloud design and if I do
it as a live tutorial I can maybe give
credit during that tutorial so please
let me know ok the other community
project that you can contribute to is
and thank you all so again to me I am so
me for making this repository is the
twelve O'Clock s-- repository so twelve
O'Clock s-- is a artwork by John Maeda
from the late 90s all made on a I think
in this document map OS 9 and released
in 1997 the only way to currently run
these historical company creative coding
this creative coding project from the
late 90s is to get like a mac os9 any
later or PowerPC and goal on Levin
actually did this for a page a blog post
for one of his courses at Carnegie
Mellon University where he got them all
to run and then kind of made some gifts
of them so what I would love to do as a
community is recreate this exact paid
what we're seeing here but instead of
gif animations the actual clocks running
in the browser so what you can see here
if you read this read me will give you
more information and if we look at the
published github pages you can see this
is just a layout for all these clocks
but the clocks aren't there right now so
this is just a beginning so I would love
for us as a community that says one of
the inspirations for this speaking of
crediting is the recode project recode
project org maybe no sold on Matthew
Epler Epler recode project let's this is
this is a documentation page about it
where is the actual link that's Matthew
Epler who also by the way has all these
great video too
girls on YouTube how come I can't find
the recode project website someone's
gonna be able to help me to find this
Rika here we go
recode project calm there it is so this
is the recode project which is
additionally about looking at historical
examples of artworks computational
artworks made by computers and you know
and it's there's a long history of this
way that takes way way past you know
what I've been doing for the last day
over many years and what what people
have been doing for me for the years
before that and so this is a project
where you click on any of these for
example let's look at random squares
this is one we could probably do here by
Charles susuri you can see here is a
direct translation and experimental so I
don't know if I click on this does this
mean we see the translation yeah so this
is that a written in processing and this
is the artwork so this I would love to
do something like this for the twelve
O'Clock project</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
