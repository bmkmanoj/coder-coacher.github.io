what do you think in this video I'm
going to look at how to work on your p5
GS sketch or really any HTML Javascript
CSS combo thingamabob outside of in any
old text editor by running a local
server on your laptop now what does that
mean actually I'm going to use the
whiteboard for a second so let's just
think about the internet as the web and
all that stuff for a second so you are
making a web page and you have a laptop
and to make your web page you're maybe
editing an HTML file maybe you have a
CSS file maybe you have a JavaScript
file and you're editing all these files
they're just plain text files and you're
editing them in some text editor so the
text editor I'm going to use happens to
be one called sublime but you can use
any text editor list of text editors I
would say now if I could think of them
but you put some in the comments and you
can write some in the comments your
favorite put your favorite text editor
in the contents so what I'm going to use
sublime text so you're editing these
files now one of the things I'm going to
show you is that you know another thing
that you're going to run on your laptop
is a thing called a browser and your
browser actually has the ability just to
open those files so you could ask your
browser open the HTML file and you're
going to see that the result of that
file in the browser are going to fix the
mic here mad magic edit so if you open
those files from the browser you're
going to see the result of those files
in the browser now let's think of what's
your ultimate goal here the ultimately
the idea that probably is that you have
a server server and you have your server
hosting some website you know
website.com
and ultimately what you're going to do
is you're going to take your files and
put them on a server so that other
people on their laptops and computers or
phones or whatever it is can connect and
look at your files so by opening the
file by opening the HTML file from the
browser you aren't actually doing what
the web server itself will do which will
ultimately
serve up the files so that other people
can request them so a better and in fact
a lot of things won't work if you just
open those files so yeah okay I used to
keep going that get start over and erase
all this so so ultimately what you want
to do is run by the way like the you
know the YouTube makes these charts you
could look at these charts where you see
people drop off and stop watching your
video and just about everybody stops
with a few of you are remaining but I
keep going with this so what you
ultimately want to do is run something
which I'll call a local server so if you
run a local web server on this machine
you are more accurately simulating what
will happen when you eventually upload
your files to a server and everything
will look and work and function
correctly
so this is what I want to show you in
this video how do you edit your files
with the text editor run a local server
so that you can see the result in the
file of those files in your browser and
accurately simulate the environment that
will eventually exist when you publish
your stuff to the world and become the
person who publishes their son for the
world there we go okay so let's go back
to the computer now and take a look at
this so this is actually the p5 desktop
editor which you may or may not have
used actually does all this for you it's
a text editor you hit this Run button
and it spawns a local server it opens a
little browser which shows your page but
what I'm going to do actually is I'm
going to just quit out of it and I'm
going to show you that if I go to my
computer's desktop I don't know if you
can't really see this and I go here I
was actually I made I there's a folder
called test sketch and in this folder
are the files associated with my sketch
there's an HTML file a JavaScript file
and a folder called libraries that
libraries folder is where the p5.js
library itself exists so what I want to
do is now I have something I have a text
editor called sublime text you can
google it you can find it you can use
any text editor you want and what I want
to do is look at those files in sublime
text one way I can do that is actually
just take this and drag it in and now
you can see here that
that I have now have I'm now browsing
and looking at those files and if I
wanted to edit my code I could look at
it right here and now I can edit the
code I can actually make the font a
little bit bigger and you can see here
I'm editing my code now let me make the
next point if I just go back here and
click on this HTML file I have no idea
what's going to happen it's going to
open it in some default browser it might
be Safari it might be Chrome if I open
it it opened it in chrome and you can
see it's working it's actually running
but look what's happening up here it's
opening it from the file path file users
processing desktops test sketch so while
this works there are a lot of things
that won't work when you're opening it
just from the file path itself that only
work if you're using a local server
running a local server certain things
like loading an image file into your
sketch for example won't work so while
this is okay as a solution a quick and
dirty test I personally would recommend
never doing it this way instead you want
to run a local server so there happens
to be this wiki on github under the
p5.js wiki which has a bunch of
different instructions of different ways
you can run a local server on different
operating systems Windows Linux Mac
Apache but about the thing that I'm
going to use which I think is the
simplest is you I'm since I'm on a Mac
and a Mac's come with Python installed I
can just run a Python local server from
any directory I want so what I'm going
to do the way I'm going to do this is by
running terminal so if you don't know
where terminal is it's in the you know
applications utilities there's an
application called terminal when you run
it it looks something like this this is
giving you console command line access
to your computer and I can type various
things like if I type PWD that stands
for a print working directory and you
can see I'm in user slash processing and
if I just type CD that means change
directory and if I type desktop I want
to change to the desktop and now if I
type P PWD I can see I've been users
processing desktop other things I can do
is I can hit the up arrow the up arrow
goes to my most recent command
see it again and now if I'm on the
desktop I can run a local server from
here and I can say Python - em simple
HTTP server so this just happens to be a
command that I have memorized but I'm
saying I want to run a Python program
that's built into the Macintosh it's
called simple HTTP server I forget what
the - M stands for somebody will tell me
in the comments I hit enter and you can
see uh serving HTTP on 0 0 0 port 8000
what this means is my this computer is
now running a web server where is the
web server running it's running on
localhost and another way of saying
local host is 0.0.0.0
so that's the IP address the Internet
Protocol address the address the numeric
address of a computer on the internet
and those numbers can become rather
important but for us right now we can
just think of it as localhost port 8000
being the port that other people can
connect to who are the other people
there me so I am the other person and
what I want to do now is go up here
right and instead of accessing my sketch
from file what I want to do is say HTTP
localhost now you can see I've done this
before on this computer so it's already
like pre filling it in but I want to go
to localhost colon port 8000 localhost
colon port 8000 I hit enter now you
don't actually see my sketch because
actually I would I now see is a view of
everything on the desktop so you can see
I have a bunch of other things like I
was doing this photo booth p5 demo which
has this snap button which allows me to
take so this is something I'm going to
make a tutorial about in a minute
another video to watch your video a few
videos from now you'll find this one but
you can see I'm sort of browsing this is
the minimum miss spanning tree example
so I have a bunch of folders with
sketches I'm sort of serving up that
hold on my whole desktop which I can
choose to do or not to do but what I'm
looking for is test sketch this is the
one and they can make it bigger in
chrome by shift command plus so now I
see the sketch running and I could go
back to the code and I could say hey let
me change the background to 100
hit save tab over to Chrome hit refresh
and you can see now I have the new
sketch running so this is another way of
working outside of some all-in-one
editor environment text editor local
server browser but missing piece let's
say in draw the draw loop I want to
debug the value of X so I'm going to say
console dot log X now I could have said
print line X print line is a p5 specific
function that prints something to the
console console dot log is the sort of
native JavaScript version of that
function basically the same thing but if
I put that in there and I go back and
hit refresh where is it I don't see it
no log no console so in Chrome I can use
something called the chrome developer
tools are you excited you shouldn't be
how maybe you are maybe you should be I
don't know so where do you get those
view up here under view developer
developer tools but I want to go
straight to the JavaScript console the
developer tools are this massive thing
and as all sorts of inspect this look at
that HTML CSS style this magic this all
I really care about is the JavaScript
console right now I want to see things
that are console dot log so I'm going to
select JavaScript console and it's going
to appear now it won't necessarily look
like this on your computer you're
probably going to see it at the bottom
you're probably going to see it a lot
smaller but what I've done you know you
can you can there's various ways you can
like move it around and change the font
size you know I want it to be kind of
rather big so I can for a tutorial you
can see it so what's nice here is you
can see there's the result and it's
showing me these each one of these
things is printing from sketch J's line
number eight so if I go over here and
see line number eight console dot log X
so that's great now you can also comment
this out and refresh the sketch one of
the wonderful things about the Chrome
JavaScript console is that it is
interactive what do I mean by that I can
actually type in the value X
the variable X which is a variable in my
program hit enter and it's going to show
me the current value of X so I can kind
of live debug as the program's running I
can do other things like I could say x
equals 50 it's getting to the other side
of the screen hit enter it you can see
that I actually changed on the fly the
value of that variable and it moved I
can do other things like what if I said
no loop no loop is a function in p5 that
turns off draw and suddenly it stops
looping I can say loop I can do things
like just call other functions like if I
say create P hello
create P is a p5 function that creates a
paragraph Dom element and there you go
hello is right there it's also showing
me what's in that Dom element and
there's so there's a lot more to this
and all as I make other tutorials that
use the chrome developer console you'll
see more and more about it so this has
been about 10 minutes hopefully this
helped you make sense of the world it's
a very hard world to make sense of these
days and this probably doesn't help make
sense of the world but it makes sense of
a small part of the world the local
server on your laptop of the chrome
developer tools I'm sure you have
questions and I will answer them somehow
in a way I don't know how yet but in in
the comments of this video or in another
video and I look forward to seeing you
in the next video maybe maybe maybe not
ok thanks very much I'm gonna hit stop</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
