knowing other than that I see a live uh
but look it says live on my phone here
but doesn't show me that anybody's
watching go finish finish oh no no I
don't want to stop that's if I want to
stop ah somebody showed up okay so I'm
here at New York University New York
University and I've had a lot of
requests let me know if those are you
leaving messages if you can hear me okay
I've had a lot of requests to do a
studio tour I'm sitting at the Tisch
School the arts I think of this floor is
technically the Skirball Center for new
media and this is the view it's kind of
like a beautiful sunset cloud action
happening back there in New York City
and I'm going to flip the camera and I'm
gonna walk down this hallway and into
this room and use my ID it's gonna open
and then here we are so this is what is
this is the room uh uh I don't know what
else to do now okay let me let me put
the gun on me yeah I hid the camera
because I didn't want to like show other
people who maybe didn't want to be live
on a livestream so here I am in the room
where I record all of my videos and so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to go
through I'm going to actually record a
couple videos in a moment but I'm going
to go through it's quite small yes
there's some file ego gate wait hold on
we turn this around show you some things
first that are in the room and how it's
set up
it's a bit of a mess and then I'm going
to do is get it I'm going to go through
and I'm going to go through and sort of
set up all the things I need to set up
and then I'll switch to the actual
recording system and livestream so first
of all those of you who are interested
in
uh coding trade merchandise here
subsample t-shirts that I have you can
see let's see I going to turn on some of
these first of all here's the thermostat
uh see maybe I can tell it to cool down
in here turn that on to 90 minutes uh
okay I am going to turn on this light to
make things brighter there's a button
here oh it's not plugged in I forgot
some things unplugged this is really
riveting okay so I am going to plug in
some of these lights and then this light
is on this is the camera so this is the
this is a mark 3 camera you can see it
has a HDMI out which I am getting here
and that camera is pointed at this
particular whiteboard and the whiteboard
is in fact painted on to the wall so
this is the whiteboard paint over here
that was used to paint onto the wall
okay now so that's that's this side of
the room camera light none I don't
actually have the lights pointed towards
the whiteboard unfortunately because
it's already warned me about this this
whiteboard is very very very reflective
so it's so that didn't really work
unfortunately okay now over here this is
the table that I stand behind it is a
kind of standing desk contraption it has
this button on it or it can move up and
down and then you'll if you're wondering
for how there's your live chat I think
is this oh no this is probably live chat
with something else this is the computer
my monitor which I use to sort of see
what everything looks like so let me I
have to figure out let's say poni let's
see what I can I am going to put my
phone right here on my laptop for a
second and I'm going to start turning
some things on okay so I got a uh I am
going to log out of here
know what I'm doing here believe I am
going to prepare so what I'm doing right
now is I am getting my computer set up
to livestream so and I flipped on this
in advance and I can see that I can see
people are sending a message hi Drita
Jair cut yeah oh I really should have
gone to like get a haircut and trim the
before I this is a bad idea to do this
studio walkthrough you're getting a much
more close-up view of my very not so
nicely manicured self okay um here we go
enjoy okay um okay so now you can see
here this is the that I use and it is
currently not plug is this is just it
right here that's the screen that
usually see but what it needs is it
needs to be plugged in to the capture
system so I'm looking for this
particular cable I'm going to plug it in
once that happens resolution changes and
I look over here and I look over here on
my monitor
looks like care points this is not very
good production value I figured for the
camera again okay this is my monitor
it's that I look at to the side there's
my random digits book with a train
whistle and you'll notice there's a big
black square there so why is there a big
black square is because that is the
rectangle so to speak that is the place
for the image that this camera sees so
I'm going to turn this camera on and now
as I walk back over here you will see
that there I am live keyed with the
green screen behind me and the monitor
so this software that you're looking at
is called Wirecast and there's an open
sort it so it's a broadcasting it's made
by Telestream it's broadcasting software
and there's an open source free
equivalent called open broadcast studio
and i'm
thinking of switching over to that just
to use something that's open source I
think it's open source but why our guest
is pretty great I have enjoyed using it
I best had some issues this morning what
was crashing but a couple things that a
Wirecast allows me to do if I turn on
this other camera turn on this other
camera oops my pressing the wrong
buttons oh you know what maybe it's not
plugged in see here whoops ah press this
button no why is this camera not turning
on okay hold on hardware the OH hardware
a debugging session is a terrible idea
who this looks like this cable goes to
here
AHA got loose maybe all right I'm gonna
have to blood I don't know what you
should look at right now uh I got to put
my phone down for a second to test this
okay let me we put it here and do this
okay hold on a second
I'm going to go get I can you hear me I
am going to go over there to check to
see if the cable is plugged in they do
need this camera to work to make videos
okay uh so here it is never has probably
unplug something unwittingly one thing
that I could really use is like cleaning
up all these cables aha the reason the
camera is not turning on is this this
must go into an outlet okay I'm going to
plug it in now I'll be right back okay
now plug that in and now this needs a
different plug which is here now magic
of magic this camera I believe us to
turn on and so now here we go
camera which is pointed at this
whiteboard is now I can see it there as
shot number two so basically the way
that I switch while on live streaming
between shots switch this back here the
way that I switch between live stream
within shots is I have them map two key
strokes so if I press one then that's
what I see if I press two and that's
what I see that's what I'm so I can live
switch between the two views and I can
also press three which goes to this
ridiculous video so whiteboard a camera
and laptop and a ridiculous video so I
really only have three shots I also have
another shot which is just yeah that's
it oh I shall have this which I don't
have a key map to it but that is just a
shot that shows exactly what the camera
is seeing so there's my random digits
here's my train whistle and uh yeah at
one point I actually had oh and like a
big red button it wasn't that big and
that was like much more fun to use but
then I realized I could just use a
keyboard and so that's what I switched I
prefer a black board no black board have
a chalk on the blackboard I guess we
don't like tingly wiggly wiggly
uncomfortable feelings so I much prefer
a whiteboard what else are you sure okay
so a couple things so all this stuff
how's this working like what computer is
running this so the computer is on the
a tower and you'll notice all the inputs
running into it so all of these are all
those camera inputs this is for Ethernet
this I believe is the microphone I'll
show that in a second
don't leave this is the microphone I
know what this is just the keyboard
probably so everything runs into this
mac tower and that's that this is the
streaming computer and so one thing I
need to show is so here's one of the
cameras for example coming out of the
camera is this HDMI cable so the cable
comes all the way out this cable doesn't
go directly into the tower it goes into
this particular box which is called I
think it's like a Blackmagic intensity
extreme so you can see it goes HDMI in
and then Thunderbolt out so this is
necessary because it's not natively a
captured whoops it's not natively a
capture device and there's one of my
lights so let's turn on this light this
is another light I will turn it on until
it makes the keying much better so there
we go I turn on this light and now
that's this light with like a softbox so
I could really is one thing I really
want to do is get a little bit of a grid
going in here with more light so the
lighting is a bit more from above what
else do I have to show you I have some i
rated my kids a trained toy bin at home
and brought some trained toys in
thinking I would use them as props I
haven't figured that out yet headed to
that let's see what else is in here
lights I showed you the shirts that I've
done making available and okay so other
things all of this stuff
um here is oh this is this is the lav
mic this is what's going into the
computer with a little antenna here and
I have two bars of battery left so I
would just say low battery is on so I
might switch the batteries before I
start and then that connects to this
particular microphone so this is the
microphone that I use to attach to
myself and talking to so now you can see
that it's on over there you'll see green
on the right so I can tell that the mic
is working and then the other thing that
I sometimes do for sound effects is up
top here
this output which goes through a magic
black magic box into the computer I can
actually send audio out of that as well
so I captured that audio into Wirecast
so any audio playing out of this laptop
also appears so I don't know how to
demonstrate that super easily book so
then I do a weird thing which is that I
airplay an iPad to get audio from like a
soundboard on an iPad but I really want
to redo that system it's not working
very well for me but you believe there
745 people watching cuz right now I'm
about to switch over I think I've done
all the setup stuff I'm about to switch
over to do an actual tutorial this was
just a little bit of a preview people
been asking about a walkthrough of the
studio I can see chat comments here
maybe I can kind of take a few questions
about what's going on in here
so if you guys could kind of limit your
questions to questions related to the
studio have I ever thought about doing a
live show yes clean your whiteboard I
really need to clean the whiteboard why
oh the camera and the pressing the
button the camera is tough swishing the
get the camera in the pressing the
button I will the issue with these
cameras is and I probably should just
use different mark 3 5 dtfz
you know focus they're good quality
there's lots of good things about them
they also natively do HDMI out the mark
3 the mark 2 does not so I just get a
nice clean output the problem is and
apparently um this is yes so I what I
need to do is install the magic lantern
firmware but I'm a little bit afraid of
breaking the cameras so I just got to
haven't gotten around to doing that
these cameras are you know technically
used for other things as well so these
aren't my personal cameras there you
know borrowed
oh yeah how much how much are those
lights from the 30 others hold the
lights aren't that close to the
thermostat there's a light there there's
the thermostat owner um so I but the
room does kind of heat up and um in
theory I should be getting air from up
there but I haven't really knows okay
what button do you press when you switch
between the white board and the green
background so I showed that previously
already but just to show you again I
just use keyboard shortcuts and then I
can switch and you can see it on my
monitor over here so that's why I'm kind
of often whoops my computer went to
sleep that's why I'm often over here
doing this I whoops you can't see I'm
doing this like I'm pretending that I'm
referencing things we're really all I'm
doing is my hand is by the whiteboard
and I what I really want to do is
install a big giant monitor up there
behind the camera because what I would
like to be able to do is read the like
sort of see a live chat sort of see a
live chat while I'm looking forward as
opposed to looking to the side you can
see this is the chat that I look at
during the live stream I also have a
second laptop which I'm not going to
open right now but I have a secondary
laptop over here which I use to kind of
monitor the stream and that sort of
thing okay hold on let's see what else
why do I use a Mac that's what I have
any specific reason why you use a Mac
Pro it's what I had access to ah have I
thought about using a lightboard yes so
I have this idea I've had this idea and
I haven't really had the time to sort of
think about it but I have this idea to
have a glass pane or like right here
between me and the camera so I could
draw on it and it would be in front of
me and see-through but as opposed to the
white that is behind me so yes I have
thought about that okay I think what
time is it oh I have no idea yes so this
studio is at new york university i work
here and your university full time this
is actually like on equip storage closet
it's a big storage closet you'll notice
that these are there some filing I don't
know it's in the filing cabinets the
mystery it's a mystery to me but they
are in here there are filing cabinets
okay um thanks but hey for watching this
I couldn't do a more thoughtful version
of this another time if do I look better
if I put the camera higher and but I
think I should get going with doing some
actual tutorials so eight all 814 of you
apparently who are watching which is
nuts
which is now 805 uh oh I should create a
Vista shirt that's a great suggestion
that's a great suggestion I should
create a this dot shirt and maybe I'll
do that as a kind of limited special run
maybe I can do it as a fundraiser for a
good coding cause so I'm going to turn
off my phone which will turn off this
live stream and then I'm immediately not
immediately but about five minutes
I am going to switch and press this
button up here which will turn on my
stream and also record a backup and that
will send out what you're seeing here
straight to YouTube someone asks when
I'm gonna happen
people are asking about the name of the
channel I guess since this is like a
just sort of arbitrary let me just give
the the short version of this story so I
called the channel coding rainbow at one
point because I love an old show called
Reading Rainbow and I love the idea of
Rainbow as a friendly welcoming symbol
and Reading Rainbow is one of my
favorites
what was a program that I a television
program that I loved a PBS program here
in the United States about reading and
literacy with a wonderful host name
levar burton
so i kind of didn't really think that I
was doing a thing because I was just
kind of making videos and I called it a
coding Rainbow as a sort of idea
informally and then I went a little bit
too far with it and I think that I
started doing this more as a regular
thing and unfortunately the you know
rightly so the logo and was too close to
Reading Rainbow and it was confusing and
a bit of a trademark issue so I decided
to change the name and the oh I went
through a lot of different options and
coding train train Bo seems like a good
idea at the time so that's what I went
with as a new name so maybe next year
I'll change the name again but there
will be there was a coding rainbow song
a music video and there still is that
music video and some but it's all been
redacted and blurred and the lyrics
taken out so I am working on a new one
with the same composer Adam Lau and hope
to have a new video as well so why do I
stream on YouTube not twitch I don't
maybe I should stream on Twitch YouTube
has just been the platform that I
started used to have all my videos on
Vimeo and I uploaded a few to YouTube I
think was maybe a year and a half ago
and I just discovered there's a new
audience for it there and I used to
stream both to twitch in YouTube but it
never really caught on
and sometimes the chat and twitch was a
little bit you know sometimes the chat
YouTube is as friendly as it could be
but in its chat and twitch was a there
was a little bit more of a kind of
mean-spirited energy I'm sure there's
plenty of twitch channels and chats that
are lovely at something I just didn't
catch on anyway so I am going to turn
this off I do teach a full time at New
York University yes a program called ITP
if you're interested in learning more
about it you can go to ITP NYU dot edu I
also used to record my videos at a place
called the school for poetic computation
which is SFP cio that's an independent
artist run school here in New York but
now I'm back and kind of doing most of
the videos at NYU ok so here we go it's
I don't know what time it is I got a
check oh it's 6 o'clock that's when I
said the live stream would start so I
got to turn this off I don't use open
broadcasting studio for streaming but
I'm thinking about switching to it could
I keep streaming both I have no idea
let's try ha this is exciting ok ok ok
ok ok ok I want to put this here I'm
gonna put this here ok phone is here
there we go there I got a plug this
laptop in
don't worry not going anywhere still
here this is really exciting I am going
to what's gonna happen double live
stream on the same console can't let me
do that can it I'm a little bit too tall
for a way it in my phone let's see if I
can do that ok so now what I'm doing
just to narrate what I'm doing turning
on my laptop I'm looking at the full
live stream preview over there I see the
YouTube chat let me open up my slack
channel so if you're wondering why I
keep referring to this slack channel is
to to support to kind of have a bit more
I don't know I have a patreon it I don't
know I don't know how to describe that I
have that patreon is a thing where
people can contribute monthly to content
creators in a Kickstarter like way and I
have
and so as a reward for that patreon I
have a slack channel where you know
it'll be easier for me to follow that
chat lines it's a smaller group and also
it's a continuous community a very warm
lovely community so if anybody's
interested in that you can go to the
coding trade calm okay let me go over
here look at this it says I'm streaming
right now okay I'm going to type I am
going to try to stream stream in both
places typing out into the YouTube chat
okay now I'm going to go check the slack
channel and go to my live channel just
reconnecting retry connect kicked okay
um okay what shampoo do I use somebody
asks well you a bit of a dandruff
problem i probe oh I don't know that's a
good thing to admit yeah Vuli you know
I've some mild psoriasis so I got lots
of issues lots of anxiety but you know
I'm doing I'm trucking along I'm here
I'm doing my best shampoo I don't know I
just used whatever shampoo is nobody
else is using at my house I like tea
tree oils it's very soothing okay see
Manny I hope you really appreciated that
a good question okay I am now going to I
am going to attempt uh going to attempt
to stream in two places will it work
okay so now I'm gonna put the microphone
on I can't see that this chat anymore
okay I can't really read the YouTube
chat on my phone right now because it is
a little too far away from me I have
some vision issues it's another issue I
have these glasses I think I need a new
prescription I need reading glasses good
thing about the Kindle is I can make the
font I love to read books are a great
thing
fiction I'm all about I mean the one
that I'm like way behind the time
but I'm in like I've been Harry Potter
and getting Thrones lands those are the
books that okay here we go
so I should probably tweet that
livestream happening again
Friday evening live stream HTTP
youtube.com slash user slash Schiffman
splash live and there we go
tweeted that now I need to I I don't
like having these two Twitter accounts I
have at shipment I have at the coding
train I don't like that now I'm going to
retweet it from the coding train and
retweet there we go
so everybody's been notified who needs
to be notified close that down and go
back to my slack channel use HTTPS haha
okay here we go
ooh all right I'm just looking your pull
over is so purple yeah anyway okay this
is an exciting moment I've got eight
hundred twenty people watching here I'm
about to go live also on YouTube right
here where will there be more people how
many people can we get will it be the
same people can you have both up I don't
know this is just a moment eventually my
phone battery's gonna die
really but we'll just let it keep going
what is that Google shirt google Summer
of Code I'll talk about it in the other
livestream okay here we go
is the audio working I've got the mic on
let me put it in a better place and here
we go let's try it
corn stream okay
I should be live now here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
