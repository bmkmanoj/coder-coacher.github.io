package manager
what is the node package manager what is
a node package why would you want to
manage packages who's managing them for
you what all that sort of stuff so what
is this thing why do you need it and why
is it relevant in particular for this
context of building a Twitter bot with
node okay so I'm gonna come over here to
the whiteboard not really sure why just
yet but so node package manager is
typically referred to online as NPM if
you google NPM you'll probably find the
node package manager website this is not
a separate thing that you need to
install when you installed node NPM came
with it and NPM is another command that
you can run from terminal from a console
and execute various things associated
with the project so the the first thing
that we okay so let's think about so why
is this thing exist anyway so you're
writing code you're a person who's
working on something with code and you
have this idea because you want to work
with an API or you want to generate SVG
PDF images for some other things right
and you're working JavaScript and node
and you're well how do you do that so
it's very rare that you're just going to
build everything from nothing you're
just going to start from a totally clean
slate
all you have is JavaScript in front of
you and you're going to somehow build an
entire engine that renders PDFs or talks
with your times API most likely you want
to use somebody else's library of code
that they've made available open source
to you that you can kind of piggyback
off of and hopefully you might
contribute back to it or make your own
packages someday but this is what a
package is so the particular package
then I feel weird saying because I don't
know twit it's like a weird thing to say
but a particular package that I'm going
to use in these particular videos about
making a twitter bot is a package called
twit because I am a twit let's just all
get that out there that's who I am I am
a twit I am NOT ah I always forget to
reset these cameras so okay so um I'm a
twit for not resetting the cameras okay
I don't even know
that is what is a twit it's whatever
anyway okay so package NPM so how do you
install a package you say npm install
the name of the package so where do you
say that why when do you say that how do
you do that so one of the things that
happens when you work on a node project
is that you want to have this thing this
file called package so as you saw you
can just write some jobs in the
previously you can just write some
JavaScript code execute the JavaScript
code it works but when you start to like
think of a project you're making that
has a bunch of different components and
imports various packages and might
depend on other modules you can keep
using all these different kinds of words
this file called package JSON is like
you can think of it as like your
settings file for your whole project or
your config file for your whole project
and one of the things that you might put
in a package JSON file is other types of
other what's known as other dependencies
dependin dependencies whatever got close
enough so and notice here the for the
file extension JSON this is a file
that's of the JSON format magic link to
video that I made about JSON and what
that is make that appear in an
annotation or a card or something I
don't know so so that's so so you could
start to write this file yourself but
one of the things you can do with node
package manager is say NPM in it so
that's the very first thing that I think
I'll demonstrate to you as I come over
here so I'm going to minimize Chrome and
I'm going to come back here now remember
I'm going to save Iowa something I like
to type is clear which just clears the
terminal on a Mac I'm going to say PWD
so I'm in you know processing desktop
you to cope this is the folder that I'm
in and actually something I could do is
say open dot what that's going to do is
open that folder in the finder so I want
to kind of go
back here and I'm going to make another
folder called node 2 and what I want to
do is now CD dot dot will move me up one
directory so you can see I'm just in the
youtube code directory and now I'm going
to go to CD node 2 so now I'm in this
folder right you can see it there
there's nothing in there and now is the
time where we're going to say something
exciting I'm going to say and p.m. in it
so with that what this does is it's
telling me this utility will walk you
through creating a package.json file it
only covers the most common items and
tries to guess sensible defaults so this
is useful to you you don't have to do it
this way you could make the package that
JSON file yourself but NPM done it will
kind of prompt you to site to ask you
some questions like what's the name of
your project no - you know what let's
call it NPM demo by the way no spaces or
it can go in this name which will often
trip me up because long as I won't tell
you till the end so NPM demo the version
like if I'm keeping track of versions of
projects whatever 1.0 sounds good the
description I am demo demos demin
demonstrating NPM entry point entry
point this is a key question what's the
name of the file that node should
trigger to run your program I called it
hello Jess before you could call it
index chance you could call it server
dutch ass you could call it BOTS guess
let's call it BOTS Jas because that's
ultimately what we're going to make
eventually although this isn't really a
bot yet a test command whatever I don't
know what that is let's skip that git
repository that's another topic for
another time I'm not going to worry
about a git repository right now
keywords rainbow awesome whatever
awkward maybe is more appropriate for me
and the author is a myself whatever not
that I know this matters I you know this
matters if you license you know
eventually it's like saying does this
look right to you and I'm just going to
say yes
so um what you're seeing here is it's
creating that package JSON file a lot of
that doesn't really matter
to you right now but it's kind of good
practice to get started with it because
ultimately you might want to release
this as a kind of published project or
open source it uploaded to this thing
called github make it a node package
that other people can use there's lots
of possibilities here so you're kind of
getting off on the right foot by
starting with this package JSON file so
now if I go into sublime here and I'm
going to say file dot open and I'm going
to I'm just going to open what one of
the things you can do is sublime is you
can open sublime by the way a text
editor that I'm using it's not free
although you can download kind of a free
version but you could use any text
editor for the stuff that I'm doing you
know TextEdit will work and so one thing
you can do with sublime is open a full
directory and you can see now here on
the side here I have kind of a directory
structure and what I want to do is look
under node two and you can see look at
that
that file didn't exist I didn't make
that file that this file arrives because
I ran NPN in it so I can click on this
file and you can see there's there's the
JSON file it's got the name the versions
it's got this thing called scripts it's
got some keywords as no author but I can
I can now edit this file just change it
manually like oh I wanted to have a
period here that sort of thing so you
now have a package that JSON file okay
so now I said that I wanted to use the
TWiT package so how do you find out what
packages you want what you might want to
use and how do you install them so I can
go back to Chrome here go back to a
browser and I can I'm just going to
Google NPM and I'm going to end up on
the NPM NPM J Escom website so this is a
website which has a collection of all of
any comment all packages that you could
possibly think of installing and for
example one of the ones that I hope to
make some videos about at some point is
this package called Express and this is
what you really want to use if you want
to like make a quick web server if you
want to host some files if you want to
kind of spin up your own API and I would
like to get to make a set of videos
about using Express but we're here and
we're like okay well let's say I want to
use
something that's going to help me talk
to Twitter so I could type Twitter in
the search and you can see wow there's a
lot easy-easy twitter twitter judges
twitter tokens twitter 1.1 twitter
coming so this now becomes this is your
life welcome to your life I go you know
I don't know maybe you should do
something else but like how do you pick
which one what do you do so a lot of
this is you know ask a friend maybe
already made something with Twitter I
could be your friend I might tell you
use that twit one who seems to be
working for me why don't you try it but
another thing you could do is kind of
look at it you can see doesn't have good
documentation when was the last time it
was updated like if it hadn't if the
last time a code update like if I look
at this one
like s off Twitter we can see here it's
not really like a huge amount of
documentation it was published a year
ago zero point zero point one is the
latest release like I might say I don't
like this is maybe a wonderful package I
don't even know who made it or why it's
there but this is the kind of things you
might want to look for and certainly
clicking over to the github repository
which is where the source code you can
find the source code for it and you
could see here that you know September
5th 2014 it's only had like four commits
so maybe this is an assorted ly
maintained project I'm going to look for
the TWiT one we're just going to put in
twit here and I think you can see here
this is a Twitter API for node it says
rest if you want to take a rest but you
might want to after watching this video
and streaming so this is good we're
going to use this streaming feature of
the API what's streaming with the API
it's kind of exciting and you can see
here it's giving you a a little message
of how I'm standing in front I have this
bad habit of how to install it
NPM NPM install twit it's giving you
some like example code of how to use it
a little bit so this looks like it's got
pretty good documentation and
information so this is a good one to use
and I'm going to use it for my examples
so now how do you install it now we saw
that on the page it said you could say
npm install twit and this will in fact
install the twit package however what I
might suggest to you that you do is also
- - save what - - save as an argument -
npm install means is save a reference to
this particular package
- your package JSON file and so now if I
hit enter because some stuff is
happening it's warning me because I
didn't really fill out everything in
that NPN package it's installed a little
bunch of thing
Tunney like twit actually depends on all
these other packages that it's using
once called tough cookie which I'm not
tough cookie I'll melt very easily you
know give me a package that's not well
doesn't have a good documentation and
I'm you know weeping instantly but I
don't know why I'm talking about that so
so you can see and install that and now
a couple things one is you can see look
at this dependencies right now right now
in my in my package that JSON file it
added this so that as this project moves
around or gets uploaded or shared it'll
I'll always remember that this this
package this project I'm working on
requires this TWIC dependency which will
help it if eventually ultimate if you're
like deploying to a server and the
server is going to automatically install
the dependency for you there's all sorts
of possibilities there why this might be
useful and also another thing you'll
notice is that there's suddenly now
remember I'm in node two if I go into
this folder there's suddenly in addition
to the package.json file there's a node
modules folder and that node modules
folder you'll notice has the TWiT module
and that has examples library other
modules it depends on tests or readme
file so all the stuff for that
particular node module is now in the
local directory for your project so now
we are ready now we're actually ready to
write some code no it's kind of been a
long journey here of like first got
installed node and you got to learn what
this NPM thing is then you got it like
do NPM in it and then you got to do NPM
install but all of this it has a purpose
it has a greater purpose because we're
going to get to the fun part of actually
talking to Twitter posting to Twitter
coming up with weird strange things that
you might do automatically with a
Twitter bot so so if you're following
along what I would make sure you could
do now is make a package.json file run
NPM and
it run npm install twit - - save and
you'll be ready for the next video we're
going to start actually adding the code
for talking to twitter and when hit stop</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
