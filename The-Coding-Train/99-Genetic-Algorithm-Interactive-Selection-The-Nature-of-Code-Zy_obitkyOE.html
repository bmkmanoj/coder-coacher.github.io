algorithms video boy I seem to be making
a lot of these chickens videos recently
this in this this video I'm going to
explore something called interactive
selection the idea is a lot of ideas
behind interactive selection pioneered
by Karl Sims here is a reference to an
artwork a project created in 1997 it's a
museum exhibit you can look kind of here
at this image and what you see in this
image are a lot of screens and these
screens are displaying images and then
you see along the floor here all these
sensors so a viewer at this museum
exhibit would come and stand in front of
an image and when the viewer is standing
from the image and looking at the image
they're standing on the scent sensor and
some type of counter or some type of
algorithmic system is keeping track of
how long the viewer is standing on top
of that sensor why is all this happening
okay so I've said before when I've
talked about using a genetic algorithm
in a project I've said there are two
main things that are really up to you to
design that your creative input into
what's going to happen in your project
one is this idea of a genotype versus
phenotype which is also a really sort of
key factor in the karlsen's project that
I'm showing to you and the thing that
I'm going to demonstrate and make for
you as well but but really what I'm talk
about right now is this Fitness function
the reason why I've come over here on
the whiteboard to kind of write that
down is usually the next stop from years
what is the math formula for the fitness
well it's you know inverse distance
squared divided by the amount of time it
took to to do this and the baba baba
wawa you're coming up with some kind of
number of characters correct baba some
type of actual mathematical function
well in this case there is nothing other
than the amount of time of you are spent
looking at a particular image so in this
case it's the behavior of the visitor to
the exhibit that is driving the fitness
function and you can think of this in a
lot of other ways you could have a
rating system you know the fitness of a
particular piece of music is the amount
of star ratings that got on some you
know music sharing web service type of
thing so user input into the fitness
user driven design right you could be
saying I want to design particular
turn for address but instead of hand
making that design I'm going to just
have a program algorithm that they
generate 100 designs I'm going to look
at them pick the ones I like and
generate a hundred new design so you
could evolve where you are essentially
the designer assigning fitness to the
things in the evolutionary system and
that's what's happening here in this
particular exhibit so how would you do
that I mean this is really all I have to
say this video is really more about this
idea and actually this it becomes you
know there's so many possibilities do I
write a web application or do I create
something with computer vision and
perhaps I can explore if you have some
suggestions some particular scenarios
but I have for you just to look at some
code and see an example happening I have
perhaps what might be the lamest version
of interactive selection ever and I'm
going to show you this example and talk
you through the code a little bit so
this is the example right here and what
it has that you can see if i zoom in
here is a bunch of different designs for
faces and as you can see as I hover my
mouse over them I am incrementing a
number so I'm saying here like this I
really really like this particular face
design so I have these designs I have
about I think there's ten of them here
one two three four five two seven eight
nine ten and I've given them all a
rating and then I have a button here
that I can press evolve next generation
and I click that button and you can see
I now have a new generation of designs
from the ones that got a high rating and
I could say you know what I love purple
let's give this one a high rating but
the size of this one is pretty good and
let's hit evolve and you can see I've
got a lot of purple ones now so again I
can keep hitting evolve and you're gonna
see there's some mutation at play and
things happening I'm not suggesting to
you that there's anything particularly
revolutionary about this but it is
showing you the basic mechanics of this
system so let me let me let's let's
let's think about how this works
number one is I'm using some form of
interaction like a rollover to increment
the fitness value for a particular face
and then and and then that then I also
have this idea of a design so there's
also this question here of oh if there
was nothing written there there's also
this question here of genotype versus
phenotype so in Carlson's is the example
if you read the paper that I've linked
in this video's description there's an
elaborate discussion of how the images
in the X
Bishan are created out of these kind of
like mathematical formulas sequences
written in the programming language list
but all sorts of craziness like that but
what I'm actually doing in my particular
example which is quite a technique that
you can apply is I actually have a DNA
the DNA is actually just a sequence of
floating point numbers and each floating
point number is between 0 and 1 so that
is the signature for the design and if I
go you can see we have this idea of
genotype and phenotype if I look at the
code very briefly in in DNA J s you can
see this is the genotype right here this
is the data an array of genes everything
with a random number between 0 and 1 and
then the expression of that data is in
the face object and the face object
right here you can see that expression
happening here
so this face object has a lot of parts
of its design it has a radius an IX and
Y position the size of the eyes and I
color a mouth color the mouth position
the mouth with the mouth height and all
of those things are taking these numbers
between 0 and 1 and mapping them to some
other range like a color between 0 to
255 or
a supposition between 25 and 60 and that
type of thing so this is a one way of
taking this idea of data and then
mapping it to a bunch of variables which
then draw this kind of ridiculous design
of a face with a couple rectangles so I
think that you as a person watching this
video probably could come up with a much
more creative or beautiful or
interesting type of design perhaps you
can think of it as like a vector-based
shape of paths or you could think of
other ways of encoding your design maybe
it's a piece of music so that's not
actually even a visual design it's a
sequence of notes and rhythms but
whatever that is then you just need a
rating system and in this case I had to
have this rollover function that
whenever the the user is rolling over
that particular object the Fitness is
going up by some small amount pretty
arbitrary but you could have a drop-down
menu to assign ratings but one of the
things that I think is kind of key to
realize about this kind of system so if
I go back to show you
just really really briefly if I go back
to this Shakespeare example right the
Shakespeare example look at this in the
time I talked there I evolved 175
generations each population having 200
elements let me run this example for you
again and there's ten elements in the
population and I'm clicking around oh
and I'm gonna I've got to actually rate
some and I got eight generations with
ten elements so this scale here is a bit
of a problem while with this kind of
numeric fitness function of mathematical
calculation I could just be churning
churning out generation after generation
after generation after generation over
and over again but here I've got to look
at it I've got a bio eight I've got to
think about it I've got a roll over then
I'm going to click the button so scale
is an issue but one thing you might
think about is the web the network a
distributed network of viewers could you
create some type of cyst maybe you could
have a website by the way that has a
different design this is kind of an
awful idea but you know you have a
website where you want somebody to buy
something or think of something besides
buy you just want someone to download a
nice flower image because that's going
to make the world a better place what if
you showed a different design each time
somebody came to the website and the
sort of rating of that design was how
likely that whether or not that person
got to sort of some end result of using
the website you can think of it this
this is kind of ties in this idea of
reinforcement learning but you could
evolve a particular design through users
kind of unconscious behavior of just
kind of using a particular website
whether it's intuitive or not or playing
a game there's lots of possibilities
besides just rating but the point is if
you have something up on the web you can
have a lot of people rating and evolving
all at the same time with like a
centralized database anyway I'm rambling
on and on and on this video you can find
this code linked to in the description
of the video I hope that you maybe try
to make your own evolutionary design
system with interactive selection and
share it with me and so we can see what
kind of new and creative ideas and maybe
if you share some with me I'll come back
and make a video where I show some of
them and so that you guys can see what
other people have been making okay see
you soon in another video soon I got one
more genetic algorithm video at least
coming in the in the pipeline here
that'll be after this one in the
playlist okay good bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
