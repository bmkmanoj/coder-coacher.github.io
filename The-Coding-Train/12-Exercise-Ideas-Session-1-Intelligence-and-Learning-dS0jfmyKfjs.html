the end of session one of intelligence
and learning this is a video that goes
along with the course that I'm teaching
at New York University ITP to School of
the Arts okay so I'm making this video
just if you happen to have watched this
entire playlist you're following this
course on my youtube channel a mouse
time where you could try to make a
creative exercise based on the variety
of different search algorithms with
grass systems that I've showed you so
this page here I will link to it has
some of these exercise ideas I'm going
to talk you through some of them so one
of the things you could really do is you
could take any of the examples that I
made maize generation with depth-first
search
binary tree and just visualize them in a
different way in an artistic way it's 3d
you're really interesting to see could
you do a star path finding in 3d you
could actually even have a terrain
that's 3d and you're trying to like you
don't want to go up and you want to go
down this is a viewer actually submitted
a project like that which I will try to
link to in the description of this video
and so so I'll talk you through some of
these possibilities so you could make
your own visual design you know just as
a technical exercise one thing you might
try to do is have music in the hallway
again take that binary tree example
which just puts ten random things in the
binary tree but allow the user to enter
numbers and have those appear in the
tree so it builds up slowly maybe it
animates in some interesting way add
some physics to it
you know the six degrees of Kevin Bacon
example I use the sort of dummy small
dataset you could try to use build that
exact same example but with a much
larger data set maybe it's not movies
and actors the animal guessing game is
so is oh that's when I didn't make a
video for I should make a video about
that so if you look at this animal
guessing game example it's just a little
node program that tries to get an animal
that you're thinking of and it uses a
tree like structure to do that and so
making an interactive version of that
you know something that I think if you
look at the a star example and you know
all it does is show you that path that
it solves for but if you actually use
some of my
animus agent examples that have steering
agents moving through a space actually
look like they're little mice trying to
find the finding it oh this was this
idea of you know how do you think about
the space that you're pathfinding in you
know it's really just my examples are
just a pure maze I should pull one of
them up so I pulled up the a star
example and also this maze example now
first of all it could be interesting to
think about combining these two that's
an exercise I actually have a solution
to that if you look at the links I
created a solution to that but here you
know you could really think about the
maze in two different ways that wall is
it a river so I think just re imagining
other ways to visualize these spaces and
thinking about this as a terrain there's
a lot of possibilities I think that you
could that you could explore just using
the algorithm verbatim but thinking
about the actual space that the
algorithm is playing out in a completely
different way and putting your own
design spin on it
what else we have here so you know
another thing you could do is I never
made a video about like say for example
Dijkstra's algorithm and you could
investigate that and create something so
if you do any of this if you do any of
these assignments and you're watching
this video share links to what you make
in this videos in the comments or tweet
them at me at Schiffman and oh it's a
variation on one of my examples that's
on the github repository you can add it
a link to it in the readme file in that
directory
I gotta have a better system for this so
I'm working that out thanks for
participating in this session one of
intelligence of learning and maybe
you'll move on and watch Session two
with genetic algorithms</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
