challenge in today's coding challenge I
am going to attempt to program this the
game of life cellular automaton in
JavaScript can we use the p5.js
framework what's running right here
right now is a processing example using
the java programming language that i
made several years ago as part of the
nature of code book now if you're
interested in that you can also look at
my whole playlist about this thing that
I can't pronounce called cellular
automata the plural of otamatone and i
do have some videos that give you some
historical background and looking at
different on Wolfram's elementary CA and
some exercises and things but i'm really
just showing examples in talking about
the systems in in those videos and in
this video I'm gonna try to just start
from no code and finish with the
simulation hopefully it's going to work
it generally doesn't so okay your hopes
up but I do want to say that yeah I
would encourage you to do some
background reading and this is the first
Republic appearance of the gate jump the
game of life as created by John Conway a
mathematician from an article in
Scientific American in 1970 by Martin
Gardner of course you can always refer
to the Wikipedia page I'm gonna need
this which is it's going to in which
where it outlines the rules for how the
system behaves and you can also think
that there's a lot of possible stuff
there's all these kinds of interesting
repeating patterns and different types
of things that you could create and do
with the game of life simulation but I'm
gonna program a simple version of it
hopefully that will happen then at the
end I'll talk about some variations that
you might think about and maybe someday
I'm gonna try to like make one in 3d or
something like that okay so let's get
started here's what we need a cellular
automaton is a system of cells that
exists in a grid it could be in one
dimension two dimensions three
dimensions the game of life system is
one that exists in two dimensions and
the idea is that you have generations so
if this is generation zero I'm going to
run some computation on this system of
cells on a grid
and then I'm going to have a new set of
cells on that grid and that's going to
be generation 1 so the cells that exist
on that grid all have a state that's
part of a CA system so that state could
be a floating-point number it could be a
kind of animal you could really imagine
in a lot of different ways I'm gonna do
something very simple with the game of
the game of life is a simple system of
discrete States two states 0 1 on or off
alive or dead so you could imagine a
configuration of this being something
like this and for each time each tick
each generation each frame of animation
I evaluate each cell one by one and get
a new state based on the previous state
so let's say I'm trying to do this cell
I need this cells new state I'm going to
get a new state based on this state and
its neighbors so what are its neighbors
that's up to us to find it could be its
left neighbor its right neighbor its
only its neighbors to its left but in
the game of life system its neighborhood
are the eight cells surrounding it so
it's this 3x3 area 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 so I
need to evaluate all of those cells and
decide whether it should stay as a zero
or turn into a one and the reason why
it's called the game of life is the
rules the rules for how we move from one
generation to another resembles some
type of like biological process that you
might think about population or about
Tyrael growth and the idea is that a
cell that is surrounded by neighbors
that aren't alive cannot stay alive a
cell surrounded by neighbors that are
alive can can come to life or stay alive
and a cell that's surrounded by too many
neighbors cannot stay alive due to
overpopulation and we can go back to the
Wikipedia page and and read those rules
precisely right here so any live cell
with fewer than two neighbors dies as if
caused by underpopulation
any live cell was 2 or 3 name
lives on to the next generation any cell
is more than three neighbors dies by
over ovulation and any dead cell with
exactly three Nate three-line neighbors
becomes a live cell so this is written
as if by reproduction so this has
written him as somewhat of a confusing
way I think I could simplify this I
think we could say like let's say the
cell is dead it's a zero it's only going
to change to a one if it has three live
neighbours then it changes to a one
otherwise it stays a 0 a 1 it's going to
stay a 1 unless it has less than 2 less
than to live and greater than 3 live
then it dies so it so birth reproduction
happens with exactly 3 neighbors death
happens with fewer than two or greater
than 3 now I don't know if I got those
numbers right let's go check the
Wikipedia page again thank you thank you
I hit the sound effect by accident live
cell with fewer than two live neighbours
dies yes less than two dies live cell
with two or three neighbors Liz I don't
care about that I'm not gonna kind of
not care about chain and then it stays
the same I can kind of ignore that live
cell with more than three neighbors dies
yep that's what I've got over there and
then any dead cell with exactly three
live neighbours becomes alive okay so
I've got those rules correct so now what
do I need pillow you're over there go
back over here I need something I need a
date all I need to make this program
work is a data structure to store this
grid and this is where I'm kind of
having like a bit of a headache and I'm
really not sure what to do
the way that I've always done this in
previous examples is by using something
called a two-dimensional array I think I
have a video tutorial about that
somewhere which I will link to in this
video's description
but two-dimensional arrays are kind of
not so much fun in JavaScript they can
become a little bit weird and there
really is no such thing as a
two-dimensional array the
two-dimensional array is
construct of our own human mind saying
link it's really just an array of arrays
which makes sense this is an array you
know each row is an array and then the
grid is an array of rows or each column
is an array and the grid is an array of
columns so I think I'm gonna do it that
way with the two-dimensional array I
just should say that it's a little bit
awkward two dimensional arrays in
JavaScript but I'm gonna go ahead anyway
so the first thing I don't want to do in
this program is just make a
two-dimensional array that stores a
random collection of zeros and ones so
let's go do that I'm gonna go to the
code and you know what I'm gonna do I'm
gonna actually just write a function I'm
having like weird DejaVu I probably did
this in another video somewhere I'm
gonna just write a function called make
2d array and I want a certain number of
columns and rows okay because that way I
can just say I can have a global
variable called the grid I'll call it
grid and I could just say grid equals
make 2d array and I could say I want a
10 by 10 grid so this is kind of what I
want to do I'm gonna just farm out the
making of the array to another function
and oh I know I do remember doing this
because I'm gonna write this in a kind
of there's a whole like coding challenge
or video I'm gonna do this in a kind of
horrific way and then everyone's gonna
like give me all these like amazing es6
javascript fancy ways of doing this
function like one line of code someday
I'll come back and do that okay so now
so now let me see here so what I need to
do is first is I need to have some sort
of array and it's going to be it's going
this is always where I get confused to
do I want the columns the point of using
a 2d array is that eventually at some
point I'm gonna be able to say something
like grid you know index 2 index 3 and I
guess I usually think of this as x and y
and X being the columns so I want this
the outer array with something about
arrays of arrays to be every single
column write every single no no that's
what X is column right and then the y
is everything a row okay so I'm gonna do
that so I'm gonna make a new array of
columns and then I am going to say for
let I equals 0 I is less than that array
dot length I plus plus make a array
index I is a new array of rows again I
know there are all sorts of shorter and
fancier automatic functions for
generating and configuring array is like
fill and map and reduce and all that
kind of stuff even more so I'm gonna do
this and then I am going to what I want
to do here now is I also want to fill
them with I guess I could fill it with
values down here so uh so maybe I won't
maybe I'll actually just do that so this
is going to make me an empty 2d array
with nothing in it and then I think what
I want is I want to have these global
variables I know this is a little bit
goofy that I'm doing this and then what
I'm gonna do
I couldn't good not and I'm gonna say
let I equals 0 I is less than columns I
plus plus and then I'm going to do J is
less than 0 J is less than rows I'm
gonna do a nested loop so that I can say
grid I J equals floor random to this is
going to this is going to give me a
nested loop this is a nested loop so I
make this sort of like 2d array
structure that's empty and then I
iterate over every single column in
every single row and I fill each one
with a random number 0 or 1 and I'm just
now I'm gonna run this and I'm gonna go
back to I'm gonna go to my code ok
cannot read property 0 of undefined
well you know it would be nice if I
actually returned that array so they
make 2d a function all right it's making
this array it's also got to return it so
that I can get it back here and then now
if I look at grid I'm gonna see it's an
array of arrays and I forgot there's
this wonderful thing you can do like
console table grid which shows me now I
can see it here so we can see this is
that two-dimensional array that's what
it looks like it's a two-dimensional
array with rows and columns filled with
zeros and ones so step one is finished
now what I need to do is I need some
mechanism to every frame of animation
iterate over every single spot and set a
new spot actually you know what I should
do first I need to render this thing I
want to be able to see it as a grid of
red and blue squares are black and white
squares or zeros and ones on the screen
any number of ways you could render this
I'm gonna do it in the traditional way
of a grid the square the cell of the
grid is black if the value of zero is
white the value of one or vice versa
okay what I want to do now is I'm going
to add a draw function and I'm gonna be
using this loop over and over again I'm
gonna add this loop right because I'm
always gonna any time I want to look at
everything I'm gonna go through all the
columns in all the rows it's pointed out
in the chat that there are some
JavaScript libraries and packages that
manage grid systems the neighbors for
you be great to use those I'm gonna just
do it all without that right now just to
kind of like figure it out I'm gonna say
background zero and I'm gonna create a
canvas I think to make my life easier
for the moment I'm going to make the
canvas also a square and then what I
need to do is I need to draw I want to
draw a rectangle add an X and a y with
some width and height and it's gonna
they're going to be squares so some
width and with and that value is going
to be the width of the
you know I should probably calculate the
number of columns and rows here's the
thing I'm gonna redo the way that I'm
doing this so I'm not gonna actually
have a fixed number of columns and rows
I'm actually going to do like a scale or
I'm gonna just essentially have a
variable called resolution and I'm gonna
say that's ten or forty I'm gonna say
that's forty so that'll be ten by ten
and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna say
columns equals the width of the canvas
divided by resolution rows equals the
height of the can
canvas divided by resolution this way I
can kind of dynamically you'll see what
if I can dynamically make a 2d array
based on how big I want the squares to
be so the columns and rows are being
calculated based on how big on what the
squares to be and the canvas size and
then I have that global variable
resolution which is probably too long of
a name which I could just use down here
and now x equals I times resolution and
y equals J times resolution and I'm
gonna now say if grid I J equals one
fill to 55 and you know what since I
made the background 0 I can actually in
this case I could just draw rect white
rectangles only for the values of 1 so
let's see I probably got something wrong
here but let's try to run this nope I
didn't so we can see there we go now
there's some goofiness like oh it's sort
of like my math is a little off and I
what's this weird like nonsense over
here
flickering I kind of feel the need to
fix that and the other thing that I can
do that this is gonna help is if I make
this 600 by 400 and I make this like 20
right it still works and now this is
driving me crazy I think what I want to
do is it's there's a sort of issue with
the stroke so I could say I could also
say stroke 255 and then I'm getting
something else but I don't know
design-wise I'm not gonna worry about
that too much
actually I kind of like being able to
see the grid
let me actually put in stroke zero and
then I'm gonna do something kind of
goofy which is I think if I say just
draw the all the rectangles like one
pixel less whoops I think I'm gonna get
the look that I want yeah
so whatever there's countless ways I
could deal with this but now I have I
have the grid I have all the cells so
now it's up to me to simply implement
these rules I need two for every single
cell count the number of live neighbors
look at its own state and have these
rules play out here's the thing this is
really important while I'm checking each
cell I check this cell first let's say I
cannot change its value and then go on
and check the next cell because the next
cells new state should not be dependent
on this cells new state but its previous
state and if I change the state I've
lost its old state so this is where what
I actually need is I need two
two-dimensional arrays one is the sort
of old one and one is the new one now
probably the simplest thing for me to do
is just make a new one every frame
that's sort of like in some ways a bad
idea in terms of memory management and
if you look at my processing example
that I referenced at the beginning of
this video what I actually do in that
example is I just have two different
arrays I have an old one and then I have
a new one then the new one has been the
old one and I write the new one over
here I just keep swapping them so I
could maybe add that in at some point
during this video but for right now at
the beginning of draw I'm just always
gonna make a new generation at the
beginning what I could do here why does
this keep happening when I press the
button to change the camera the
beginning of draw I can say let next for
next generation equal make 2d array
columns and rows okay now I'm gonna
leave this here for the rendering and
what I'm actually gonna do is at the end
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna say I
guess it doesn't really matter I want to
like
render first this is have like a
philosophical deep philosophical
question do I want to compute and then
render or render and then compute kind
of could matter in some situations this
met in this situation does really matter
but what I what I reason why is like I'm
never gonna see the first generation
because what I want to do is say grid
equals next so basically the algorithm
here is compute next based on grid
because draws looping so I want to
compute the next generation based on the
grid make grid that render and then
compute the next generation based on
grid make grid that render so I don't
know that's bothering me I'm gonna do
this I'm gonna do this after so at least
I draw the first one and I'm gonna do
some computation for the next frame okay
okay so now what do I need to do once
again loop through all of these loop
through all of these now what I need to
do is count live neighbors I need to
count the number of live neighbors the
neighbors that have one so I could do a
kind of internal loop here and that
would probably be a smart thing to do
maybe I will do that where basically
what I do is I say I have a certain I'm
at a certain cell let me look at the
cells between negative one and one and
negative one and one offset from where I
am I could also just do something really
silly like let me do that really silly
thing first I could say let's sum equals
zero then I could say some plus equal
grid I minus one J that would be the
neighbor to the solo right if this is I
comma J I minus one comma J is there I
minus 1 J minus 1 IJ minus 1 that sort
of thing so if I'm thinking about this I
might like add go I could like manually
put in all the neighbors just like add
them all up this is like I'm gonna going
around the horn here
plus I plus 1 J plus 1 I sometimes I
like doing ridiculous things like this
just to figure this stuff out now I
gotta go I minus 1 J plus 1 and then
what's the last one I minus 1 J this
should be 8 neighbors and I'd write this
is 8 neighbors one two three four oh
eight one two three four five six seven
what did I forget I minus one J minus 1
IJ minus 1 I plus 1 J minus 1 I forgot
to do that whole top row and then I plus
1 J I plus 1 J plus 1 I yeah so this
should now be 8 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 okay I
kind of hate that I did this like
throwing your tomatoes at your
television screen because of course
you're all watching this on the
television screen so this is the idea I
need to add up all those neighbors let's
do this in a loop so another way I could
do it is I could say ah you have a
better idea
let's neighbors I have a better idea
let's write a function to do this
neighbors equals count I'm going to give
it the grid and I'm gonna give it the I
and the J so I'm gonna write a function
I'll put it all the way at the bottom of
my code that receives I'm going to call
it count account neighbors let's call it
and it's going to receive some 2d array
and it's going to receive an x and a y
location and then what I'm going to do
is I'm going to say I equals negative 1
I is less than 2 I plus plus then so I'm
going to do a little nested loop using I
and J around that spot and I'm going to
say let sum equal 0 and then
to say some plus equals grid I J however
here's a problem I don't want to count
myself as a neighbor so there's a few
different ways I could do this but it's
a little bit silly I'm just gonna like
subtract it at the end like I'll just
subtract it out I could have like put an
if statement here like ignore it if I
equals X and J equals x but I'm just
gonna subtract it out at the end and
then I want to return that sum so this
is you could see like a couple different
ways of doing this right now this is one
way to kind of do this what this is
doing is it's saying let me do a little
loop around here negative one zero
positive one negative one zero positive
one so let me check this this this and
then subtract this out cuz I don't
really want to count that one okay so
now I should be able to I'm gonna just
delete this I've now counted all of the
neighbors I've got a big problem what do
I do with the fact that if I'm on the
edge there's no neighbor to the left if
I'm on the bottom
there's no neighbor below if I'm the top
there's no neighbor to the above on the
right there's no name if I'm in the edge
there's no neighbor to the right so what
I could do there's a bunch of things I
could do I could consider this like an
infinite wraparound world we're like
this neighbor to the right is this this
neighbor to the left is this I could
there's other ways that I could project
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna leave the
edges as fixed values and just not
bother to check them which is I so what
I'm gonna do here is I am going to I
wanted to do like I was gonna do this
loop like this you know what let's do
the wraparound do I do
no no let's do it the simple way first I
was like I'll be just add the wraparound
code because I could add the wraparound
code here but let me know maybe I'll
leave that as an exercise or do that
later so the issue is you know what I
really want I think then what I want the
problem is if I change this loop so I
have to I have to treat the edges
differently Oh some but so much
heartache here but I I can say what I'm
gonna do here is I'm gonna say oh this
is the drawing well all right this is
the computation so I'm gonna say if I
equals 0 or I equals columns minus 1
minus 1 or J equals 0 or J equals rows
minus 1 these are this is like all of
the edges I'm just gonna treat them
differently I'm gonna say next
i J equals grid I J so I'm just gonna
keep the same values from before this is
not a great solution but it's a quick
one that I can do right now so I'm if
I'm all on an edge I'm just going to use
the same value because now what I could
do is say look at this my state is grid
I J now it's time for me to implement
those rules right okay if my state is
zero and three neighbors are alive
change my state to 1 if state equals 0
and neighbors equals 0 then next I J
equals 1 okay that's rule number one if
not not 0 equals 3 ok now what else if
I'm alive and less than 2 or greater
than 3 or live then change my state to 0
else if my state is 1 and neighbors is
less than 2 or neighbors is greater than
3 and I probably should put a little
parentheses around that one and again
I'm sure they're like some nicer ways I
could write this in a more
sytze way but you can see this is the
rule right if I'm alive and I have less
than two or greater than three neighbors
then the new state is zero in all other
cases the next state is just the current
is just the current state okay so and
this makes me want to put this up here
at the top so that I can also just use
this here so that's the state right the
state this is the current state if I'm
in edge just ignore me on the same state
if I'm not an edge count all the
neighbors check if I should change my
state or stay the same I'm singing the
chat there's a typo at neighbors in the
first if thank you
neighbors okay what's the chance I've
actually finished this so there we go
I think I have mostly all the code for
it okay count is not defined sketch
touches line 55 oh right because I
called it count neighbors which is a
better name for the function than counts
try that cannot read property negative
one of undefined at count neighbors so
what is undefined
oh no no wow look at this this is a big
mistake right what was I doing here this
loop negative right this loop which goes
which is basically a loop for like a
little subsection right if this is x and
y right i is an offset negative 1 to
positive 1 j is an offset negative 1
it's a positive 1
the cells I'm looking at are not IJ but
X + I + y + J because I'm just looking
relative to what that XY point is so
that was a big mistake here this should
be X plus I Y plus J oh so close
count neighbors at drawers get 55 look
Oh see it's 9:55 count neighbors way
will cannot reap repartee negative one
of under five what's undefined grid
neighbors hmm okay hold on let's look at
some stuff here or if j0o look at this I
just keep going anyway so this I really
I need to break out of the loop so this
is really like I'm done leave the loop
or continue or something I don't know
I'm gonna I'm just gonna put an elf in
here as much as I hate that so because I
shouldn't be I'm basically doing the
edges or the neighbors but this will be
much nicer if I just in this function
add some code to deal with a wraparound
which is not going to be that hard to do
so but now it should be good there we go
the game of life now it looks weird
because the edges aren't ever changing
but this is actually now the game of
life working I really got to implement
this wraparound thing so let's do that
now let's fix it so that the edges
consider the other sides as neighbors so
how do I do that well one way to do that
is with something called modulus this is
really this is great and I can refer you
to goal on leavens guest tutorial video
on modulus which was made as part of
this channel so I will link to that but
basically what I'm saying here is if I
have ten columns 0 through 9 what could
and I'm always looking for the neighbor
plus one right so 0 plus 1 is 1 1 plus 1
is 2 etc etc etc 9 plus 1 is 10 but I
want the neighbor to be 0 well guess
what 9 plus 1 modulus 10 equals 0
because modulus is the operator that
gives you the remainder of division 10
divided by 10 is 1 remainder 0 so I
encourage you to watch that modulus
video if you're not familiar with
modulus so this will actually work
almost getting closer if I say
I'm gonna just say like I'm gonna have a
new I need like a new variable name for
X plus I guess I could say column
I don't like column and I'm gonna say X
plus I modulus columns and row equals y
plus J modulus rows so this gets me
close it doesn't get me all the way
there but it gets any close so now I'm
adding it up like this and I'm gonna I'm
gonna get rid of this whole edges thing
because no longer okay so I got to get
this now I'm gonna have an error here
right I'm still getting like an
out-of-bounds error because I'm going to
need one why because what if in the case
of I equal negative 1 so what is its if
if I is zero right so let me come to the
console here 10 modulus 10 is 0 but
let's say I'm looking for the left
neighbors so I'm going through negative
1 negative 1 modulus 10 is negative 1
but I need that to be 9
I need negative 1 to be 9 well guess
what if I actually just add the number
of columns to everything right if I'm
actually working with the numbers
instead of the numbers 0 through 9 the
numbers 10 through 19 right 10 minus 1
is 9
modulus 10 is 9 so the formula is
negative 1 is negative 1 plus the number
of columns modulus the number of columns
oh but there's not Ted there's a
different numbers in my system but so
let's let's try to confirm this again
okay the idea is that I have an x and a
y point so that point might be let's say
if it's on an edge for example might be
like 0 comma it's on the left edge might
be something like 0
whatever the why is you know 10 it's
five so this is the x-value and I want
to take X plus I plus the number of
columns modulus the number of columns
they said oh this is gonna be simple but
it's kind of it's really kind of like a
crazy thing to do but you might write
this out and practice it but on your own
I say it will make sense to eventually
so when this is going to work basically
let's say I is going to be the values
negative 1 0 &amp;amp; 1 right X is going to be
the values 0 through 9 if I'm thinking
about all the possible all the possible
columns so let's just take 0 and
negative 1 for example 0 minus 1 plus
and in this case I have 10 columns plus
10 modulus 10 is actually 9 modulus 10
which equals 9 so 0 negative 1 to the
left of it that wraps it around to get
the neighbor on the right right does it
work for just any arbitrary thing in the
middle like if I take I to be 3 sorry if
I take if I take sorry X to be 3 3 minus
1 plus 10 modulus 10 we'll see how this
10 intended kind of cancels itself out
can you see that am i off the whiteboard
I'm close to being off the whiteboard
that equals 2 right because this is 12
modulus 10 is 2 so this actually works
and then what if I'm on the edge if I'm
at like 9 right if X is 9 9 plus 1 is 10
plus a number of columns is 10 is 20
modulus columns 20 divided by 10 is 2
remainder 0 0 so 9 to the right gets its
neighbor zero so this is kind of goofy
it like shifts everything over so it can
kind of look across the edge so I'm this
is going to work you can believe me or
not believe me but it's going to work
and I'm going to put this in so now what
I want is X plus I plus
columns modulus columns y plus J plus
rows modulus Jo rows add those all up
and the game of life thank you thank you
for watching this study challenge thank
you thank you
so let's try and make you let's try
doing a couple things just to get a
little further here let's let's I don't
know no I'm not gonna do you you do all
the next stuff I'm just curious like let
me make the resolution ten so we can see
that's with the ten so you can see it's
running pretty fast in the browser I
have a pretty slow low resolution so
here's what you should do now I'm gonna
stop this is a perfect opportunity for
people watching this video to make some
variations some things you can think
about well one thing is what if you make
each one of these cells an object so
each state might not actually just be it
can keep track of more than just its
state 0 or 1 it could keep track of
whether it's changed state or stay the
same or how long it's stayed the same
what if you visualize those what if you
visualize with different colors based on
the history of the system what if you
allow a user to draw with the mouse and
set cells on what if you look up some of
these repeating special repeating
patterns that you can create certain
kinds of patterns what if you are you
gonna think of more and what if you did
the edges in a different way what if he
used two floating point numbers instead
of zeros and ones and did like an
average or something there are so many
ways you can create a system lowering
the resolution why don't you drew didn't
draw squares but circles used images
how can you visualize this system how
can you change the rules or how can you
visualize the system in a different way
to create a piece of art or for some
other purpose I look forward to share
what you make in the comments there'll
be the code link from here and a readme
where you can submit your versions and
I'll come back in a future livestream
I'll share some of the community made
versions run this again there's one
other thing but I do think that making
cell objects is a path right right now I
just have and you should probably do the
swapping thing like maybe maybe that's
one other thing
like you really maybe not don't make a
new 2d array every time but what I'm
thinking about here is what if instead
of each one of these being a random
value you said something like new cell I
comma J and this cell object can key can
animate it could move around the stem
cells could move they could grow they
could shrink they could keep track of
their history there's so many
possibilities there if you make an
object for the cell okay thanks for
watching I hope you enjoyed this coding
challenge and you share with me what you
make good bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
