hurt myself too much throughout the
course of this video I'm just gonna
start again hello this is a video about
arrays in Java / processing in fact and
I'm gonna use processing 3 which is a my
new song my new album processing 3
coming out I know many years from now
and I'm not making videos about
programming but making albums about
singing about programming okay so what
is an array why do you want to use one
how does it work and what kinds of
things can you do with it that's the
topic of this video so perhaps you're
familiar with this idea of a variable
int num 7 so you have a variable the
name is num the type is int integer and
the value is 7 but what if you want to
have a whole bunch of numbers you want
to have number one and number two and
number three and number four you'd have
to make all these variables well an
array is essentially a way in a single
variable of having a list of values and
those things can be numbers or pieces of
text it could be an array of images the
list of anything that's a piece of data
in a program you can have a list of that
thing and if you know a side there's an
aside here I'm not gonna talk about
objects in this video but a raisin
objects is a particularly powerful thing
link below then I will make sure to add
to videos about the raisin objects okay
so how do you make this list well with a
variable you always need a name and a
type so with an array an array is a
variable but it's a list of you know I
think of a variable as a single value
and array is like a list of values
anyway so we think the array which I'll
call nuns you also need to give it a
name nums and a type integer but you add
this extra bit of syntax square bracket
square bracket square bracket so look on
your keyboard now the square
brackets if you haven't used them before
you're going to need them a lot with
arrays so now I have an array of numbers
and I can initialize it instead of as a
sing
all value I can use curly braket 7 comma
5 comma negative 32 comma 90 so now you
can see I have an array of 1 2 3 4
values so I'm gonna go start a sketch
and add this whoops look over here to
start a sketch in adness so I'm gonna
say at the top int nums equals and I'm
gonna make them like 34 40 10 5
arbitrary numbers and you can see here
there we go that's the syntax for an
array now there are other ways you can
initialize an array you can use a loop
I'm gonna get to that in a little bit
this is just one way to start off this
list of values so now the comes the
question over here if I wanted to use
the vowel let's say I want to use that
value num so to draw an ellipse at 100
comma 50 and with a size num so I wanted
to use this particular value to be the
size of a circle I just take that
variable and I put it in the width and
height arguments of the ellipse function
so what if I want to use this one or
this one or this one some value from
this list from this array ellipse 100
comma 50 hmm num what pretending like I
have to figure this out the issue is
this is a single value so you can put it
right here it needs to be a single value
here I need to address one of these
particular values and the way that I do
that is with an index an index is an
address into the array it's like
counting the array you say like here's
number 1 number 2 number 3 number 4 I
except I've got a problem here I mean
actually I have a this makes me very
happy but it's a weird thing how you
count with arrays in programming you
could think of this as having four
elements there's the first element the
second element what I've told you is
accurate however counting with arrays
this is technically index 0 so when
you're counting
elements of the array you start with
zero not with one so this is element 0
this is element 1 this is element 2 and
this is element 3 the index values go
from 0 to 3 with a total of 4 elements
so to individually address one of these
nuns index 3
once again the square brackets square
brackets are just the syntax of arrays
I'm gonna have an array UNAM addressing
not the third element right index number
3 which is technically the fourth
element and now if you look at this this
line of code will draw a circle of size
7 and this line of code will draw a
circle of size 90 if I change this to 1
I'll get 5 I change it to 0 I'll get 7
so that's piece number 1 let's go and
add that here into this program and so
now I'm gonna say void setup I'm gonna
say size 400 400 and I'm going to in
draw I'm gonna say background 0 and fill
255 and then I'm going to say ellipse at
you know a hundred comma 200 nums
index 1 nums index 1 so he zoom back out
here and run this code and look at the
result and you can see here
tah-dah I'm doing like singing today I
don't know why and that's not really
singing sing tada but whatever the the
the size of that circle is what 30 40 0
is 31 is 40 the size is 40 let's see it
get a little bit quite if I change this
to nums index 2 now look at that I've
got a tiny one yeah there's a few things
I could add to this and I'm not sure
which direction to go in but I'm gonna
go in a certain direction this is the
direction I'm going in right now let's
let's draw a circle with all of those
so there are four elements 0 1 2 3 0 1 2
3 hmm
now let's draw them a little bit spaced
out at 100 200 300 400 and I'll make a
size 500 now look at this and let's make
these numbers a little bit bigger 50 92
so you can see what's going on here
if we zoom the screen in a little bit
just to look at all of this I've got
four circles at different xvalues 100
200 300 400 each circle is pulling its
width and height from that array index 0
index 1 index 2 and X 3 so this is
working for this is a nice idea and I
will talk about this for seven minutes
but this is and this works well like
this is sort of like helping us instead
of having 4 separate variables I have a
single variable with a list of four
items but I still have four lines of
code down here which is kind of
ridiculous right I mean it's not
ridiculous but it's it's it's the
problem comes up what if I have a
hundred values in that array what if I
have 200 values in that array I don't
want to have 200 lines of code
however you'll notice there's a kind of
logic here start with 0 go to 1 go to to
go to 3 this is kind of counting do you
remember
I don't know where you've come from or
why you're watching and if there's
enough light in here if you but anyways
do you remember there was a time where
you hopefully probably learned about a
for loop and if you didn't I will link
you to a video about a for loop below
where you wrote something like this or
I've done this many times for int I
equals 0 I is less than 4 I plus plus
now if is like a terrible pen if I were
to put much better print line I write in
here this loop would run and first it
would print out the value of 0 then 0 go
up by 1 it would print out the value 1
then 0 would go up by 2 and this then it
would print out the value 2 and then up
by 100 was print out of value 3 we get
we get 0 1 2 3 then I would be 4 4 is
not less than
or the loop would exit so notice how a
four loop is a structure that can be
used to count a variable from zero up to
some limit like four well this is
exactly the structure that we need over
here so if I come back to this code and
I say for int I equals zero I is less
than 4 I plus plus and then I grab this
I take this line of code and put it here
well now couldn't I replace that index 0
with I so this loop and only I give
myself a little more space here this
loop you can comment this out this loop
is now doing the job of what this code
did before instead of manually having to
type 0 1 2 3 this loop uses I to do
numbers I know 0 num nums 1 numbers 2
times 3 now let's run this and see what
happens
ok so that worked it but it looks wrong
why does it look wrong ah all the
circles are at value 100 and I wanted
the circles to be at 100 200 300 400
well over here remember the loop is
counting I 0 1 2 3 what happens if I
multiply each of those numbers by 100
times 100 times 100 times 100 I get 0 I
get 100 I get 200 I get 300 oh but I
wanted 100 200 300 400 I know why don't
I just add 100 to each of these so you
can see another thing we can do I might
be the index into the array 0 1 2 3 but
we can also apply some math to I to do
other interesting things like here
instead of now saying 100 what if I were
to say I times 100 that gives me 0 131 0
100 200 300 and then what if I add 100
to that then I have 100 200 300 400
so let's now run this and we have
exactly what we had before with albeit
only these values now
one thing I should mention two things I
should mention 350 things I should
mention but you know this has been going
on for 11 minutes it's gonna be a little
bit of a longer video because I think
I'm gonna try to cover everything you
know just sort of all the erase stuff
just in this video but there's a couple
things I should mention one is I don't
love that I have the number 4 there are
a hard-coded value what if I were to add
more values to the array I still would
only loop through four of them so one
thing you could do with an array is nums
dot length let me just turn off the code
completion so nums dot length
dynamically resolves to the length of
the array so if I were to add another
one you know
Sept 75 you can see I've added an extra
value an extra number which got me an
extra circle and now it's looping
through the entire rate it's always
using the length and you know I could
space them out a little bit less like
let's space them out just by 50 so we
can see ah now they're kind of crowded
together aha but what was the other
thing I want to show here well this is
one way to initialize an array I just
give it some hard-coded numbers in
between those curly brackets however
what I might actually like to do more
often and I'm trying to think of where
to do this is give the array initial
values that maybe are random so let's
say there were eight values and I want
to say nums index I equals int random
somewhere between 10 and 100 so this is
this is code that is filling the array
with a random number loop starting from
zero all the way up to eight pick a
random number between 0 and 100 and and
put that in the array but a funny thing
about arrays is that you you have to
specify in advance the size you want
that array to be now there are ways
around this and ways of expanding
contracting an array and have other
videos that cover that but for the
purpose of this discussion right now the
array is it has a fixed length so we saw
that one way to get that fixed length is
to just manually type in the
aliens but what if you don't know the
values in advance you just want to know
how many things should be in there well
the syntax for doing that is a little
bit goofy looking but if you're not
filling it manually between the curly
brackets what you need to say is you
want a new integer array with like a
hundred spots in it so this is your
number to make up so this seems very
redundant I'm having an integer array
called nums which is a new integer array
with a hundred spots in it but two
things are going on here
this is declaring your intention to have
an array and this is actually creating
the array allocating the space in the
computer's memory to store 100 values so
if I come back over here I can change I
I can change this top code here to say
new int 8 I want eight spots nums length
and let's just clean up how we're
drawing this I'm gonna say no fill and
stroke 255 so we can kind of see and
let's make them a little thicker I know
this is very silly but strokeweight 4 so
the point of what I wanted to show you
is that now you can see here every time
I run this sketch I'm going to get a new
result every time I'm going to create an
array with 8 spots every time I'm going
to fill that array with 8 random numbers
and then I'm going to always look
through that array and draw a circle
using each element from the array so
here we go run it again just to see look
at those differently sized circles run
it again look at those differently sized
circles so for you you know I might
think of a couple exercises here to try
number one is what if your array instead
of having numbers in it maybe maybe you
know about strings maybe you don't but
what if you made an array with strings
in it hello my friend right this is an
array with three strings three sequences
of characters so could you display every
time
you run the sketch a random one of those
strings in the center of the canvas
window or could you do something as you
click the mouse you see one message one
at a time how would you do that so those
are two interesting exercises to try
this particular scenario that I've made
here I'm looping through the entire
array each time but what if you just
want to use one number one at a time or
one string one at a time that's enough
that's one thing you can look at the
other thing that I think is crucial to
mention is that one reason to learn this
is that the all the stuff in the window
that you're seeing here is an array of
pixels an array of colors so underneath
the hood of a processing sketch of an
image that you might load or an image
you might get from a camera all the
colors of that image are stored in one
giant array and you can loop through
that entire array to read all those
colors and manipulate those colors so
I'll also include a link below to online
tutorial and some other videos about
images and pixels that you can look at
that this will give you kind of the
foundation for okay so hopefully this
video was helpful and you saw a little
bit of processing 3 and some nice
circles and a strangely colored shirt
that doesn't really blend in with the
background yes see look you can see the
background nobody cares about that but
it's interesting to me and I'm gonna say
goodbye now before that camera shuts off
