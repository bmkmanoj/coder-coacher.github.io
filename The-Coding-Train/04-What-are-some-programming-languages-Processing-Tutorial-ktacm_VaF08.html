videos away from actually opening up a
processing window and typing in some
lines of code running our code and
having our first computer program but um
I think before we do that I want to talk
about something which is ok it let's
just say it's time to learn programming
then the big question arrives what
programming language should I learn
what's my project what am i doing what's
the right environment what's the right
language and this this is a question
that's loaded with anxiety and confusion
and what if I'm learning the wrong thing
and should I be really learning this and
and and this this I just want to say a
general comment first before we start
talking about programming language there
is no perfect programming language there
is no perfect programming environment
that will do everything you always
wanted to do it is perfect and exactly
right for the particular project you're
making and often the answer to that
question is you know the answer the
question what programming language
should you use it's the one that you
just sort of feel comfortable with and
it kind of looks good and kind of like
you're happy to get started and the one
that you're using right now better to be
writing code and making something than
to be spending all day worrying about
trying to find that perfect language so
in a sense one answer is pick something
get started you can learn this language
and try this one later and another one
later it doesn't really matter but for
us we have to come to a decision and in
many ways I'm picking a programming
language an environment which is one
that I'm comfortable with it's one that
I work on it's one that I've known for
many years it's not perfect Frigg and so
that's what you will be learning and
hopefully you will find other languages
and environments in your life and this
will have helped you to that end so
let's just first though okay so let's
think about what what are what are
what's what's the kind of map of
programming languages that are out there
and what what are the super pros and
cons and advantages and disadvantages of
using different languages
hello okay so one thing you can look at
I'll provide a link to this this is a
nice little chart called the history of
programming languages I think it's
available from O'Reilly and we can first
at least see like back here 1954 the
invention of Fortran which you can see
right here we can start to kind of like
scroll around this thing and see that
there are zillions of languages and they
have various relationships and they're
all funny names like Oberon and ANSI C
and ADA and all sorts of stuff the other
thing I should point out about this nice
little graph chart is that it ends in
2004 so a lot has happened by the way in
the last ten years nine or ten years
there's a lot of other languages a lot
of other innovations or this chart if
you were to continue it would get even
bigger and crazier but you know just
looking at it you realize like oh it's
like it's totally overwhelming look how
many languages there are we could also
kind of go to Wikipedia there's a nice
kind of comparison of programming
languages page and you can scroll down
and see like look at all these possible
languages there are zillions of them so
I think we can kind of make our own
little list just to kind of you know
you've probably heard this would be the
moment where I'd say hey everyone out
there the three of you watching this
video you know raise your hand and shout
out a programming language that you've
heard of and you might say like you know
Pascal probably none of you have heard
of Pascal but Pascal
oh boy this pen doesn't work Pascal
there we go um you might say C you might
say Java you might even say something
like oh what is what's this thing
assembly language or machine language
I'll write assembly language down here
and you might say oh what about
ActionScript and you might have even
learned something or heard of some
things probably you have but the first
programming one of the first programming
languages I learned actually was a lingo
which was the programming language of
Macromedia sector which I believe still
exists anyway so we could start making
this list and I kind of started doing
this I think I probably put Pascal in
the wrong place but what I'm one of the
things that I want
talk about with this kind of list of
program languages and what you might
pick I'm going to say C++ objective-c is
this idea of low level versus high level
and this is kind of a low level low
level high level this is an important
concept that comes up in thinking about
programming languages right so
essentially like let's say you want to
write the low is the lowest level
possible code like you were a completely
insane person who wanted to just like
torture yourself for eternity you would
you would say like I'm only going to
write my computer program as a sequence
of zeros and ones right because
ultimately so here's my you know this
execute this code it's amazing it's
beautiful up here this is my program
right and I guess you can't see it
because I wrote off the edge of the
screen but um let's just say this is
your program right uh what am i sorry
but okay this is like the lowest
essentially everything that executes on
your computer all data is stored all
instructions are stored as a sequence of
zeros and ones but this is unrealistic
how could you possibly really be
expected to write software just as a
series of zeros and ones so there's
generally a process where you want to be
able to write your code in a
higher-level way the ultimate like if
I'm creating a graphics application
which is what we're going to be doing
the really high level program might say
it might be written like this draw read
draw a square on the screen that's like
medium sized and red colored and draw a
circle that's really big and blue that's
very high level it really is like
English and what happens is there's a
compiler that will take that high level
code and translate it into machine
language so assembly language is kind of
one of the lowest level programming
languages that people use C when C came
around C was often referred to this kind
of like oxymoron type way as a
high-level low-level language meaning
it's high-level in that you're writing
code that starts to have higher-level
more English like constructs but it
still allows really low-level access to
the computer direct access to the
computer's memory lots of stuff that you
can do and it makes it very very very
you can execute very very fast so anyway
that's just kind of an important concept
to realize most of the languages that I
haven't kind of written up here which
I'll kind of like add over here like if
you might have heard of like Ruby
JavaScript Python you know we can keep
going here we could write lots of others
these aren't all generally high level
programming languages now there's
another kind of interesting little
component that I think that I'll mention
which is this idea of a language that's
compiled versus interpreted health in
many ways I almost want to stop myself
and not talk about this because we don't
really these are some details that when
we're first learning to program we're
going to put aside we just want to like
write the code run it make stuff happen
but it's something to think about as you
start to get into this larger world of
programming languages so let's say
you're writing a program in C right you
write out the the text-based
instructions in your high-level language
that program gets compiled down into the
sort of lowest level program which is
like one level below assembly language
which is machine language the zeros and
ones then it can be run this is great it
makes it run it makes it run very very
very fast but it's it's it's it's
different than some languages that we
have now that are interpreted JavaScript
being one of those which a language
that's interpreted it's actually while
the program is running it's reading your
code line by line and executing the
program this allows for things like live
coding right if a program is actually
reading the code as it's running you
could change the code as it's running
and the program would change in real
time which cannot happen in a compiled
language because you've got to write
your code compile then run it so the
reason why I mentioned this is we're
using prop we're going to use processing
boy I'm um which am i recording yet
we're going to use processing which is
an art code is actually going to be
compiled before it's run which is
something we'll see as we start to first
write our programs another topic that I
want to bring up is this idea of client
side versus server side programming this
is this is an important question because
you know you you might have project
ideas in your head things that you want
to make and one thing might be I have
this idea for this kind of interactive
exhibit about dinosaurs for a science
museum and in that sense you might be
building a client-side application a
desktop application that's going to run
maybe it reads some pixels from a camera
so the user can interact with it and it
draws some dinosaur footprints to the
screen or something like that you might
also have an idea for I have this
website I want to make where the user
enters all this information about
personal information about themselves
and it gives them back their horoscope
right so these are different
applications and require a different set
of programming languages for them and
one thing that is we can see here I mean
on this idea of anytime you go to a web
page if this is my web browser and you
type in you know google.com and you
search for something you are sending a
request to a server in the cloud which
it's not really a cloud it's an
underground bunker basically with some
servers but we can think of it as a nice
cloud floating in the sky um where a
program a server-side program a
server-side program executes and returns
information back to you so you can see
the result in the browser this is
different than perhaps there being an
animation in the browser that's running
that you click on and when you click on
it it makes little pretty fireworks that
might be something written in JavaScript
that is executing on the client-side
this animation that's running locally on
your computer and reading your mouse
clicks the server-side programming is
this thing that happens when you ask for
requests the program runs it sends you
data back perhaps that's written in
Python now there are lots of different
languages and some languages you can
write you know JavaScript you can write
client-side
programs JavaScript you can write
server-side programs it's something
called nodejs what's that language
specific but conceptually there's a
different thing going on here are you
writing a program that's executing
locally on your laptop you know here I
have my prop here right here there is a
program running on this laptop it is
drawing pixels to the screen that is a
client-side program there is a program
running somewhere else on a server
that's you know sending the information
to back about like how excellent my job
was this morning or whatever from some
you know RunKeeper website or whatever I
guess I just plugged rope-keeper I like
it
that's a server-side program so this is
an important consideration when you're
learning programming languages and
you're creating applications with them
and this is something you want
familiarity with both client-side and
server-side this video series that I'm
doing while we will refer to and
demonstrate some examples that involve
server-side programming later on is
really focused on client-side programs
we are going to be writing applications
that open a window on your computer
screen draw pixels draw text draw things
to that window and that you can interact
with on your laptop so we're really
learning a client-side which i think is
an important thing to note and this
brings up kind of where this we're kind
of finishing off here so if you want to
do stuff for the web there are lots of
fantastic resources out there for you to
learn web programming javascript is a
terrific programming language to learn
that has lots of applications Python is
another fantastic language to learn as a
beginner but we're going to use
something called processing and I'm
going to write processing right here and
I'm going to draw like a weird little
arrow there that's pointing back to Java
so what is processing processing saying
it really should be able to say it
processing was developed was created in
2001 by Casey Reese and Ben fry while
they were students at the MIT MIT Media
Lab under John Maeda so what processing
really started as was hey we need
something to make these projects where
make
let's make something and so processing
is this really nice simple environment
you can download it it's kind of all in
one you can open it you can type some
code you can run it it works so I'm
going to get to that in a second
the more about kind of like why does
we're using processing but let's just
think you probably heard this term now
creative coding so we the term creative
coding start I think as a kind of
catch-all phrase for people making
creative applications with code trying
to make art trying to make installations
trying to make weird obscure impractical
crazy ideas and you know there's lots of
discussion now is this a good term is
this a bad term you can think of it
one thing I heard I think from Jer Thorp
was you could think of it as creative
writing right the process of writing for
creep the process of writing code for
creative applications there's also now
the term poetic computation which I
think is interesting there but anyway
there are lots of environments and I'll
draw a line here you might have heard of
something called open frameworks you
might have heard of something called
cinder these are creative coding
environments program these are libraries
frameworks for writing code in your code
though is really in C++ C++ even with
all of its advantages
in terms of having low-level access to
the machine is a very hard language to
get started in right from the beginning
you have to a you have to manage that
memory there's lots of stuff you have to
learn about that's like these things
called pointers there's you've got to
I'm using these environments in addition
to writing C++ you've got to use on the
Mac something called Xcode the
development environments which are
larger and more complex so I want to use
in this video series something that's a
bit simpler that we can kind of get
started with a bit more quickly but
these are terrific environments with a
lot of similar qualities to to
processing the other thing you might
have heard of which i think is
dimension is something called max/msp
jitter I don't know I don't know like
where I wrote this here I'm going to put
this over here somewhere
max/msp jitter and there's also
something called PDR pure data these are
known as dataflow programming
environments and the interesting thing
about dataflow programming environments
is you actually aren't writing your code
as text you're essentially designing a
flowchart for how your program should
run you're putting a box on the screen
and then giving that box some inputs and
then connecting some data to those
inputs and that box might have an output
which goes to another box and it looks
like an interesting little alien pair so
this is actually really fantastic and
for many people they find that many
people find this way of programming more
intuitive and easier to do it certainly
works wonderfully for audio applications
because if you think about how an audio
app and you know if you built audio
system physically you have a bunch of
mixers and instruments and cables and
things have inputs and outputs and go
through stuff and eventually make it to
a speaker and then it comes out so this
idea of writing an audio application
with a dataflow programming environment
is a and you can certainly do graphics
applications and many other things I
would encourage you to look at a Maximus
P and PD so there is this huge world of
stuff and you could spend your life
learning every programming language you
could also spend your life worrying
about oh my god which one should I use
so I'm going to say to you right now
stop worrying if you feel like a um pure
like the way this video series is going
go to go to another resource online and
learn a different programming language
but what I what we're going to use is
processing and I'm going to very briefly
now show you kind of the core basic
reason of the court that's one of the
core reasons why processing is going to
work well here for learning to program
and so let me walk over here and I'm
going to switch over to the desktop so
processing is just an application I've
downloaded it it's already sitting here
on the machine where do you download it
I guess I might as well
show you this right now if you go to
processing org you can actually click
here to download processing I guess I'll
mention that processing is a nonprofit
foundation you can make a donation when
you download and that donation is tax
deductible but it is available for free
you are not required by any means to
donate and I would imagine maybe when
you're just first trying it out you want
to see if you like it first but the
other thing I should mention here is all
of these creative coding environments
open frameworks cinder processing these
environments live in this rich landscape
of open source so what is this mean for
it to be open source it means not only
can you get the are you getting this
software these these these things are
available to you for free oh the
open-source doesn't have to be free
anyway but um if that the source code
how these things are written right these
are libraries in their applications you
can actually go and read the source code
contribute to them it is all completely
open to you and all of this stuff is
available on something called github
which is a website essentially for
sharing open source projects but I
digress this is where you can get
processing and download it once you have
it on your machine you can run the
application and you can see here when
you run it you're going to get this
window like this and if i zoom in all
the way here we can see there's this
nice little button called run and if I
were to actually just run press run
right there we get this little window
and look here it is our very first
computer program we've ever written
right there it is it's running it opened
this window and look at the code it's
amazing it's like the emperor's new code
or ever there's nothing there
so the obviously the next steps were
going to get to in the future videos
we're still in this sort of introductory
place but you could just skip right
ahead is what are we right there what
are we right there and what is it what
happens and and but but what's one and
I'll just write one line of code just
demonstrate this and this is what one of
the nice things about using processing
is we are able to just write our code
really simply in this interface run it
and we get
our window and everything just kind of
works really we can kind of get up and
running with that really quickly
okay so there's so much more to say
about processing and why we're using it
I guess what I'm gonna but I think this
video has gone on for quite a bit of
time to kind of ramble through a lot of
things so we're gonna commonly when they
get to a bit more about processing the
reference of how it is that you're
really learning Java while you're
writing processing well I think we'll
get to that as we as we as we start
learning in some of the future videos
okay the next video I think I'm actually
going to continue this thread by show
you a kind of a range of projects and
things that are made with processing and
computational media that might help you
start to think about the kinds of
projects you might make while following
along with these videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
