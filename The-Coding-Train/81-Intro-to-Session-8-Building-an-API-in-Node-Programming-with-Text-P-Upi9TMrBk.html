programming from A to Z in this session
I want to talk about and look at more
deeply how to build an API using nodes
so this whole course has focused on
working with text reading text analyzing
text generating text and most of the
stuff almost everything that I've shown
you happens in client-side JavaScript so
let's talk about a little bit just
generally what the difference is so if
you have a laptop that you're working on
and it has a web browser in it you might
be running your p5.js sketch right there
in the browser itself so this is going
to get you very far there is so much you
can do with just this as we've seen now
you can do word counting and Markov
chains and all sorts of projects but
there are some limitations here so for
example let's just go back and think
about word counting so one of the things
we did is okay so you have some text
document and you want to count how many
times each word appears in that text
document and visualize it in some way
with your p5.js sketch this will work
just fine all client-side unless and
unless a couple of things one is where
is this data coming from if you have a
little text file that you can put on
your server great but what if this is
instead of one text file what if this is
1,000 or 100,000 or 1 million fun I need
that like Austin Powers music 1 million
text files you know it's going to be
kind of unreasonable to expect the
client side just your p5.js guests in
the browser to sit there and churn
through millions of text files for 10
minutes a half an hour and then produce
the result this is where server-side
programming can come in and now the
platform that I'm going to use for
server-side programming is note is no
dot J's of course they're a variety of
ways you can approach server-side
programming so okay so there's a lot of
pieces to this so one thing that we've
established is if you have a really
large
data set perhaps server-side programming
is going to help you here's another
thing what if you have users entering in
their favorite words and you're there
you have your mad libs application and
they're entering words nouns adjectives
to generate stories what if you want
every time the user comes back to be
able to see what they entered before or
what if you want when a user comes comes
to the page we'll see what everybody has
entered this is also so large these are
some reasons for server-side programming
is large data set another one is
persistence and I don't know how to
spell that
persistence meaning saving data and
there's a variety of ways you can save
data but with client-side JavaScript
only while you can download data to that
users local computer there's no way to
save data across multiple sessions using
a particular web application so this
server is a place where if we could send
data to the server it could be saved on
the server in you know what's known as a
database so these are some pieces to why
you need server-side programming now
here's another reason what if you want
to expose everything your data or your
algorithm or the thing you're working on
to other users as an API this is another
reason why you might want server-side
programming and this is mostly what I'm
going to focus on in this particular
week 8 set of session 8 however I'm
going to kind of look at all of these
pieces by the time I get to the end of
it but this idea of maybe you have a
this wonderful spreadsheet of all of
this information about flowers and you
want to allow other people to make
queries go to flower API comm slash
chrysanthemum or flower API comm slash
sunflower and receive JSON back with all
this information about flowers this is
something you're going to want
server-side programming for as well and
this is going to be the focus here it
was one of the thing on my mind
and I'm trying to kind of come up with
it
API persistent large dataset aha
I thought of it I'm gonna say I'm gonna
just say scraping but um and with
persistence by the way could be kind of
like user accounts and all that sort of
stuff but I'm kind of staying away
mostly from like traditional web
development here and looking at kinds of
creative applications of this stuff but
I'm saying scraping because one thing
you might have noticed is in p5.js if
you try to do the bane of your existence
might be this this is this thing called
cores or you might see it as like xml
httprequest
error you might have tried to load image
from some URL or load strings or load
JSON you get this error I can't do it
security cross-origin resources sharing
not allowed inaccessible stopstopstop so
there's a lot of times where the
client-side for security very good
security reasons is not allowed to reach
to another server and request data but
your server-side program is allowed to
do that so your surfers from so for web
scraping for example if you want to look
at a webpage download all of its HTML
parse it out pull out some things you
want you can do that from server side
and pass that to the client side so
these are kind of four reasons why you
might want to use server-side
programming number three being make your
own API this is where in many ways I
want to start okay so what are the
pieces of this the first thing that I
want so I'm going to make a bunch of
videos and then we'll eventually be here
on YouTube for you to watch or I don't
know what the platform of the future is
when YouTube goes away but hopefully the
videos will still exist
number one I'm going to talk about what
I have a bunch of videos that I will
link to in this playlist of kind of what
is node and what is NPM for node package
manager so you need to install node and
get up and running with something called
NPM first and I already have the videos
made for that which I will reference and
link to somehow but here I'm going to
start with a node package called Express
which makes building a web server which
is what you're going to need the score
the web servers the thing that's going
to pass information to but your client
your p5.js sketch or somebody else is
making an API query so we need to look
at Express I want to look at saving data
and I got like a secret
you which is one of the easiest way I'm
sure someone Gavin get struck by
lightning for doing it this way but to
add it a really easy way to have a
database it's just save a JSON file say
the text file to the hard drive of the
computer and then load it every time the
server run so I'm going to look at the
simplest way you can have a database and
then some other more complex ways maybe
using a database system like couchdb or
MongoDB and then something called
firebase
which is a Google product that allows
you to just send them information they
say before you can request it later I
want to look at some point at scraping
other web pages so how could you grab an
image and then pass that to p5.js or an
HTML page and pass that to p5.js there's
a lot of topics here about making an API
there's this thing called rest I don't
even know what that is
try to figure it out together there's
the thing called cores cross-origin
resource sharing which I think I dunno
what it is and then I want to look at a
bunch of different examples mostly
around working with text to follow the
theme of this course so what if you what
if you had the sort of Big Data scenario
where you need to load massive amounts
of text and you want to pass to a user
word counting it for you want to pass to
make an API for word counting
information so that's something that I
look at as well as I want to build an
API for sentiment analysis using this a
fin 111 a list of words I'm gonna have a
couple of examples that use that use a
node package called node natural which
is another text analysis natural
language processing node package which
has a lot of great features and I'll
show you a couple of them here so I'm
gonna get started in the first next
video you know this isn't the order that
I'm going to go and I'm really going to
focus on working with Express setting up
this idea of an API and then see if I
can transition that into a simple
sentiment analysis intimate analysis API
and we will see how that goes okay see
you next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
