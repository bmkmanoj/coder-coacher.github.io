a loop but it is not the video you think
it is it is not the next one which is
about nested loops which is also about a
loop within a loop this is about a
different kind of loop within a loop
which is something very specific to
processing and animation programs which
I just feel is important to mention
because it is a source of confusion when
you're first beginning to program
animations and repeat things in your
code I hit the microphone so you might
have heard a loud noise we're gonna use
a different audio source of my finger as
they went by there so who does anyway I
could just start over but I can't I just
have to keep going okay so here's the
thing what do I mean by loop within a
loop in this video which is not about
nested loops I mean this remember a
while back in a video about flow we
talked about setup at the beginning of
your program draw about the thing that
loops forever well this is a loop this
loops over and over again and we just
said okay
we could write loops inside of draw like
wile X is less than with flow x equals 0
and x equals x plus 20 and draw some
sort of line blah blah blah
that's essentially what is happening
over here in this program if I run it we
can see we have this loop that would
says draw a line repeat that a certain
number of times across the screen until
you get to the width spaced out by 20 so
what I mean this may be obvious to you
and if it's obvious to you did awesome
you could just stop now
but what's going on this is a loop and
this is a loop the reason why this gets
confusing is you might have an instinct
to use a loop to animate something for
example what if I want to show one line
at a time first draw the line at zero
then go up by 20 and then draw the line
again then go up by 20 and then draw the
line and go up by 20 this is not the
loop to do that this is for doing
something multiple times within one
animation cycle this outer loop the main
draw loop that's the things they draw at
first then go up by 20 10
again so what I'm asking you as an
exercise and you could pause right now
and try to figure this out is let's look
at this output what if we want to see
one line appear at a time right now when
I run this program and run it again we
just see boom all lines at once I want
to see one line at a time well we still
could use this loop within a loop but we
need to vary something about it so I'm
gonna go no further I'm gonna go further
but I'm gonna first say you know take a
moment to meditate you can pause the
video and you're back so maybe you tried
it maybe you succeeded in maybe you
failed let's take a look at how this is
done so if we want to animate something
your instinct might be well this
animates it and what if I just kind of
like slow it down like I could say like
there's even this function in processing
called delay I can't even mention
there's a function called delay never
use delay but you could say delay like
by a thousand milliseconds which is like
one second I should see them one at a
time come on all it's doing is it's
delaying each time for the lupo we're
not gonna see the result until we get
through the end of draw so this is not
for doing an animation draw is for doing
an animation but let's look at something
interesting it's how did getting
anywhere because that's a lot of lines
at a thousand seconds per line a
thousand milliseconds me as a while
anyway let's get rid of that that's
awful
okay what if let me run this I have
lines all the way across the screen what
if I say X the X condition for loop is
when X is less than width divided by 2
halfway across the screen if I say X is
less than you know 50 I get like two
three lines two or three lines whatever
that is over here okay so what's going
on if I just change this value I get a
different number of lines what should
that tell you that should tell you that
why don't I turn that into a variable
for example what if I said mouse X oh I
have to move the mouse now I have the
number of lines that loop is each time
through draw the loop is happening but
it's happening sometimes a few times
sometimes many times the point is the
outer loop is what's changing it because
it's drawing that loop a certain number
of times the different over times each
time we go through draw this is not
animating this is doing all the ones and
choices the result we get to the end so
where can I start I could add a variable
I could call it end X and I could say
and x equals with R equals zero and I
could put while X is less than end X now
here we go what if I say okay I get
because then X is zero what if I say and
X is 100 now we have this many lines
what if I say and X is 200 now we have
this many lines you should give you a
clue then I don't need to keep typing in
a new value I could just say hey and x
equals and X plus 1 and now when I run
this we see you know what is the value
of index it's going up and up every
frame so it's giving us the appearance
of that loop doing it one at a time but
actually we're doing the loop each time
we're just doing some of the loop then
more of the loop then more of the loop
then more look we're actually doing the
whole loop each time but the whole loop
is a smaller portion and a larger
portion then a larger portion of the
whole window so this is an important
concept which is ok we have alternate
audio sources or hopefully it won't be
so horribly loud but this is an
important concept to realize that this
loop is always executed in its entirety
and the result is shown at the end of
draw so don't get confused the the main
draw loop is for the purpose of
animation we want to vary each time to
that may draw a loop the loop inside of
draw is for repeating an element
multiple times in one frame of animation
ok hopefully that makes sense
this was a little bit you know it's sort
of it feels like I I feel like I
understand it I feel like I don't know
if I communicated that so well but I
could always remake this video and you
