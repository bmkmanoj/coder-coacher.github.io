videos the first set of videos were all
just introductions where are we what's
the world coming to all that kind of
stuff and now we're going to begin
actually looking at the practical
reality of writing code now we're doing
something in this whatever you want to
call it video series which is we are
learning about computer programming the
foundations of computing through the
lens of computer graphics drawing to the
screen so actually in this very first
video in this series of a bunch we're
not going to write instructions just yet
we're going to begin by just feeling
comfortable getting together having a
moment and understanding what it means
to draw pixels to the screen what is the
coordinate system of the screen what
does it mean to draw a point a line a
rectangle how do we actually put stuff
onto that computer window so this should
be a short video we're going to do this
video first then we'll actually look at
opening up processing how processing
works and writing code to implement our
drawings we'll then we'll add color and
do all sorts of other stuff as well so
what's the begin what's the first thing
that we need to understand when we write
our first processing program which
people will eventually call a sketch of
what happens is a window opens and here
is what happened we can represent this
window by drawing a rectangle over here
this is our computer graphics window all
of the instructions were rewrite as we
learn about all the stuff about
foundations of computation we're going
to write instructions that are going to
draw stuff to the screen
you know it's important to note though
that this is a small fraction percentage
of what you can do with computation
write draw make drawings it's just a
nice way to begin and but you know you
shouldn't you should realize that this
you're not limited to this world of
drawing to the screen you will go out
and solve all sorts of interesting
problems and create all sorts of
wondrous things with the power of
computation but we're going to start you
know we're going to be like super
excited when there's you know a red
circle in the middle of the screen we're
going to think we really achieved
something brilliant
ok so this we have this rectangle boy am
i blonde winded um you might have one
time in your life
taking a math course a geometry course
some sort of course where you drew
something that looked like this the
Cartesian coordinate system maybe you
had graph paper even the graph paper is
a great thing for if you have any graph
paper lying around the house go pause go
and get it and pull it out you'll be
very happy at graph paper but when you
have a Cartesian coordinate system you
had something called the x axis
awkwardly gonna walk over here and you
had something called the y axis and then
we could say like oh look there's a
point over here what is that point maybe
it's one two three four five one two
three four and we're going to say it's
hey it's five comma four meeting its x
equals five right with this point over
here them center here being the origin 0
0 right and this is 5 comma 4 and Y
excuse me 1 2 3 4 right this should feel
somewhat intuitive somewhat are familiar
to you right this is this idea you have
this coordinate system and we can locate
spots on the coordinate system by their
numeric horizontal value X by their
numeric vertical value Y we're going to
do the same exact thing in computer
graphics only the coordinate system but
is going to be slightly different you
know one thing I should mention is what
is this point here this point is 1 comma
negative 3 right this is positive 1 2 3
4 negative points down negative 1
negative 2 negative 3 and here's
negative 1 negative 2 negative 3 along
the x axis so we have this idea of this
coordinate system with zero zero in the
center positive x going to the right
positive Y going up now in computer
graphics we have something similar to
this but flipped in with zeros here in a
different place right a computer
graphics window right here's a window
this is actually processing but you can
see we could say hey that's the top left
of this window which is this big
rectangle on the screen the top left of
any computer graphics window is the
origin 0 0 and this is the x-axis going
this way
and this is the y-axis going this way
but we should note something what is
this point this is the point 5 comma 4
right it's it this was 5 comma 4 in this
coordinate system this is 5 comma 4 1 2
3 4 5 1 2 3 4 in this or the system why
it's positive pointing down X is
positive pointing to the right wow
that's kawaii not I don't know I feel
very I feel at ease with this but I
don't know if this makes you
uncomfortable or it's just like oh my
god ok but if you're still talking about
where the point 5 comma 4 is but what we
should note here is it doesn't make
sense to have negative pixels right so
all of the pixels within our window are
positive numbers there's a no there's no
such thing as a negative pixel now of
course all of this could be is going is
going to change as we look at more
advanced environments there are
certainly ways when we get into 3d or
0/0 you want to consider at the center
there are all sorts of reasons why you
might consider negative numbers versus
positive numbers but we're starting at a
very simple nice friendly happy-go-lucky
place where we just have 0 0 in the top
left positive x to the right positive Y
going down now you might be wondering
boy you took a very long time to explain
that and I'm not sure why I did but
hopefully that was helpful um so but the
reason why we really need to be
comfortable with this is because as we
start to write instructions to draw to
the screen the way we're going to say
hey right put a rectangle here at this
XY location with this width in pixels
with this height in pixels draw a line
from this X Y to this XY location so
this idea of being comfortable with in
x-axis or y-axis and the kind of scale
of pixels is important to realize now
let's take this I have an eraser
somewhere let's take this a few steps
further now that we're comfortable with
our coordinate system let's start to
understand how we might write and store
action right we want to draw to the
screen how might we write an instruction
to draw to the screen so let's start
with I'm gonna start with something a
little different than I expected if
that's going to be shocking to you I'm
going to start with a line instead of a
rectangle rectangle is off in the first
example but let's start with a line so
let's say here is our window and the
other thing about a window we need to
define any window we need to define a
width and a height so let's say I think
most of the processing examples tend to
start with a width of 640 pixels and
height of 360 pixels so it's just drawn
relatively to scale so that's all
another thing you want to realize if
this is 0 0 in the top left
what is this pixel in the middle it
would be halfway to 640 which we could
do head math at our head 320 halfway
right down with 360 at the bottom comma
1 eating right so this is what we speed
to start getting used to this idea of
scale right we're not thinking of well
it's 2 meters to the wall or 3 feet this
way we're always going to be thinking in
pixels and generally you know what are
we talking about something that's full
screen which is like 1920 by 1080 or is
it a small window 200 by 200 and really
depends am I making a printed
installation a little like game for the
web what type of scale are you what work
in generally in this scale okay so let's
just say that what we want to do is we
we decided we could design a little
picture by making a bunch of lines you
know maybe the lines are like this we're
going to make a little face where the
nose right so we could imagine that what
if we could draw all these lines on the
screen we could create this pattern of
this very serene face so we need to
understand what does it mean to write it
instruction to draw a line on the screen
and let's actually just even do um let's
just do this I'm going to arbitrarily
make something up I'm drawing little
circles here to indicate the beginning
and end of the line so I don't have
anyone to talk to here but you are kind
of
if you're watching this still somehow
your your your thinking along with me
what do we what what do we need to
define how to draw a line what we're
looking for is how to write the
instruction to draw a line we're going
to once we figure that out we're going
to maybe understand how to write the
instruction to draw a rectangle to draw
a circle to draw a curve to draw a
polygon all sorts of elaborate shapes
and designs that we might want to make
but with a lot you might say hey a lie
is a bunch of pixels between point a and
point B right we call this point a we
can call this point B what do it what do
we need to define each one of those
points and XY we might say this is like
x1 y1 and this is x2 comma y2 right so
if you draw a line we might say draw in
English we might say draw a line between
and here we could say let's make up some
numbers here maybe this is about hundred
two hundred three or four maybe this is
about pixel hundred and this is about
pixel fifty draw a line between 100
comma 52 and maybe this is like pixel
600 and this is pixel like 250 I'm kind
of making this up to 600 comma 250 right
this is how we would write that in
English draw a line between 100 comma 50
to 600 comma 250 draw that line how do
we write this in code we don't know this
is we're learning to program comes in
one of the things we have to learn is
syntax so while we kind of all have a
generic understanding of the syntax of
the English language or whatever
language you might speak in we don't
you're not familiar with the syntax of
processing so I'll show you what it is
this is the syntax line 100 comma 50
comma 600 comma 250 so here you go this
is our first line of code that we are
ever writing our entire lives for
dramatic effect we're saying
in parentheses a number comma not a
number comma nothing overcome another
number parentheses and semicolon and in
fact this is where we begin everything
that we're going to write at this in
this sort of first beginning set of
videos I forgetting that the cameras
there hello has this format it has what
we're going to say is a function name
and you see that yes followed by a
parenthesis followed by some set of
arguments we're going to call these
arguments which are values separated by
commas
ending with the parentheses and ending
with a semicolon what does this mean
exactly you can think of this as a
command for now truly it's a function or
a method or a procedure with lots of
different words for this function I
think will be the word that we use
continuously but we could think of this
as a command
I command you to draw a line arguments
are the parameters that define how we're
going to execute that command right I
could if I'm if I'm trying to program
you I could say walk or I could say walk
fast or I could say walk to this
location fast or this location those are
arguments to the command the function
walk so everything we write and the
first ones we're going to learn are like
rectangle ellipse these are this is we
just did line already and point so this
I think is a nice easy place for us to
start how do we define a rectangle how
do we define an ellipse how do we define
a line how do we define a point what are
the arguments for each one of those we
can then draw rectangles ellipses lines
points so what I would suggest to you
here's your exercise for the end of this
video what you should do is come up with
some design that you would just draw
with pencil and paper Eve uncle's a
graph paper fantastic draw that design
make it simple only use rectangle circle
ellipses circles lines and points and
then try to guess what would the
instructions look like with this
syntax what would the art what arguments
makes sense we're drawing a rectangle
hint the location width and height what
arguments make sense for an ellipse for
a line for a point try to come up with
something and in next video we're going
to start seeing the answer some of these
questions where to start putting this
code into processing executing it and
seeing our first programs run I don't
know I forgot to set a timer so I don't
know how long this was but I was hoping
it's just about five or six minutes and
you probably think that is like 20
minutes long or something anyway I will
see you in the next video if you choose
to watch which is totally reasonable if
you don't I would completely understand
okay thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
