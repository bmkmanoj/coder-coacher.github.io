challenge in this coding challenge I'm
going to program a firework simulation
Oh puh ping and I'm going to program it
from scratch in javascript in the
browser the version that's running
actually behind me is a version that
I've made in processing a Java based
platform the code for the one behind me
and the one that I will make in this
video we'll both be available in links
in the description and at the end of
this video I make I'm hoping to return
back to this processing 1 and also turn
it into 3d fireworks this might have a
three dimensional like quality to it but
it's really just two dimensions ok so
here we go so let me minimize this code
which was the processing version get rid
of that and I have a blank JavaScript
can html5 canvas and I have some
JavaScript code so the first thing that
I need to do is I need to have I want to
have this idea of a particle I need to
have a particle so I'm going to just
write a particle a constructor function
where oh you know what I'm going to do
is I'm going to the particle should have
a position which will be a vector the
particle I need to use physics here is
going to have a velocity which will
right now be just zero and the particle
is also going to have an acceleration so
I'm going to kind of custom bake a
physics engine that's the same sort of
model that I use in all my nature of
code tutorials and videos about physics
but I'm just going to kind of bake this
from scratch really quickly then I'm
going to add a function called update
and that function does what it takes the
velocity and adds it to the position and
it takes the acceleration and adds it to
the velocity now where does it get
acceleration well that I need to have a
function I'm going to call it apply
force and in that function I'm going to
get some sort of force and I'm going to
add that force to the acceleration this
is the idea of force accumulation force
equals mass times acceleration or
acceleration equals acceleration equals
force equals mass times acceleration or
acceleration equals force divided by
mass but I'm analytic mass in for
simplicity so acceleration equals force
are all the forces of a moment added
together so once I do that I also need
to make sure that
after I update the particle each frame
that I multiply its acceleration by zero
to sort of clear it out because the
acceleration at each moment in time is
going to start with zero okay so now I'm
kind of got this both last thing I need
to do with this particle is I need to
have a function of a college show which
draws just for simplicity just draws the
particle at where where a mix it as a
point this opposition dot X and this dot
position dot Y and what I'm going to do
just for one thing I learned recently
about p5 GS which by the time you watch
this video in the future may not really
be the case anymore but if I set this
stroke and the stroke weight up just in
setup and don't set it over and over
again it sometimes can run a lot faster
so just to test that things are working
I'm going to make a variable called a
firework and I'm going to say that
firework is a new particle which lives
in the center of the window and I'm
going to say here in background firework
in drawn a safe fire worked on update
and fireworks show so I want to now go
back to my sketch and see ah I have some
error so particle J s let me make this a
little bit bigger that's really big but
particle J s line number 6 has an error
let's see particles I just this dot
apply force equals OP function is
spelled with a C we refresh there we go
so you can see there's the particle in
the center things are working so far the
next thing I want to do is let me give
let me have this particle start at a
random width and all the way at the
bottom of the window and let me give
that particle a velocity pointing up so
let me say it's velocity is negative 4
pointing up let me run this there we go
we can see it's going up each time i
refresh it it starts in a new random
location and starts going up so we're
getting somewhere the next thing that I
want to do is see if I can add some
gravity so I'm gonna make a gravity a
global variable and it's going to be a
vector that does what it points down so
negative
they don't pointing down as positive so
0 comma I'm going to say 0.2 and then
I'm also going to say firework dot apply
force gravity so I'm now adding gravity
to that particle so let's run this up
acceleration is not defined let's go
back to the particle where this dot
acceleration
I'll always forget to this let me
refresh didn't make it very high but
that's sort of reasonable so let's make
the particles velocity a lot bigger like
negative 10 okay so that's good so we
could see so this is the start of our
fireworks simulation something shooting
up from the bottom and then at some
point it's going to explode and make a
lot of particles but before I could do
that what I want to have is just have a
lot of things shooting up from the
bottom continuously so let's get that
going so instead of having a one the
single firework what I really want is to
have an array of them and actually what
I want is for the firework to be its own
object so I'm going to create a firework
up function sorry and a constructor
function and the first thing I'm going
to do is it's going to have a local
variable which is I so I'm basically
going to do what I did here right I want
it to have in this firework object I
want it to have a particle it's going to
have that particle the firework itself
can have an update function and whoops
what happens in the update function it
does all these things these things it
adds gravity and updates that firework
and then I'm going to also have a show
function for the firework object and I
have a I can see I have a syntax error
and which I'm going to fix in a second
so the idea here is the particle write a
particle is an individual particle this
firework object right now is one
particle but the firework object is also
going to in a moment not just be the
particle moving up but suddenly all the
particles that explode from it so I need
this object to keep track of that
individual particle and then also an
array of particles but this should at
least get me now if I say
firework dot push new firework and then
I should be able to say firework dot I
should be able to say fireworks should
be an array then I should be able say
look at all of the fireworks dot a
length I plus plus and you know I could
use a for each loop but I'm choosing not
to just for clarity update fireworks
index I show okay here we go so now okay
firework is not defined in line six yep
I need that as always I always forget to
this stop this dot this dot I'm going to
do this this dot this dot this dot this
dot song never forget the Vince dot but
somebody could pose that song for me and
ruin this again there can see okay so it
happened and now what I'm going to do is
I have this line of code that puts a new
firework object in the array and I could
put that line of code in draw and if I
put it in draw over and over and over
again it's just making these fireworks
making these fireworks I don't want to
make them that often so I am going to
say if random one is less than point one
so every frame there is a 10% chance of
making a new firework let's try that
that's a little bit better so it's
making them kind of randomly every so
often so that's a good start and now
what I also want to do is you know I
think this should be a random value so
let's say random between negative 15 and
negative 5 so that way they don't all go
home and so that the range might be off
there let me make the range a little bit
calmer let's do this so anyway you get
the idea that they're not they're also
not all going to just go up to exactly
the same height so now we're pretty good
we've got our system of the fireworks
going up over time but I need to figure
out what's the point where I want them
to go poof and explode into a bunch of
particles okay so how do I do that here
in the update function one thing I
should
edit point timeout back I what I need to
do is I want to check something I could
do is it how do I know when the firework
gets to the top point well its velocity
is negative its velocity is negative its
velocity is negative in the y-direction
now it's zero now it's positive now it's
positive I want it to explode the moment
it reaches that top point so I can say
if this dot firework dot velocity is
letting down is greater than zero is
greater than or equal to zero this is
the moment where I want it to explode so
what I'm actually going to do is I'm
going to say this dot firework equals no
so I'm just going to like set the
firework to null so that it's like that
will make it disappear essentially so in
and what I'm going to need some like I'm
going to have to say if this dot
firework so I only want to update apply
force and update it if it exists and I
also only want to show it if it exists
so let's just see you know there's lots
of other ways I could do this but this
is just going to be a sort of way of me
tracking it could have actually a
boolean variable like exploded or
something I might I might change it to
that later but let's see how this works
so hmm that's weird
if this oh well that's if the Y
component of the velocity right if the Y
component of the velocity let's add that
who cannot read velocity of no where did
that happen
ah okay well this is up issue so this
little bit can go inside here like also
as long as it exists there you can see
now it's disappearing the moment it kind
of gets to the top so that's good and
what I want is when it gets to the top I
want it to just go into a whole bunch of
particles so I actually kind of feel
like I'm going to just change this just
for to be I'm going to say this dot
exploded is false as long as not this
dot exploded apply force if it's then
say this dot exploded equals false
because as long as this
as long as not this dot exploded I think
I would prefer to use a boolean variable
if it equals true so this should be the
same exact result but I'm not doing this
sort of null thing okay
so I used a boolean variable to track
when it's exploded now what do I do when
it explodes well what I need to do is I
need to suddenly right here I'm going to
just say this dot explode I want to put
this in a separate function and I'm
going to write a function now called
this dot explode and what do I need to
do in this function I need to make a
whole lot of particles let's make a
hundred of them so for VAR i equals 0 i
is less than 100 i plus plus what i need
to do is say VAR p equals a new particle
and where should that particle start so
it's about to explode where should that
particle start it should start where
this dot fireworks position dot x and
this dot fireworks dot position dot y so
i need to make a whole lot of these
particles and now i need an array the
firework object in addition to keeping
track of this sort of like seed firework
should keep track of this dot particles
and array so it has an empty array and i
am now going to say particles dot push P
okay particles push P now what I also
then need to do is and I'm going to just
do this here right here what I need to
do is display all those particles index
I dot show so oh and this has to be this
dot particles and this has to be this
stop particles in xio so what I've added
here is the moment that particle reaches
the top it makes a hundred new particles
and then draws all those so let's see
what this looks like
whoops cannot reach show of undefined
firework J s index 30 Oh this should be
this dot particles dot length because I
don't want it to show non-existent
particles that array is only going to
100 as soon as as soon as it is exploded
let's run this again look at that oh it
made a hundred particles
none of which move or do anything pretty
weird right well first of all why aren't
they moving well I forgot something
I forgot that I also should call here in
update I should also call for all of
those particles apply force gravity and
for all those particles I have to update
them so I need those particles to
experience physics as well well look
what's happening it's making those
fireworks but they're all why what
happens when you make a new particle it
shoots straight up so I need to make
those particles in a different way so
let's look at how I'm doing that if I go
back to the particle object the particle
is always made with a velocity that
randomly points up between negative 12
and negative 8 so I could use like
inheritance and have like a different
two different kinds of particles that
inherit but I think what I'm going to do
is just add just add a third argument
here and I'll call it a exploder and
I'll say if exploder
I don't like exploder that sounds violin
I'm already using explode I guess I'm
going to call it firework if firework
make the velocity that way otherwise
make the velocity and I'm I'm just going
to do something different just so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to say I
want to say p5 dot vector random 2d so
I'm gonna have any random Direction okay
so if that's boolean variable is true
it's going to make it as like one of
those original firework things so let me
go back to this firework object and this
particle it needs the last argument of
true
these particles it needs the last
argument is false but in JavaScript if I
don't I can also just pass nothing in
and that variable will have the value of
undefined which will evaluate to false
this should now if i refresh this we
could see now I'm getting something
closer so now why are they why are they
exploding in this perfect circle well
the reason why they're exploding in a
perfect circle oops I have some old
notes from a computer vision tutorial is
I'm giving them a random velocity which
is a unit vector all of length one so
they're all going to explode out in a
perfect circle so one thing I might do
is just have those the length of those
vectors be a slightly random length but
and I'm not going to do this in this
tutorial but you should make heart
fireworks for example so what if you
could figure out if I draw a heart like
this from the center vectors pointing
out to the edges of a heart so you could
actually or you could use we've got a
fireworks that display letters or
particular kinds of shapes so the way
that you pick those initial velocities
of that explosion can really make parts
or rainbows or unicorns or whatever kind
of shapes you can imagine that you might
like to make so I encourage you to do
that as a kind of riff off of this you
can also notice that right now it's
running really really slow so that's
another thing we're gonna have to fix
but let me just go back to here and I am
going to where was I under particle now
the other thing I want to do is I
actually want to in the particle object
I think I want to keep track of this
this whether it's the original firework
or the particle because I want to like
do other things that are different so
I'm going to say this because I also
want oh you know what I'm but I'm gonna
leave that for later okay so let me fix
this and say random 2d and then this
stop velocity multiplied by something
like oh I know what I'm gonna do in a
second x between you know two one and
six so now it's a magnitude is going to
be scaled by some random amount me run
this again ooh okay that didn't work
what did I not do right let me look at
this this dot velocity multiplied Oh
random a random value between 1 and 6 ok
so you can see the hell they're really
exploding kind of like wildly there's
also too many of them so I can't really
see what's going on that well so I'm
gonna go back to the sketch and make
them like quite a bit less often lost
power but I'm back now and where I what
just was is I was saying if this is not
one of the seed fireworks particles if
it's not one of the seed firework
particles
let's take its velocity and multiply it
by something like eight point eight five
so that it slows down slows down every
frame and you can see that kind of gives
it this sort of like burst out that sort
of slows down and stops now there's sort
of a funny thing happening where they're
still there and when you see a firework
it explodes it kind of like fades out
and you know I'm not going to get too
crazy with visual dressing here you can
make stuff Sparkle and have trails and
glow and all sorts of stuff like that
but it'll eat sleazy add something where
the fireworks fade out so what I want to
add is a variable I already did because
that's before the power ran out I'm
going to add a variable called this
lifespan equals to 55 and what I'm going
to do is in the update function I'm
going to say is law also if it's not one
of the seed ones I want that lifespan to
go down by one and this maybe I want it
to go down let's actually have it go
down by for each frame and what I want
is for the particle to have a stroke
which is its lifespan so so I want to
give it some alpha so to say if it's not
the sort of seed firework do that to the
stroke otherwise just have a regular
stroke and then also let's make them
stroke weight too and we'll make the
those a little bit thicker so let's see
what this looks like now was it running
really slow note Oh life span is not
defined because I need to say
nice man let's try that again so you can
see here now this is a little bit better
now you know I should fiddle with these
values like maybe this should be a you
know 0.9 and its initial values should
actually be between like two and ten and
whoops and over here we can see what
that looks like now and whether this is
better or worse I don't know but I'm
going to let you sort of like consider
that on your own but I now have the
basic idea you can see very quickly now
though it's starting to run rather slow
so we're losing a lot of frame right
here why are we losing a lot of frame
rate well it doesn't matter whether the
particles have faded out or left the
screen I'm never I'm never getting rid
of them so there's a bunch of things I
need to do number one I need to say I
need to figure out a way of getting rid
of particles so here in this in the
fireworks system what I need to do as
I'm looping through all the particles
first of all I actually want to loop
through the list backwards because going
to do something where I'm start plucking
them out of the list and if the list is
shrinking its contracting from the end
it works better if I'm going through it
backwards and taking things off the back
end so what I'm going to do is I'm going
to change this loop to say go for a
particles length minus 1 and greater
than or equal to zero and I - - let's
make sure that still works so nothing's
changed it's still working and what I
need to do go away finder what I need to
do now is say ok well if this particles
index I is done then this dot particles
duh
splice I so splice is a JavaScript
function that deletes something from an
array and you can actually splice at I a
bunch of things after it but I just want
that one particle so if the particle is
done splice well how do I know if it's
done I need to write a function that
says if it's done so in particle J F
I've got another function I need to add
I'll just add it over here this dot done
and what I'll do is I'll say if if this
dot lifespan is
than 0 then return true
so that lifespan which is counting down
else return false so let's run this it's
hard to the Oaks we have an error
particle j/s line 30 line 30 here this
not done equals function so now I have
no way of knowing if it's actually
removing the particles it does seem to
be like performing a bit better like not
slowing down
so those particles are being deleted but
they're actually still a firework object
the system object in that list so what I
want to do now is add over in the
firework object also a function that
says this dot done and how do I know if
that thing is done well it is done if
that particle is exploded and this dot
firework dot sorry this dot particles
dot length equals zero right the
particle system itself is done as long
as it's in a state of having exploded
and there are no panelist particles that
fade it out so if that's the case I
should be able to say return true
otherwise return false so now I can go
back to the sketch here and what can I
do here in this sketch I also want to
loop through this thing backwards
fireworks at length minus one I is
greater than or equal to zero I - - and
I want to say if fireworks dot length of
so fireworks dot done
fireworks index i dot done then
fireworks in the splice I comma one so
now and what I'm going to do is I'm also
going to add just to make sure this is
all working I'm going to add console.log
fireworks dot length so now we should be
able to see you know as you can see that
that length is going down so it's never
going to be too many things on the
screen so performance wise it's going to
work fine so this now is and you know
Java Script canvas drawing can be a
little bit slow but you can see I've got
kind of
you know with 100 particles per system
it's kind of running reasonably well now
we can make this look a little bit nicer
for example I could add oops I could add
a little bit of alpha to the background
meaning have the background transition
into and we'll have each firework draw a
little bit of trail let's see how this
looks right that has a little bit more
firework like quality to it that's nice
then of course I could say well let me
give it a color mode of HSB and I could
say for each firework let's for each
firework system is going to get its own
color so it should get a hue value is a
random Q and then Oh every time I make a
particle I'm going to also want so the
system gets a hue and then I'm going to
want to send that hue into let's do that
before the last argument here into the
particle objects so they can use it as
well so anytime I make a new particle
even in the explode function I also make
new particles so I'm going to say this
hue and false and then now in the
particle object I can add a variable to
get that hue value and then I can say a
stroke is the hue 255 255 Q 255 255 with
a with no alpha and now when you run
this we can see we have now we have
rainbow oh how come I lost the trail
that's weird what did I do to lose the
true oh you know why I lost the trail is
because I changed it to use the color
mode to HSB and the background is now
doing something weird so this should fix
that I think whoops ah look at that
I wonder if this is a bug in p5.js that
we've just found well I'm going to do
something here which might make things
run a bit slow but I'm going to just
change the color mode to RGB here and in
each particle right before the particle
is drawn I'm going to change the color
mode to HSB let's see if that works
there we go
so that should be I think that seems
like a bug to me like there should be a
way to have an alpha with the HSB color
mode but now we've got it working and
you can see there we go so there could
be a lot of finesse here right I could
have those velocities go at an angle I
could think more thoughtfully about what
the velocities are the bursting
particles are I could have a variable
amount of particles I could think more
thoughtfully about the design I could
actually store a list of history of the
positions to draw a trail myself I could
use like textures I could use something
called additive blending maybe all to
make things appear more glow like but um
but you can see here here's the basic
idea so I encourage you to take my
JavaScript code and make some
improvements on it and I want to make a
3d WebGL version of this but that's
before I'm ready to do that
I'm this is this kind of concludes this
video but I'm just going to keep going
I'm going to go back to my processing
where I'm going to close this I'm going
to go back to my processing sketch which
is basically exactly the same code that
I just wrote but it is oh it's doing it
fullscreen I forgot that it's doing it
so one of the things about using Java on
a desktop environment is I can kind of
get a bit more speed out of it so I have
now this full screen application but
this is still 2d so what I want to do
with this one and let's let's take off
the full screen for a second just so I
can kind of see it a bit more clearly
let's make it 800 by 600 what I'm going
to do here is I'm going to change this
to p3d each particle when it gets drawn
is a point but I'm going to say push
matrix I'm going to I need to do three
actually I could just use I'm going to
do through this anyway I'm going to do
translate to add that z-axis and I'm
going to say point at zero zero so let's
just make sure
still runs oops they're all shooting off
above the screen because when I made it
smaller the initial velocity should be
less strong so let me just run this
again I'll fix that again later okay so
that's still working now what I want to
do though however is these particles
when it explodes somewhere somewhere I
create that vector the random vector
probably in particle system that
firework object and yes and then it
makes a new right here it makes a new
random 2d vector I want this to be
random 3d let's look at that let's see
if this works now can you see anything
different here I'm not so sure you can
but technically speaking it should be a
random 3d vector let's see if we can now
actually start to rotate the scene to
see if this really works so I'm going to
add I'm going to import a library called
PZ cam which I always I've been doing
which I can style say I can add a PZ cam
object and I can say a cam equals new PZ
cam this and I'm going to say 500 like I
want to look at it from 500 pixels away
the other thing that I need to do is
when I make the initial particles their
location sorry when I make that initial
particle its location should be random
PZ can mix everything relative to the
center zero zero so I want to look for
random negative width divided by two to
with divided by two and then I also want
to change the bottom of the screen is
now height divided by two so let's run
this and see what happens
ooh ooh peace okay oh okay hold on three
PZ cam is very unhappy with my Oh
clearing of the background technique so
I'm going to lose the trails I can get
those back in another way and just say
background zero
I forgot about that once I have PZ cam
okay now let's start manipulating the
scene can you see I'm looking at it from
above now yeah so you can see I need to
make a lot more of these to be able to
see this more easily let's add let's
have a lot more being added and let's
also make the stroke weight of these
particles much bigger and let's have
their lifespan lasts a little bit longer
and let's run this and okay so now and
let's actually just make this fullscreen
again because that might help so I want
to make the initial random velocity much
bigger and I'm going to go back and make
this fullscreen in P 3d and let's see if
we get some nice 3d fireworks here ooh
that I can kind of like yeah you can see
there they are oh no no no oh yeah they
are 3d but they're all like in one plane
so I should also probably mess with
where they start
okay so let's mess with where they start
so this starting location is oh it
happens here which is a particle and I
don't give it a Z location it's Z ooh
new particle a random okay hold on the
new particle gets a random X Y and a Z
and it should have that x y&amp;amp;z and so
let's give it a 0 and 'm and then let's
give it a random z which is going to be
sometime somewhere between negative 300
and 300 and so i'm going to run this
okay now let's sort of zoom out and look
there we go so we can see that's not so
there is some Z depth there it's not
very much
let's make that more extreme
I pretty sure did I get it will should
know now yeah okay now you can see I've
got 3d fireworks so and then you can see
that I could probably do something where
I have them burst out quite a bit more
and I now have upside down so anyway you
get the idea you can play with this more
so I encourage you I'm going to post in
the description of this video the
processing code I'm going to clean this
up a little bit the processing code for
the 3d fireworks as well as the browser
JavaScript code I need to get rid of the
fullscreen thing this has to stop stop
as well as the I lost I lost everything
ah come on no come back
fireworks fireworks fireworks somebody
see a fireworks p5 as well as the this
code the JavaScript version of the 2d
fireworks and I hope that you will make
pretty shapes out of them I hope you
think we will add angles and that you
will think of different ways of doing
this and come up with a creative take on
this and post it share it with me in the
comments or on Twitter or whatever
wherever you find to the internet to
share it and I hope you enjoyed this
quick coding challenge wasn't very quick
probably of how to program a firework
simulation from scratch thanks for
