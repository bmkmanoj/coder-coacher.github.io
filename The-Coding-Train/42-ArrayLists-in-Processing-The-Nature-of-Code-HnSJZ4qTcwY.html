way we're back and we're ready to deal
with the practical side of particle
systems and that practical side that
we're going to start with is an
ArrayList what is an ArrayList well
before we even get to and what is an
ArrayList let's talk about why we might
want an ArrayList okay so you have a
particle object now you want to have
many particle objects your first thing
you're going to do is say ah-ha I used
to declare a variable particle P now I'm
going to declare an array of particles
so I'm going to say I'm going to come
over here where I don't really have any
rooms to hand but I'm going to say
particle brackets particles equals new
particle 100 semicolon right what have
we written out here this is an array
declaration we have a type particle the
brackets indicate it's going to be an
array our name is particles and then we
have 100 elements 100 particles in that
array this is what we're used to then we
can look through that array we can draw
all them and update them and do all
sorts of things
great the issue is what if we want to
start with zero particles and then add
one then add one then add one then
delete them one delete one we could kind
of do that with an array we could have a
variable to keep track of what part of
the array are we're using I'll use this
section we could reuse elements there's
also even in processing if you look
through the processing documentation
there's append contract there's a bunch
of functions that seem to like added
subtract stuff from the array and the
syntax is kind of weird and confusing
and then you know this it's just not
it's not a place we want to go to right
now the place we want to go to is using
an ArrayList an ArrayList is going to
allow us to have this essentially this
like empty bucket this empty bucket
where we can put particles in we can
take particles out we can manage our
system of objects it's going to be great
so how do we know how do we learn about
what an ArrayList is okay so there's a
couple places that we could go to just
just that I think I should mention
before we start kind of mapping out the
parts of what an ArrayList is that we
need to know so number one is processing
okay so an ArrayList is not really
something that is part of processing an
ArrayList is the class that's part of
Java but it's so commonly used that it's
that you will find it documented on the
processing website so you will find a
documentation page with a little bit of
an examples and it says in the
description and ArrayList stores a
variable number of objects and this is
great so we could find out some initial
information here and you can see aha
there's a size method an ADD method
again a remove in fact those are the
methods that we're going to want so for
the kind of easygoing introduction to
the concept of an ArrayList this
processing reference page is going to be
perfect for us however it should note
that where it really comes from is from
Java so there is this kind of balloon
giant like read all this stuff about
what an ArrayList is this is the Java
reference page and you can see look at
all of these methods add at all clone
and sure capacity get is empty remove
remove range so there's a huge amount of
things that an ArrayList can do but what
we want to look at is this kind of
subset of that we're going to start by
looking at just a small list of methods
in an ArrayList so you know what I'm
just forget about it we don't even need
this anymore we want to make sure we are
comfortable with this idea of adding to
an ArrayList we want to sometimes get
things out of an ArrayList sometimes we
want to remove things from an ArrayList
and sometimes we need to know the size
of the ArrayList so this can kind of be
our list of methods that we're going to
need to feel comfortable with in order
to program this particle system
simulation with an ArrayList right okay
ah low energy day low energy day okay um
don't fall asleep wake up okay
uh all right so how do we even start
okay how do we even start let's say
we're assuming the existence of a class
called particle so this class called
particle we assume exists so we're going
to make an ArrayList with particle
objects in it now there's some funny bit
of syntax here that's I want to say new
but these years old at this point it
just it feels new because when I first
started work
with ArrayList it didn't exist but when
we declare an ArrayList
I'm going to declare an array list over
here say hey I'm gonna have an ArrayList
and I'm going to call it particles okay
so here's the thing about this
declaration one of the things about
ArrayList is they are it's a
general-purpose bucket that you can put
any kind of objects you want to in I
could put some particles in and some
movers in some pea fonts in a couple pea
images and I could just start putting
objects in there but this is not
typically how you use an ArrayList
typically use an ArrayList to collect a
bunch of the same kinds of objects and
in our case this is exactly what we're
going to do we know that this ArrayList
that we're about to make we're only ever
going to put particle objects in it so
we can specify in advance at the moment
that we're going to create this
ArrayList called particles that what
it's our intention to put particle
objects in it this is called generics
the syntax is called generics and the
way that we do that I'm standing in the
strangest way ever is by use of the less
than and greater than signs these add we
put we put the type in which in in
between those signs
so we're saying I'm going to have an
ArrayList it's going to be full of
particle objects and we're going to call
it particles now just for the purpose of
this demonstration it's going to allow
me to write less things on the board but
also to emphasize remember this is your
variable name it can be anything you
want and often it is confusing I have an
ArrayList with particle objects of
calling of particles and I get a
particle what's--what so we're going to
have an ArrayList of with particle
objects in it I'm going to call it just
a so we're not done anytime that you
have a variable right any time that you
have an object need to declare the
object and you need to initialize that
object you initialize an array list by
calling the constructor just like you
say particle P equals new particle we're
now going to say ArrayList a equals new
ArrayList and I could do that in one
line of code but just to demonstrate
here on the board and say a equals new
ArrayList and this is another moment
where I need to specify what goes in it
a is a new ArrayList with particle
objects in it
so this is
all we need this is the beginnings of
what we need we need to declare a
variable of type ArrayList say what
we're going to put in the ArrayList and
then we need to call the constructor to
have this empty bucket now that we have
this empty bucket we are golden we can
start using add get remove size we can
do all of these things and one of the
first things we might do is just say hey
let's add a new particle object into our
ArrayList we can do this at any point we
could do this when we click the mouse we
could do it in setup we could do it over
and over again in draw we can add
particles to that ArrayList who and okay
so boy there's a lot of stuff here and
we've been seven minutes this is going
to be everything's fine you'll need to
edit this part out
okay I'm just trying to map out in my
brain where we're going with this okay
where are we we let's go over to our
example for a sec okay so here we are we
have our particle example before with a
single particle now what we want to do
is add an ArrayList to this example so
that we could eventually have multiple
particles so instead of the single
particle variable at the top we want to
type in an ArrayList called particles
instead of initializing that single
particle we are going to initialize an
array list that will have particle
objects in it and and this is no longer
relevant but we'll we'll come back to it
in a second so here we go now our
program has an ArrayList but it's empty
there's nothing in it
there's no particles in it so we could
say ah-ha let's add particles in it
maybe we want to start with 10 particles
how do we start with 10 well how would
we even have one
we know the add method allows us to add
a particle object so we can call add on
the ArrayList and put in any object
reference a new particle in this case
and put that in the ArrayList if we want
to add 10 I could just say I don't know
let's just have a little loop and you
can see now there's 10 particles in the
ArrayList so now how do we
update and display all those all those
particles that are in the ArrayList okay
so now we need to go back we need
another function for that all we know
now is how to create the ArrayList and
how to add things to it now we need to
access the elements of that array list
okay so to access the elements of that
array list because we've done ad get is
going to do that for us get is a way of
getting objects from the ArrayList so
that we can access them and call methods
on them so how do we do that for number
one is I could say hey a our particle
system by the way over here is called a
in the example we're building it's
called particles and that's fine because
we can make up any variable names we
want a dot get zero this would get the
zero element out of that ArrayList what
do I mean by zero element well remember
an array is a list of elements a regular
array which each element has an index
and if we had a regular array called you
know my array we would access the first
element by its index with brackets
brackets we put 0 in between the
brackets and we're talking about this
element right here
well the get function in the ArrayList
does exactly the same thing as the
brackets do with a regular array so what
are we doing what does get actually get
actually returns for us a reference to
an array up to it so to it to that
object in that spot yeah ok right so
particle P equals a dot get 0 this gives
us that first particle out of the
ArrayList so that's kind of getting us
closer and we can go over here to this
example and we could say all right let's
just confirm that that actually works
I'm going to say particle P equals
particles get 0 P update P display and
if we run this we can see great there's
that there's that first particle and I
could say hey the ratan in there let's
get the fifth one our index number for
hey there's that one so clearly this
works we have an ArrayList we can put
stuff in it we can get stuff out of it
we can do stuff to it but obviously we
need to do this with a loop right we
want to say for every particle in the
ArrayList update and display for every
particle in the
a list update and display for every
particles the ArrayList update and
display how do we say that well one of
this is a moment if you haven't used
this kind of loop before and processing
going to erase all this because this is
like a thrilling moment in my life when
I discovered you know if you ever
programmed in all these other languages
you have all these for each loops which
seem really convenient you don't need to
count I and index this you can do that
in processing you actually do this with
regular arrays or with an ArrayList this
is just a nice moment to see that this
kind of loop works we want to say for
every particle P :
in the ArrayList in this case a update
and also display so if you haven't seen
a loop like this before here it is this
is called an enhanced for-loop what it's
doing is saying there is a list called a
it has particle objects in it we can
just this loop says whatever's in there
access every single one and update them
and so we can put this into our program
over here and we can say for every
particle sorry for every particle P in
the ArrayList particles P update P
display and here we go boom we see this
like little mini explosion right at the
beginning it's 10 of 10 particles let's
see if we can make that happen again I
don't know why we need to let us do it
again
poof okay so we can see that this is
working this is very exciting we have a
list we've added 10 particles to that
list and now we know how to access all
10 and call methods on update display
update display we see them all now
they're gone when they're gone we should
really delete them from the list so
that's the next step I'm going to
actually stop this video right here
we're going to the next step is going to
be deleting elements from that ArrayList
and once we have that then we're going
to have to look at hey we don't what we
want to do is they'll this gobbledygook
code that's in our set up and draw this
is all actually a could because it's in
8
system class so the particle class talks
about an individual object the system
class manages the list of those objects
so we're going to get to all that so
what I would say to you is if you're
following along behind that example you
had with your single object moving and
try to make an ArrayList of them try to
do things like maybe add to the
ArrayList when you click the mouse you
know see if you can start with nothing
then add 20 then add 1 see if you can
kind of add to it in a with some logic
that happens over time and by some means
ok so this is the end of this video
