topic of functions and reusability what
does it mean to call a function multiple
times and why might you do that and so
to illustrate that I want to start with
this particular example now this example
is from the book getting started with
p5.js it's a it's by Lauren McCarthy and
based on the getting started with
processing book by Casey recent Ben Frey
so you can if you're looking for an
additional resource that's a great one
for you and there's many more great
examples like this one the reason why
I'm using this example is look here so
this robot creature thing is a rather
elaborate design it involves a whole
bunch of circles rectangle a bunch of
lines maybe some dots
I don't know lots of lines of code a lot
so you can imagine if you knowing what
you might have known a day or two ago or
whenever you before you watch this video
to draw that robot design four times you
would have to have so much that you
would have to do you would have to have
all of that code for the entire design
four times in your code get very very
long so there's got to be a better way
right if you could just figure out what
it means to draw that robot packaged
that into a function you could call that
function multiple times and then you
could think of what are the parameters
by which that design can be altered or
changed for example one parameters where
is it on the screen what's the sort of
XY of the center of the robot another
might be its neck length or its body
length so you can see each one of these
robots is slightly different and if you
look at the code the draw robot function
is called four times with four arguments
and I'm guessing they are location Y
location neck length body length
something like that I guess I've looked
at this before so not just totally
guessing but you get the idea so this is
essentially what I want to look at in
this video I'm going to talk through the
pieces of how you define and call a
function when there are arguments and
then kind of build a much simpler less
visually interesting version of
something like this okay so so let's
come back over here for a second and
let's imagine something different let's
say you were going to build a flower
your and it might be you know
something like this it might be like a
rec time what I'm doing here let's try
to draw the flowers pathetic so the
point is let's say you wanted to have a
flower so let's think about what might
be the parameters for this flower I
don't know what I'm doing here but the
parameters might be location right we
can think of the X Y location let's be
really simple about this and let's just
think we're not actually get a number of
petals so we need an XY location and how
many petals should appear on the flower
so we know before that the syntax for
defining a function is function the name
of the function I will call it flower
and then open and close parenthesis now
when when we look at the setup function
draw function those never had any
arguments
you never say setup with this argument
or draw with this argument but with the
robot function you do say draw the robot
at this location with this neck length
with this body length here I want to say
draw this flower at this x and this y
with this number of petals which means
the that we need to put something here
and the things that we put in between
these parenthesis are known as
parameters they are the parameters by
which we define how that flower is drawn
really how that function is executed and
those parameters are essentially
variables so I can put I get and I get
it's up to me to name them I'm going to
have it an X a Y and a variable called
petals so those variables the names for
those variables go in between those
parenthesis separated by commas and then
I can start to use them for example I
can say ellipse draw an ellipse at that
XY you know with some width and height
and then maybe the petals the number of
petals I'm going to use in some sort of
for loop I don't know I'm like imagining
some complex scenario now where I'm
rotating around and drawing a bunch of
circles but you can see that the X and
the y are used here in the ellipse
function the variable petal
is used here in this for loop so what
these variable these parameters are
there essentially variables that are
local to this function it's as if at the
top of the function I said bar X bar Y
bar pedals the question is when when we
looked at variables we said okay well
you have a variable you need to declare
it var X well this is like declaring it
declaring it as a parameter to this
function X and then you need to
initialize it var x equals zero or bar x
equals 200 so where does X get its
initial value and this is the new piece
here X Y and petals get their initial
value from where you call the function
so if I were to say flowers 200 comma
100 comma 10 it's the equivalent of
saying here I'm not saying this VAR x
equals 200 so that's how we're writing
cuz 200 goes into X 100 goes into Y 10
goes into petals and by the way these
and these are what are known as
arguments so that the the terminology
it's easy to confuse these and you don't
have to worry about this too much
because you know the program is not
going to care what you're cut what
you're calling what to your friends and
you're talking about your code but the
the variables that you define in the
parentheses in the function definition
donor those are called parameters that
the parameters to the function and the
arguments are the things that get passed
into the parameters 200 100 comma 10 and
by the way this is just like you know
this is just how p5 works right when you
say ellipse you say X Y width and height
and then the ellipse function is defined
somewhere function ellipse X Y WH
something like that so so and the
wonderful thing here 9 by 8 flowers this
is flower flower the wonderful thing
here is once you've figured out this
elaborate code for drawing this
elaborate beautiful wonderful flower
design you can then have more than one
on the screen so you could say now
flower 300 comma 50 comma 20 so you have
a flower in a different place with a
different number of petals so this is
essentially the exercise that I think
you should try for yourself is build
yourself some kind of interesting design
see if you can give that design
parameters define it in a function
and call that function multiple times
and let's come over here and let's look
at just kind of doing that quickly hit
an example yeah we've got we've gone up
by self enforced 10-minute limit so
let's look at this this is again I call
this the lollipop it's trying to do
something just very simple here so this
is just a single design it involves both
a rectangle and an ellipse so now what I
would like to do is write a function
call it lollipop hope I spelled that
right I'm going to put this code just
right there inside the lollipop function
okay and I'm going to run it okay of
course we don't see anything because I
wanted was define this function I didn't
actually call it so the next thing that
I'm going to do is call the function and
now you see there's the hum flickering
which is not good yeah I'm back
hopefully I fixed that camera problem so
what about what I have here is I just I
have what I did before in the previous
video which I just took a chunk of code
put it in a function and calling that
function and then when I run it it
executes the function but the point of
what I want to do right now is add
parameters to this function and just to
be overly simplistic I'm going to give
this 3 parameters an X location a Y
location and a size of the lollipop
thing itself so two three parameters
need to go inside the parenthesis as
variables an X location a Y location and
because I'm the least creative person
ever I'm just going to call this
diameter so diameter it meaning the
diameter of that circle so we know the
ellipse
instead of saying 100 I want to use the
variable diameter the the ellipse itself
should be at the X&amp;amp;Y location and the
rectangle itself should also be at the
X&amp;amp;Y location but I'm going to say minus
10 here because that's helping me just
the rectangle is 20 pixels wide I'm
going to Center it a little bit over so
now if I run this first of all I'm going
to get an argument I mean an argument an
error which if you read down here is
going to say can't well if my font is
too big and I'm failing up see baigan
right says looks like an ellipse we'll
see
empty variables bah-bah-bah so it can't
figure out what to do because I called
lollipop without the proper arguments
and so it doesn't know what X is and
it's trying to call elapse but it
ellipse with an X but the X is undefined
so this is going to cause problems if
your arguments don't match the
parameters things will break there's all
sorts of clever ways around that but for
right now if I've got three parameters I
want to have three arguments here so I
want to have the lollipop at say 100
comma 100 with a diameter of 50 and you
can see there's a lollipop and then if I
want to have this line of code again at
you know 300 comma 200 with 150 diameter
there now I have two lollipops and you
can see this shows how untalented I am
in that you know that's why I had to
pull that beautiful interesting
intricate robot example but you see the
point here you have a function I've
defined a function I made it up it's
called lollipop it's my own it's my own
function it takes three arguments I can
do whatever I want with those arguments
execute code execute drawing stuff and I
can call that function then multiple
times in different places so I think
this is hopefully a useful exercise for
you to try something similar hopefully
you have more talent than I do it can
come up with something different than
this pathetic looking lollipop and I
have two more videos that I want to make
one we'll look at a function that
returns a value which is a key thing and
the other thing I want to do which is a
little bit crazy is look at what happens
if I put a function inside an object
okay so I will see you in the next video
I won't see you I would like to see you
good bye oh I can't stop your head stop
