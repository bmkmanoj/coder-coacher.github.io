watching a video I think this video the
goal of this video is to talk about
something called p5.js what is p5 yes
who should you or might you be thinking
about learning this thing called p5.js
from the very very beginner stage
without any experience with anything
else whatsoever I am recording and what
might you use it for and and what's
going to happen am I making more videos
less videos hype sort of thing so first
let's let me give you a little context
actually let's start with a little
context there is this thing called
processing processing is a project that
started in 2001 by Casey Reis and
Benjamin I like to call him benjamine I
don't know what Ben by Ben fry k-series
have Ben fry the two and we're students
together at the MIT Media Lab designers
artists programmers trying to make a
tool that could help them with their own
work since then since 2001 this idea of
creative coding it's a complex term but
creative applications through
programming I like to think of it as
creative expression through programming
how do you communicate express your
ideas while making making computational
tools it's also a bit really like if you
don't have to learn to program you know
there's a lot of like learn to program
learn to program everyone's gotta learn
to program ah kind of stuff going on
these days take a deep breath relax you
don't need to know how to program
there's lots of great stuff in the world
you learn to play the violin that's a
wonderful thing but there is an aspect
of learning to program that is very
powerful in that that software is
something to drive so much of what we
use and if you want to not be stuck just
kind of using whatever software other
people large corporations if you want to
be able to express yourself in new and
different ways learning to program is a
great way to do that also and this is
kind of come around full circle here
learning to program and have the results
of what you program go in a browser on
the web so that other people can see
those things that you can share and
distribute easily this is a very
powerful thing so interestingly enough
processing when it was first created was
built on top of a programming language
called Java which was you know all the
rage back in 2001 and one of the reasons
why Java was invented not of jobs well
the reason why processing use Java is
that you can make these things called
applets and applets would run in the web
browser so you could program your thing
in processing upload it to the web
distribute it all the world would see it
you become rich and famous or even
better you don't become rich or famous
but you do something good for the world
or both perhaps then that that it made a
lot of sense you know fast forward 14
years later 2015 you know when was the
last time you saw a Java applet on the
web if you saw it it was just basically
an experience with like a giant error
message in total your browser crash and
nothing work the language these days of
the browser is something called
JavaScript and I'll say a bit more about
that in a minute javascript allows you
to program and create all sorts of
exciting things that happen in a web
browser
you're interested in creating unique and
animated and creative web content
learning JavaScript learning p5.js is
something you might be interested in now
I don't remember what year 2013-14
sometime 15 no 15th this year and not 14
that's too recent sometime in the last
couple years a bunch of us were talking
and we asked the question what language
would you pick if processing were being
invented today and somebody that
answered that question in an interesting
way her name is Lauren McCarthy so
Lauren McCarthy began a project in
collaboration with the process
processing processing the not-for-profit
foundation so it's about to say
processing found a
this is a totally different video the
last one I made done I threw away so but
you don't know that
so Lauren said okay well what if
processing were being invented today and
the language instead of Java was
JavaScript so this is what p5.js is as a
project there I should just briefly
mention there's another wonderful
project called processing jeaious I know
this is like crazily confusing
I just want recently mention it
processing jest as a project started by
John Resig and many other people have
worked on it since then and processing
Dutchess sort of tries to solve this
other problem your Java code can't run
on the web as an applet anymore what if
we could secretly or not so secretly
what we could behind the scenes
translate it to JavaScript so that it
ran there but but this project p5.js is
different in that it is not it is a new
project we can now think wonderfully and
happily about what that thing called
Prostate that I briefly spoke about but
mostly right now for the purpose of
these videos we can now ignore this
p5.js is a environment a simple
hopefully simple and beginner-friendly
environment to help you learn JavaScript
to make applications computational
creative interesting hopefully
interesting things happen in the browser
and eventually you could go in a lot of
route routes with this you might make
art you might make data visualization
you might make websites as like a web
designer there's lots of paths that you
might take from this basic set of videos
that I hope to make so you know actually
I think that's just about the full
context there's there's some other
pieces that you know how do you make
something happen in the web browser you
need more than JavaScript you need these
other things called HTML CSS and
JavaScript I think what I want to do now
very briefly and I'm going to pick this
up in the next video is just look at
open p5.js and do a few things with it
just so you get a sense of
what kinds of things that can do and
what it would be great if I had a video
that showed you like here are a whole
bunch of awesome projects that are made
with these kinds of tools and don't get
me wrong there's a lot of really amazing
JavaScript frameworks oh I think I'm
missing piece here that I say is so just
like processing was built on top of Java
it's a little bit different here p5.js
is not really built on top of JavaScript
it is a set of boy this is a hard one
and I was I was doing so well I was just
going to transfer myself over the
computer nothing was going to get too
shaky and weird but what I would like to
so and I think what is useful to think
of here for a moment is p5.js is two
things one of these things is it's a
library of functions so here's a great
way of thinking about it let's say you
want to learn JavaScript and you type
you go to Google you take JavaScript
boom whoa there's a lot of stuff out
there there's like a million Stack
Overflow posts which are like places
where people ask questions there's like
15 million this j/s things that you
could learn and there's something called
jQuery and there's so much so one of the
goals I think at least of p5.js is to
give you a little bit of a sandbox a
walled garden to learn some of the
basics and for that and get a library of
functions to draw a circle or draw a
rectangular set a color so you can just
use some basic drawing functions to
learn some of these beginner steps of
programming the other thing it is and I
think I need to move over to the
computer here ah this is care for turned
off hold on a sec okay I think I'm here
now oh there I am so the other thing it
is the other thing it is is this thing
here Sam Levine has created something
called the p5.js editor what this means
it's an application a program on your
computer that you can launch and just
start typing some code in and get your
feet wet and start to experiment and
learn a bit about code without having to
worry about all of the larger pieces of
things that you need in order to like
make something happen in a webpage we're
going to do it very simply here so let's
look at that for a second so I'm going
to launch this by the way I just
downloaded it haven't even would have
used it before but but but I
this computer here so oh look see you
can even see this p5 is an application
download from the internet are you sure
you want to open it so now is the time
where you could say I'm just going to go
learn to play the violin or I'm going to
go play frisbee I don't know football
soccer soccer I mean whatever outside
long sorry okay but I'm gonna open it
because I'm I live in a cave although I
have sunlight this year a newer version
of p5 is available I don't want to
download it right now I'm gonna say okay
oops I do want to download it right now
so okay alright so this here oh boy lots
of things have gone wrong now that's 110
that off the I'm going to like zap you
so you don't remember that last 30
seconds so this here is p5.js the
application the editor sorry this is a
p5.js editor and if you look at it it's
already filled in a little bit of code
for you so you can start to see I've to
learn to program I have to learn some
strange new language and syntax function
draw parentheses curly bracket curly
bracket these are some things that will
come to light in your if your for the
first time watching this video looking
at programming so one thing that what
I'm going to do a couple things here
real quick one thing I'm going to do is
I'm going to type in create canvas and
then down here to draw I'm going to type
rectangle and I'm going to type some
other numbers and then I'm going to zoom
back out and hit play and we can see
here look what's happened I wrote
something that says create canvas and
what did that do it made a canvas that's
the canvas then I'm down here I wrote
something that said rect tank
short for rectangle what did it do
it made a rectangle so these are the
first pieces these are the first things
that I'm going to show you in the next
video how do what lines of code you
start to write and one of those lines of
code too
and with p5.js here
a the first thing that we're going to
learn is how to like draw a picture and
by the way this canvas is actually a
little mini web browser that's open so
as more and more videos come to pass we
can peel back some of these layers and
see how you might take this and put it
on the web somewhere share it allow
people to interact with it that sort of
thing so this video is okay P+ I think
I'm going to keep it though and upload
it and someday there will be a better
one probably never but you know my tree
anyway so this is the end not I'm going
to make another one video and then
upload that one too and you can watch
many of them and I'm keeping a list I'm
going to try to put a link in like the
description so thank you a list of all
the videos I'm going to make to make a
lot of intro ones and then some project
based ones which are more like you know
how to do it how to take a Google
spreadsheet and visualize it as a graph
in JavaScript in you know and try to do
that in like a short ten minutes so
that's sort of my plan for this semester
it's 11:30 I got a little time before
I'm going to go Absalon I just want to
make a few more okay I'm turning this
