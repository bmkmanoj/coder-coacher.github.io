introduction to this larger playlist the
intelligence and learning set of videos
but now this video is an introduction to
just the first session and the first
session is about search and graph
systems now why why why should that be
the first session I don't know might be
a bad idea first of all I wanted a warm
up so I wanted something to kind of get
us thinking about algorithms data and
things that the intelligence or that
solve problems in an intelligent way so
and also there are some very you know
some ways common unsolved problems of
computer science like the traveling
salesperson problem which is one of the
topics of this week's that could could
use of you newly invented machine
learning system to solve it you know I
don't have my if I had my book
artificial intelligence that the modern
approach the nor big Russell books yes
and I hope I got that right um you would
see a lot of my pen anymore uh
continuity error you would notice that
there's a lot of algorithms in these
books about search because one of the
first one of the kinds of problems that
artificial intelligence algorithms that
intelligent algorithms often need to
solve in computer science in
applications interactivity all the sort
of kind of projects you might be
thinking of making is there's a problem
I need to figure out the answer to this
problem but there are so many possible
answers I couldn't possibly check every
single one and so search refers to the
idea of searching for the answer in a
sea of possibilities now one way is to
search every single possibility I
mentioned the traveling salesperson
problem let's talk about that for a
second so I want to talk about search
and graph systems this is kind of
loosely the topic for right now there
goes that relation oh my god I'm sorry
everybody there it is okay everything is
fine okay so the traveling salesperson
says oh I have videos on this already so
you can go watch those there are some
number of cities and let's say there are
five and that a salesperson needs to
visit all of the cities in the shortest
amount of time or taking them with the
shortest distance in any order starting
with anyone ending with anyone so I
might be able to eyeball this and say
like okay well maybe that's the path
that's probably not the best it's
probably more like that whatever the
point is we could have a computer
algorithms bigger is about let's just
check every single possibility
so first let's pick a city how many
cities should I pick how many cities
click oh there's five okay now if I pick
if there's five possibilities now once I
picked one city how many possibilities
are there left for I'm how many are left
three now we're left - and we're left
one so five factorial 20 60 120 120
possibilities for five cities and this
is five factorial so this is a kind of
problem that doesn't seem like such a
big deal but if I just have ten cities
what's 10 factorial no the computer
could probably crunch through that
number what about 50 cities okay that's
just three with 64 zeros after it
it's like a really really really big
number I mean what's the what thing uh
the age of the known universe 50 is
thirteen point six times two billion
years that other numbers a lot more than
that so and you know even if we could do
like a million per second or something
it's trust me we're going to have some
issues so let's talk about it so what
are some solutions to this next week
we're going to look at genetic
algorithms which is a technique for
trying to optimally find a solution and
there are ways we might say something
known as a greedy algorithm I went all
for the scared to do well think this is
a problem able to edit this part out but
a greedy algorithm which might say like
I don't know let's just pick a city and
then pick the closest one then pick the
closest one to that trying to get us a
pretty good answer
even if it's not the exact Aquaman sir
the point of what I'm saying is this is
the application that I want to look at
in this first week so the things that we
need to learn about to be able to do
things and work with problems like the
traveling salesperson are number one
graph systems and number two search
algorithms okay now what is a graph
system a graph system is something a
system that is made up of two elements
node and an edge we can name these other
things but I'm going to call them the
nodes and edges one of the next videos
that you'll watch if you follow this
playlist will be on something called a
binary search tree a binary tree is a
graph system where every node is
connected to two children nodes a left
and a right and those are connected to
two and those are connected to two etc
etc etc so this is one example of a
graph system so what you'll notice is we
need some sort of data structure to
store what are all the nodes and what
are all the edges and this depends on
the problem a common example also the
grass systems similar to the traveling
salesperson problem in a subway map so
let's say I need to get from this
station to this station well there are
all these other stations and routes and
maybe they all are interconnected and
there's many ways to get on this bus
subway map makes no sense there's many
ways to get there but they all take
different amounts of time like maybe I
could go from here to here to here to
here to here which is hold on let me
read let me redraw this let me just draw
it like this so let's say I want to get
from here to here we could see like oh
I'm going to get from in one step to
here and it's going to a two step I want
to take two trains to get to here what
if this train takes 60 minutes this
train takes 30 minutes and each one of
these is six five - six - the six one in
this pick six so even though I have to
go on one two three four
or trains this is optimal this will get
me there faster this is known as a
weighted graph system so the graph
system is a bunch of nodes those nodes
might have value so a binary search tree
you can use to organize an alphabetical
order a lot of words or numbers and
other variety of things and you could
think of this but the edges here don't
necessarily have weights at least in a
standard binary tree but here they do
now there's an algorithm for searching
for that optical path in this scenario
in a weighted graph and it's called
Dijkstra's algorithm
there's also another algorithm called a
star and etc etc so these are different
examples binary search algorithm
Dijkstra's algorithm a star and the one
that I'm actually doing today but that
doesn't really matter to you because
you're to watch these videos the
sequences I'll talk about a second it's
something called breadth-first search so
breadth-first search is a good algorithm
for finding the shortest path between
two nodes in a graph that aren't
weighted so the shortest number of steps
and I'll talk about the example that I'm
gonna use for that in a bit so this week
is all about learning how to program a
graph system and learning about
different algorithms to efficiently
solve a some type of problem associated
with the graph system like the shortest
path and you'll and so now once you stop
watching this video there's going to be
a bunch of others in this playlist that
I've made at all different times under
different circumstances so this is the
experiment that I'm trying going to put
together a sequence course with all
different coding challenges so you'll
see there's a binary search tree example
there will be a breadth-first search
example there's there is no at the time
of this recording but there might be at
the time as you're watching a Dijkstra's
algorithm a star so you'll see and I'm
going to be filling stuff in as time
goes on once you get to the end of all
of those if you choose to watch them all
I'll make another video that kind of
wraps up and shows you a bunch of
examples all together and gives you some
ideas for some homework exercises that
you might do that you could share with
me in the comments and that sort of
thing if you want to participate in
aflac channel that I have that's going
on for this course you can sign up
patreon.com coding train is a
crowdfunding thing if you want to
participate in this black channel but
you can also always hit me up on twitter
at Shipman and in the comments here
which I do read ok so that's what's
going to happen next and I will see you
if you decide to come back in a wrap-up
video where I kind of summarized a bunch
of this stuff and give you some exercise
ideas great so I'm going to go and
actually record a video right now on
breadth-first search but you might watch
the leaves other ones first thanks very
much
I've always it back at the end of my
videos when you think they're over so
one thing I want to mention that if
you're about to watch some of these the
rest of the videos in this sequence
first of all you should you know if you
don't know JavaScript programming and
p5.js you might want to take a look at
some of my intro people have shows
videos but more importantly than that if
you have experience with two things that
I'm using in these videos is one is this
concept of prototype as a way of
attaching methods to an object in
JavaScript as well as this idea of an
associative array or hash table and how
that works in JavaScript so those two
things or might be videos that you might
want to go and watch first before you
start looking at some of these craft
systems and different search algorithms
okay just in case that matters to you
you know but you don't really have to
know very much to follow this stuff
along if you know a bit about
programming you've tried you watch them
my other videos hopefully you'll be ok
if not let me know and I'll see what I
can do ok
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
