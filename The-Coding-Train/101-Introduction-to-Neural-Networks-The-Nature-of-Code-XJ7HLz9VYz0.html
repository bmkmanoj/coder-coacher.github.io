present time doesn't exist but when you
are watching this video right there to
the right of nine genetic algorithms
will be the number ten and will say next
to that neural networks so I am
embarking on a journey to learn about
neural networks what they are how you
program them what are their what's kind
of like math and stuff you need to know
to make them work and then what kinds of
creative and experimental outcomes can
you have now it should be said that
there are lots of machine learning
libraries out there there are lots of
examples and resources for doing this
well I want to hold on I'm still talking
I don't know where they put that book
after here I want to reference this book
make your own neural network by tariq
Rasheed which I used to develop a lot of
the materials that I will be presenting
to you and developing during this series
of videos and I should also say that you
know and this book this book has all
sorts as how to program your own neural
network from scratch and without even
doing anything by programming in Python
because as I might have said earlier
today any reasonable person would start
and make a video tutorial series about
programming a neural network from
scratch in Python but I don't really I'm
not very reasonable or logical and I
make just constantly make mistakes with
everything and here's a mistake that I'm
going to make I'm going to do all this
in JavaScript and the reason for doing
that is to have everything run in the
browser on the web and also really for
me to learn about how to do this stuff
so I am going to build a set I'm going
to build a simple neural network library
in JavaScript not to make something
efficient not to make something robust
but to learn about the mechanics of how
all this stuff works because ultimately
and you we want to just enjoy your
summer or maybe you're watching this
during the winter and get outside and do
something else
and not watch these videos and just skip
ahead to like later because I'm going to
do a bunch of coding challenges and
projects that involved that neural
network library and also other neural
network libraries namely something
called tensor flow in future videos but
these first videos of building the
neural network library which I will do
over a series really just for me to
learn how to do this stuff if you want
to watch and sort of give me some good
feedback and see if you can follow along
and improve on what I'm doing and help
me with it
that would be great so ok what what
hello am i just rambling here I am but
why are we here so I'm going to go so
the nature of code materials in this
video sits in the nature of code
playlist is all about looking at things
in nature in our physical world and
trying to unpack those things and
understand the algorithms behind those
things and see if we can convert those
figs those algorithms into code who's
like going but like also playing how do
I stop that and turn those things into
software to make animations and creative
projects why not look at something
really interesting in nature the brain
so this is kind of a loose diagram of
this idea of an actual biological neural
network apparently I have one here
struggling quite a bit these days where
there are these entities called neurons
and they're connected to other neurons
and there's a lot of you know mystery to
this in a lot of recent research to be
very science what I am focused on in
this series of videos is what kinds of
computational systems can be built
inspired by the actual biological neural
neural network biological brain and made
into something called an artificial
neural network and what kinds of
applications and outcomes can we can
create so what is the analog what is the
neuron in but in our code how does it
receive
inputs how does it generate outputs so
my brain does this it receives all these
inputs you know from life in the room
that travels through my retina into the
brain and the signals enter these
outputs that allow me to catch something
or read some words what how can that how
can that process be simulated in
software and what types of outcomes can
be generate and the very first thing
that I'm going to do is look at the
simplest possible neural network a net
value in a network at all it has one
neuron a processor neuron that receives
two inputs and generates an output and
that's called a perceptron so if you
look at the next videos in this playlist
I am going to build in processing a
perceptron example just to show the
mechanics of how this works and to
produce a from trivial example that
doesn't necessarily have a very powerful
outcome but gives us because if we can
build and understand how this single
neuron receives inputs processes those
and generates an output then we can
start to connect those together to
create more sophisticated systems that
can begin to generate outputs based on
more complex output space or more
complex inputs and this is kind of a bit
sits right there in the world of machine
learning this idea of I have some data
that I want to make sense of that data
is an input to a machine learning
algorithm that algorithm is going to
generate it an output so maybe the data
is an image the machine learning
algorithm is going to guess is it a cat
or a dog or maybe that input is this
specs of the house you know square
footage a number of bedrooms etc etc and
that machine learning system is going to
generate an output a predicted price so
there are lots of other machine learning
algorithms besides just neural network
based ones and I do have another videos
purities that cover some of those but
ultimately I want to learn how a neural
network works so I can place it right
there and start to make sense of data
generate outputs from it so if you want
to continue along the way this video
series will work first will be a
perceptron which
this thing then I'm going to talk after
the perceptrons done I'm going to talk
about what the limitations of the
perceptrons are and why it is that if we
can create a multi-layered perceptron
meaning many of these perceptrons all
connected to each other what we can
start to build and create afterwards so
that's my rambling introduction that
apparently you just watched it goes I
mean maybe I'm did no one will ever
watch this but but but probably somebody
will and I'll see you follow along I
look forward to your feedback I hope
this goes okay that's mine it's a pretty
good goal just okay it's fine and I'll
see you in these future videos as I keep
going thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
