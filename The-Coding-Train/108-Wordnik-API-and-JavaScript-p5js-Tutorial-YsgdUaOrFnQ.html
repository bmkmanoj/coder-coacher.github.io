look at an API called the word Nick API
which is an API that allows you to get
lots of information about words in the
English language so on the one hand this
might be relevant to you and that you're
interested in the word Nick API on the
other hand you just might be interested
in how do you work with api's how do you
work with data so I'm really looking at
this as a case study of one particular
API and I'll do a few more videos after
this with other API is like the New York
Times API maybe some API that involves
images okay so where do we get started
here so I'm using the p5.js JavaScript
library
I'm using the p5.js editor which you can
get a p5.js org and let's get started so
first of all what is this word dick
thing so let me go to my friend I like
the I don't know my friends are things
on the computer apparently the browser
and look at the word Nick website so
here I am just at word Nick comm and I
could type in a word like rainbow and I
could see here that word Nick is giving
me lots of information about this word
it's giving me definitions it's giving
me examples I can see here etymologies
where's the word come from related words
synonyms equivalents hyper names so
these there's lots of information lots
of data associated with a particular
word so we're Nick is a vast dictionary
and resource for gathering information
about words it and I don't pretend to be
an expert in it at all
I'm extra connected fake actually but
looking at it from the lens of I'm a
person who is talking about JavaScript
code and data and api's this seems
interesting to me let's try to make
something with it so now this is just
the word Nick website there's all this
data there so you have to ask the
question how do you get access to that
data well the lovely thing here is that
word Nick happens to say to you oh look
you we have this data we want you to
have it and there is this thing called
an API application programming interface
a way forward Nick server the programs
that run in its server to send your
program data through JSON through the
through this format known as JSON and if
you're interested if you don't know
about how that stuff works you can go
back to the beginning of this video
series which kind of gives you an
introduction to that sort of data format
how this
works but I'm going to click over here
and I'm just at developer not wordnet
calm now and if I if I if I went to that
you'll see there's a lot of information
and things that you can look at but what
I'm looking for is this I'm looking for
this thing that says docks so how easy
it is to use an API is only as good as
the documentation and examples are and I
think word nick is a nice example of an
API that has good documentation and so
I'm going to walk you through how you
can bring it I'm I'm rambling way too
much but I am making a point in a way by
rambling which is that a lot of the work
involved with working with data and
api's doesn't even have facing do with
writing code it has to do with reading
the documentation playing around with
the website clipping hunt things and
figuring out how it works so that you
know by the time you get to writing code
you know exactly what to put in your
code and that's the stage that I'm at
right now so I kind of know where to
look
let me click on Docs and here we are and
you can see you know this this might be
unfamiliar to you like what's going on
here but you can see hmm ah
so I've looked at this before so I'm
trying to like get I'm like doing like a
method acting thing where I'm trying to
pretend I've never looked at this before
but I'm seeing here okay there's a bunch
of options here to click on and this is
quite common with API is in that they're
sort of commands that you can execute
with an API like maybe you want to ask
for information about one particular
word or maybe you want to get a list of
words back or you want to ask for
information about a group of words
so these what's what what's being shown
here are the different API commands that
you can kind of start with and I know
for a fact that in the scenario that I'm
imagining in my head I want to get
information about a particular word so
I'm going to click on this and it's
going to show me aha so if you if you in
the pre in one of my earlier videos
where I looked at open weather map the
whole thing was figuring out how to put
together this API query out of a bunch
of pieces so what the documentation is
showing you right here is what are those
pieces and in fact you could see like
mmm if I want to get the definitions of
a word there's like this part of the
path then there's that part of the path
and what's this thing here in between
curly
rackets oh that's the thing that I set
myself so if I want to get the
definition to the word Apple
I need this part of the path and this
part of the path and I want to put Apple
in there if I want rainbow I want
rainbow in there for one porcupine
I want porcupine in there just some
words I'm thinking up in my head so uh
for this particular example what I want
to do is look for related words so
where's that are synonyms words that are
antonyms you know similar words opposite
words those are the things that it kind
of might be intuitive to you but there's
lots of other ways that words are relate
related to each other something is
called a hyper name like furniture is a
hyper name for chair it's like a broad
category and there are high poems which
are the things in that category so they
can have these higher relationships of
hierarchy so there's a lot more to this
something with more knowledge about it
come and join me sometime
talk about that but I don't even need to
know be an expert on that I can click on
this related words and start to see okay
now here's this is something that makes
me personally super happy and it should
make you happy too if you want to work
for an API work for work with an API
which is that this is a tool so I in
order to figure out how to use the API
this is now an interface where I can
start to do things like okay let me put
the word rainbow in here use canonical
hmm that must mean something important
we could kind of read about that in the
documentation later but false default
that's why relationship typos I could
pick a relationship type or I could just
leave that blank limit per relationship
that must be how many things I get back
so you can see I'm sort of configuring
the API call that I'm gonna make and
then look at this button this is the
greatest button I've ever seen
yeah I've seen a lot of buttons and I'm
sure I'll see a greater one later today
but right now it feels like such a
wonderful button because it says try it
out so all I need to do is click on this
and you can see first of all look what
I've got I've got the full path to the
API query so this is that API query that
I spent all this time figuring out with
open weather map the tools of the word
Nick website are helping me make that
query already so I can just literally
copy paste this into my code and then
it's also showing me what the response
is so you can see I look at this
equivalent a SIBO a rainbow is
equivalent to a SIBO I don't know what a
SIBO is I guess it's a bow over the sea
and you can see the hyper names right
Ark is like a broader category for a
rainbow bow is a broader category what
other kinds of bows are there I'll help
my whole life I only ever thought there
were rainbows now I know there are sea
bows and other kinds of bows I mean
there's the bows you wear in your head
okay
cross reference spurious rainbow style
synonym bow what anguish this is like
fun I mean to me this is just fun like
I'm getting some moments of surprise
here getting some data you might have a
real reason why you're doing this but
the next thing I want to do just to like
really be sure that this is working the
way I want is I can take this full URL
and I'm going to just copy it again into
my web browser just into the address bar
and hit enter and you can see look at
this this is indeed the data that's
coming back so I've done I've now done
essentially all the work that I need to
do before I start writing code
I found the API I look around the
website I enjoyed it I found that it has
documentation and an API tool to help me
like configure a query I did that it
maybe it made the add URL address for me
and I put that into the browser and I
see that I'm getting data
so once I've gotten through those steps
my next step is to start writing some
code so really I need to use the lo JSON
function to get this data and then they
need to practice all the things that
I've looked at in previous videos which
is how do I get this is an object and
then there's an array called words over
the / whole thing is an array so how do
we dig into the data and and I'm gonna
get to that
so let's um let's get started so um okay
so one thing that I want to make a point
of here is that once again we have this
idea I'm gonna just I feel like I have
to use the whiteboard in the video which
is sort of silly I don't really have to
use the whiteboard but again I need to
do this thing where I think about this
API call in pieces so I might have the
path to the API I might have my API key
as a particular variable and then I'm
going to create that API call as like
the API plus the API key
and then something that goes here in the
middle this is the word that I want to
search for like rainbow or something
like that so this is one of the things
that I'm going to have to figure out is
now that I have that really long URL
that's your thoughts you can see it up
at the top there how do I break it into
pieces to make the query in the code so
okay so let me come back over here and
let's start writing some code first I'm
just going to grab this URL and I'm
going to go back to p5 and I'm going to
say VAR URL equals and it's this long
thing now one thing you'll notice by the
way is there's an API key in there
already like who's API key is that now
um what word Nick actually don't know
that this is true but I'm speculating is
that word Nick when you're using their
tool just generates a temporary API key
that you can use to try out the API so
hopefully this will work in my code for
a little bit if not I have my API key
saved in a file but again to do this
yourself you're gonna have to sign up
for an account developer account with
word Nick and get your own API key or
like analyze this video and use mine
which is fine with me my API key your
API key that's how I feel about my API
keys okay so a couple things I want to
do is I want to first realize that like
okay I need this is the thing rainbow
right there that's the thing that I need
to put into the query myself so I'm
going to put a end quote here and then
I'm going to make another variable that
stores rainbow and then I'm going to
make another variable that says URL to
so I'm going to just divide it into two
parts
so this is one way of doing it right
that big URL has the beginning and the
end and the one thing in the middle that
I need to change so I think this is kind
of a way of doing it okay so next what I
am going to do is I'm going to create
I'm gonna I'm going to have a link on
the page which will be like a button and
I'll put the word rainbow in it
sorry I lost my train of thought for a
guide like went into some sort of trance
state forgot that I was making a video
let me come back look what am I doing
here
so first of all actually let me just
check to make sure this works so I just
want to add
JSON your l1 plus the word + URL - - and
then I need a callback where that data
will come in so then I'm going to add
that callback and the callback the
variable the argument that's part of
that function that's what gets filled
with the data and I'm going to say print
line data just to see that this works so
whoops and I better save this is
something word Nick so let me run this
and see if it works and you can see ah
good
something is happening there I got some
data back so first of all we can be
happy we know that this idea works now
what I want to do is what I want to do
is put something on the screen that when
I click on it it makes that API call so
I'm going to make a I'm just going to
call it like a link and in ms a link
equals create a with that word in it so
and it's going to link to nothing so
okay so I'm kind of jumping around here
but in the p5 library in the Dom library
there's a function called create a which
makes an anchor link link you might say
a href equals google.com and then Google
here I'm doing I want the word rainbow
to link but to nothing I'm just putting
the pound sign in there because it
doesn't actually link to another URL I'm
gonna handle the clicking on it so if I
look at this now if I run this sketch
you can see here there it is rainbow up
at the top and I probably should add no
canvas because there's like an invisible
canvas there that's making the spacing
weird and I can run this again you can
see there it is up at the corner so I
don't have any luck clever styling going
on here but there it is up at the corner
so now what do I want to do I want to
make it so when I click that link I'm
going to make write a function called
add word what word ask word Nick then in
that function ask word Nick I'm going to
make that call to load JSON right so
here we've got a good type I could type
so here we go right what do I have now I
have this web page that has a single
link on it when I click on that link
this ask word Nick function will be
triggered that ask word Nick
we'll make an API query to Wernick and
the data will come back so the question
is what do I do when the data comes back
so first of all let's just see that this
is even working so I'm going to run this
again what I want to see it right now
what's what happens when the data comes
back I just should see something in the
console down here so I click on rainbow
and I see something in the console down
here
perfect now what I want to do is look
into that data and pull out a related
word to the word rainbow so let's go
back to here where I had that data open
now what is this what is this okay god I
don't know this is an array you can see
that square bracket with bracket at the
top means that it's an array what is
each element of the array it's a kind of
relationship so each element is a kind
of each element array of like
equivalency hypernym maybe cross
reference you can see and then what's in
each element of the array a property
called words which has another array
which are actual the actual words that
are related so for example if I wanted
to get to this particular word SIBO I
would say data index 0 dot words index 0
right data is the whole thing index 0 is
this first object dot words is that
property index 0 is that SIBO let's try
that so I'm going to go back to my code
and I'm going to say print line data
index 0 dot words index 0 I think that's
what I said right let's just look at
that I'm going to run it and I click on
rainbow boom ah and look at that the
most beautiful two words in the English
language to me right now
this is working SIBO so what could I do
with that well if I have access to this
link why not just change the content of
it so I'm going to say link dot HTML
oops this is the wrong place but I don't
need this draw function I'm not using it
link HTML is that data so there we go
and now when I save this and we're
it again let's zoom in here I'm going to
click on rainbow and I'm going to see
Zeebo
so I query the the word Nick API and I
got back a related word what happens
when I click on see Bo mmm nothing
I'm still getting see Bo so what I want
to do is now when I query again I want
to get a related word to see Bo so I'm
kind of playing a game of telephone with
the word Nick API 15 minutes into this
yeah if you're 15 minutes into this
video is still watching you know hashtag
C both uh okay uh that's uh no I don't
know if this is really working my whole
hashtag thing I feel like I'll but
you're like doofus okay so uh so what do
I need to do this is always querying on
my finger disappeared this is always
querying the variable word the variable
word is always the word rainbow what I
want that word to be is now C Bo so what
I really need to do is update the
variable to be that word and then I'm
going to add put the book update the
variable to be that word and then update
the content so now the next time it asks
for Nick it's going to pass in c bo so
it feels like a very word strange word
to say so I'm going to click here I get
C boat and click there I get rainbow
execute see about all rainbow simple
rainbow so there's a flaw in what I'm
doing right the flaw and what I'm doing
is I'm only ever getting exactly the
first similar the first related word of
the first related category so what what
could be a better solution here think
about that think about this why don't I
pick a random category and a random word
from that category so you know what you
might do right now is pause the video
stop and like try to implement that
yourself I would wait for you but that
doesn't make any sense so I'm going to
go on and do this right now and that's
going to wrap up this video but this
could be something you could stop and
try to implement on your own but you can
see that there's two numbers in here I'm
getting the zero element of the data
array and the zero element of the words
array so what if I want to get a random
element of the data array and a
an element of the words array well I
just need to use the p5 random function
I could use the native JavaScript math
dot random but I'm using the p5 library
which has its own random function so I
could say you know I could say index and
I maybe else call it index 1 equals a
random number between 0 and data length
right data dot length is is it data is
that first array so I want a random
number in that array but remember random
gives me a floating point a decimal
number so I need to use the floor
function to chop off that decimal I
don't want to be mean to the decimal to
remove it nicely kindly put it to the
side and I'll talk to it later decimal
friend of mine so then I'm going to now
once I have that what do I need but a
random word from whatever I picked so
now data index 1 dot length i dot words
dot length right I this is now right I
picked a random index into the data
array so I need to look at that array
that that element in the data array and
get a random index of the words array
from that particular element and I'm
going to call that index 2 so I'm going
to say data index 1 words index 2 into
this kind of quickly but hopefully this
works
and now I run this again and I've got
rainbow arc-flash
bash bashed clashed clashes dashes -
foil frustrate nugatory slash okay I
don't know where this is going I want to
stop now word ever get like a word
that's very embarrassing for me to say
like pumpkin that's not that's not
embarrassing but I kind of not good I
don't want to say the embarrassing word
because then I'd be a bear
beary very easily embarrassed I'm
already I'm so embarrassed right now so
I think this wraps up this video and
there's so much more to word Nick I
really only showed you just this one
aspect of it of using this particular
API call which remember is related words
word dot JSON related words but you know
I might encourage you if you watch this
video and want to do something yourself
go back to that API tool come back here
I'm going to click back in the browser
look at all these different
abilities I could get example sentences
definitions top example um we're Nick
has this huge corpus of lots of source
text and you can actually get word
counts per year I think of frequency so
you might look at something like how
often is a word generally used in the
English language over time so there's so
much possibilities there I don't know
you probably have better ideas right in
the comments this is like the longest
video I've ever made 20 minutes and I
thank you if you actually are still here
watching and I'm gonna in the next video
I think I'm gonna look at the New York
Times API which is yet another API I
wish you could just I wish I could stop
and hear a question from you if there's
actually a live stream going on maybe
there will be a question but I'm going
to instead just hit and record goodbye
and until the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
