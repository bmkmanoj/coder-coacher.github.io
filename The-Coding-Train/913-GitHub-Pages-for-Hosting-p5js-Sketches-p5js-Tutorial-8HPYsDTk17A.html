to take a p5.js sketch and host it with
github pages so in order to follow this
tutorial it assumes two things you have
a github account and you have a p5.js
sketch and the p5.js sketch I'm going to
show you is this one which is just a
little a little simple game
demonstration where there's a obstacle
coming at you and you've got to hit the
spacebar in time to jump over the
obstacle
okay so if you can see that's the basic
sketch now what is this sketch it is a
directory in the directory it's called
running game which is I don't know why I
called it that and it has a set of files
associated with it as an HTML file to
JavaScript files and libraries files the
point of github pages though is you can
host anything you can make whatever your
gonna has many CSS files HTML files as
many JavaScript files you can have
directories images all that sort of
stuff but I'm gonna take just this core
basic directory and host it on github
using github pages so the first thing
that I need to do in my in my github
account under rainbow coder is I just
need to make a new repository and make a
new repository I'm gonna call it p5.js
sketch obviously you should call it
something better but that'll work fine
showing how to host p5.js sketch with
github pages I want it to be public so
people can see it I'm gonna I'm gonna
initialize it with a readme so it has
something in it to start and then I'm
just gonna hit create repository then
I'm going to add a branch this is key I
need to go into her branch matcher I
need to add a branch called gah - pages
I'm gonna create that branch then what I
want to do just for safety reasons I
want to go to settings under branches
and I want to switch the default branch
to gh-pages I'm going through this a
little bit quickly because you can watch
my previous video where I do this in a
bit more detail but here I'm gonna show
you the steps again here but more
quickly so all I need to do is hit
update I want to say I understand update
the default branch I want the default
branch always to be github gh-pages only
the stuff that's in that branch is
viewable on hosted online as a web page
so then the other thing I'm going to do
just also for safety is I'm gonna go
back to my repository I'm gonna
here under branches and I'm just gonna
under master here I'm gonna click this
trash icon all the way over on the right
cuz I just want to delete the master
branch so there's no more master branch
this particular repository only has a
gah - pages branch so here we are I have
an empty repository with nothing in it
agh - pages branch and now I need to
commit those files my sketch to the
branch now there's a bunch of different
ways I could do it I could clone this
repository down I could add the files
and I could push it back but just for
simplicity right now I am going to just
actually grab this whole directory and
drag it in here so get up pages is
github as a tool it allows me to upload
files directly to it and so it's
uploading everything and now I'm gonna
say uploading my p5.js sketch and I'm
gonna say commit directly to the
gh-pages branch I'm gonna hit commit
processing my files it takes a minute
and there you go now one thing you'll
notice here is my files are in a
directory called running game I could
have had them and the core directory
which I mean in the root directory which
probably would make some sense maybe
I'll show you that in a second but you
can see that the files are there so now
where do I find where do I where do I
see this stuff so the URL is always your
username github you slash your your
repository name but if you don't want to
remember that you can always just click
on settings and then scroll down and
you'll find here under github pages that
your it'll say your site is published
here so I can click here now the irony
here is it's gonna say it can't find
anything I'm getting a 404 error that's
because I actually have my index.html
file in a directory called running game
so I've got to go add that directory
right here running game and I'm gonna
hit and I spelled it wrong I'm gonna hit
running game and now you should see
there it is so there's my sketch online
and I have a permanent URL to that
sketch so there it is there it is hosted
on github pages now if you want it to
just appear at the root directory p5.js
underscore sketch what I would recommend
doing is I'm gonna go back to the
repository and actually I'm gonna
just I'm gonna clone it I'm gonna fix
this by cloning it so I'm gonna go sorry
everyone I'm gonna go to this repository
rainbow where am I
p5.js sketch I'm gonna grab the URL for
cloning it and I'm going to go here and
I'm gonna CD back up to my desktop I'm
going to say git clone here and I'm
gonna open that drawer here and I'm
gonna look at running game so let's look
at this
so whoops no nonono p5.js sketch so mp5
just sketch this is what's in that
particular repository and I'm just gonna
take those files and I'm gonna put them
in the root directory and then I'm gonna
delete that folder and when I go back
here I can say CD into p5.js sketch and
I can say git status so you can see it's
telling me I moved all these files
around I did to all sorts of stuff so
I'm gonna say add dot dash a to add
anything and delete everything and then
I'm gonna say git commit move files to
root directory and then I'm gonna say
git push origin and now the really key
thing I'm gonna put those changes back
up I don't want to say get push origin
master remember everything happens in gh
- pages so I'm gonna push everything up
and I'm already authenticated it might
ask for your username and password and
now I should be able to go here and you
can see all of the files are now here
just in the root directory there's no
more running game directory and I can
actually just now go to rainbow rainbow
coder github is lash p5 underscore
sketch you can see this is the URL that
I'm going to I can hit enter and there
is my sketch so you can easily just have
files in your github repository as long
as they're in the gh - pages branch then
you know where to view those pages
hosted on the web so I showed you all
the possibilities I showed you uploading
files just through the github interface
I showed you cloning and making changes
but you can you can work entirely
through the kid hop interface you can
work entirely locally through terminal
all of those possibilities
are open to you the only thing that you
have to know how to make sure is that
all of your work is happening in gh -
pages and that you know the URL which is
your username github do slash the
repository name incidentally you can
also have a custom URL that involves
creating something called a cname file
I'll make another tutorial which will be
like part 9 at some point of this series
of how to do that or part 10 where in
this github get and getup tutorial
series will be that video as well ok so
hopefully you found this helpful and I
will see you in some other part of the
universe somehow I hope</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
