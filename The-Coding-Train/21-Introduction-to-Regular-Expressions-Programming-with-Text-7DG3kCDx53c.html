from A to Z set of videos and this is
the first video in a series of videos
all about regular expressions great
expressions actually I mean I don't know
if you should be like me but they are
something that I just absolutely adore
um
they are just fun little puzzle strange
things that you can do to just expand
your mind and you'll find so many if you
look around and looks for regular
expression games you'll probably find
tons of games people are making on the
Internet
where you try to like solve things with
regular expressions and I encourage you
to make your own but I don't want to go
off too long about that what I want to
do in this video is simply talk to you
about what a regular expression is and
in fact what's interesting about this
topic is this topic really stands alone
regular expressions have nothing to do
with JavaScript well they have nothing
to do but they they aren't inherently
something that only has to do with
JavaScript or Python or Perl or Java or
C++ or even programming whatsoever and
in fact a lot of what I'm going to show
you today is how to use regular
expressions just as a tool for yourself
in a text editor for writing or Find and
Replace and that sort of thing and you
can see so here's the downside of
regular expressions
the downside of regular expressions is
that's what they look like so they're
possibly one of the most cryptic
strange-looking things that you could
ever possibly create with strings of
characters and this is in fact a regular
expression that is searching for phone
numbers and you can see here that
magical regular expression has found
these three phone numbers in this
particular piece of text which leads me
to the discussion of what a regular
expression actually is I don't know why
I'm coming over here but I am okay a
regular expression is a sequence of
characters that defines a search pattern
in a search pattern for text so it
actually comes you know if you look at
the history of why these regular
expressions things exist read about this
on Wikipedia you'll find that it comes
from the map
amount of concept of regular sets sort
of an interesting side note but here
really what what I want to show you how
to use them is how to define a search
pattern in a body of text so let's let's
talk about what this means exactly hello
this is coding rainbow right here is
text okay now I want to define a search
pattern to search inside this text here
is a regular expression often referred
to as reg X for short regular expression
this is a valid regular expression it is
a pattern the pattern is as follows
capital R followed by lowercase a
followed by a lowercase I followed by
lower case and follow a low case being
followed by locus o followed by
lowercase W and you might think it
absurd that I went through that whole
thing but this is exactly how you need
to think of regular expressions you need
to look at that sequence of characters
and translate what each character means
and in this case each one of these
characters is what's known as a literal
character meaning the pattern is the
pattern that I'm searching for is
literally the character capital R
followed by literally the lowercase a so
you could imagine what would happen if I
go over to I'm not going to go over
there if I go over to text editor I hit
command F I'm searching in the text I
type in rainbow it'll highlight for me
every time rainbow appears now this is
unto itself not super powerful yet when
you add the addition of this idea of
something called a meta character a meta
character meaning a character that it
does not indicate a single literal
character but a character that indicates
some type of more generalized pattern
for example I could say I want to match
the capital letter R followed by any
possible vowel followed by the N
followed by any possible consonant
followed by any possible uppercase
character followed by any digit followed
by any white space you can imagine how
you can start to create more and more
generic patterns that were multiple that
would match different kinds of text so
let's think about this a little bit more
I'm going to come back over here for a
second and point out let's think about
the phone number example I think it's a
useful example to start with imagine you
had a huge text you've got access to
this massive text and you want to
publish it but it has lots of private
phone numbers in it and so what you
ultimately want to do is redact the
phone numbers so you need a way of
searching throughout the text for every
phone number but you can't say literally
I want to search for not the actual
numbers you have to say I want to search
for something like I want to search for
three numbers followed by either a dash
or a dot followed by three numbers
followed by either a dash or a dot
followed by four numbers oh and it's
possible the first three numbers could
have parentheses around them and this by
the way is exactly what this particular
regular expression is doing so let's go
back and unpack this a little bit more
and let me show you what what some what
some meta characters are so I want to
keep a running list of meta characters
and I think I'm just kind of in this
video I'm just sort of introducing the
topic and I'm going to talk about this
phone number example in the next video
I'm going to kind of start to go through
the pieces of regular expressions a
little more one-by-one so it might jump
around a little bit here then I'm going
to go through them one by one I think
that's going to work okay so let's think
about the phone number example so I
might the text that I'm looking in has
this in it nine one seven five five five
one two three four and six 46.8 six
seven five three oh nine okay so how do
I I want to create now a pattern that
will match these so what could I say and
let's make a list of meta characters
over here the first thing I want to
match is any digit so guess what
backslash backslash D means any digit
zero through
backslash D followed by backslash D
followed by backslash D followed by what
now in this case it's always followed by
a - so - I'll erase this so this is
metacharacter metacharacter
metacharacter literal character
backslash d backslash T backslash T -
backslash D backslash Dean backslash D
backslash T so this means search for any
text that matches three digits followed
by a dash followed by three digits
followed by a dash followed by four
digits so now what I want to do is
actually show you this running in the
wild so one of the things you can do in
most text editors so for example the
atom text editor the sublime text editor
a lot of things tools that you might use
have when you do the command F for find
there's all often a little button there
that allows you to search by regular
expression so let's look at that so I'm
going to come back over here and I'm
going to delete this we'll make this
happen later I'm going to do this so
pretend I'm like this pretend I'm like
this I am like this pretending that that
other stuff didn't exist a moment ago
and now when we do is do command F so
normally I might do something like this
okay
type in phone and you can see it
highlighted phone for me and I realize
this text down here is very very small
I'm going to try to zoom into it when I
remember but it's some atom doesn't I
can't seem to figure out a way to make
that text bigger so I could also search
for nine one seven - five five five and
you can see I'm searching literally for
this particular phone number now what I
said is I could do slash D / D / D now
look at this notice this just looks like
this is actually looking for literally
slash D / D / D in order to enable
regular expressions I need to go all the
way over here see this button and it
says use regex so that button enables
regular expressions in the search and
incidentally why is it dot star so two
more meta characters dot means
character I've got the wrong whiteboard
marker again and star is what's known as
a quantifier and again I'm going to go
through this stuff in sequence meaning
zero or more so this dot star which
you've probably seen like oh I want to
look for all my files called rainbow dot
star that means it could be rainbow cap
PNG or rainbow happiness dot jpg or
rainbow si do si write any file right
rainbow dot star this is often referred
to as a wild card and it is in fact it
comes from regular expressions this is a
regular expression it means I want to
match rainbow followed by any number of
any characters wild card anything zero
or more anything this matches absolutely
everything in the known universe this
regular expression matches the universe
okay so that's where that comes from
back over to here we can see here dot
star so now I'm using regular
expressions as soon as I do that and I
come back over here can I come back over
here oops
ah oh I have to enable it you can see
this is now highlighted so regular the
syntax highlighting will happen for you
and you can see that it has now matched
all of these groups of three characters
now notice how it's still matching let's
say I only want to match groupings of
three numbers notice how its matching
five-30
with the nine afterwards so what could I
do here I could say oh well I only want
to watch three numbers followed by a
dash so you can see here now I'm
matching only three numbers followed by
a dash I could say a dash or or followed
by anything okay well that's not really
right so I'm going to have to over the
course of the next few videos I'm going
to show you all the pieces of things
that are part of a regular expression
and create a bunch of different
scenarios and examples to show you a
bunch of examples of regular expressions
and by the end you should have a sense
of how they work then I'm going to show
you how to use these regular expressions
in code in JavaScript specifically and
do a couple coding challenges around
manipulation with those regular
expressions okay so okay if this gave
you the basic idea and how to use them
in Adam and I'll be seeing you in future
regular expression videos maybe okay
