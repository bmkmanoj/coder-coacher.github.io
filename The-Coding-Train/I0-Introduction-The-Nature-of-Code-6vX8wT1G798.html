it's probably not morning for you but it
is for me good morning here in this
strange place that I am okay so somehow
somehow you found your way here and
you're watching this video and I've
never done this before I sort of have
done this before but I haven't done it
in a while and I certainly haven't done
it with this newfangled setup that makes
that where I'm sort of floating in this
strange white space so uh but babbling
is probably not what I should do it's a
little it's not that's not that's not
the best way to start okay so my name is
Daniel nobody ever calls me I tell you
you could call me Dan Schiffman dan
Schiffman any variation of of those I
teach at a place called ITP and I'm
teaching a class in two days called the
nature of code where we look at
programming simulations of natural
systems and we use this thing called
processing to do so so for this year for
this semester I'm planning hoping and
and and really really thinking about and
I'm going to do it because I'm doing it
already right now recording a city
series of videos about the topics in the
course and the students are going to
watch these videos I'm also going to
meet with the students answer questions
something's going to happen
with me in the students in the classroom
but these are videos now these videos
anybody can watch maybe not because I
might never want anyone to watch them
but if you are watching them then I
guess I did let somebody watch this
video so what I can skip now you can
just turn this one off and go to the
next one you probably have already but
what I'm going to do in this short video
which I've already been going for two
minutes I want to try to limit this one
this one will be a little bit longer I
want my videos to be only about five to
seven minutes each this one might be
more like 10 to 15 minutes of I just
shut it off at any moment I want to
introduce the entire course so I want to
kind of talk about what are all the
topics we're going to look at go through
them quickly and look at a few
so if you're wondering though let's say
you came to this video you have never
seen it you have no idea why you're here
and what's going on I'm going to give
you even a little bit more of an
introduction I'm going to demonstrate
first of all I have this cup of tea
which is sitting over here there's a
table I'm in a room by the way it's
strange cuz I'm by myself talking to a
camera
I hope the audio is working although I
have to throw this one away and there's
a cup of tea here and I don't want to
spill it so I'm going to just for a
moment move it over here okay
it it's fine everything's fine nobody
worry okay and now I'm going to I'm
going to do something I'm gonna walk
over here over there is another part of
the room and I'm gonna hit this button
and now I'm over here and I strangely
I'm floating in front of a processing
window but this is actually just my
computer right in front of me here I can
lean over and kind of move this screen
around but I can look at it and talk
about this so we're going to be looking
at some code here but first let me just
open up a browser so okay so this is ITP
if you don't know what ITP is I'm in a
room walled off there's sort of a window
to the hallway there it's kind of
strange somebody might knock and we
could say hi to them but I'm wah this is
ITP if you're interested in my TP it's a
two-year graduate program we do all
sorts of stuff here you can take a look
at the website ITP NYU edu I also want
to show you processing processing is the
open source that I'm reading this is the
open source programming language and
environment for people who want to
create etc etc it's what I'm going to
use to demonstrate all these examples
this however is not a beginner video
series if you've never programmed before
you should watch my other video series
called I don't know learning processing
which doesn't actually exist sort of
does there's some draft videos hopefully
I'll get to those and publish them as
well it's free I wanted to say only 995
but it's actually just free I belittle
be free anyway so you should download
processing you should take a look there
are all sorts of great if you're you
know there's a bunch of tutorials here
you can find a bunch of great books this
is a really I believe Ducktown
underneath this one over here is a
really great one to get started with
because it's called getting started with
processing hopefully didn't mess up the
audio I would recommend it there's lots
of places you can get started with
processing now if you're looking for
more material text-based material to
follow along these
deals with you could go to the teacher
of koat.com
wow this is like some weird sales video
it's going to stop this so this website
you can get the book this book will go
along with all these videos you can also
get the PDF for free the book is also
just if I scroll down here and click
here you can see whoa and if I shrink it
a little bit you can see here's a table
of contents behind me and you can read
the material for the book online as well
so there's lots of resources you can get
if you're interested in this material
that I'm going to just talk about for
five minute videos over the 5 minutes
and 30 seconds were pretty good ok so
where are we going to start here though
what is the thing that we're beginning
with okay so programming natural systems
in processing well one of the things you
first do when programming in processing
is one of the things you first learn how
to do is move a circle across the screen
if I had prepared for this I would have
an example of a circle moving across the
screen to show you right now but I'm
just winging it and you can imagine what
that would be but so let's talk about
what that is so if you one of the first
things you learn to do is say this x
equals x plus 1 you have some circle you
circle you're driving down the screen
that's because that's what everybody
does take circles on the screen and it
has an X Y location and it when you say
x equals x plus 1 if you put that in
Processing's draw a loop right draw over
and over and over again looping looping
looping it goes up by 1 it goes up by 1
it goes up by 1 we see it here we see
here we see it here the illusion of
motion is created that's one of the
things you learn maybe if you took an
intro processing class if you read one
of those books if you looked at the
website one of the first topics we're
going to do in this I don't what to call
this video series this this this
television set program show I don't know
anyway uh is learn to formalize that and
learn to formalize it using good but
everything's ok just just drop the cap
oops I did it again to the kid
okay is using vectors okay topic number
one vectors vectors is nothing other
than what you've been doing already you
have an arrow it sort of says move this
from here what is a vector we're going
to look at all that we're going to
formalize our understanding of motion
into vectors which is allowing to
understand an object's location on the
screen as a position which has velocity
and perhaps even though acceleration
which is going to be very exciting the
keep right that I said this word
acceleration acceleration is a vector
you can think of I accelerate a car I'm
is it going faster it's going slower am
i turning it what's the next step there
well if you ever took a physics class
which I think I might have it there's
something that's going to trip me here
this is kind of hanging there on the
floor don't I'm not going to spill the
tea with it okay everything's okay
if I spill the tea I'll pause the video
okay if you ever took a physics class we
might have learned it talking about
Newton's law there's this law force
equals mass times acceleration well you
can see there's a relationship between
acceleration and force and one of the
things we want to do is look at modeling
forces we're going to look at modeling
forces this is our sort of first
simulation of the natural world does
that even make sense right there's
physics in our world so we're going to
begin our simulations of natural systems
by looking at essentially custom
building our own physics engine you know
we're not going to build a fully fledged
super awesome amazing bells and whistles
collision detection crazy physics engine
we're going to look at basic physics
moving options or moving objects around
the screen with vectors understanding
how forces in the environment can affect
our motion well why don't we just walk
over here for a moment excuse me and
just see what I mean by that I'm going
to just I'm going to just look at a
couple examples as we're doing this so
if we want to think about forces one
thing here's a nice little demonstration
I should have run some of these
beforehand but me I'd like to make the
size of this bigger but you can see here
that we have some objects falling the
experience gravity they hit this liquid
they experience some sort of resistance
drag liquid
resistance air resistance friction like
thing viscosity there's all sorts of
words there we could use there's
formulas we're going to get into all
that and see how we can model that in
code okay so where were we I lost my pen
it's over here forces so you know once
we look at the basics of motion we have
something moving and has a velocity as
acceleration we might want to think also
about angular motion how what happens
when things spin oscillate all sorts of
other types of motion related to
trigonometry so we're going to spend a
few videos looking at oscillating
oscillation oscillating motion angular
motion anything really that has to do
with angles and trigonometry if you
wanted to know about sine cosine tangent
review those topics see how they apply
in codes yeah you can make things spin
move back and forth think of a guitar
string plucking a plucking think of
plucking a guitar string do you pluck a
guitar string I guess you pluck it
anyway or spring bouncing back and forth
we're going to look at all that stuff
with oscillation I really hope this is
working otherwise this is just good
practice just do it again I'll probably
to do this again anyway so we're going
to look at that oscillation and I could
go pull up an example but you can
imagine that for right now the fourth
topic on our list particle systems so
essentially we're spending all this time
understanding the basics of physics
building a physics engine how do we
formalize our understanding of moving
things around the screen to really
create dynamic and exciting animations
of motion once we get through that we're
all that time are we saying look at our
little circle whoo it's moving the
circle is moving around the screen once
we get through all that we're going to
say hey what if we want to make lots and
lots of lots of lots and lots of those
circles so really a week 4 week 4 video
4 video 12 who knows what video will be
on week 4 of the semester whatever this
topic number 4 particle systems is going
to be all about understanding how to
take a single entity that's moving
around the screen how to model a single
particle within a system of particles
and there's lots of topics that will go
with that we're going to spend time
really diving into the array
which is a Java class that we'll want to
use and processing to manage large
numbers of objects we're going to spend
time looking at advanced object-oriented
programming inheritance and polymorphism
polymorphism meaning many forms and I
really need to write this down here
because can you even see that you can't
see that right because this is it
doesn't exist over here I just move over
here I'm gone
but there's a room a whole room it's
like a physical place that we are that
I'm in by myself with some lights and
there's a computer over here okay so um
it's probably distracting to talk about
that okay I'm getting used to this okay
number five particle systems okay uh
well okay so well I'm going to maybe
move over to the computer in a moment
we'll look at some more examples but
number five here's the thing what have
we done here we spent all this time kind
of figuring out how to make a physics
engine but you could be a where physics
engines exist already there are plenty
of examples we're going to look at -
we're going to look at something called
box2d and we're going to also look at
something called toxic libs
and in particular the ver let physics
package of toxic lives and both of these
libraries you know there's you know
there are times in life where you just
want to make like your circle move
around the screen and change some pretty
colors like you just that's what you
want to do this afternoon you don't
really need to pour through box2d
documentation glasses figure it out
download a library just for that there
are times in life where you have these
really complicated strangely shaped
jaggedy polygons and you want them to
all bounce off of each other yeah that's
when you need something like box2d toxic
libs is another fantastic suite of
libraries it does so many things but we
really want to look at it for I'm
getting my photos vibrate ink over there
with the timer on it
it's like teetering on the edge about to
fall off of where it's standing but I
was saying toxic lives um toxic lives is
a really great for doing a connected
systems where you have lots and lots of
elements all connected together through
spring connections you can model
cloth string a jellyfish all sorts of
great things with toxic lips and we'll
see some examples of that um just to
show you what I mean by box Judy I'm
going to come over here for a second and
I have a very bad feeling ha ha so this
is what happens when you don't prepare
well I don't have the library installed
I'm just going to keep going you can see
examples of that this video is going for
way too long ok I'm going to redo it I'm
gonna upload it if you people can watch
it but I'm definitely have to redo this
video because this is just practice ok
so you can think of this as kind of part
one of a semester maybe you know in a
semester if you were taking a class
which you're not or maybe you are um
something called like a midterm would
come here
because the first half nature of code
part 1 so to speak is really dedicated
to this idea of modeling physics because
we need a core set of building blocks to
start with if what we're all Tamayo is
is think about complex systems systems
of many elements that have intelligence
or limited intelligence or perception in
their environment that when they come
together achieve some sort of goal or
exhibit the property of emergence or
evolve or develop like the brain with
connections we want to start looking at
all these other advanced topics we need
to set up building blocks and this
physics engine will become our set of
building blocks when we look at all
these other topics which I'm about to
kind of just rattle off and list we're
going to use the this these examples of
modeling motion to tease and I kind of
there's another one here 6 I don't know
maybe 6 should go up here I'm not really
sure
steering forces definitely gonna open up
some of these examples to show them to
you so this I think is one of my
personal favorites make sense scent this
is a reason why these videos should only
be five to seven minutes long because
I've already been going for 15 minutes
and I I don't know I feel like I
wouldn't want to watch this anymore and
I mean I don't want to watch any of it
cuz I want to look at myself but okay
but what it's too late I'm doing this
we're going to go through the rest of
these topics and you can
skip ahead to the next video that's you
don't have to watch this so but if you
liked it you could just keep watching
fast-forward would your clicker give a
clicker
okay so steering forces here's the thing
an important thing that I didn't mention
about all of this one through five is we
are dealing with this scenario let's
here's a scenario for you there is a
table there is a circle a ball some sort
of little soccer ball beach ball
basketball sitting on the edge of this
table and a gust of wind blows and the
the the circle just sort of pushes off
and falls down and bounces and hits a
wall and bounces up right that's we're
not only a physics engine there's
collisions there's forces there's all
sorts of stuff happening let's consider
this scenario there is a ball here but
it has little antennae and little tiny
feet could you see that to see my
beautiful alien drawing what if this
ball living ball chooses in and there's
a giant predator here uh big teeth earth
and it's coming it's coming at this
little alien I'm totally losing my life
I was coming at this little alien it
chooses to leap off and go this way so
there's a very different thing between
an inanimate object just sitting there
in the world responding to forces and
this entity that has life that has
desires and hopes and dreams and fears
and goals and wants to make a choice
something it could do so we want to
start looking at that this type of model
and the way we're going to do that is
through the lens of steering behaviors
there's a great book called vehicles by
Brayton burg which I refer to in my
materials I'll talk about it later in a
video there's the work of Craig Reynolds
who developed all these steering
behaviors for autonomous characters for
animations and that we're going to look
at but we want to say what does it mean
for an entity to make a choice to seek a
target to flee from a target to follow a
path in a crowd to flock like a block of
birds to swarm like a collection of bees
swarming how do we have an entity do
that and we're going to do that by
understanding
calculate steering forces the major
difference there is that this ball has
no understanding of its environment this
alien has a perception of environment it
can see that there's an evil predator
coming at it and we can see that there's
nothing down here and it needs to jump
to get off of there so just to for a
moment to look at some of these examples
what I'm going to talk about here is
under agents if I just go really quickly
to I think a nice demonstration of this
is a crowd path following which I will
open up very briefly and run it so we
want to get all the way to understanding
systems like this so you can see here
there are a lot of little circles moot
and a half they've only two they're only
two principles by which they live
principle number one follow the path so
we have to understand how do we define a
path how do we have something follow a
path principle number two do not bang
into my neighbor I just want to I just
want to have my own physical space I
don't like anybody getting too close I
just that's the two principles
separation path following so we want to
look at what are these steering
behaviors and how do we model these
forces seeking fleeing arriving
wandering path following wall hugging
obstacle avoidance etc etc then how do
we combine them when we combine them we
can get complexity and that is really
the key to where we're going in the
nature of code I kind of want to say
whew I don't know I would say it like a
scary voice but that does about wouldn't
make any sense
I need sound effects we're good to have
sound effects of buttons all here I can
press little sound effects okay so so
that's where we're going so this is
really part one part two we can think of
as complexity and because I'm already
going on for way too long we we talked
about combining steering forces simple
local interactions of autonomous agents
making all sorts of crazy emergent
phenomena happen we're going to look at
flocking we're going to look also at
cellular automata which I'm sure I said
incorrectly and maybe I'll learn how to
pronounce that
before we get there which is a complex
system where instead of the elements are
moving around they're sitting on a grid
so what does it mean to have a system of
simple elements with local interactions
on a grid and how could that really be
linked to all this motion stuff that
we've been doing so far we're going to
look at fractal patterns fractal systems
how do we design a fractal that's really
actually a set of elements moving with
vectors could we do that and then that's
really part too boy I'm just racing
through it now and then we're going to
get all the way to part three which I'm
going to call intelligence and we are
going to look at to really look my phone
must've buzzed again it's really about
to fall that's not a good place for us
little note to self don't just rest the
phone on top of the camera during while
making the video okay we're going to
look at evolution and modeling evolution
in software I'm going to set something
running over here an example where all
this is always going to tie to motion
and animation so if we go down here to
the genetic algorithm examples and I'm
actually just going to click on this one
evolve flow field I think this one has a
bug in it so it actually might crash but
let's run this for a second oh I didn't
press the button just talking okay so
here we are and you can see here all
there's all these entities almost look
like flies just like scattering out in
the wind these entities have DNA to them
they're there they have some sort of
principles encoded into them that is
their DNA and how they do their DNA gets
passed on to a next generation through
through a natural selection algorithm
they start the better ones prop the
better ones what's a better one it's
trying to get to their this target so
they're learning how to go around the
obstacles they're learning how to find
this path through the system through a
process of evolution so we want to look
at okay we learned how to make a complex
system I will come back and see how
they're doing in a second we learned how
to make a complex system like a flocking
system how could we actually give those
systems the the elements of those
systems make them into a population and
have them evolve hooray and then the
very last topic we'll look at although
maybe I don't
I really like this stuff no if I was
really interested but I did write some
stuff and make some example so I guess
I'll go through those but we're gonna
look at neural networks so what does it
mean to actually not only put DNA into
this animated thing that we put on the
screen but actually put a brain into it
as well and and is there something about
the human brain the way that the human
brain works that we might model in
software to some sort of interesting
effect let's go take it let's take a
look at our friends now it's like a
cooking show like where you put them in
the oven and now we're going to come
back check on them right no it's not
we're not cooking okay let's take a look
here we can see that they are they've
gotten quite further along you can see
they've actually learned to get around
mostly obstacles it doesn't look like
they've made it to the end yet so this
was my introduction I have a feeling I'm
going to just walk back over here that
didn't work I have a feeling that I will
probably rerecord this video maybe I
should make it into smaller snippets I
actually would like to show you example
projects of things that people have made
with a lot of these topics which i think
in a starting video would make sense to
kind of get it just see your ideas
flowing but this is the list of stuff
that I'm going to go through these
videos will never be this long again
this is kind of just practice I wanted
to just get this out there I have a list
if I could turn the camera now I'm out
of focus I know anyway but if we could
turn the camera over here I have a list
of all the videos I want to make for the
first day of class and there's about one
two three four five six seven of them
they'll be about five minutes each or
most ten minutes each or some around an
hour of content and my goal is to have a
place where you can watch them a place
where you can ask questions about them a
place where you can interact with the
code live on the page there's all sorts
of possibilities so that is the plan I
think there's a button now that I go to
press and turn this off right I goodbye
I enjoyed this I awkward pause come over
