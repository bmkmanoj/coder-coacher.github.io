am streaming soap that I had the window
open here because to get some cool air
in here but now there's an ambulance
hopefully not coming for me although
sometimes I just wish that an ambulance
would come and take me away
Calgon or Calgon would come and take me
away I don't know what I'm talking about
I'm just over here looking at myself so
I'm here doing a livestream I have this
habit that if somebody asks me to make a
video about something I'm like really ok
I'll go make it so I'm going to make a
video today about arrays and I'm gonna
use processing 3 which I'm so thrilled
to use because I'm making all these
JavaScript videos and processing 3 just
came out and processing 3 as always like
nice features so comfortable comforting
you know such a happy place for me to
just be using processing so I'm glad to
be doing that I don't have a second
laptop here right now but I'm in a
minute I'm gonna pop open the the
YouTube stream page and look at the chat
you'll actually I'm seeing it behind me
and so first let me know if you can see
ok can you read this font whoops
can you read that font can you hear the
audio fine and over here I'm also gonna
use this whiteboard and I feel like I
have a smaller area and I guess it's
what it always is and so hopefully you
can see that okay which I think you can
hi
ok so I'm gonna check the chat now I'm
gonna pull up this YouTube page and see
that there are a couple people who said
hello doesn't mean like there's anybody
here now but the stream help help I'm
sorry I forgot to press the button here
I am and there I am
by the way this shirt has green in it so
I'm like a little bit see-through today
can you see like if I walk over I don't
know I don't know what I'm doing anymore
ok so loud and clear and looking good
Thank You Paulo town alright so you can
also you're welcome to ask questions and
I will answer those questions but I'm
gonna go ahead and start this video
recording so this is like the live
stream which is like
the raw footage which gets automatically
uploaded to YouTube and what I do is I
hit a button at a certain point in
record I think every video starts with I
think I'm streaming and then starts with
this elaborate explanation okay so I'm
minimizing the chat now
so I'm not gonna see it for about ten
minutes but after I do this quick lesson
about arrays I'll come back and check
the chat I have like a half an hour so
so the it's only be about ten or fifteen
minutes I'm anticipating and then I'll
be able to take any questions about
anything not just arrays so I'm gonna
leave this open and I'm gonna put the
camera over here and I'm gonna come over
here in a second and start talking about
arrays boy Java processing that's right
okay oh you know what I need to do good
tie my shoe
it's untied I will trip I will fall this
is me live streaming tying my shoe okay
here's my pen I'll have a smiley face
I'll leave it there okay here we go
and three two one hello this is a video
UPS I will not hurt myself too much
throughout the course of this video I
let me let I'm just gonna start again
hello this is a video about arrays in
Java slash processing in fact and I'm
gonna use processing 3 which is a my new
song my new album processing 3 coming
out I don't know many years from now and
I'm not making videos about programming
but making albums about singing about
programming ok so what is an array why
do you want to use one how does it work
and what kinds of things can you do with
it that's the topic of this video so
perhaps you're familiar with this idea
of a variable int num 7 so you have a
variable the name is num the type is int
integer and the value is 7 but what if
you want to have a whole bunch of
numbers you want to have number one and
number two and number three
number four you'd have to make all these
variables well an array is essentially a
way in a single variable of having a
list of values and those things can be
numbers or pieces of text it could be an
array of images there's a list of
anything that's a piece of data in a
program you can have a list of that
thing and it you know aside there's an
aside here I'm not gonna talk about
objects in this video but arrays in
objects is a particularly powerful thing
link below then I will make sure to add
to videos about the raisin objects okay
so how do you make this list well with a
variable you always need a name and a
type so with an array an array is a
variable but it's a list of you know I
think of a variable as a single value an
array is like a list of values anyway so
we think the array which I'll call nuns
you also need to give it a name nums
and a type integer but you add this
extra bit of syntax square bracket
square bracket square bracket so look on
your keyboard now the square
brackets if you haven't used them before
you're gonna need them a lot with arrays
so now I have an array of numbers and I
can initialize it instead of as a single
value I can use curly bracket 7 comma 5
comma negative 32 comma 90 so now you
can see I have an array of 1 2 3 4
values so I'm gonna go start a sketch
and add this whoops look over here start
a sketch in adness so I'm gonna say at
the top int nums equals and I'm gonna
make them like 34 40 10 5 arbitrary
numbers and you can see here there we go
that's the syntax for an array now there
are other ways you can initialize an
array you can use a loop I'm gonna get
to that in a little bit this is just one
way to start off this list of values so
now the comes the question over here
if I wanted to use the Val let's say I
wanted to use that value num so to draw
an ellipse at
droid comma 50 and with a size num so I
wanted to use this particular value to
be the size of a circle I just take that
variable and I put it in the width and
height arguments of the ellipse function
so what if I want to use this one or
this one or this one some value from
this list from this array ellipse 100
comma 50 hmm num what pretending like I
have to figure this out the issue is
this is a single value so you can put it
right here it needs to be a single value
here I need to address one of these
particular values and the way that I do
that is with an index an index is an
address into the array it's like
counting the array you say like here's
number one number two number three
number four I except I've got a problem
here I mean actually I have a this makes
me very happy but it's a weird thing how
you count with arrays in programming you
could think of this as having four
elements that's the first element the
second element what I've told you is
accurate
however counting with arrays this is
technically index 0 so when you're
counting the elements of the array you
start with 0 not with 1 so this is
element 0 this is element 1 this is
element 2 and this is element 3 the
index values go from 0 to 3 with a total
of 4 elements so to individually address
one of these nuns index 3
once again the square brackets square
brackets are just the syntax of arrays
I'm gonna have an array UNAM addressing
not the third element right index number
three which is technically the fourth
element and now if you look at this this
line of code will draw a circle of size
seven and this line of code will draw a
circle of size 90 if I change this to
one I'll get five I change it to zero
I'll get seven so that's piece number
one let's go and add that here into this
program and so now I'm gonna say void
I'm going to say size 400 400 and I'm
going to in draw I'm gonna say
background zero and fill 255 and then
I'm going to say ellipse at you know a
hundred comma 200 nums index one numbs
index one so he zoom back out here and
run this code and look at the result and
you can see here tah-dah
I'm doing like singing today I don't
know why and that's not really singing
sing tada but whatever the the the size
of that circle is what 30 40 zero is 31
is 40 the size is 40 let's see it get a
little bit quite if I change this to
nums index 2 now look at that I've got a
tiny one yeah there's a few things I
could add to this and I'm not sure which
direction to go in but I'm gonna go in a
certain direction this is the direction
I'm going in right now let's let's draw
a circle with all of those so there are
4 elements 0 1 2 3 0 1 2 3 hmm
now let's draw them a little bit spaced
out at 100 200 300 400 and I'll make the
size 500 now look at this and let's make
these numbers a little bit bigger 50 92
so you can see what's going on here if
we zoom the screen in a little bit just
to look at all of this I've got four
circles at different xvalues 100 200 300
400 each circle is pulling its width and
height from that array index 0 index 1
index 2 and X 3 so this is working for
this is a nice idea and I will talk
about this for seven minutes
but this is and this works well like
this is sort of like helping us instead
of having 4 separate variables I have a
single variable with a list of four
items
I still have four lines of code down
here which is kind of ridiculous right I
mean it's not ridiculous but it's it's
it's the problem comes up what if I have
a hundred values in that array what if I
have 200 values in that array I don't
want to have 200 lines of code
however you'll notice there's a kind of
logic here start with 0 go to 1 go to to
go to 3 this is kind of counting
do you remember I don't know where
you've come from or why you're watching
and if there's enough light in here if
you but anyways do you remember there
was a time where you hopefully probably
learned about a for loop and if you
didn't we'll link you to a video about
it for loop below where you wrote
something like this or I've done this
many times for int I equals 0 I is less
than 4 I plus plus now if is just like a
terrible pen if I were to put much
better print line I write in here this
loop would run and first it would print
out the value of 0 then 0 go up by one
it would print out the value 1 then 0
would go up by 2 and this then it would
print out the value 2 and then up by 100
was print out of value 3 we get we get 0
1 2 3 then I would be 4 4 is not less
than 4 the loop would exit so notice how
a for loop is a structure that can be
used to count a variable from 0 up to
some limit like 4 well this is exactly
the structure that we need over here so
if I come back to this code and I say
for int I equals 0 I is less than 4 I
plus plus and then I grab this I take
this line of code and put it here
well now couldn't I replace that index 0
with I so this loop and I made myself a
little more space here this loop you can
comment this out this loop is now doing
the job of what this code did before
instead of manually having to type 0 1 2
3 this loop uses I to do numbers I know
0
number one number two and I'm sorry now
let's run this and see what happens okay
so that worked but it looks wrong why
does it look wrong ah all the circles
are at value 100 and I wanted the
circles to be at 100 200 300 400 well
over here
remember the loop is counting I 0 1 2 3
what happens if I multiply each of those
numbers by 100 times 100 times 100 times
100 I get 0 I get 100 I get 200 I get
300 oh but I wanted 100 200 300 400 I
know why don't I just add 100 to each of
these so you can see another thing we
can do I might be the index into the
array 0 1 2 3 but we can also apply some
math to I to do other interesting things
like here instead of now saying 100 what
if I were to say I times 100 that gives
me 0 131 0 100 200 300 and then what if
I add 100 to that then I have 100 200
300 400 so let's now run this and we
have exactly what we had before with
albeit only these values now one thing I
should mention two things I should
mention 350 things invention but you
know this has been going on for 11
minutes it's gonna be a little bit of a
longer video because I think I'm gonna
try to cover you know just sort of all
the erase stuff just in this video but
there's a couple things I should mention
one is I don't love that I have the
number four there are a hard-coded value
what if I were to add more values to the
array I still would only loop through
four of them so one thing you could do
with an array is nums dot length let me
just turn off the code completion so
nums dot length dynamically resolves to
the length of the array so if I were to
add another one
you know except 75 you can see I've
added an extra about an extra number
which got me an extra circle and now
it's looping through the entire way it's
always using the length and you know I
could space them out a little bit less
like let's space them out just
50 so we can see ah now they're kind of
crowded together aha but what was the
other thing I want to show here well
this is one way to initialize an array I
just give it some hard-coded numbers in
between those curly brackets however
what I might actually like to do more
often I'm trying to think of where to do
this is give the array initial values
that maybe are random so let's say there
were eight values and I want to say nums
index I equals int random somewhere
between 10 and 100 so this is this is
code that is filling the array with a
random number loop starting from zero
all the way up to eight pick a random
number between 0 100 and and put that in
the array but a funny thing about arrays
is that you you have to specify in
advance the size you want that array to
be now there are ways around this and
ways of expanding contracting an array
and I have other videos that cover that
but for the purpose of this discussion
right now the array is it has a fixed
length so we saw that one way to get
that fixed length is to just manually
type in the values but what if you don't
know the values in advance you just want
to know how many things should be in
there
well the syntax for doing that is a
little bit goofy looking but if you're
not filling it manually between the
curly brackets what you need to say is
you want a new integer array with like a
hundred spots in it so this is your
number to make up so this seems very
redundant I've having an integer array
called nums which is a new integer array
with 100 spots in it but two things are
going on here
this is declaring your intention to have
an array and this is actually creating
the array allocating the space in the
computer's memory to store 100 values so
if I come back over here I can change I
I can change this top code here to say
new int 8 I want eight spots nums length
and let's just clean up how we're
drawing this I'm going to say no fill
and Stroke 255 so we can kind of see and
let's make them a little thicker I know
this is very silly but stroke wait for
so the point of what I wanted to show
you is that now you can see here every
time I run this sketch I'm going to get
a new result every time I'm going to
create an array with eight spots every
time I'm going to fill that array with
eight random numbers and then I'm going
to always look through that array and
draw a circle using each element from
the array so here we go run it again
just to see
look at those differently sized circles
run it again look at those differently
sized circles so for you you know I
might think of a couple exercises here
to try number one is what if your array
instead of having numbers in it maybe
maybe you know about strings maybe you
don't but what if you made an array with
strings in it hello my friend
right this is an array with three
strings three sequences of characters so
could you display every time you run the
sketch a random one of those strings in
the center of the canvas window or could
you do something as you click the mouse
you see one message one at a time how
would you do that so those are two
interesting exercises to try this
particular scenario that I've made here
I'm looping through the entire array
each time but what if you just want to
use one number one at a time or one
string one at a time that's enough
that's one thing you look at the other
thing that I think is crucial to mention
is that one reason to learn this is that
the all the stuff in the window that
you're seeing here is an array of pixels
an array of colors so underneath the
hood of a processing sketch of an image
that you might load or an image you
might get from a camera all the colors
of that image are stored in one giant
array and you can loop through that
entire array to read all those colors
and manipulate
colors so I'll also include a link below
to online tutorial and some other videos
about images and pixels that you could
look at that this will give you kind of
the foundation for okay so hopefully
this video was helpful and you saw a
little bit of processing 3 and some nice
circles and a strangely colored shirt
that doesn't really blend in with the
background yes see look you can see the
background nobody cares about that but
it's interesting to me and I'm gonna say
goodbye now before that camera shuts off
goodbye ok the live stream might still
be going I don't know if anybody is
watching or has any questions I'm gonna
pull that up am I still here I am
10:52 if you have any questions 10
people are watching that's interesting
if you have any questions let me know
right now I've got about 10 more minutes
before I've off to class with human
beings supposed to this thing that I do
with lights and cameras and sunlight
outside there's a window there so I can
see that the world is there not just
this cave of talking about code and
processing any questions I will how far
behind how far how far at lag is this
dream I'm gonna do this so I'll see how
long that takes to get to me hitting my
head 1 2 to do it would be nice if I
could get there lag I wonder actually
here under stream options if I had clue
yeah low latency I have that selected
maybe I should play an ad while I'm
waiting that's what I'll do play ad
watch this everybody
oh you can't see that okay I'm gonna
click this play ad button and I will
probably make 3 cents but I'm curious
about it okay and while your while while
the ad is playing you can ask questions
keep on it's telling me based on some
complex criteria some of your viewers
will see an ad are you one of those
viewers keep on streaming I'm waiting to
see if anybody has any questions
otherwise I'm gonna just head out of
here let me make sure that recorded I'll
come over here I'm just checking while
I'm waiting yeah looks like it did and
there's a video there you can see great
okay thank you that's nice night thank
you nice feedback so I'm gonna do a much
I'm gonna do let me just close this I'm
gonna do a much longer stream I can't
see myself anymore over here I'm gonna
do a much longer stream on Thursday and
possibly Friday I've got a long list of
videos I'm getting to about Donnell
manipulation in JavaScript and data and
API is also really would like to do a
whole bunch more videos that use
processing especially I did make a video
about the new features of processing 3
but there's some topics that I've never
gotten a chance to look at in a video so
hopefully I'll get to that as well
I'm gonna do one last check to the chat
see if anybody has any questions then
I'm gonna turn off the stream great okay
I don't see any questions here thanks
for watching all all of you and this
will happen again soon talk to you later
you can ask just questions in the
comments so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
