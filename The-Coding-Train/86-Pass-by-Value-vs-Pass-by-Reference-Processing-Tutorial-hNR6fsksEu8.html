today it occurred to me while I was
making that video about looking at how
objects might communicate with each
other that there's a kind of a key
principle going on in how variables are
passed in as arguments to other
functions that has been missed
throughout all of these videos so I
don't think I'm going to have an example
for this I'm just going to kind of diet
talk you through this and diagram it and
we'll see what's missing and what needs
to be added and what's confusing but so
I'm going to make up kind of a silly
function almost a function that has no
point I'm going to call it change and
it's going to receive a single number as
an argument and inside this function I'm
going to say that value equals value
times two okay so this function receives
a number and and multiplies that number
by two and stores it back in itself so
if I say int X can you see that now you
can we write a little lower int x equals
50 and then I say change X and then I
say print line X what is the result of
this print line going to be so let's
think about it X has the value 50 change
X means X goes into Val so Val now is
the value 50 then Val equals itself
times 2 so Val now has the value of 100
but when I print X am I going to see 100
or 50 think about that you know as the
designer of the programming language
it's up to you to decide what it should
be the java programming language on
which processing is built on top of what
we're going to see is the number 50 why
is that this is known as pass by copy
when you pass a primitive value a number
integer float etc into a function you
pass a copy of that value meaning in the
computer's memory X is referencing us
place in the computer's memory with the
value
50 then val is referencing another place
in the computer's memory with what the
value 50 gets copied in there then over
here
val gets multiplied by 2 val now equals
100 but x which is pointing to 50 is
unaffected pass by copy the reason why I
have bringing this up and the rewrite is
is so is important this is so important
is if you pass an object into a function
it does not work this way it works with
something called pass by reference so
let's pretend there's a made-up particle
object and that particle object just has
an x and a y so I'm going to say a
particle P equals new particle you know
50 comma 100 and then I'm going to say
change P and there's a function called
void change which receives a particle
object call it a block it just need a
different variable names terrible I hate
that I just made up a variable name blah
let's think of something
particle I'm going to call it sum P a P
a particle a P now if I say ap dot x
equals 300 what's happening okay so this
is my equivalent of int x equals 50
change X now I'm saying particle P
equals new particle change P this change
function that's just instead of
multiplying it by 2 I'm just setting it
to the value 300 and remember X was 50
and then we made a new variable Val was
100 so here I have a particle P and it
is pointed to somewhere in the
computer's memory
we're both 50 and 100 is stored now here
I make a new particle ap sum P at Tempe
whatever I do not make a new object when
you pass an object into a function
you're passing the reference the at the
location of the the data in memory not a
copy
that data so AP is actually pointing
over here and if I change the aspects
parameters data of that object like X
becomes 300 I'm changing the original
variable as well pass by reference so in
Java when you pass a primitive value
into a function as an argument you make
a copy of it and the original variable
is unaffected when you pass an object
into a function the original you're
passing just a reference and if you
change that object in the function it is
also changed as well let me let me show
you an actual scenario where this
matters so if we come back to this right
what if my this is this example where
I'm just changing the background color
so I'm going to save this as a version 2
and I'm just going to make a function
called p1 overlaps p2 and it's not going
to return true or false anymore ok and
in that function it's just void I can
I'm going to do something if they
overlap and what am I going to do I'm
going to give the the particle of color
and that color is going to be black to
start and I'm going to say fill that
color and when it overlaps I'm going to
say other dot color equals red otherwise
other color equals black so I know I'm
doing this kind of quickly you may or
may not be following along but let me
show you why this is so important notice
when they overlap this particle changes
its color I'm passing p2 into the
function a copy is not made I'm passing
the at a reference to the actual object
and p2 the reference to that object goes
into other and now I'm changing values
of other if I'm changing values of other
that means I'm actually changing values
of P 2 and P 2 is now going to be red
incidentally I could say
also this objects color is green and let
me give these each a little alpha so if
we look at this you can see now they're
both black one turns green one turns red
one turns green one turns red they're
having a note about this is it seemed
like in the original version of this
program
p1 overlaps p2 was equivalent to p2
overlaps p1 but now if I were to change
that
since I'm giving them the p2 is now
turning green and the other one is
turning red so there's a lot of
goofiness going on here in this sort of
like four stand fake example but I think
this is important to realize that if
you're passing this object into a
function you can actually change that
object in the function itself okay so I
don't know if this makes things better
or worse if you had just said that in
the last video but I'm kind of like
today I just have this day where I'm
wrapping up all these videos are trying
to make extra little pieces of content
so this one's like 7 minutes long which
isn't so bad ok see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
