coding challenge this time what I'm
going to do is the exact thing I just
did in the previous video where I did a
word counting application in JavaScript
and we do the same exact thing in
processing this will be written in the
Java programming language
now I explained a bunch of details in
the previous video and we kind of gloss
over those just to see kind of work
through this rather quickly but I'm
gonna use the same text file and the
same exact algorithm so let's get
started so processing actually if you're
not aware has this lovely object built
into it called an int dictionary int D
ICT so I'm gonna call that counts and I
can say counts equals a new int
dictionary and what this now does is it
it's it's able I what I'm able to do
with this is store right in there
strings with numbers there's also a
float dictionary if I want strings with
floating-point numbers and a string
dictionary if I want to pair of strings
with strings if I want to do any other
kind of sophisticated pairing in job in
processing I need to use something
called a hash map which is that sort of
native Java class for doing hash tables
dictionaries that sort of thing and I
can demonstrate that in a future video
if people are interested but the integer
is going to make this really quick and
easy so first thing I want to do is load
in the text file so I already have that
rainbow txt the text from the rainbow a
Wikipedia article loaded into a text
file in the data folder
remember load strings just like in p5
loads that text file and separates it
into lines so the first thing that I
want to do then is say join that so I
can say join lines with a line break so
now I have all the separate lines joined
in one big text why because ultimately
what I want to do now is have a big
array of all the tokens the words so I'm
gonna say now I'm going to say split
split tokens and actually I can use the
native Java split function but split
tokens is in processing it'll be kind of
easy for me to use it I want to split
all words by anything I put in here it
now acts as a delimiter so I'm just
gonna say period question mark
exclamation dollar sign whatever period
question mark exclamation again I can
always refine what the delimiters are
and there are ways of being fancier with
that using the Java split function I can
improve that later but I just want to
see print array tokens I just want to
see that this is working so let me print
out that array into the console there it
is oh that didn't work
ah guess what I forgot space space would
be good and line break that would be
good too
let's try that again there we go so this
looks like it's working we can see I
have all of these tokens a comma I
should probably include let's get a
comma in there semicolon that's a little
bit better let's see okay great so
there's gonna be straight junk in there
and I could always filter out that junk
but I've got a big array of every single
word in this array so now the next thing
I want to do just as I did before
it is loop through that loop through all
of the tokens and I want the same exact
algorithm so I want to say if the
dictionary so before I said if the word
value in the dictionary is undefined
that's why I did that in JavaScript here
I want to use the interdiction airy
function and let's actually just look at
int dictionary of the reference page so
we can see here here's the reference
page for a dictionary and there's a
bunch of functions that I'm that I want
to use for and the function I'm looking
for right now is has key so has key
checks if a key already exists in the
dictionary so that's the function I want
to use come back over to my processing
program
if counts has key and let's make a
variable here string word equals tokens
index I has that word already as a key
right if it if it exists what do I want
to do I want to add one to its count
and by the way processing knowing that
this is an int dictionary has functions
that will just do stuff to the numbers
in there so I can actually say can
actually I need to add the key sorry
Council
so the first thing I need to do is add
no ads to a value so this manipulates
the numbers I could just use set so I
want to just set that word to count
stats set that word to the value 1
perfect
oh no that's if it was a new one so if
it's a new one I want to set it to 1
right if it doesn't exist if it does
exist what do I want to do I want to say
counts dot increment that word so the
increment function reaches in to the
value and adds one to it so this now is
the same exact algorithm in that
dictionary either set a new word to 1 or
increment that word increment that the
value the count of that word by 1 so
let's just see I'm not sure what will
happen if I say print line counts but
let's see how it decides to format it in
the console we're gonna have some sort
of error what's going on here let's look
in the errors tab no errors ah it just
who knows so we can see this looks good
ooh a quote is definitely needs to be a
delimiter there's so many things in
quotes I think so let me add quotes as a
delimiter which I need to escape with a
backslash
why do I see all these extra quotes in
there maybe that's just the way it's
spitting it out Oh another thing I
should do is do the same thing to change
everything to lowercase now we can see
okay well I'm assuming that this is
working because I'm seeing like a whole
lot of things with the number 1 so I'm
getting all these words and their counts
so now what I want to do is let's draw
something to the the window so I want to
iterate through the entire list so how
do i iterate over into dictionary and
processing well one thing I can do is I
can just get a copy of the keys because
if I can get those keys in an array just
like I did in JavaScript that I can
iterate over it I could have my own
array but here I know that in dictionary
what it's doing so I'm going to ask for
the array so I could say here a string
keys equals counts
ray and then and by the way I can use
this sort of enhanced loop I can say for
every key in keys I could say let's pick
random X let's pick a random Y and let's
let's draw the text to the window oh I
shouldn't use key because key is a
built-in variable in processing that
indicates the key that was pressed so
I'm going to draw the text at a random
location so let's just see what happens
if I do this and I'm gonna say and I
already used the variable word so that's
a bad idea
WD I don't know okay k4 key I don't like
one letter variables but I just did it
anyway and we can see here after a while
this is gonna run I think oh oh this is
terrible that's in the loop in the so
because I have this big font and I've
been bringing stuff for the console I
wasn't paying attention this is actually
I'm doing this in the loop of looking at
all the tokens which is pretty much a
disaster this 100% needs and by the way
if you're ever doing an application like
this you should start with a really
really small text file that would be
much better than what I'm doing and you
can say okay that worked so you can see
that it drew all sorts of words
everywhere so let's do a couple things
one let's draw a black background let's
actually make this fullscreen so we can
kind of quickly see fullscreen there we
go those are all the words all the
unique words that are in that document
and now what I can do actually is I
could say hmm let's get let's get the
count from the counts get from the key
right let's get that count and let's say
text size count so I'm going to assign
it the font size to how many times it
appeared there we go
so we can see very
most of the things are just like a font
size of one but you can see rainbows
there a is there the and there's there
and sort of random locations so I could
be more thoughtful about how I'm
positioning these placing these I could
use a different mapping I could use some
other kind of like scale but you can see
the basic idea now have a word counting
application that shows me all the words
that appear with their size according to
the frequency that they appear in that
document in processing okay thanks very
much and see you in the next video where
I'm going to look at something called
tf-idf
