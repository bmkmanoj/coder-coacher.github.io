regular expressions I'm actually pretty
excited about regular expressions and
I'm especially excited about this video
because now I think we after this women
have all the tools that I need to match
all of those phone numbers so let's look
at the next piece here I've talked about
position metacharacters single character
meta characters quantifiers and now I
want to talk about character classes so
character classes a character class is
stuff that appears in between square
brackets and this is one way I'm gonna
talk about two things in this video I
don't know if this is the right term but
I'm going to talk about character
classes and alternation so alternation
these are two different ways of saying
of having an or like operation meaning
if I say this a b c match an A or a B or
a C ok that's a character class match
right this also matches a - or a period
now one thing that's important to
realize and there's so much funny
business and little things to remember
and look up but mostly going to have to
look up this stuff or mess around to get
it wrong a lot
but remember dot is a meta character dot
is a meta character that means any
character so why doesn't this match a -
or any character well it turns out that
dot inside of a character class is no
longer that meta character instead it
the literal dot and I should also
mention I really should have done this
in the last video I just realized I just
forgot that if I want to match a literal
dot not in that's not in a character
class like if I want to match email
addresses so I want to match anything
that's like dot oh this is going to be
perfect for this like so this is a
scenario that I want to do what if I
want to match anything dotnet or.com
or.org now obviously there can be more
than just that for email addresses but
this is a good start
so alternation is going to be a way to
allow us to say or net or calm or org
but how do I match the actual dot
backslash
dot means literal done so if you have a
meta character like for example a
bracket is now a meta character so but
if I want to match a literal bracket I
have to say backslash bracket so it's a
way of escaping it
so I'm going to come back to the email
address we'll get to that in a minute
but so these are character classes match
any one of these characters let's look
at a little bit about how this works let
me come back over here let me open up
atom again
and let me try to like make some
character classes so what I want to
match is let's think about the I'm going
to make up something I'm going to match
L Y or i NK so what is this going to
match L followed by the character class
why I followed by NK and I'm going to
type some stuff here the link is quite a
link don't you think so you can see what
did that do it matches both ly n K and L
I and K on the way that we have this
character class so I could say or a
space or a parenthesis you know all this
stuff would work I don't know why I
would want to do this but I could say L
Space NK l k l parenthesis NK I don't
know why that didn't work Oh L I don't
know what I got wrong oh other others
other way parenthesis right so I could
use a character class to match any
possible any one of these characters
okay so let's go back to the phone
number for a second look now remember
what I had before I had three digits
followed by a dash followed by three
digits right look what that's matching
nine one seven dash five five five now
what if I down here change that you
followed by either a dash or a dot dash
or a dot look at this now I've matched
it let me put this back to make these
phone numbers you can see now I've
matched both of these phone numbers
except weirdly I'm getting something
weird here so let's we got to be a
little bit better about this let's match
now followed by a dash or a dot followed
by four four digits now look what I've
got I've got this phone number in this
phone number now I know you can't see
the regular expression let me let me
just show this to you again three digits
followed by a dash or a dot followed by
three digits followed by a dash or dot
followed by four digits we're now we're
talking now cooking I can match any
possible phone number where it's of this
form in this article but look at this
ah there's also these parentheses how do
I deal with that okay well optionally I
could start with an open parenthesis so
let me do this optionally now look at
this invalid regular session why so a
parenthesis we're going to see in a
moment as part of this thing called
alternation so I need to say I want to
match optionally a literal parenthesis
and then after the phone number instead
of the dash or the dot the first one it
could also be a closed parenthesis but
inside the character class I don't need
to escape the parenthesis oh boy
but look at this now I've matched all
three of them so you might have had to
have to pause through this video copy
that down and you really should just you
should make up a song or talk yourself
thoroughly through there slowly through
a regular expression and I'm going to do
it for you
we're going to like have a moment here
where we're going to read this regular
expression I would like to match a
literal open parenthesis optionally
followed by three digits followed by a
dash or a period or a closed parenthesis
followed by three digits followed by a
dash or a period followed by four digits
so this is the kind of thing you need to
try to translate in one way also
creating regular expressions is to
iterate so I could have written this in
a more long-winded way and then
shortened it and shortened it and
shortened it kind of overtime and maybe
we'll see that process as I do more and
more examples okay
so we're moving through this I think
I've kind of covered now for you what a
character class is oh and I should ah I
missed something really important this -
is that a that okay so special
characters inside of a character class
are - and karent let's look at how those
work so even though this -
in this particular scenario is matching
a literal - it can work a different way
so let me show you what I mean by that I
want to match I'm going to try to get
closer here I want to match any - now
notice in the character any - or period
so you can see I'm matching any - or a
period but I'm going to show you
something else I want to match a - Z if
the dash is not the first character it
does not mean a literal - instead it
means any character A through Z so look
at this I'm matching any any character A
through C right I'm matching an A or a B
or a C I can also say or any character 0
through 5 so now I am matching right I
could say I want to match only phone
numbers that have the number 0 through 5
sequences of 3 numbers only with the
numbers 0 through 5 so notice how I've
matched 2 1 2 and 5 5 5 but I did not
match 6 4 6
6 4 6 has a 6 in it which is not a
character 0 through 5 let me show you
something crazy remember how I said so -
is a special character inside a
character class carrot is also a special
character let me come back over here and
I want to show you what happens if I put
carrot here what did I now match
anything that's not a 0 through 5 which
is actually kind of insane because I my
mind you can easily forget these things
I thought I was going to get sequences
of numbers that aren't 0 through 5 but
this just means anything except 0
through 5 so this means like any
character except a B or C right I'm
matching including spaces including
numbers including periods including
punctuation so you can negate the
character class if the caret symbol is
the first symbol if the caret symbol is
in the big in the middle it's just a or
carrot or B or C it's literal and Adam
is helping us along by color coding when
something's a meta character and not
color coding when it's not a meta
character okay so I think I'm kind of
all the way through the character class
thing
I did realize though that something is
going on here which is that I want to
match let me just show this you right I
want to match any character a through Z
look at this notice that this match
capital T even though I'm lowercase a
dash D now usually the default is going
to be the other way around but and here
the context is I'm using atom so in this
case over here I can make this regular
expression case-sensitive by clicking
this match case and now you'll see that
I'm not matching any capital letters but
if I want to match only capital letters
I could say a - Z so this by the way is
now a regular expression here we go to
match any four letter words only with
characters in them so not and I'm right
only with characters with them so this
will not match oops
l 3 NK but if I change this instead of 8
to - W it'll match so - W includes
numbers and characters if I only want
characters I need to include I need to
write a character class like all capital
A through Z all lowercase a through Z
now here's what I could do let's be
better about this let's say I want to
match a single capital letter followed
by one or more lowercase letters so you
can see now I've matched only
capitalized words and I didn't match
actually though if a something is the
right I didn't match a but I could make
instead of followed by one or more
lowercase letters I could put a star
there 0 more and now I matched a so you
can see if you want to look oh there's a
something going on here so by the way
this was considered a word boundary
right in here so we'd have to change our
regular expression a little bit if we
didn't want to allow something followed
by an apostrophe okay alright so we're
moving along here there's a little bit
more that I want to cover in this video
which is something called alternation so
character class is a way of kind of
stringing an or a or B or C or anything
not a or B or C but there's another way
to have an or and you need parentheses
for that and you need a pipe symbol so
remember when I was saying I want to try
to match emails so I could say net or
comm so this is not saying N or E or T
this is saying n et or Co M so this pipe
Simone this looks a lot more like
programming I I think this might be
referred to as alternation having a
memory of reading the word alternation
and Geoffrey Friedel's math during
regular expressions book which I highly
recommend net or comm so let's look and
see how this works I'm going to come
back over here I'm going to write a
bunch of emails Daniel at Schiffman net
or Daniel dot Schiffman at gmail.com
here's all my email and why u dot edu
there now I'm going to get a lot of
emails from people I guess so let's try
to match any of these email addresses
okay I should have written fake email
address here I'll just spell my name
wrong yeah whatever it's fine so let's
think about this what I want to match is
any word characters one or more of sorry
I'm not in this I'm blocking one or more
word characters followed by what an @
symbol followed by one or more word
characters followed by a literal dot not
any character followed by a literal dot
backslash dot
followed by net or calm or edu and look
oh look at this I forgot that an email
address can have a dot in it as well so
look what it matched hmm so let's try to
fix that so in the in here I guess I can
say any number of word characters or a
dot well let me do that yes so I can put
the that meta character in the so you
can see now I've matched any email
address if I took out this edu you can
see that now I could have just done
something like you
no anyway we can make this more generic
but you can see how this works right so
this is um you can see how these these
regulus rushes in by the way here's you
know regular expressions one way you
could use them is like form validation
oh you didn't type in a valid email
hopefully after you watch these videos
you're going to come up with some more
creative and experimental uses of
regular expressions but that's one place
that they are used certainly in code and
that sort of thing okay so um I think
that brings me to the end here some the
side effect that we're gonna that you're
going to see in the next video is that
when use parentheses you also get this
thing that happened that is called
capturing groups and then you can do all
sorts of interesting things with fine
and replace and something called a back
reference and that stuff that I'm going
to show you in the next video ok so
thanks for watching this one and
although all there is is more regular
expressions to come</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
