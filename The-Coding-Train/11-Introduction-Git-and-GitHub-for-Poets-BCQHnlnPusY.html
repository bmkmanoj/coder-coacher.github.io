poets this is a tutorial series that I
am beginning today and the whole point
of this tutorial series is to explain
what is get what is github how do you
use them and let me say something really
important from the out right you don't
need to know anything about programming
or code whatsoever to follow this
tutorial get and github our tools
generally used by software developers
creative coders and eventually as I get
through more and more and more and more
videos about getting github will start
getting and looking at code repositories
but right now it doesn't matter what I
want to do is put a poem on github and I
want to see what happens when you take a
poem on github and why is that powerful
and why would that be something exciting
to learn about and I hope that people
will watch this who want to use git and
github for creative ways that might not
even necessarily for collaboration and
creativity that might not necessarily
have anything to do with programming so
we're going to start from total scratch
so first of all why do these things
exist so I'm going to come over here to
my computer screen and I've been working
very hard on a poem about rainbows it's
a terrible poem I don't know if I can
show you it's I don't want to show it to
you but has this ever happened to you
did you write a poem and then you made
some revisions and saved another file
underscore one and then you save another
file underscore two and then you called
it final but anyone to revise it again
so you called final revised but think
was like really the final you see the
point it often what happens is you're
working on something a piece of a poem
an essay an image a design a piece of
code and you have versions of those over
time and you want to save a previous one
the history of what you're making is
important this is primarily the first
thing about what get is that is why get
exists for something called version
control so rather than you the creator
having to keep track of separate files
in history yourself manually get is a
piece of software that does that for you
it keeps track of the entire history of
things that you're working on on the
computer but it's not just for you so
this is very powerful on its own but
there's something more to what git has a
lot of features that get halves and what
I would say the other thing that's
really key
why I'm putting quotes here but
collaboration you know to be to be
honest you can do a lot of what we're
talking about with things like Dropbox
or Google Docs or all sorts of other
tools that allow you to keep track of
the history of a file or even have
multiple people work on the same file
but git is a particularly special tool
which has a lot of advanced and
sophisticated features for collaboration
in particular it doesn't have a problem
with two people working on the same
document at the same time there's lots
of ways of managing that which I'll get
into as I get further and further along
but this is what I want you to think
about this is a system that you can use
to keep track of the history of a
project as well as allow many people to
collaborate on the project together okay
so that's the first point I want to make
which hopefully is good now let's move
on here for a second and I need to make
a really important distinction
what is git and what is github okay
let's write get over here and let's
write github over here this tutorial is
going to live somewhere in the middle
eventually I'm going to kind of start
with just only showing you github and
eventually later I'm going to only show
you how to do stuff only with git but
right now I want to live in a strange
place that's in the center why
git is the actual version control
software this is the actual application
it was invented by you know that guy who
invented Linux his name and a link to it
will be somewhere in the description it
has another story about why it has a
name you can look that up on why it's
called git you can look that up on
Wikipedia but git is just version
control software there are countless
examples historically of other version
control software this is a particularly
popular one you can run this on your
laptop you can run this on anywhere you
want github
I'll say I'm going to call it a website
or a web service github is ass web
service where you can sign up and have
it
out and do stuff do get things on a
server on a website so you could github
kind of runs the get software behind the
scenes and some people call it like
social coding in a way it's like a
social network for projects that are
managed through git so what I want to do
is show you how do you the reason why
we're living in the middle here is I
want to show you how to use github to do
all the things that get does but it
should be it should be really important
to realize that these are two completely
different things
git itself is the application you don't
you could you could be you could spend
your life being a git person and never
ever go to the github website
interestingly you can also spend all of
your time on the github website and
never actually run get anywhere else but
I want to live here in the middle I want
you to start by using git and learning
to get concepts through the github
interface and later see how those
concepts translate locally to your own
computer I said that way too many times
but I'm trying to set the stage for
myself you can skip ahead to future
videos if you've been rambling too much
okay so let's now actually go and get
started so here we are we are writing a
poem about rainbows and we this has
become a disaster so we're going to go
over to the github website now the one
thing that I've done that I'm not doing
in this video tutorial is I already
signed up for a github account a
brand-new github account my user name is
rainbow coder you just need a username
and an email you can upload an image
that sort of thing so pause this video
now and go sign up for an account or
just keep watching whatever you want to
do if you haven't done that you want to
try to do this along now the first thing
that I want to do and I'm going to keep
track of kind of a list of terms over
here the first term that's important
this is different pen let's try using it
is a repository affectionately by me are
also known as a repo so a github
repository a github repository is a what
another word for like a project it can
have multiple files associated with it
it it's it's a repository of file
so I want to make the first thing I want
to do is just make a new repository for
my poem new repository and I'm going to
call it rainbow
poem so I'm calling it rainbow poem and
this is and notice by the way it's going
to named it for me automatically with a
- because get git repositories can't
have spaces in their names and this is a
repo for my poem and I want this to be
public and I also want to check this box
right now initialize this repository
with a readme a readme is a special kind
of file that goes in your repository
that says this repository is a
repository for poems about rainbows so
I'm just going to check that because
going to make it a little bit easier for
me to work with it and then I'm going to
hit this green button over here to
create that repository and now you can
see look at this I have my github
repository this you can see is the
readme file it made one by default right
over here so this is it I've now made a
repository place where we can have files
now what kind of file do I want to work
with I'm a writer I'm a poet a really
terrible one of not actually but um so
I'm going to what I want to do is create
a new file so I want to put a new file
in my repository this is the file that
I'm going to work on I can have many
files but I'm going to start with just
one so I'm going to create new file and
I'm going to name my file a poem txt
there are lots of different file formats
that github and get github can keep
track up for you anything but I'm going
to work with just a plain raw text file
so I'm going to scroll down and now look
at this so this is where I name the
photo I'm gonna write my poem the oops
I'm going to write my poem down here the
rainbow purple pink orange blue red
these are the the colors of the rainbow
that's the end of my poem so I wrote my
poem and now I'm going to scroll down
and you might the nominee hit save but
notice here look at this
commit new file so this is another key
term in our list of terms repository is
the repository of stuff commit is now is
like you can think of this as a save so
a commit is I'm going to change the file
and make a commit I'm committed to this
I'm very committed to making this
tutorial now there's all sorts of stuff
about commit directly to the master
branch or create a new branch this is
branching is going to be the topic of my
next video which is going to be exciting
I hope but right now all I want to do is
press commit new file let me press that
I'm going to zoom back out and you can
see now here are the files in my
repository the readme file and the poem
and I'm going to click on poem and we
can see there it is there's my poem
here's the file now let's say I wanted
to make a change to this file I've
decided that it's missing the color
green
so I'm going to I'm going to go over
here to find the oh this little icon
over here is the edit button so I can
use that button to edit this file I'm
going to click edit and now I'm going to
add and you can see I'm doing a terrible
job of managing where this stuff is here
I'm going to add right now the line
green so I added this I'm editing my
poem and then I'm going to scroll down
and look at this now over here under
commit changes this is the button all I
need to do is press that button and I've
made a save however this is each commit
each save can have a note associated
with it which can sometimes be useful
when you're collaborating or even to
keep track of things yourself so I'm
going to say I am adding the color green
and then I'm going to just hit commit
again and I'm also going to do this
again really quickly and I'm going to
green yeah I'm going to add yellow and
I'm going to say adding the color yellow
and I'm going to commit those changes so
I've made a bunch of commits so we can
now here we can see the current version
of my poem
and what so so what have we done so far
we've made a github repository we put a
single file into it and we made a few
commits on that file so why is getting
github exciting and powerful because now
I can actually go and view the history
so one thing I can do is I can click I'm
looking for somewhere in this in this
interface where I see the but the the
the word history oh right here I don't
know why I couldn't see that over here
there's a button called history and I'm
going to click on that and look at this
this is now my github history the first
thing I did was create poem txt then I
added the color green and then I added
the color yellow and any one of these
that I click on it can actually show me
what was changed at that moment so you
can see the line that was changed as
highlighted plus meeting something was
added and the green color it's funny it
was green there's also a green color
showing you what was added so I can also
go back and look and see when I added
the color yellow this is what happened
here there's all sorts of ways now
something kind of goofy is over here
look at this crazy number so while this
looks like the most nonsensical thing
that you would ever want to look at and
looks sort of terrifying this strange
crazy string of numbers and characters
this is the commit hash meaning a unique
identifier for this particular commit
notice also up here in the browser's URL
rainbow dash poem slash commit slash
that crazy number so you don't ever have
to memorize this you don't ever have to
write it down but this is something that
I want to point out to you because it's
going to come up again and again so I'm
going to come over here and look at
commit hash this is a key concept so
let's review git is version control
github is a website where you can do
projects that have version control on
them you can make a repository where you
add files to that repository then you
can make changes to those files by
making commits and those commits allow
you to browse a history
and each one of those commits has a
unique identifier for it so this really
is the basic idea and what I would say
now is go and make your own github
repository write a poem in it get it
going play around the interface see what
happens and in the next video I'm going
to show you I'm going to talk to you
about branches get branches what is a
branch and why might you use them and
how do they work on github</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
