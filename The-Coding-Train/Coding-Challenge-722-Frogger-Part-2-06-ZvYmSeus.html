what I need so far in part 1 if you
could believe it I don't know it's all I
got so far was a rectangle that I can
move around the screen by pressing the
arrow keys and now what I want to do is
add some cars so I want to add the cars
that are moving across where which I
have to avoid so what I want to do is
first I already have a car tab and
hopefully I'm hoping boy am i hoping
that all the work we did to figure out
this rectangle thing and this frog thing
will pay off when it comes time to
program the car and it's going to be
really simple so let's just first do one
car eventually I'm going to need an
array I'm gonna have multiple cars but
let's just have one car and I'm going to
say car equals new car and I'm going to
put the car at zero it's going to start
at zero and it's going to be its y is
going to be height minus grid times two
and it's size is also just going to be
grid not a car and truck could have a
variable so and I'm going to I'm going
to make it this is having the car start
at the bottom two row two rows up from
the bottom and having its wispy the side
of the grid and its height being to know
I want its width if it's a truck it's
going to be longer so I'm gonna have it
be a little bit wider just to try that
out and its height be just the grid then
I'm going to say a car show and let's
just see if we can see the card now the
car is not showing hmm what if what if I
dare have the car no this is a bad idea
because ultimately some level is
probably going to be drawing the cars in
different ways let's just have the car
extend I could was thinking about having
the car extend frog and I would inherit
the show function but I'm actually just
going to leave that here and I'm going
to make the car like a slightly
different color just for right now and
I'm going to I need to have the same
exact constructor basically except I'm
going to include a height and so this
now is the car so if I run this
we should see okay what happened here ah
whoops with height there we go
what did I get wrong ah whoops just the
way that I'm drawing it there we go that
was just a little bug and now there we
go so there is the truck
there is the truck or the car now what I
need is for the car to have maybe an
update function and the car should also
have its own variable called speed so
let's just set the speed equal to two so
this is one of the wonderful things
about inheritance is I can inherit all
the properties from rectangle and then
add my own so the car is also going to
have a speed and then speed is going to
say x equals x plus updates because say
x equals x plus speed so I'm going to
say car update and now we have the car
moving yeah and I could go past it as it
moves by now when the car goes off I
probably want it to re-enter so what I
prompt in update under say if X is
greater than width then x equals
negative hiked never negative width so I
wanted to start off the screen and
re-enter so what I mean by this is when
the cars X which is its left side gets
past the right side then it should we
emerge on the other side and I might
want to you know maybe have that be more
of a delay or something so I could like
you know maybe if it's you know further
off the screen I could use W I could
actually probably let me just use the
grid size which is probably oh but that
I definitely want to do negative w u- w
minus grid there's just so many ways I
could do this but I just want to have a
little bit of buffer so it's got to go
more than just width and then it
reenters so you can see now I've got
look at this we're moving along now
we've got the car moving so what do I
need I need to have multiple cars okay
so let's just think I could use an array
list which allows me to have a flexible
amount of cars but for simplicity I
think I'm just going to
fixed amount so I'm going to say car
equals cars cars index zero is that new
car and cars index zero show and cars
index zero update I want to make sure
that just works what did I get wrong
I didn't initialize the array cars
equals new car with you know 100 cars so
let's say justice mother's not going to
be let's just let's go look at Frogger
for a second what's a reasonable number
of cars so you can see there's 1 2 3 1 2
3 1 2 3 1 1 2 there's some configuration
but that's 3 6 9 10 11 12 13 13 what a
lovely number let's have oh no no that's
actually 12 but whatever let's just have
10 10 is a nice round number right now
there's only one car okay
now what I need to do is okay so how
many how many rows of cars let's say I
have 10 cars and I have 5 rows that
would give me 2 cars per row I mean this
is sort of all arbitrary making this up
but let's let's think about how many
rows there are so I'm going to say for
int I equals 0 I is less than let's just
say there are going to be 3 rows for
right now I plus plus so I'm going to
say row equals zero row is less than 3
row plus plus I almost kind of want it
maybe I should do this much more
manually let's do this let's configure
this manually let's just say I'm going
to do let's keep track of an index which
is 0 then this is going to be the first
row I'm going to put three cars in the
first row so the three cars there they
need a starting X location x equals I
times 100 plus 50 so what I want to do
is arbitrarily space them out
and let's just say those are there's
only going to be three cars right now
there's only going to be three cars
you'll see where I'm going a second so
I'm going to and you know what I can
actually die forget I can use this
enhanced loop which is like a for each
loop for every car in cars car car show
car update so this is a nice way you
could say well whatever amount of cars
there are show and update all of them
okay so now what I should have here is
three now you can see I didn't do a very
good job of spacing them out
so let's space them out more I times 200
I don't know why I have this plus 50
there I'll just pick that up right so
now we can see there are there's the
bottom row right so I can now that looks
like really hard it's probably too hard
so let's just have two cars in this row
and space them out by 300 pixels and I
just need to match that I only have two
so far there we go so we can see that's
one row yay yay this is working because
distracted by my own game so let's now
new so I'm going to put a comment here
oh and the whole point of this is I
wanted to do index I want to keep track
of the index boy an ArrayList might be
easier here because what I'm going to do
this is Row one I'm doing this and again
this could be optimized I could do this
less manually I'm going to do Row 2
which is now I'm going to I'm going to
also add two cars to road too
so now I have a total of four cars let
me move this down here and for Row two
I'm going to add those cars height minus
grid times three right because I need to
go up another row I want to make these
just square and they are separated by
200 pixels and let's take a look at this
now I probably want to offset that by
some amount so they look in it again
this could be random and there oh
they're moving at the same speed so each
row should also get a different reading
and Radek and the chat is making a
really great point which is I should
make an object which is just like a row
or a car lane object and it can keep
track of its own cars and its position
and speed I'm going to say that's like a
refactoring thing that I'm going to
suggest maybe people do as a exercise
for after it because I'm going to keep
things kind of simple here but that is a
really great suggestion so one thing
that I want to do is give these a speed
so let's say for also I'm going to add a
fourth argument here so this has a speed
of two and this is going to have a speed
of three point five and so now the car
should also get a fourth argument called
speed s the car constructor should get a
fifth argument so I'm going to want to
be initialized so now also these cars
which are all in row 1 have this
particular speed and these cars which
are all in row 2 have a different speed
okay let's run this now and there we go
we can see this looks a bit more like
Frogger let's see well right whether
this is difficult or easy I'm not sure
let's add one more row row three let's
put in four cars they're going to be
their height is going to be one more
spot on the grid up and their speed is
going to be really slow but they are not
spaced out by as much I'm just picking
some random numbers this is Row 3 and
what did I mess up
so I have two plus two plus four is
eight cars total there we go
so now I have again now I have a whole
bunch of cars and that you know again I
could also have them each have an image
associated with them at their own
animation but is this playable that's
question yeah it looks like I made it
but have I actually hooked so we've got
a row of cars I'm going to just keep
three but what I need to do I've got one
more feature I've got to add to this
part which is that I need to check that
intersection thing but guess what I
don't know why I spent the part one of
this video tutorial series on making for
hunger doing the intersection because
just waited now but thank goodness we
did that because I have this function
already so what I want to do is now say
here if car intersects frog or maybe I
want to say frog intersects car it
doesn't matter
frog and car both extend rectangle
rectangle has in itself this convoluted
but it works we don't know that it works
never tested it intersects function so
now I could say if they intersect then
let me do something like we just print
let me just do a print line you know
game over or something so now we should
see look if I look down here in the
console oh so we have a problem here
which is you can see I see the game over
already which is that it's actually
intersecting when they're right on top
lifts when they're right next to each
other and that's because I as because in
my intersects function I'm actually
checking right remember I'm negating
whether they're not overlapping and so
they shouldn't be overlapping if those
edges are equal and so I think if I add
this in here that should fix that
problem oh and it's less than or equal
not equal less than less than or equal
okay all right game is not over okay so
now let's see if I can do this can I get
through them I did it I saw no game over
down here now let's make sure the
intersect function is working game over
beemo ha ha so we have actually what do
I want to do let's let's actually just
have if instead of game over let's let's
just reset let's call a
let's call a function called a reset
game and I'm going to make that function
I'm going to just put it up here at the
top
reset game and what I'm going to do is
and I think I'm just going to just reset
the frogs location and I'm gonna I'm
just going to put this here I'm gonna
make a new frog object and then I'll
just call reset game here so I could be
more thoughtful about this there might
be a lot of other things you know
ultimately I'm not really doing lives or
levels and this isn't really a reset
game but one thing you can notice here
if there are a bunch of things that you
want to reset that happened when the
game starts but then also happen later
when you make when something happens
like the frog in the car collide I can
have a separate function that does all
that call that boat and set up and also
down here so let's see now if I can make
it through not too hard to play actually
let me run it again and mess up yeah so
you can see if I mess up it just puts me
back at the beginning so we've got we've
got the basics of Frogger now part two
done I'm gonna end this part two and in
the second cart I'm going to add the
logs the third part that is I'm going to
add the logs at the top that instead of
avoiding the Frog has to actually jump
on to and and ends up sticking to okay
thanks for who keeping going with me I
guess there will be a third part to this
okay
