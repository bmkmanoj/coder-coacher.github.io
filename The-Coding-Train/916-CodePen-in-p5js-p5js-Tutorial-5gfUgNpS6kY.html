about how to use code pen with p5 yes
now cook pen is a web browser-based code
editor it allows you to type some HTML
stuff in this a box here it allows you
to type some CSS stuff in this box over
there and then in that box on the end
that I can't reach because my arms will
get cut off you could type some
JavaScript stuff so there's a lot to
code pen I'm sure there's a lot of
features I'm actually you might be
watching this as an archive video but
I'm actually doing this as a live stream
and I'm using something called code pen
Professor mode and there are 27 people
watching me live code this right now at
this very moment but what I want to do
is just make a quick p5 just sketch and
see how it works with code pen and some
of the features of coq10 that I might
discover along the way because I
actually haven't really used code bed
before this is my I'm discovering this
as I make this tutorial okay so first
thing we want to do is let's look under
settings here and I want to go under
JavaScript so one thing that I want to
do is I want to make available the p5.js
JavaScript libraries now I could add
references those to those in the HTML
file
but since code pen has this feature I
can actually just add a URL to my
JavaScript library right here and now
how do I find the p5.js JavaScript
library it just so happens that if I
Google CDN CDN by the way stands for
content delivery network because it's
going to deliver it's a network that
will deliver our content the content in
this case being the p5.js library and
i'm gonna do this CDN p5.js and we're
gonna come to this URL which is CD
nj.com slash libraries flash p5.js and
now i'm gonna see a whole bunch of urls
now one that i want right here for the
main p5.js library is this one so I'm
gonna grab that I'm gonna copy it and
I'm going to go back to code pad whoops
code pen and I'm gonna place it in here
and then I'm gonna add another while I'm
here I might as well add let's add the
Dom library as well so I'm gonna get the
Dom library I'm gonna put that in here
and then hopefully I'm gonna save and
close and now if I go back to settings
we should see that these files are
referenced and incidentally popular
JavaScript libraries that you might
use are available directly right here so
if I wanted to use jQuery for whatever
reason I could just kind of go into this
menu here okay yay
pimple on my nose and I just whacked it
it hurts I don't know if you zoom into
the pixels this is gonna be permanently
in this video forever now but you could
zoom in and try to find it it's very uh
oops quite notable okay close maybe I'll
edit that out I won't edit that out it's
- its - it's just there okay so now
let's just see so one thing I'm gonna do
is I don't really care about CSS or HTML
right now I mean I care about them
CSS and HTML I care about you but right
now they're not the primary focus I just
want to see if things are working I'm
gonna add function set up I'm going to
say create canvas 200 200 I'm gonna say
background 0 and I'm gonna hit save and
look at that there p5 just sketch
running in code pen I don't know what
else should we do in this tutorial I
didn't come up with something to make
let's just make sure things animate I'm
gonna add function draw and I'm going to
say ellipse Mouse X Mouse Y 16 comma 16
I'm gonna hit save I hit command asked
by the way to save and you can see now
there is my sketch running I could also
add something like create P which is
part of p5 DOM and I could say this is a
sketch this is a painting sketch and I'm
hit command s again and you can see now
there I have a paragraph element there
we could add something like let's see a
print line test actually let's let's
let's let's add the mouse pressed
function so I'm ready the chat is
mentioning the creepy sounds like
something else I guess that's true print
line Mouse X so I want to look at the
console there's a console here and I can
click and every time I click you'll see
my oh this is very hard for you to see
so let's zoom in on this you can see
that I also have access to a console
right here in code pens lovely to use I
could and I'm enjoying it quite well
look there's a chat here look people are
talking in the chat because they're
watching this live and I am also going
to say change the
and I can now do a look at this so you
can see one of the nice things is there
are different views here so if I want to
go to a presentation or a full page I
can actually I could click on that or I
could also just go up to the URL and
type full here and now you can see
there's my sketch so this is actually
how you make a p5 sketch in code pen was
really quite easy and I I wish I had
prepared to do some other stuff in this
video I'm gonna just pause it maybe this
video will continue in a second where I
do some more stuff I'm back and I've
decided that it's okay to have a very
short just like five minute video that
showed you very quickly how to use p5
yes in a code pen so if I'm gonna do
this in future videos if you have
questions about it or features you want
me to explore please let me know in the
comments or at the Rainbow topics github
repository that is also linked to in the
description of this video
