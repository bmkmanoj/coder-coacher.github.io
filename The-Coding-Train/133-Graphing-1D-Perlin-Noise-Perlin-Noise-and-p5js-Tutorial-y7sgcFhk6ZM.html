Perlin noise I've got so far I've got
the basics of Perlin noise and what this
particular sketch is doing is just tying
the exposition of a circle to Perlin
noise values over time what I want to do
in this video is show you two things one
is I want to add the y-axis just to sort
of see what happens if I do that and
then also show you how to actually graph
those values over time as opposed to
just seeing sort of a single value over
time which may be useful I think so
let's do that briefly okay so what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna add and now what's
really confusing here is that I kind of
was about to type Y off equals zero and
that's not really a good idea because in
the next video I'm actually gonna look
at two dimensional perla noise what does
it mean for perla noise to exist in two
dimensional space and in that say it
since I'm really gonna have an X offset
and a Y offset I don't really have a y
offset really what I have is I have a Y
value where I want the ellipse to be so
I could do this right and then put Y
here right I'm just gonna add a Y value
which is also mapped to noise and I
could you know have that be matched
between zero and height and then draw
the ellipse at x and y so let's see what
happens there but you can see it's just
moving now along the diagonal why is
that because the x and y values are
always equal because I am asking for I
think we're gonna need a visual
reference here so I'm gonna really
attempt to get a nice right this is the
graph of Perlin noise if I'm say hey
draw a circle add an XY position and
have the x value be tied to this part of
noise and have the Y value be tied to
this part of noise I'm gonna X&amp;amp;Y are
going to be equal meaning in the canvas
if x and y are equal it's somewhere
along this diagonal so what I want to do
is I want to have x and y both be Perlin
noise values but not be equal so I could
have an entirely other Perlin noise
space one dimensional space and get the
Y values from that another thing I could
do is I could just say hey
let me just get the y-values from some
other part like I'll get the X values
from here and I'll get the Y values from
over there so in that sense what I need
are two X offsets like I want an X
offset one that starts at zero and an x
offset to that starts somewhere else
like really far away how about ten
thousand and so I want the x value from
the from one offset the Y value from
another offset and both of these they
move through Perlin noise space you know
eventually X off one is gonna get all
the way to ten thousand and you're going
to see repeating values but it's gonna
take so much time and what X offset two
will be somewhere else you'll never
notice that so let's look at this and
now you can see I have this kind of
pearl is almost like wandering sporadic
bee buzzing like behavior kind of nice
actually I got to move the mouse out of
the way so I know this is actually I
think I kind of I think this is a good
moment to uh I don't I don't I don't
have this prepared right this is a
visual representation of fertile and
noise okay okay anyway so this is the
idea I forgot what I was doing so I was
just so excited that I had a moment to
do something weird um anyway so you get
the idea now let's think about you know
it's kind of intro there's so much I
don't want to keep going with this like
what if I put the Y values a little bit
behind you know but anyway this this
this gives you the basic idea now let's
do one more thing in this particular
video and yes so I met Chad a question
is asked and the question might be man
can't you give two-dimensional arguments
to noise and I could do that and I'm
going to do that in a moment and in fact
that's how I'm really gonna deal with a
two-dimensional space but I'm showing
you a kind of a way of getting multiple
kind of single values for two different
parameters using two different parts of
the noise space I know that's confusing
but it will all become clear or if it
doesn't become clear then all I have to
say to you is
nothing is going well alright um okay oh
it's very hot in here okay so anyway
okay I'm just gonna graph the values now
cuz I don't know what I should be edited
out of this particular all right let's
graph the values because I think that's
gonna be useful okay so what I want to
do is I'm going to comment some of this
stuff out and I am going to right now a
little for loop so what I want to do is
I'm gonna say var X C and I'm gonna bar
X equals 0 X is less than with X plus
plus and I want to draw a I'm just gonna
draw a point at X comma 200 and I'm
gonna say stroke 255 so I'm gonna go
back to the sketch and we see there's
this line going across the middle why is
there a line going across the middle
because I have a loop for every single
x-value draw a point there all the
points are next to each other it looks
like a line so now what I want is I want
this Y value to not be Perlin noise I'll
be sure I want it to be fairly often the
sheet the 90-degree in New York City
heat so I'm just the first I'm gonna say
random height now look at this now I
just got a whole lot of random crazy
points Emperor so first of all I want to
like stop this animating for a second so
there's one way I can stop it from
animating it which I could say no loop
so now I have a bunch of totally random
points and what I actually want to do
here is I want to connect them so I'm
gonna say begin shape no stroke
oh no no stroke 255 and no fill and then
I'm going to say n shape and I'm gonna
draw instead if I'm gonna say vertex
right if I was doing so if I instead
with single points if I say begin a
shape and a shape with a bunch of
vertices it's gonna connect them all so
now I'm gonna refresh this and you can
see this is this is what I was trying to
draw for you on the board before this is
now essentially a graph of random values
a random value for each point X along
the x axis and by the way if I allow it
to animate again this is what you get a
lot of totally random values new random
values every frame but imma put that in
now what I want to do now is change
those to Perlin noise value so really
what's going on here is the Y value is a
random value so instead of Y being
random what I want now is to say y
equals the result of the noise function
so first let me just plug in one point
of time like noise zero and we can see
okay first of all where are all the
values we'll remember I get a value
between zero and one so one thing I
certainly need to do again is map that
value and you know I'm tired of mapping
it's gonna be simple just to like
multiply this by height so you can see
every time i refresh it I get one value
across that's because as I move from
pixel to pixel I'm not moving through
I'm not moving through this noise space
I'm just staying at one point in time so
now what I want to do is I want to add
an X offset variable start that at zero
get the noise value at X offset and go
up by some amount like point zero two
and now I know refresh that you can see
there's my Perlin noise graph this is
what purlins noise looks like when i
graph it smoothes randomness as compared
to random so you can really see the
difference now I want to do a few more
things with this there's a couple things
I want to do one is one thing is I just
want to show you what happens when I
change this particular parameter so let
me make this 0.01 so 2.02 and actually
let's do something oh the other thing
let's let's let's loop it
so you can see I'm adding the loop back
and it's animating but remember the
Perlin noise values are fixed so so I'm
always offset always starts at zero I'm
gonna get the same values so let me do
something where I make an increment
variable and I say that's 0.01 so I'm
gonna increase by that increment
variable and now I can do things like
say what if increment is 1 you can see
what that looks like
what if increment is 0.001 you can see
how smooth that is and I could easily
tie this to a slider that would be a
nice thing to do and you can see how how
the graph changes based on that
increment value now there's another
thing I could do to this which I think
would be kind of interesting what if I
want to kind of scan across the Perlin
noise space what if I don't always want
X offset to start at 0 so in this case I
could say start equals zero X offset
equals start and then I could say the
start also changes by that increment now
look at this now I'm sort of singing
this is basically exactly what I did I
have a terrain generator example which
does this in two dimensions which I
recorded before I made this video so
things are a little strange and out of
order but you can go and find that if
you look for a youtube terrain generator
Schiffman you can see I serve but this
is exactly what's happening now I'm this
is a one-dimensional terrain generator
I'm moving across this space moving
across the Perlin noise space over time
boy there's so many things I want to add
to this um let me think about ok one
thing I think I should mention here by
the way this kind of looks like like
it's like a wave form right like a sine
wave I could easily just by the way
change the noise function to sine and
notice what I get I get a sine wave now
the one thing the sine wave unfortunate
the sine function gives me a value
between negative 1 and 1 so what I
really need to do is change the mapping
like
add height divided by two and multiply
by eight divided by two and now you can
see the sine wave but interestingly
enough this these algorithms work the
same way they're just functions that
when you pass it a value that changes
over time give you a new value whether
it oscillates perfectly or it moves kind
of randomly so there's a lot of
possibilities here in fact you could add
noise I could also like I could say like
noise X off you know times 10 plus oh no
no y equals how come that didn't work I
want to add oh no no yeah yeah
y is maybe 10 isn't enough times 100
yeah you can see now there's the sine
wave with a lot of sort of like
randomness a little bit of randomness
thrown in because what I actually didn't
it's not offset very well let's actually
make this correct I'm gonna show you
while I'm here right let's say let's say
I have a noise value which is noise of X
offset map the noise value between 0 and
1/2 between like negative 50 and 50 and
then let me take a sine value which is
map the sine wave of X offset which goes
to be negative 1 and 1/2 between 0 and
height and then what I want to do is say
that VAR y equals the those two values
added together and now you can see I
have the sine wave with a little bit of
noise at it and this by the way if you
if you took like letterforms and you
want to make them appear a little bit
like handwriting you could add a little
bit of Perlin noise just to the paths
between those letter forms you can see
there's a lot of interesting
possibilities here I could kind of do
the opposite like I could say well let
me make noise the primary thing and make
the sine wave just like a little
something that adjusts the noise and you
can see now I don't know is this harder
to see but there's a little sine wave in
there that's kind of adjusting the noise
and if sort of perfect perfect amount I
think by the way that I changed that so
the logic you could play with here so I
kind of messed
around because I'm nearing the end of
the point where what I all want to do is
look at then this is all about noise in
1 dimensions I'm drawing this graph in
two dimensional space but my values live
in one dimension thanks for watching
this video I'm ready now in the next
video to move from one dimensional
Perlin noise to two-dimensional perla
noise and i'll see you maybe in that
