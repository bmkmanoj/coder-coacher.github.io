bit of a tough one here we are we're
going to begin talking about
object-oriented programming and the
theory about Victoria programming in a
way and oh because we think this myth
Nijo later but it's just going to live
for we live with it for right now
so what I want to do in this video we're
going to get into the nitty-gritty the
nuts and bulbs were to look at the
implementation what it means to write a
class to use objects to make multiple
objects later we do arrays of others
there's so much to come forward but to
start with to begin with we need to take
a deep breath and just understand what
are we trying to do with object-oriented
programming well okay so in one sense
we're trying to understand a computer
program in the way that we think it's
somewhat about the world and we've got
one right over here we have this ball
bouncing around the screen and we can
see I've actually written this program
already using object-oriented
programming this is where we want to get
to understanding all of the pieces here
by the end of this of this this set of
videos but we can start with this here
what we did what we're looking at here
is we're seeing the manifestation the
instance of a ball object moving around
the screen what is a ball object what is
the innovation of object-oriented
programming well our programs so far
have looked like this we have set up we
have draw write that is the sort of
framework for the flow of our program
what else do we have we have a bunch of
variables up here we can think of that
as the data of a program this is the
data of a program the X the Y the X
speed the y speed of color the film blah
blah blah we have the functionality what
are the things that are happening
something's moving some things checking
its edges it's being displayed it's
exploding its be it's doing stuff happy
it's dancing right we should have a
dancing ball for a bouncing ball but
next time we have functionality move I
think I actually called an update can
see I'm
this we have maybe a function called
display you know display ball we had it
in one of our most recent programs or up
we have functionality
what object-oriented programming does
for us it says ok we have data we have
functionality we want to put those
things together we want to have an
object that wraps the data for an entity
for functionality for an entity
altogether
what is that entity well that's what's
up to you conceptually how do you
organize the pieces of your program if
we were to make this palm maybe there
would be some paddles so there would be
paddle objects and a ball object maybe
there would be some thing we need to
sort of manage the whole game score the
player names maybe we'd have a game
manager object that has that data
associated with it so we're looking to
take data and functionality and put them
together we can think of this one way to
start thinking about this is actually to
think about you yourself for me myself
as an object we are an object living in
our world what do we have we have data
for a human object a human object a
human has data maybe a human has a
height an eye color a sort of
personality but there's so many things a
way to beard lengthen thorn on whatever
this you can see that there's lots of
data that could be associated to
describe those sort of aspects of a
human being
a human being can also do things there
might be functionality for example I can
eat them actually right
printing out it's time to get lunch
because I have some office hours
appointments I really should be stopping
this video but Brown took four minutes
we're almost to the end I can eat I
could sleep I could run right there is
data and functionality associated with a
human what would it mean to package all
those things up into an object so that
we could add human beings to our
processing sketch it might be a little
bit of ambitious but but we could get
there eventually so this is the theory
behind what we're doing we can start to
see the syntax that looks like this now
how does processing know what to do when
to make a ball object or what to do when
to update a ball object well there's
actually a sort of secret little tag
here which I'll just flip to real
quickly we'll look at this this is all
the code for the ball object this is
like a mini program to describe
everything that's to do with a ball
there's variables from the ball there's
functions for the ball that's what we're
going to get to in future videos how do
we write that but we should notice
something about this that's pretty
important and this is going to be very
important to them the next set of videos
that we're about to look at the examples
we're about to make there is this idea
here what if I written up on the board
here I have not put a human being in
board there is no human being here what
I have done is given you a template for
making a human being this is the cookie
cutter the cutter to cut a human being
out of the stuff that would make you
pick me right but this one great this is
the concept of what it means to be a
unity then there is right here the human
being him or herself right I am an
instance of a human being object I am a
human being I am feel win
don't you whatever anyway this is what
it means to be a human being I know it
seems silly that really running on about
this but this is actually quite
important we have this thing in
processing where you see which is called
a class a class you can think of as the
template right a cookie cutter is a
template for making a cookie or cookie
which Audrey yum yum is the cookie
itself this is quite important we need
to write the class we need to write
the template for what it is to make a
ball so that we can have an actual
instance of a ball object in our program
so the class is the template the object
is the thing itself so this is where
we're going and I think in the next
video if I look at my outline correctly
what we're going to do is learn how to
write a class we're going to learn how
to write a class so that we can make an
object in our program what we're seeing
here right now is the object itself an
instance of a ball what's on this
mysterious second tab here is the class
the template the things don't exist
unless we use them the template is what
defines what it is to be a ball bouncing
around the screen and processing so this
is what we're looking to do this is what
we're hoping to do in these next set of
videos think about this I don't really
have an exercise for this OP here's an
exercise take something you've done in a
processing sketch and try to write as a
list just write for yourself what is the
data associated with it what it what are
the functions associated with it so
design your template without code you
could do this with pencil and paper and
if you want you can even sort of can
magic what it would be to type the
program like this without knowing what
it's a piece of the syntax does you can
kind of look at this and understands its
structure okay so in the next video we
will actually look at writing the clasp
itself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
