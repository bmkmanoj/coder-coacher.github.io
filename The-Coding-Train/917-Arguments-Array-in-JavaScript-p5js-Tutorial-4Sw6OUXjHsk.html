JavaScript video tutorial thingamabob
thing that I'm making this tutorial I'm
going to cover something called the
arguments array which exists
mysteriously in JavaScript perhaps
without you than knowing that it's there
what you can use it for and this idea of
overloading a function or overloading a
constructor and how do you have optional
arguments to a function and all this
stuff okay well what am I talking about
first of all so let's just say today is
a nice sunny warm beautiful day rain
last night a rainbow came out and you
just sat at your computer and decided I
want to program my own function called
some and what some is going to do is
it's going to take two arguments a and B
and it's going to say return a plus B so
it's just going to make a sum of
whatever things I pass to it so I could
then say here in setup I could say VAR c
equals R you know C equal or whatever
value equals the sum of 5 and 15 and if
I say console dot log Val we should see
then if i go here i should see 20 and i
could say something like sum 2 comma 7
and i'm gonna get 9 or some negative 3
comma 7 and i'm gonna get 4 so this
function works but what if i were to say
this sum for not a number well let's say
i wanted to be able to actually have it
return just the number 4 how could i
have it do that it's getting not a
number because what is the value of a B
in this case if I were to say console
dot log B and run this again you're
gonna see the value of B is undefined
another that another way that I can
consider undefined undefined if I were
to ask is undefined true or false
undefined is actually false so something
that I could do for example is just say
something like if B
returned a plus B otherwise return a so
in this case I now have a function that
can perform differently based on the
number of arguments it gets right as
long as it gets a second argument
returned two of those two numbers
together if it doesn't get the second
argument right if the B is false simply
return a so in this case now if I go
back to the browser and I say some 4
comma 5 I should get 9 but if I say some
4 I'll just get 4 so we've now written a
function that it can optionally have a
second argument very very basic idea
here now let's take this a few steps
further what if I just said some with no
arguments now I've got undefined again
so in this case I could actually say if
a a if a and b else if then the way to
say if B that means there has to be an a
right return a + b else if a return a
else return 0 oh I made this sort of
like messy and awkward and weird but you
can start to sort of see what the
possibilities are so now I'm kind of
checking if I get two arguments return
the sum of both of those if I have if I
have one argument return just that one
argument if I have no arguments return
the value 0 let's just least make sure
that works right so I could say sum of 4
and 5 I get 9 sum of 4 I get for some
with nothing I get 0 so great so this is
working but what if I now want to say
some 4 6 8 I still only get 10 right 8
isn't involved well guess what anytime
you call a function in JavaScript the
arguments to that function 4 comma 6
comma 8 those things get placed into
what an array an array called arguments
you could just say the word arguments
and
you have everything in an array let me
show you what I mean by that if I go
back to the code and I just say here I
say console dot log arguments and I say
some whoops aah some four six eight you
can see what is the value of arguments
it's an array 4 comma 6 comma 8 so you
know what I could actually do in the
case of this function I can write a
function called sum I don't even have to
name any of the arguments here I can say
there is a value at 0 I can then go
through the length of the array I starts
at 0 I calls all the way up through are
the all the arguments val plus equals
arguments index i and they're going to
turn val this is now a function that can
take any amount of things you've any
number of arguments 0 arguments 5
arguments 10 arguments 20 arguments and
it can loop through and add them all
together so now here i could say things
like some v and i have a whoops sorry i
think i didn't reload it some v i have
the number 5 some 5 comma 6 I have the
number 11
some 5 comma 3 comma 2 comma 5 comma 1
comma 10 comma 11 comma negative 5 comma
3 comma 3 33 68 somebody confirm for me
that that number is correct it's going
to take any number of arguments and loop
through all of them so you can think of
all sorts of interesting possibilities
that this might open up for you in how
you write a function I could also name
those arguments too as well so like for
example I don't know why I want to do
this but I could name the first argument
and I could also say that return valve a
so in this case this is a little bit
weird but if I say sum 1 comma 2 it's
gonna add 1 and 2 and then add 1 to it
again so I would get the number for a
little bit silly but you can see that
you can both use that arguments array
and you could also name optionally name
those
arguments coming in so there's a lot of
possibilities of things you can do here
now let me make this even just to make
this even more a little bit stranger
what if I want my function let's say I
were to create an array so I have an
array that has the values 5 comma 3
comma 6 in it so I know I could say 5
comma 3 comma 6 with some and I'm gonna
get 19 did I take tonight I leave that
weird extra plus a thing in there I want
to take that out run this again and make
that array I'm gonna do this 14 right so
what what if I what if I also wanted to
be able to say some array in this case
look what it did something crazy happen
because it actually tried to add 0 with
the array but then it tried to make the
array of string and a concatenated
together JavaScript just tried to figure
something out but this isn't what I want
I want that if you pass this function an
array as its argument that you're going
to add the elements of that array so how
would I do that
well what I want to do is I want to
check I could put this back in AI could
say if a is an instance of array and I
think capital or like this so this is a
kind of keyword in JavaScript instance
of that can determine what kind of
argument you passed in so you could say
like oh well if the function receives a
string as its argument it should act
this way but if it receives a number as
its argument it should act this way so
if a is an instance of array and I'm
actually going to call this ARR then
what I want to do is do exactly this
algorithm but instead of using the
arguments array I just want to use that
actual array so now I'm gonna say array
dot length and add all that up right so
if you get an array look through that
array and return the sum of everything
in that array if you don't get an array
then loop through the because it's
there's just a sequence of numbers then
use the arguments array so now I have
like all sorts of possibilities here for
how this function could before
so now I can say let me have some it
still works if I give it five three and
six now if I make an array five three
and six and I say some of that array I
should also get that same number and if
I were to say array dot four equals a
negative one and look at that array
whoops I have an undefined
array index three equals two and look at
that array again and we clear that clear
it look at that look at the array and
now if I say some array I should still
get I should get 15 which is right 14
plus 2 is 16 minus 1 is 15 so now I have
this function which can both receive
inner right now
unfortunately I can't do this right I
would have to write them as an exercise
for yourself if you want a tricky
exercise how could you now write this
function so that it can have mix arrays
and regular numbers and still add all
those things together okay
yes so in the chat some people are
saying I could use the apply function up
and other types of things too like put
the array into the arguments array and
that's a great suggestion maybe I'll
cover that in a separate video but right
now I just want to look at different
ways that you can have flexible
arguments for a function and this often
comes up in the case of making objects
like a particle object so let's take
this a little bit further and let's just
say that this is going to be a program
and I'm just gonna take this and comment
it out for right now and I'm going to
say let's say I have a I'm writing a
program with some sort of particle
object and the whole point of this
particle object is that it has a
position which is a vector and I'm going
to make that vector with divided by 2
height divided by 2 and then I'm gonna
have a function called show which what
does that function do it draws a circle
on the screen at that vectors x and y
and maybe filled out to 55 and I'm going
to say here I'm gonna say var P P is a
new particle and
and Peep Show now you can see I run this
program and I get that circle appearing
in the center of the window now let's
think about all the possible ways I
might want to make a particle for
example I might want to make and let's
do it let's do this differently now
let's let's say there's an array called
particles and and what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna say particles index 0 is a new
particle and then I'm gonna loop through
and I'm just going to call show on all
the particles in that array so this is
essentially the same program but the
reason why I want to show this to you
right is that I want to be able to say
things like this
well particles index 1 what if I could
make a particle this way what if I could
say this
and what if I could say particles index
to equals a new particle with that
particular vector what if I were to say
this particles index 3 equals equals a
new particle whoops let's make this one
50 comma 100 100 comma 150 now I'm not
so sure I really want all of these but
you could imagine an object you might be
able to in your code you might want to
make particles and sometimes you make a
particle with no object no arguments and
it always puts it in a default location
or you could specify the location as two
values an x and a y or you could just
pass in a vector it would put the
particle at that vector or maybe for
some reason you are getting data from a
text file and you're reading in strings
and what if you give it two numbers
separated by a comma how would you deal
with it then
this is the kind of scenario that can
come up in many things that you might
want to program so let's see if we can
get all these particles to appear on the
screen so one thing that I might do here
first of all is give it some let's give
it two arguments an x and a y so one
thing we can do is say this and actually
I'm gonna I'm gonna change it from
having a position vector just to giving
it just right now I'm gonna change it
just having an x and a y so one thing I
could actually do that you'll see is I'm
gonna say this set x equals x or 100
this dot y equals y or 100 this would
cover me for these first two cases right
I'm basically saying I want to take the
value that comes in or some default
value if it's false and in this case it
would be false because it would be
undefined no value would come in so
let's let's actually say I want to make
the particle at 150 comma 50 and we
could see we should be able we should
see two particles now right so this is
and let me give all the but okay it
doesn't really matter the point is you
can see now when the particle gets two
arguments coming in it
it uses those two arguments like 150
comma 50 when it doesn't get those
coming in it uses 100 comma 100 so this
is 100 comma 100 and this is what 50
comma 150 that's that second particle
okay so those two cases are covered now
what about this third case what if I'm
passing in a vector so one thing I can
do is I can say okay well actually right
here I can say if this dot X is an
instance of a p5 dot vector object then
this dot X equals X dot X and this dot y
equals x dot y now this is a little bit
weird because I'm sort of stuck in this
place of I named that first argument X
so now X is kind of this vector I still
have to call it X so I might actually
want to just use more generic names like
a and B in this case so I could say if
and I'm not saying if this dot X I'm
saying if a is an instance of PFI vector
do this otherwise go back to this other
idea so now I'm checking I've had two
three possibilities one is I've gotten a
vector or another possibility I got
nothing
or I got two separate values and we can
run this again you can see now I have
three of them all three of those work
and I have one last possibility which is
this string so I can also say else if a
is an instance of string I guess I
forgot there's a sort of funny thing
with strings that I forgot about because
this if a the instance of string is not
actually checking if a is just text but
if it's an actual like fully formed
string object in JavaScript and let me
just show you this is a little bit of an
aside but it's kind of worth it does it
might come up let's say I create a VAR s
equals test now if I say s instance of
string you're gonna actually see that
that gives me false but if I were to say
s is a new string with the text test in
it right it's actually like a whole
string object now and this will actually
return true but in most cases
I'm just gonna be in the land of saying
ass equals test whoops something like
this
so another function that I can use in
JavaScript is type of and I could say
type of s and I'll actually get the word
string back and so I think in this case
I could say else if typeof a equals
string whoops then now let's see if that
works I'm gonna run this and you can see
that came through so since that came
through what I need to do now is say I
can use like a dot split by a comma and
then I can say this dot X equals number
numbs index 0 and this dot y equals
number numbs index 1 so split take
something takes the string so let's let
me do this actually so let's say s is
100 the numbers in a string 100 comma
150 and what I want to do is I want to
say nums equals s dot split by a comma s
dot split by a comma
so now nums is just an array with two
strings in it and so I could say numbs
index 0 but it's actually not the number
100 it's the string 100 but and there's
lots of ways I could probably convert it
but one way is I could just do this
convert it to a number number whoops not
numbers number and you can see now I
have the value of 100 so I'm just doing
that in the code here I'm saying ah if I
happen to get a string split it up by
the comma then convert those two numbers
and we should see then another particle
at 100 comma 150 so if I now run this
again we can see now I have 4 particles
so we've now written a constructor
function that optional it takes two
arguments you could give it no arguments
you could give it two numbers you could
give it a vector you could give it a
string and it's going to figure out how
to fill in the x and y based on what it
gets so this is one just kind of small
instance of that but there's lots of
other scenarios where this could come up
where you want to write a function
to arbitrarily handle a certain number
of arguments of different types
incidentally if you were doing this in
processing or in Java you would just
write multiple copies of the function
each with different arguments and then
handle the those arguments in that but
in JavaScript since the arguments don't
have a type a type is not part of this
signature of that function of that
method you have to handle them with an
if statement by having sort of optional
flexible arguments okay hopefully you
found this helpful and you learn
something about what the arguments array
in JavaScript does and how to write a
function or a constructor function that
is flexible different kinds of arguments
of different numbers of arguments thanks
