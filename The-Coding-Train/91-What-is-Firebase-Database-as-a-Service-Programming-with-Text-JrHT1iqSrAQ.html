talk to you about something called
database as service so I want to put it
in the context of kind of web web
programming in general and you know this
video is kind of sandwiched in the
middle it's you know you could just be
here just to learn about databases and
JavaScript and all that sort of stuff
but it's in the middle of this
programming from A to Z playlist and so
I'm going to sort of set this topic in
that context so I've been using a
variety of different tools and libraries
and frameworks in making web
applications around text in this video
series one is called p5.js which is a
client-side library for JavaScript and
it has lots of nice things in it like
drawing to the canvas and some Dom
manipulation and it lives on a client
like which I will draw as like a little
laptop here you know it happens in the
browser now another aspect that I have
explored is something called nodejs
also a framework for writing code in
javascript for server-side programming
so and the code that we've run runs on a
server now if you've watched my previous
videos you would have noticed that I'm
running both the client and the server
on one computer just to like mess around
and try stuff and learn stuff and
because I'm just you know
ba-ba-ba-ba-ba coding but if you were
deploying making a big thing and putting
it out into the world you would actually
put it on some server somewhere whether
you have like an Amazon account or your
own account or whatever and then you
might have lots and lots of clients all
connecting to that server now one of the
things I explored is that on the server
you could store data one of the examples
I'm a just writes data to it like a
local text file a JSON a JavaScript
object notation text file that sits here
so you can think of the simplest
scenario here is like you made a game
that people are playing in p5.js and
whenever they finish the game it sends
the score to the server if it's a high
score it gets saved into the file and
then if somebody else comes to play
later they can request and see the
current high scores and their score can
get it saved into a file so this is one
something I've done and I've
demonstrated if you go back
words in video times you could see the
pieces of this you could get more
sophisticated than just a local text
file you could actually have you know a
proper so to speak database and you
wouldn't need that if you have large
amounts of data or if you needed you
know encrypted passwords and all sorts
of things and you want additional
functionality a database and you can
learn MongoDB or CouchDB and you can
install that and get a note package and
all that what I'm here today in this
video to show you the beginning steps of
how to work with something called
database as service so what if there's
something else existed oh I made it a
cloud nothing is a cloud there is no
clutter clouds it rains but there's no
there's no clouds in the internet so
this others let me erase that I don't
know where my eraser went look here it
is um okay so there's another what if
there were another server somewhere so
this is a server that's you know you
have some ownership or account over this
is your client but what if there was a
server that wasn't yours and that you
could actually eliminate this and you
could just say hey save this data for me
could I get this data back and you
wouldn't have to write the server the
node program set up the database it
would just exist and it would have an
API and interface for you to make calls
to it so this is what's known as
database as service exclamation point
database as service so this is
incredibly useful because you don't have
to have you don't have to like set up
configure this is like easy just like
you know hey please say you know hey
databases service could you save this
for me and I might ask you for it later
so now there are lots of examples of
this a particular product that I'm going
to show you in this video and the next
and the next one is something called
firebase which is it was it originally
created by Google but I believe Google
Google acquired it so it's a Google
service there is um there's something
that I really like also called sheet su
for turning a Google sheet into an API
that you can save data to and request
data from I'm gonna sheets for of sheets
who doesn't have a lot
of great free options as far as I can
tell maybe somebody can correct me in
the comments and I'll come back and do a
video about it but as far as I can tell
you can only have one Google sheet and
300 calls per month so I'm going to
focus on firebase which is has quite a
lot that you can do with it without a
paid account you know there's limits to
that of course and then there are
probably other examples that you can add
in the comments if there are things that
you use that I should explore in a
future video or that sort of thing so
this is oh but I should mention the last
thing I wanna mention here in this kind
of introductory explanation is you also
don't have to cut this out so you could
still have your node program and your
node program could also connect to the
databases service so there's you know it
just sort of depends if you only need
client-side code you just want to save
some data and you don't you know
security isn't too much of an issue for
you this is going to be just fine if you
have some other server-side components
but you don't want to deal with setting
up your own database you could still use
a database of service and the server and
your client everything is possible so um
this is my sort of introduction to why
this matters and in the next video I'm
going to just get started with how to
set up a firebase account and how to
send data to it from p5.js or any
JavaScript program really and how to
request data from any JavaScript program
and I'll see you in the next video if
you're interested
