gonna leave this in the video because
this really happened and it's there so I
the previous video I made we looked at I
just looked at really really the basics
of the control structure of the loop a
while loop a for loop for looping this
for primary looping structure that I'm
used for the rest of the examples and
all I did was something very basic use
it to draw a repeating shape and now
it's up to you to figure out what kinds
of creative things you can try to
experiment with to create different new
kinds of patterns that you haven't
explored before but I think there are
two key elements that I would like to
discuss that I think will fill in a
couple gaps in you in your knowledge
here that will help you do more stuff
with loops so the first thing that what
I mentioned is you know we I started
talking about loops as if this is this
new thing but there actually is this
draw function and the one of the very
first things I looked at in an earlier
video is this draw function is looping
and every time you get to the end of the
draw function the screen is updated then
the draw function repeats stuff is drawn
again screen is updated so sometimes it
gets a little bit confusing here if you
have this loop like there's this for
loop that that I just created in the
previous example which is inside the
draw loop which is all like comes back
together because this video is all about
nested loops because this is really a
nested loop draws looping the for loop
is looping but right the goal of this
loop was to do what it was to draw
multiple shapes repeat the same ellipse
function over and over and over again
however if you were if you're thinking
about this kind of in most to much
detail you might have noticed it's while
this loop is going it's not like you see
like the first ellipse then you see the
second one then you see the third one
then you see the fourth one you just see
that all you might also think yourself
okay well it's drawing them one at a
time but it happened so fast it looks
like it's just all of it so I would like
to remind you that neither of those
things is the case in fact the window
the canvas is not updated until the end
of draw is reached so the purpose of a
for loop inside the draw loop is not
animate something but rather to draw a
whole bunch of things for each cycle of
the draw loop if you want to animate
things you would have to do something
slightly different so let's take a look
in this particular example so I'm going
to draw these back in the middle these
circles so the circles are just there
I'm seeing all them nothing is changing
I could do a couple things one I could
add random for the blue value of the
color and now we can see that can you
see that whoa yeah that's really like
the worst let me make this random too
because you can barely see that now you
can see that more right so you can see
that draw is looping over and over again
and the only thing that's changing is
that the color is changing the location
of these ellipses from that loop are
staying the same I could do something
kind of strange and I could say let me
add a variable like offset and I could
say draw every ellipse at the X X is
part of this loop oh my goodness I'm
flickering like crazy this camera is
having problems but hopefully you're
going to be able to get through this
video anyway the X X is the same every
time through X is the same every time
through draw because X is what's this is
making crazy governing the location of
those circles but if I were to say
offset equals offset plus 1 now you can
see I'm offset in the location of all of
those by some amount so this dismay this
is these are kind of like a few sort of
strange quick things that I've added
here but the point of what I wanted to
make is you just need to keep that in
mind write this draw loop is for the
purpose of refreshing that flipbook
metaphor I think works well or analogy
someone will correct me the flipbook
idea right you've got a page and then
the next page in the next page of next
page there's no flip book here this is
in order to perform a repeating task on
a single page in the flip book for
animation so that's the first thing that
I wanted to know the other thing that
comes up very often is kind of related
to this because what happens if now
inside this
I put another loop for every X do
something to every Y and let's think
about how that might be useful and this
is a kind of algorithm or process that
comes up over and over again and again
in any sort of computer graphics
programming and other kinds of
programming as well why because the
canvas the thing that we're drawing to
is a 2-dimensional grid
it has pixels along an x axis and it has
pixels along the y axis so if I would
like to draw something for every X fill
in all the Y's so for the first X do all
the Y's for the next X do all the Y's
now for the next X do all the Y's the
way that that works is to say for VAR x
equals 0 the rest of the for loop and
then for every X assuming this X is
going up every time you do an X also do
a Y so this is a little tricky to get
used to but it's incredibly powerful it
will open up a lot of possibilities you
know you want to program a game that
involves a 2-dimensional board of cells
like chess or checkers you're going to
need some sort of structure like this if
you want to learn about image processing
how do you read every pixel of an image
and make that pixel a little brighter a
little darker or apply some other kind
of effect you're going to need this kind
of loop so it comes up over and over
again in so many things so let's look at
that apply into code and I'm still here
okay I won't flicker and disappear too
much so what I'm going to do I'm going
to get rid of this I'm going to save
this project as I'm saving these because
someday I will upload them somewhere I
suppose I am going to remove this weird
offset thing I'll keep the random fill
why not we don't need this offset and
what I want to do is add right here
another loop for y equals 0 Y is less
than or equal to height Y goes up by 50
and draw the ellipse at X
why so all I did is now this is the
exactly we're talking about for every X
do every y so the first X do all the Y's
the next X do all the Y's and let's see
if this works
whew it did so now we have this perfect
grid of circles flashing random colors
all over the window you know how could
you make those colors not random how
might you have like supply some sort of
pattern to it how much you do all sorts
of interesting things like have those
circles start to shake a little bit
that's a little bit more complicated
you're going to need some other tools
and objects and rays for a bit more but
you can start to think about all these
possibilities and I just want to point
out that again if I were to take this
loop and I did this sort of backwards I
don't know why I'm showing you this
because it works so nicely but if I were
to not do it this way right if I were to
do this two loops right this is what
I've got with two separate loops I'm
doing all the X's along the Y column 200
and now I'm doing all the Y's along the
X sorry along the Y row 209 doing all
the Y's in the X column 200 so I don't
know I had this in my mind I could show
you this first and so now I make sure
you this after which really doesn't make
a lot of sense but I'm just like letting
this video fly with all of its weirdness
and errors so let me go back to what it
was correctly that was sort of like
pointless to take that out and we could
I think this is a nicer place to end
looking at this again so what I've
talked now about really very little but
kind of giving you a running start here
into thinking about loops a loop is
something to repeat a certain task
during one cycle of drama you can use a
loop anywhere but right now I'm using it
to draw multiple copies of a shape
inside of draw you can also use a nested
loop to see a grid if draw remember is
the flip book so each time through draw
if you change some aspect of the loop
you know I just thought of something
really interesting that we could try
like for example everything can be a
variable right here the X loop stops at
width what if I were to put
mouse X here so I just want to
dynamically loop up to where the mouse
is so now this loop remember is
executing every single time but the exit
condition is changing every time through
drop you're still watching this was a
little nugget here that's that's
hopefully useful okay
so that gives you the basics about loops
how loop works within draw how you have
a nested loop and I need to make one
more video which won't happen today
because I now have to go do something
else but I want to look at an array and
how loop relates to that okay thank you
and goodbye
this is where I need to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
