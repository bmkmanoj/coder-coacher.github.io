whatever this what do you watched one
video a day come on they're like seven
minutes long this seven minute period
topic is variable scope now this is
admittedly a kind of a strange topic to
just sort of insert in here because we
did have a whole set of videos about
variables you know variables it's fine a
variable what's a variable datatypes all
sorts of things I think we made those
videos yes anyway I'll make them if I
have it but what are we doing when talk
about variable scope here shouldn't have
that gone back there
in truth this idea of variable scope is
probably a concept that goes with
variables at the same time we've never
really had a need to concern ourselves
with variable scope but this moment of
using a loop is the first time where it
makes some sense it's only gonna make
more and more and more sense as we get
further and further along with many more
programs okay
so the people just talking always very
distracting quiet so we're down out
there now they're gonna start begging
back anyway
okay so let's think about variable scope
just to recenter ourselves let's write
the words variable scope now we're used
to writing processing sketches that have
set up and then have draw and we said
okay well you're gonna use variables in
your programs what if we needed to put
these at a variable X for example you
next called adepts of type float it's
gonna be initialized to 0 we always put
our variables at the top of the code or
so we thought but I'm sure you've seen
examples or maybe by accident you've
actually put your variables somewhere
else what we're talking about with
variable scope is what happens when we
start to declare our variables not use
them by declare I mean give them a name
and a type somewhere else in our code
what happens if we put them in setup
what happens if we declare them and draw
what happens if we have a conditional
statement and we declare a variable
inside a conditional statement what does
that mean well conceptually we have
these two these concepts this is what's
commonly referred to as a global
variable now is anything really global
or local isn't global just a larger low
I mean that's what I think but we can
separate the idea here that this is a
global variable meaning if it's declared
at the top or outside of setup and draw
truly then we can use it anywhere in our
program anywhere at all its global we
can say X whenever we want and it's this
variable X if we happen to declare a
variable somewhere else
it is only usable in that block of code
let's go let's take a look at what I
mean by this okay so I actually have an
example prepared that had two that I was
going to use for variable scope but I'm
actually just going to open up a sketch
that we did in with conditionals
bouncing ball let's open up this
bouncing ball sketch and let's run it so
we can see this bouncing ball sketch has
two variables circlex circlex + X speed
if I'm standing here I mean yeah you can
see nothing you need to see me whatever
it has Circle X it has X speed two
variables Global variables we're using
them and setup we're using them to draw
all over our code what would happen if
by accident we weren't really paying
attention one day and instead we wrote
our code like this right we have circle
X people we say okay what's happening at
the beginning of our program we say we
want to use a variable called circle X
and 0 and X speed which is 3 and then
we're going to use those variables later
in our program if I run this code it
says down here at the bottom cannot find
anything named circle X that is the
error message you get when you trying to
use a variable that you've never
declared your intention to use in the
first place but is that wrong didn't we
declare our intention to use it right
here and set up float circle X the
problem is a variable that is declared
eraser a variable that is declared
inside set up float if we have some
variable float X here inside setup this
is referred to as local meaning it is
local only to the setup function it's
the rest of the program knows nothing
about it so here we could use that
variable anywhere we want and setup but
we can't use it in draw because it
doesn't exist and draw only exists
instead of what is the scope you have to
look and say okay where are my curly
brackets what set of curly brackets am I
in that wherever I've I'm declaring
inside a set of curly brackets that's
the only place I can use that variable
that goes for a conditional statement a
loop other types of curly braket things
we're gonna see later like functions and
objects it's a low variable local only
to that function so now we have to ask
ourselves this question that's confusing
that I don't have to worry about whether
or not I'm supposed to use it or not cuz
I could just use it wherever I want and
you know what I think you're right just
make everything global your life is easy
certainly that's where we are now we're
writing small programs they have a few
variables we're using the variables and
setup we're using them and draw
everything should just be global but
there comes a time where that
convenience can be a bit of a mess what
if you had a thousand variables in your
code you might actually someday have a
thousand variables in your code you
don't want to have a thousand global
variables at the top it's gonna be very
confusing things aren't gonna get put
into packages in different places we're
gonna learn about objects and classes
and tabs and functions a loop is sort of
a place where we might actually have an
instance for a local variable that makes
sense because if we don't need it
everywhere
why declare it as global when we could
only give ourselves some problems okay
so I'm moving over here now I don't know
why I feel like sometimes a helpful find
out that I also I really wanted to try
this which is the goal underneath just
pop up and appear I don't know what that
does that probably does nothing okay so
let's go away from this programs fix
this program by putting our variables
back to the top and running it our
bouncing ball works again and now let's
look at this let's look at this sketch
so this sketch and I'm at six minutes
we're gonna be done in a couple minutes
this sketch is drawing a set of lines
horizontal you seen up
to these now so where is our variable
here well this is a static sketch it
doesn't have setup and draw and you
notice I declared in two x equals zero
down there because it kind of goes with
the loop X should start at zero and then
increment by 20 and we should draw those
lines I mean I could have put into X up
here and we're gonna get the same exact
result because it's just a static
program but now let's let's go ahead and
put a set up in here and put draw around
all of our drawing code so now it is a
dynamic program it's to do the same
thing every time through draw and we run
it and oh crap it's not doing what we
wanted to do why because for this loop
to work X always has to start at zero
where X is only is zero once then it
goes up we've got to make sure every
time through draw we reset ex back equal
to zero so we just add this line of code
and now our program works again but
here's the thing did we use X and set up
no did we use it anywhere else do we use
it in mouse press key pressed is there
some other code no so it's confusing why
is it up there if we only need it just
for this loop really and so I think it
would make more sense for us to actually
just declare X the moment because we
only need it down in this block of code
so this is where it makes some sense to
use a local variable because we only
need it here and our code is a little
bit cleaner to read and see and we can't
by accident use it somewhere where we
don't need it or want to use it so
that's what variable scope is for we
have variables that are accessible and
usable in certain parts of the code
certainly there are questions of
efficiency like the computer can release
the memory when it's done with them but
you know I don't care about that we're
writing these little skipping you know
you can worry about that later
some time where you have a big giant
complicated program whatever I don't
even know why I mentioned that oh ok
that's it that's variable scope I don't
even think an exercise really needs to
go with this one I suppose if I were to
give you an exercise it's go back look
at something you made in prosthetic that
has a lot of global variables at the top
any of those variables do you need them
everywhere can you make some of them
local at least maybe try some loops and
by the way when you're using a for loop
you if we turn that turn that into a
four loop with a local variable and see
what happens there is your exercise okay
I know how to juggle but I'm not going
to do that someday I will hopefully this
video will be cut off before I talk
about okay that's it end of this video
we're doing well today this is good this
is good okay Clark goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
