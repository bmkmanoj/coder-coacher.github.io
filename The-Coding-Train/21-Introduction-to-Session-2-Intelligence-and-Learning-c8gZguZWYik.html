of code intelligence and learning so I
am making this video in 2017 these are
videos that go along with a course but
I'm teaching at New York University ITP
on this video is going to be very very
short and you're here it's Session two
so the topic for Session two is
evolutionary algorithms so this this
there will be a link to this particular
readme file on github which has kind of
a little outline of a lot of the topics
some additional reading that you could
do about the topic links to various
examples but mostly if you're in this
playlist you're seeing this video this
is part of Session two intelligence
learning playlist there's going to be a
lot of videos about genetic algorithms
that you can watch this is a long
session will be if it starts with about
four or five videos that just explain
the idea then I go through a kind of a
scenario known as the Shakespeare
monkeys and they're careful if that
makes any sense to use a genetic
algorithm to evolve a monkey that could
type Shakespeare it's not really what
happens but something like that and then
I try to take a variety of other
approaches looking at something called
interactive selection where the user
plays a role in the evolutionary
algorithm by making Fitness selections
of what the user likes or doesn't like
or what that sort of thing and then also
I'm going to look at an ecosystem kind
of simulation where you just have a
continuous system of agents moving
around the screen that try to try to eat
food or escape from a predator and that
type of thing so there's a lot of videos
watch them all don't watch them all but
if you get to the end there will be a
video that gives you kind of an exercise
or assignment prompt so if you get to
the end and watch that video and you
make something you create something
please share with me at Schiffman on
Twitter or in the comments here there
anywhere and I look forward to seeing
what you make normally in this
introductory video I might sort of
introduce the topic genetic algorithms
but this video was really looking sure
because the very first video in this
particular playlist which should come up
next to you actually does that so
genetic algorithm introduction so you
could just walk right into that video I
don't know if you walk into a video but
you can go right to that next video
where I'll actually talk about what is
genetic
and how it can be applied okay thanks
for watching this short video that I
don't know if it ever will actually
exist but I'm making it so maybe if
you're watching it then it does exist
okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
