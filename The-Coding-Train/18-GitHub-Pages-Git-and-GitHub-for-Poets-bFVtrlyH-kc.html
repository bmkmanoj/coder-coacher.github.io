baguette and all that stuff for poets
and in this particular video I'm going
to show you how to have your poem or
whatever it is you're making web page
hosted through github so your git
repository on github can actually be you
could get free web hosting with it so
and this is by using something called
github pages github pages is a rather
large topic because there's tons of
features that it has available for you
but I'm going to show you the very
basics just how to take your files and
have them viewable through a URL so
that's the first thing that I'm going to
do in this particular video so um if
you've been following these videos long
and there's these important get concepts
that I've been covering in each one of
these videos commit we have a repository
a commit is like a same branch is
ticking is having a separate branch of
changes that you might merge into your
master branch later if you like those
changes there's push and pull of pushing
being descend and pull being to to
retrieve so there's all this stuff that
I've covered in all these other videos
and the exciting thing is that using
github pages all of this stuff works
identically exactly the same way so you
can have a project that you are working
on through get keeping track of its
history collaborating through git but if
you flip a switch and it's on github you
can actually view that project as a
directory of as if it's hosted on a
website so let me show you how this
works the key to it is the under branch
the key is that typically by default
your git branch is called master that's
the sort of like fundamental core branch
of your project where you're like finals
things are your main poem your main code
whatever it is lives in the master
branch for github pages to work you want
to get rid of this idea of having a
master branch you still can have one but
for simplicity you could just think of
your master branch as being called gah -
pages so as long as the branch that
you're working on is called gah - pages
there is automatically a secret URL by
which you
can access now there's a there's a lot
more to this and I but I'm avoiding
saying that now and I'll get to it later
so let's come back up and let's so let's
just do this right now it's actually
going to be quite simple and easy I'm
going to go I'm on my profile page I'm
the rainbow coder for lack of a better
username and I'm going to make a new
repository and I'm going to call this
poem website so this is my repository
name poem website is ridiculously bad
repository name but it's fine you can
come up with something better and this
poem will be on the internet and really
on the world wide web talking about so
that's my description it's going to be
public I want to initialize it with a
readme so you can see what I'm doing so
I'm just making a new repository through
the github interface just like I always
have before so I am going to hit create
repository there it is now I have this
repository so notice here that by
default the repository lives in the
master branch so in order for it to use
github pages all that I need to do is
click here and make a new branch so I'm
going to type in github - pages and I'm
going to select create branch gh-pages
so now I have this branch gh-pages now
here's the thing that master branch is
still there and in fact if I were to go
to this repository again by default it's
going to put me on to the master branch
so to make things simpler I want to make
sure that gah - pages is the default
branch so where I do that I need to go
to settings so I'm going to click on
settings and under settings I'm going to
go over here to branches I'm going to
click on branches and over here notice
here this is where it says default
branch so I want to go to this default
branch place and I want to switch
default branch and I want to switch it
to gh-pages and then I want to click
update now it's going to it's going to
say like oh my goodness changing your
default branch can have unintended
consequences
it can and this is you know it's we're
living a little bit in the danger zone
here but what's the big deal there's
nothing in this repository yet I'm just
making a poem I'm messing around this is
actually quite okay to do with a brand
new repository you're not affecting
anything else that's happened in the
history because there is no history so
far so I'm going to say I understand
update the default branch and now the
default branch is gh-pages so if I go
back to this whoops
a poem website repository you can see
that I am now by default in the branch
gh-pages now there's a little bit this
is fine and I could stop here but I want
to be real I'm really serious about
github pages I thought I'm not stopped
I've my live all in on github pages so I
also want to go over here to branches
where this is the link where I could
view what are all the branches
associated with this repo and I'm going
to click here and I'm going to see that
the default branch is gh-pages but I
still have this other branch master so
over here on the right hand side there's
this little trash icon I can click this
and actually delete the master branch
and this is worth doing because I don't
want to by accident ever work on the
master branch in this particular case so
I'm going to delete this branch and you
can see it's gone it's it's kind of exit
out and all I now all I have now is a
gh-pages branch okay we did it this
repository is now a repository hosted
through github pages so I can up I can
go to settings by the way and I can
scroll down under github pages you can
see here your site is published at this
URL so by definition if you have a geat
gh-pages branch in your repository the
URL for that repository will be your
username github dot
the repository name which in this case
is poem website now here's the thing you
absolutely can use a custom URL so for
example I have plenty I have several
websites hosted through github pages
nature of code comm for example is
hosted with github pages but it is an at
Schiffman github io / nature of code so
there is a way to do that and
in another video maybe I'll explore that
as the topic it's just a sort of
configuration thing but you get this
sort of free URL that you could use now
let's go to that URL and you can see
here it's going to say page not found
the reason is there are no files there
there's no files there for me to look at
I mean maybe in the repository there is
a file called readme I might be able to
look at that but let's let's take a step
further let's add a file so I'm going to
go here under create new file and I'm
just going to name the file now I'm just
going to make a plain text file I'm
going to call it poem txt and I'm going
to do oh I'm going to write some poetry
github pages oops get hug oh it's let's
row that by accident by them to keep it
github github is a hug on the pages oh
dear
this poem is terrible okay so that's my
poem you can you send me a pull request
to improve it and I'm going to do commit
new file and you can see that it's
committing it directly to the gh-pages
branch and you can see there it is so I
can see it here in my github repository
but now look at this I can go to the URL
and I can put in their poem dot txt so I
can access that particular file and
there you can see there it is I now have
a web page with this particular poem on
it
now that web page is a plain text file
so all it shows up as raw text those of
you who have used the internet before or
browse the web have noticed that web
pages have different fonts and images
and animations so to go further with
this to actually host a dynamic website
through github pages you need to
actually have HTML files perhaps also
image files perhaps also something
called CSS files I happen to have a
whole set of tutorials about how to use
HTML CSS and JavaScript to create
different kinds of webpages you could go
and look at and then come back to this
but I'm at least gonna just in one step
I'm going to make an HTML poem just here
so you can see a little bit more so
what I want to do now is I'm going to go
back and I'm going to say another I'm
going to create another new file and you
know what I'm going to call this file
index.html if you name a file index.html
then you don't actually have to type in
that file name on the web it will be the
default file that's open whenever I go
to rainbow coder github dot dot io / po
and website so I'm going to call it that
and then I'm going to type whoops I'm
going to type some HTML into this file
you know I'm probably missing some
things you're supposed to have in HTML
but hTML is all about having these tags
open HTML closed HTML open body close
body and in the body I can put something
like H 1 which means header 1 and I can
say poem and then I could say like H 3
by Daniel Schiffman and then I could
tell you like P which is for a paragraph
I could say this you know rainbow
rainbow you are my rainbow and then I
could put a period and close the
paragraph and you can see this is you
know you can check out my other
tutorials to learn a lot more about HTML
but this is writing some markup which is
giving it some formatting and I'm going
to just add a little more formatting
like I'm going to add strong so this is
going to make that particular rainbow
bold and then I'm going to hit commit
I'm going to say making an HTML poem and
I'm going to commit that new file and
you can see now what do I have in my
repository I now the index.html in
addition to poem txt and if you remember
this is what poem txt looks like however
now if I go to the URL and I just get
rid of that right and I want to go to
just the core URL rainbow coder github
do slash poem website and I hit enter
you can see there's my poem and
formatted so I've now used a little bit
of HTML and it's freely available on the
internet this is a website people can
contribute to this website by making
pull requests you can make changes to it
through the github interface you
clone that repository down to your
computer the same way I showed you in
other videos you can make branches you
can make changes just remember the one
thing that's going to be different I'm
actually going to let's do this really
quickly let's say you want to work with
this locally I want to get I'm going to
go to clone or download I'm going to
copy this particular this URL and I'm
going to go to terminal this is
something that I did in a previous
tutorial if you need to go back and look
at that and I'm going to say first of
all just so you know I'm on the desktop
of my computer and I'm going to say git
clone so we can see now that here is
that you can see there are the files one
thing for you to remember if I say
no telling me I am on branch gh-pages so
if I ever want to get updated changes
get pull normally we were saying things
like git pull origin master no longer is
there a master branch so I have to
remember if I'd use any of these other
git commands to always use gh-pages okay
so there you go that's the basics of it
you can put image files anything that
you can do in a webpage you can put into
this repository you can add stuff you
can commit stuff your whole webpage is
there online for anyone to work to see
and for you to work with through the
through the git platform what I'm going
to do in the next video for those of you
who might have come to this series by
working with something called p5.js is
I'm going to show you how to actually
take a code example something that has
HTML CSS and JavaScript and host that
with github pages which actually be
quite simple but I'm just going to put
that in a separate video because it does
involve programming and source code but
you can actually just still just with
this video put a text file or some basic
HTML online okay thanks for watching and
let me know what questions you have in
