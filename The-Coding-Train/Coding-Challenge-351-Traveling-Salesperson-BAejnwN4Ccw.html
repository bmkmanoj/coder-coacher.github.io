challenge in this coding challenge I'm
going to explore the traveling
salesperson algorithm it's a classical
algorithm that you'll find from kind of
this thing known as computer science I
want to talk about what the algorithm is
I want to build a quick JavaScript
example to demonstrate how to kind of
program the problem and then I'm going
to do a several follow-up videos to look
at different solutions to that's
particular problem and for you the
viewer I want you to think about what
are some creative applications could you
make some kind of interesting line
drawing visual art with it could you
create a musical system could you use it
for some sort of data visualization
scientific simulation creative project
in your field of interest so I hope that
you'll watch these videos get the
example code play with it and make an
application with it and share that
application with me which I might share
then with other people but whatever
that's not the point the point is let's
talk about this algorithm so this is
currently a processing sketch I'm going
to program this in JavaScript which is
true checking every single possible
solution to what so let me walk the
traveling salesperson so you know I
think that a Pokemon go within the
future some many years from now and
somebody's watch this video poke event
goes the most irrelevant thing it'll be
so annoying to watch this but the
problem is let's say you have a space
and this could be a two-dimensional or
three-dimensional or an n-dimensional
space but we're gonna work or the
two-dimensional space and the problem is
usually framed as they're a bunch of
cities so here are several city a map of
a bunch of cities or perhaps they're a
map of a bunch of pokemons that you want
to catch but you're a salesperson and
you want to go sell your you know coding
rainbow stickers or t-shirts or whatever
in every city so you know I could go
here and then I could go here and then I
could go over here and then it could
take the Train here and I could fly here
and I could go here and I could go here
you can see that would be a path that
hits every single city but it wouldn't
be the shortest path and I could try to
eyeball it and this might be an
interesting application by the way idea
what if you build a computer algorithmic
system solving the optimal fastest
solution and you have it compete with a
person trying to draw that solution that
could be an interesting interactive
exhibit but you know we could try to say
like oh well maybe the optimal solution
is something like this
but you know that's just kind of a guess
so we don't have to guess I could go
back over here and this is a program
that checked every single possible
solution for and this is 12 points so
you might think big deal how many
possible ways are there to explore how
many possible ways are there to connect
12 points well there's actually quite a
few and it and let's kind of explore
that for a second so let's say there are
only three points and the points are a B
and C well let's look at all the
possible ways a b c a c b b a c b:c a
I'm doing this in a specific order for a
reason which will become relevant in a
future video c a b c b a and if I did
this correctly these are actually sorted
in alphabetical order which is a kind of
piece of this that's going to come up as
I explore this further so you can see
did I do this right there are three
possibilities and there there are three
cities or three Pokemon there are one
two three four five six six
possibilities so the way you can
actually calculate how many
possibilities is 3 times 2 times 1 which
is also known as 3 factorial and why is
that
because there are there are 3
possibilities for the first let for the
first letter and with each one of those
there are 2 possibilities for the second
and for each one of those there's one
possibility for the third so actually if
you were to if there are 12 points there
are 12 factorial possible ways of
connecting all of those dots which if
you pull up your calculator is a really
really big number and when you would go
to 13 it's a really big number so
actually like if I change this program
right now to try to use like 20 points
watch how slowly it's going to complete
all the possibilities we are going to be
here till the dawn till the time the Sun
envelops the earth we we won't be alive
then I guess but you know you get the
point this is going to take a really
long time and if I even just go let's
just go from 12 to 13 just
this point a little bit more explicit
you can see now come on computer you can
see that it's still checking all the
possibilities but even just to get to
one percent of the possibilities is
taking quite a while and this is a
program that's written in Java that's
running relatively fast okay so um
people in the chat are posting the
answers to these factorial questions I'm
glad because I don't have them I don't
have those numbers in my head
so now let's let's start to program how
do we think about this program in a
visual simulation of this idea in a
visual simulation so I'm going to move
out of processing you'll be able to get
this Java based processing code also in
this video's description but I'm going
to quit processing here I'm gonna don't
save that and I'm gonna work in the
browser which admittedly JavaScript
html5 kit this is not the place where
you're going to find your greatest power
and speed from your computer but it's a
place that we can kind of explore this
idea and so what I have here is a simple
JavaScript program it makes a canvas and
it has a draw loop so what I'm going to
do is I'm going to create an array and
I'm going to call that array cities but
this could be anything please think more
creatively what are the what are the
things in your world that you need to
find a pathway through and then what I'm
going to do is I'm going to say let's
just have three just to be simple about
this I'm going to have three cities I'm
gonna say cities index cities index I
equals create vector and I'm going to
create a random vector and I'm going to
do this as a separate line of code
random with random height so a vector is
just an object in p5.js I mean it's you
know the concept extends beyond p5.js
but that stores an x and y position it
does more than that but that's what
we're using it for and so I want to
create a bunch of those and then I just
want to see those points in the window
so I'm going to do that same exact loop
but I'm going to say here cities dot
length and I'm going to actually make
that a variable like total cities so
it's something we can vary equals three
and then instead and then what I want to
do is say I want to draw a circle at
cities index
a dot X city's index i dot y we'll make
it circle 4x4 pixels will say fill 255
so it's white and I just want a little
bit more room to write my code and then
I'm gonna hit refresh here whoops it
refresh here and you can see there are
three cities picked randomly refresh the
page I get three random cities so and
you can see here you know if I just now
go and say total cities 20 now I have 20
but I want to work with a small number
so I can sort of visually see that
things are working okay am i recording
this yes excellent all right so um let's
go back to three cities let's make these
a little bit bigger so you can see them
and let's also whoops let's make this a
little bit bigger and it can make the
Consul a little bit smaller okay so now
what I want to do is start exploring
possible orders well I have an order
already actually the order that I have
is in this cities array so I could sort
of say this is an order and what I might
actually do beyond just draw those
cities is draw a path between them so
I'm going to say a begin shape and shape
and instead of drawing a circle at each
point I'm going to say vertex cities X Y
and I'm going to say a stroke 255 I'm
just a stroke weight - just to give it a
little bit of thickness so it's a little
easier to see I'm also going to say no
fill and so now I'm going to run this
and we can see there we go now I just
realize I know what I want to do is
shuffle the array so what I want to do
is I want to try these are now I'm
getting I'm getting random every time i
refresh but what I want to do in draw in
that draw loop is I want to shuffle that
array to try different random orders so
how do I do that so I have a feeling if
I go and look up the Mozilla
documentation for the array object in
JavaScript there might be a kind of
function as part of the array prototype
well what's a prototype did I just say
prototype in a video but in other words
when I say prototype prototype being
this sort of like thing that is in
charge of every array
it's ever made ever in JavaScript and
there are some functions that I've
explored in other videos like remove or
splice or push that allow you to
manipulate that array I'm wondering if
there's one that's called shuffle
whether or not there is I'm going to
write my own function so I'm going to
write a function and I'm actually going
to call it swap not shuffle and you'll
see what it's going to do in a second it
needs an array and it needs to into
index things so something that's going
to be very useful in just about every
scenario that I explore the traveling
salesperson is this idea of a swamp and
this comes up all the time in different
things you might want to program and do
so in other words a swap is if I have an
array that says ABC what if I want to
pick two random elements like oh this
one and this one and I want to swap
their position so now the array is CB
and I might use this if I do this with a
genetic algorithm as later as a mutation
so the mutation of a path through all
the cities is swapping to ranch cities
randomly so let's look at how I might do
that and I am going to say well so what
you would think you might do is say a
index I equals a index J and a index J
equals a index I right this is the idea
of a swaps a index I this is the idea of
taking an array and swapping two
elements right put the element number
three at element zero and put element
number zero at element three the problem
is if I set a index J equal to a index I
I just reset I and excitable J so I'm
actually setting a index J to itself so
in order to perform a swap I need to say
this actually I need to have some
temporary variable which is holds a
index I so I keep track of what a index
I is and then later once I replace a
index I with J and then J could be equal
to temp so this is just a really simple
really simple algorithm for taking two
elements of the array and swapping them
and let's look at what happens now if
what I do every time through draw at the
end is I say swap cities and then oh I
need two random index indices so I'm
going to say I equals floor random
city's length and J is also a random
value so I'm gonna swap I and J and of
course I you know I'm not guaranteeing
that I don't pick the same one and swap
an M with itself but big deal it's going
to do this a bunch of times let's run
this program again and you can see you
know with three things there's not a lot
of order possibilities but if I make
this total Cities ten you can see now
you can see how elements are being
swapped and so it's doing this very fast
but I'm exploring a whole lot of
possibilities okay so now what can I do
what I want to do just just kind of
explore this in a brute-force way is as
I'm trying all these different
possibilities I want to calculate what
is the distance traveled through this
particular order and if that distance is
the best one I've gotten so far let's
save it so let's do that as the
following so one thing I need to do I
think it might be useful to write a
function that calculates the distance
between every point in an array so I'm
going to write another function down
here at the bottom and I'm going to call
this function calc distance and it's
going to get a list of points all right
so I'm getting a function it gets an
array of points and the whole point of
this function is now to return the total
distance between all those points in the
order that they are so I need some sort
of sum that starts at zero I need a loop
where I start at zero I go all the way
through the length of that array and I
say what so if this is my this is my
order I want to know this distance Plus
this distance Plus this distance Plus
this distance so I always want to know
the distance between I and I plus 1 and
then this becomes I and this becomes I
plus 1 etc etc so if I come back here
I'm going to say var D equals distance
between points index I X points index I
Y points index i + 1 dot X
points index i + 1 dot y okay and then
I'm going to add that sum + equals D and
then I'm just going to return the sum so
by the way this is a function in p5 that
calculates the distance for you between
two points so I'm giving it points index
I X&amp;amp;Y points index i + 1 x + y so that
should be that is now later i'm going to
optimize this because this is actually
going to be kind of a slow operation to
calculate distance and there's a way
later that i mean i could speed this up
but when i'm trying to do this zillions
and gazillions of times
speeding it up could be a good thing ok
now what i'm going to do is i'm going to
say i want to have a variable called
record distance now so the first thing i
want to do is whatever order this array
is calculated first i want to know
calc distance of cities right calculate
the distance for this array cities and
then the record distance is that first
distance so i'm going to try and again a
random set of points i'm going to get a
distance between those and that's my
best so far
then remember down here i did a swap so
I shuffled it around so once I did a
swap let's calculate that distance again
of cities and then if that distance is
less than the record distance then
record distance equals that distance so
this is me just checking all like
randomly swapping things around this
again is not going to be an efficient
algorithm for solving the traveling
salesperson I'm building it this way
just to show what the problem is and how
kind of impossible it is to find that
optimal solution with a certain number
of points so what I want to do here is
just say console whoops what I want to
say is console dot log record distance
so we can kind of look at these values
as I'm finding them so let's run this
program now oops
sketch j/s line 55 what
mistake did I make points okay
again a list of points ah of course I
meant to I made this mistake on purpose
and because I wanted to correct it later
and then I forgot about it
so what's the problem here remember I'm
checking in the array element I and the
next one I plus one so I can't go to the
end of the array if I go to the end of
the array there's no I plus one there's
no element after the end of the array I
don't actually care because that's the
end of my journey that's the end of my
traveling to catch all my pokemon or
whatever I'm doing later somebody will
dub this video over with whatever is to
do a thing like um never mind I don't
know what the newest thing will be won't
be Pokemon it'll be cool about that huh
okay so I need to add a minus 1 here so
I don't go to the last one ok now we can
see I'm getting these nice so far
I had a distance of 105 which was the
record and at some point it got a
distance of 76 and then they got a
distance of 19 pixels through all of
those points that seems kind of insane
to me not unless I don't know if we're
ever going to beat that record in a
while so let's run this one more time
and see like yeah so you can see this
optimizing I'm not saving what that
optimal what that optimal path is so
that's the next step that I want to look
at so I might need your help in the chat
here I'm not really a JavaScript
programmer that's a confession I have to
make to you and I know I feel like in
the let's look actually so there must be
a way I went what did one thing I want
to do is make a copy of an array I'm
going to need to be able to do that
because if I have an array with an
ordered list of vectors I want to be
able to like save a version of that if
it's a really good one and I could write
my own function to copy an array and I'm
kind of tempted just do that to know
that it works but let's let's take a
minute in this video to and somebody in
the chat will oh did I forget return
some oh thank you no wonder this is a
big bug I just had by the way somebody
in the chat just mentioned another bug
where I was returning D which makes no
sense at all because I'm just returning
the last distance which of course Y that
value didn't make any sense so return
sum is correct let's run this again to
take a
look at it there we go these values make
much more sense right so you can see
like it's you know thousands of pixels
between all these points and you can see
that the best one that I've gotten so
far okay so I'm running that now let me
go back to what I was doing is I'm going
to go to a mozilla developer dock array
something like this I'm googling that to
get to here and what I want to look for
is like what are all of the available
functions things that I've used I've
used push which is a function in array
that adds an element to an array reverse
whoo I might need to use reverse later
on shift oh there's so many things I
might use but I'm looking for one I
think slice might do this for me the
slice method returns a shallow copy of a
portion of an array into a new array
object
let's explore if this is what's going to
work for me so I'm just going to go over
here this is how I like to figure things
out I'm going to go into the console
here while this is running I'm just
going to make an array that's like 1 5 6
and I'm going to look at that array it's
1 5 6 now I want to say B equals a dot
slice what does that give me B is also 1
5 6
that's good that's what I need what if I
say now B index 2 equals 7 1 5 7 and a
is still 1 5 6 so this should work for
me and I believe shallow means because
I'm actually not putting numbers in
there I'm actually gonna put a raise and
sorry vectors in there that though those
it will copy the vectors it just going
to copy the array and that's exactly
what I want because I want to keep that
same list of vectors it's just the
arrays are pointing to the same vector
object but in a different position in
the array so this is going to work
poor perfectly for me so hopefully I got
that explanation right things are gonna
work people in chat are giving me good
advice about shallow copy I might have
messed up that explanation I'll correct
it as I continue to talk in this video
you yes you are watching a video of a
person teaching about programming who
really does not know what he's doing
okay so let's come back and let's say
what I want to do is I'm going to say
best-ever
and what I want to say here is
uh best you know you know there was a
show that I used to watch back when I
watch television we don't have time for
anymore which was called best week ever
so this is best
I guess that's from you know there's the
whole Simpsons thing best anyway
whatever never my best cities path ever
is cities to start and then every time I
find a record oh no it's uh I want to
actually say dot slice I want a copy of
it and then every time I get a record I
want to say best ever is city's slice so
just to see if this is working what I
want to do is I want to draw the path
twice I want to draw the current cities
and I want to draw the best ever and I'm
going to make the best ever thicker and
some pinkish purplish color and I'm to
make the current cities thinner and
white so let's run this yeah this is
working so I think it's I believe this
is doing what I wanted to do which is
just randomly swapping things and every
time we can look here and see that oh I
took the print line out but you can see
the pink path is currently the best path
that it's got now with ten points I can
see here like this is no good
like over here this part is like
terrible because look at that crossing I
could easily myself just design like go
here I can't I can't do this like this
people who do the weather on television
are like so good at this I could go here
then I could go here then I could go
there than anyway you could see how you
could easily design a more efficient
path so this isn't going to get us that
most efficient path that's what future
videos that I'm going to go into the
next steps are going to explore but
let's just see that this program is
working by just having four points
because I think we can probably visually
see that looks like the best path
between those four points saying there
it looks like it's kind of finding it
rather quickly right you can kind of
imagine you know arguably is it going to
be better I don't think so but you can
see it's going to randomly kind of try
every possibility with just four points
rather quickly we can even try five
cities and you can see that it's kind of
finding it so you know you know if I
slow this
down if I draw it more artistically if I
allow the user to interact with it by
adding points and that's sort of an
interesting thing right
DRI I don't you know these are might be
some things that you can explore so I'm
kind of finished with this first video
demonstrating the traveling's know what
the Bell does but it's a thing with this
traveling salesperson problem in the
next video
what I'm going to do is show you how to
not just randomly swap points to try a
bunch of different possibilities but
actually sort an array of numbers with
every single possible permutation so we
can actually just try every single
possibility in order which I think has
some kind of interesting creative
applications to it as well so I'm going
to do that in the next next video okay
so thanks for watching this one and the
the next video will follow up on this
okay
talk to you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
