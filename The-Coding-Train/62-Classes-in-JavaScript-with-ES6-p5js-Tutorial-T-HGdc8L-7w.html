for me I don't know if this is an
exciting moment for you this is the
video where I am going to talk about
object-oriented programming in
JavaScript using something called
classes for the very first time ever in
any of my videos so this video is part
of a playlist and if you're watching
that playlist what you just learned
about is functions and you might have
done something where you first use
functions to reorganize your code and
you said okay I have some code which
draws a circle and I have some code
which moves a circle so I'm changing
some X Y variables and draw drawing an
ellipse at some X Y variables and then I
put those into these own functions call
them display call them move and I could
call them and draw so I've organized my
code and I even have this thing I kind
of had this thing called an object it's
a JavaScript literal object meaning I'm
saying I literally want an object with
an X and a Y so I can see those up there
and so the thing is I got distract you
for a second the thing is this isn't
really this was a nice way to learn
about how to declare and define your own
functions and there are reasons why you
might want to do that you're gonna see
those in many future videos just sort of
standalone functions that exist unto
themselves and in fact there is a style
of programming called functional
programming which JavaScript is
well-suited for because functions are
kind of like the core building block of
JavaScript but I am going to do take a
different direction here because in
particular if what I want to do is
program graphics simulations animations
things moving around the screen one way
to do that is to think about this circle
moving around as an object now I'm
already thinking about it as an object
it's a bubble it's got an X and a Y it
has data but I want to think about it as
having functionality it can move it can
be displayed I want to I want to say
things like in addition bubble dot move
bubble dot display this is ultimately
how I want to write my code and I'm kind
of wondering why display there is being
syntax highlighted it's
probably like a keyword or something in
JavaScript somewhere else I'm gonna just
change that to show what I want to do is
I want to write code where I'd write
where I create these objects and I issue
commands on them and the reason why I
want to do that is because well
ultimately ultimately uh I changed the
code and I won't run again this is not
going well
what I want to do if I could think about
this thing moving around on the screen
as an object then I can maybe make a
second bubble and a third bubble so I
have to think conceptually about what
I'm doing so I think what's gonna be
helpful actually is if I come over here
hello to you too and talk about this
with the whiteboard so the one of them
there's a couple of different principles
I talked about with functions that
there's some principles behind why you
might use functions you can make your
code modular or you can make your code
reusable this is also true of
object-oriented programming but one of
the first key principles of
object-oriented programming is this idea
of encapsulation I want to encapsulate
everything that it is to be a certain
thing inside of an object what does it
mean to be a bubble what is there what
do bubbles have what properties do they
have what things do they do throughout
their life I want to encapsulate all of
that into something and the idea of
using something called a class in
JavaScript we can think of a class
another way to think of it is the word
template I think is appropriate or the
word blueprint is also appropriate the
class which is a new block of code that
I'm going to ask you to write if you
choose to follow this these tutorials is
this idea of encapsulating that goes in
between the open curly bracket and the
close curly bracket is everything that
it means to be a bubble what does it
mean we're gonna find out what does it
mean to be a bubble all that will go in
there so that in my main program which
has set up and draw I don't have to
write the code for the bubble I could
just do things to create bubbles I could
say things like bubble
equals new and I think I'm gonna go off
the whiteboard here something to write
this down here new bubble so there's a
new keyword which ironically as is new
new is a key word that means to create
an object we're gonna see what that
actually really refers to in a second
and then as my animation continues
throughout the draw loop I can see say
things like bubble dot float dark pop or
dot move or whatever whatever commands
these are functions that are somehow
part of the object objects the idea of
encapsulation is to encapsulate the idea
of data and functionality into an object
so for example I had this weird little
JavaScript literal object this is an
object that has data in it it has an X
value and a Y value and actually I mean
if I really wanted to I could do this
this is something you'll see I probably
shouldn't show this to you I'm not I
don't really do this that often but it's
totally reasonable I can only put a
function in there that way you know this
is this is the thing welcome to your
life there are 15 different ways to do
everything in JavaScript and also this
video will be out of date by the time
you watch it because they'll be a
different way that people are doing now
but I'm just trying to keep with the
times and I think classes are a nice way
they're a way that I am now choosing to
create objects in JavaScript so let me
come back over here a class is the idea
of the template this is the template you
can think of this at it you know this is
a bit of a this is not my invention here
but one way of thinking about this is
the class is the cookie cutter the
object itself this is the object also
often referred to as an instance this is
the thing itself this is the template
this described there is no bubble here
this just describes what does it mean to
be a bubble this is the actual bubble I
make a new bubble based on what it means
to be a bubble am I saying the same
thing over and over again I am but I'm
hoping this helps make this make sense
to you
so object instances instance object
template cookie cutter is like the thing
you used to make the actual cookies so
this is the cookie and this is the
cookie cutter so now that that hopefully
makes some sense to you the next point
of discussion is what goes inside the
class how do we write the class
okay so first let me just apologize I
had a little technical glitch where I
drew stuff out of your viewpoint in the
previous video I'm hoping that by the
time you're watching this I figured out
some nice magic to make it make sense or
redid this video and you're not even
watching this because I don't have to
say this but we'll see but I'm going to
go on and what I want to do in this
video is now talk about we really need
to like hopefully that the first video
helped you understand the concept behind
object-oriented programming in a very
simple and basic way and now what I need
to do is look at the actual syntax how
do I write the class how do I make
object instances and how do I use them
so let's let me I guess I should be over
here
so what is the syntax of writing the
actual class what is the syntax of
making actual object instances okay
where should we start so I keep saying
that not I keep saying I said before
there was this new keyword called do and
what new does is it creates an object
instance it says hey make a new instance
of an object that's defined inside of a
class called bubble so I know I want to
make a bubble which is something I made
up this is a made-up name for a class
but what cut what actually happens do
what I call a function when I say
something like you know draw a robot I
look for a function called draw robot
that draws the robot this new keyword
actually says execute a function but
it's a special kind of function it's a
function to create an object or actually
maybe let me use a different word
construct it's a function to construct
an object and so the first thing that I
need to write and I need to write this
that might work without it but I really
need to write this in every class that I
make is constructor so I actually
declare a function
called constructor it is written just
like I don't have to say function by
definition it is a function so it's just
like any old function definition it's a
function definition inside the class and
in here this is kind of like the objects
setup so we think of setup and draw in
our code like in p5 setup is where I
initialize everything draws where I
animate stuff and loop over and over
again the clad the constructor is like
the objects setup so I'm defining again
what does it mean to be a bubble now I'm
getting more specific what does it mean
to be the first moments when the bubble
is formed that first baby bubble it
comes out of the bubble making machine
and what is what happens so in this case
I'm just gonna say x equals 100 y equals
100 so this isn't correct yet so don't
yell at me if you know about how this
works I need to add something to this
but this is the idea I want to declare
remember objects are a collection of
data and functionality so this is where
I say this is all the data that has to
do with this particular bubble this
particular bubble has an x and a y now
here's the thing and nowhere in here did
I declare var X or let X to be which
video to JavaScript by the way as two
different ways of declaring variables
that I'm kind of using let now but I
probably use the bar to previous video I
hate that this is happening but it's
happening but I didn't actually declare
the variable so in what's weird here is
that I don't actually declare it in the
way that I previously had so something
that happens here when I say new bubble
is there's a new object instance and I
need to like actually say this is a
variable that I want to attach this is a
variable that is a property of that
object and so the way that I do this and
this absolutely this I'm awkwardly
saying this because the thing that I've
been right here is actually this this
dot X this dot Y this is a keyword in
JavaScript that can mean a lot of
different things and over time in future
videos I will use it for
variety of different purposes but for
right now the this keyword is a
reference to the current object instance
it doesn't exist right this is a
template so I'm saying in theory if I
would ever use this template to make an
actual instance of a bubble that
instance that's being made I'll just
call this out here the instance that's
being made has a variable name called
bubble I declared it let bubble I mean I
said let bubble I might have said bar
but I'm saying let let bubble bubble is
a new bubble that's the object instance
that's the real object it says this is
the theoretical object instance and then
when I say new bubble this code actually
happens that actual bubble is created
this and bubble point to the same thing
but the nice thing is I can use this
template for any object I create because
this is a generic term to refer to
whatever it is I happen to be making at
the moment so that's the idea so let's
go let's start writing this code and
just let's put this in this this this
dot this dot you know I'm talking about
right this is good if this dot is the
bane of your existence now welcome to
your life ok so I'm going to get rid of
this I just have this idea right of a
bubble and I'm gonna change it to say
let and I'm gonna say bubble equals new
bubble we're gonna comment out
everything and draw because I don't have
anything yet I don't even wanna I'm
gonna comment all this out because
anybody use it later but the idea now is
that I want to write the class now where
I define the class can kind of be
anywhere and I might show you a way of
organizing stuff in two different files
at some point but I'm gonna write class
bubble open curly bracket close curly
bracket now I'm gonna create that
constructor like this I'm gonna say this
dot x equals you know 5 100 200 this dot
y equals 150 and I'm just going to say
print line X double dot X double dot Y
and it's not println anymore in p5 it's
just print which is the same
console dot log but that's a bit of a
decide so now I'm gonna run this and I'm
gonna see look at that 200 comma 1 200
150 and actually one thing I can do just
to kind of I can actually in this
interactive console that I'm using in
Chrome I can actually just type bubble
and look and see look now I have an
object it's a type bubble and it has two
properties x and y so that's what we've
done we have made a constructor in the
bubble object we can create new object
instances and there they are
so the next step now is we can't
actually do anything the goal here is I
want to write nice elegant easy to read
code where I say things like now I want
this bubble to move now I want this
bubble to show and ultimately I'm going
to do things like let bubble 1 let
bubble 2 and again I know some of you
might have just watched the previous
video where I used a bar some day web
saying this it won't matter and the
aliens will have figured it out - like
dub over my voice in a way that makes
all this make sense but for now I've got
music laugh music laugh so I ultimately
I want to be able to make multiple
objects we're going to look at this
thing called an array in future videos
but we haven't gotten all the way
through right the only thing I've put
inside of this class is the constructor
and I've I've initialized and I've did
I've set I've I've I've I've specified
the data for this particular bubble what
it is to be a bubble is to have an X
into y so now what I need to do is add
the functionality if I know I want to
say at some point bubble dot move what I
want to say here is move so this is how
I declare a function of piece of
functionality inside the bubble class
this is what it means for a bubble to
move notice I don't have to say function
here so classes the functions that are
part of the bubble template I do not do
are by definition functions I don't have
to say functions and then what do I want
for the bubble to move I want to change
its exit its Y so can I just say x
equals x plus something 2
it's X know who say it with me this dot
this dot this dot it's so hard to
remember but inside of the template
inside of the class I'm referring to the
variables the data that's part of a
bubble object I need to refer to it as
this dot X and this dot X so let's go
now add that to our program so I'm going
to add a function called move and I'm
just going to do it and by the way what
do I want to do in this I want to do
exactly what I did in the previous
example and I'm just gonna take this and
put it up here the difference is and
weirdly I'm gonna do something this is
horrible I should not and and I'm let's
do show at the same time why not I don't
have to do them one at a time
I feel I'm feeling confident I'm gonna
do this and then I'm gonna take all this
code from that show function and I'm
gonna put it up here inside this show
function and then I'm gonna delete this
stuff down here and now I have
everything whoops I need to uncomment it
and I have everything for my class can I
fit it all in one screen KY yes again
perfect look at this so this this is
wrong avert your eyes don't don't don't
implant this into your brain just yet
but this is weirdly gonna work so we
should be done in a way right I made
this i made this bubble class i have a
bubble object and it sort of worked by
accident it worked because i have this
global variable called bubble and it's
the only bubble in the world but the
template the blueprint should not refer
to a specific bubble this won't work as
soon as i try to add a second object
this bubble this template needs to use
this stock so all of the X and the y
needs to refer to bubble next one now
here it is take this implant into your
brain this is I you know I should
mention there are lots of other features
of things I could do in here there's
these things called gathers and senders
and there's extends I'm gonna get to
that eventually or maybe never because
this is this is a good start the basic
idea is to find the template the class
define a constructor which specifies how
that object is initialized
and then add whatever functionality you
want and then the world is your oyster
to make bubble one Bubble to bubble one
Bubble to bubble one move show bubble to
move show so look at that there are now
two on the screen and I didn't have to
change anything about the class the
class is a generic template it knows
nothing about where it might be used or
how it might be applied it's just the
template so this is a way of defining
objects and it's gonna you know this is
also this is no good because this works
for two but eventually I'm gonna want to
have a hundred and I'm gonna get to that
in a future video and there's lots
there's some other missing pieces here
and that'll be in the next video but for
now if you're watching this here's an
exercise to do for yourself find a
sketch you made that had some thing in
it okay kind of a simple thing thing
moving around the screen maybe you
didn't use objects in it at all try to
encapsulate everything that has to do
with that object into a class what are
the properties that are part of that you
know if you're making a rainbow the
properties are the colors potentially I
don't know or it's positioned on the
screen what are the what's its
functionality it can appear it could
disappear it can shine and glow whatever
it can whatever it does make those
functions try to create one object
instance and operate it and then see if
you can create a second object instance
now you might have a problem we're both
of your objects you make two but they do
exactly the same thing so you can't
actually see that there are two and
that's the thing that I want to address
in the next video this idea of kind of
hard coding these values so that every
single bubble always starts at the same
place is someone problematic and I'm
going to address that with something
called arguments or parameters to the
constructor so that's what I'll do in
the next video make your objects share
them with me and I'll see you in a
future video unless I'm gonna still be
here in a second because I might have
got
we're gonna have to correct it okay I
didn't perfectly nobody in the chat is
telling me that I did anything horribly
wrong in this video tutorial i maybe
I'll hear from you in the comments but I
will see you in the next video where I
talk about constructor arguments
