videos as if you're taking a weekly
course here's an assignment that you can
do so one thing is the coding challenge
that I just did in a way I think that's
your assignment come up with a creative
way to interact with individual words in
a larger body of text and think about
how you might use regular expressions
with us so how do you match what do you
what are you looking for what are you
matching how are you replacing that sort
of thing the other thing though you
might really do is if you did the
previous assignment about sort of text
mashup without regular expressions or
you simply did it manually your
assignment would be to do that now with
programming with algorithms with regular
expressions I also have a few ideas here
that I've written up are things you
might think about you know the flesh
index calculator I made as an example I
didn't use regular expressions for it if
you rewrote it with regular expressions
that would certainly make it probably
more efficient or be a good exercise and
using regular expressions I'm thinking
about how you could translate a text
using the replace method the pirate
translator which takes hello my name is
Dan and turns it to do a hoary matey
dan my name is you could think about
using as using a regular expression to
do that and also you might simply look
around making a game that you play with
regular expressions so the regex golf
game is something you can actually play
there's a regex crossword game that it's
not linked here but you up try to add to
the to this page that will be linked in
the description of this video and yeah
so you could do something like that it
may be write up a blog post or something
about you know how it was working with
write of expressions what worked for you
what didn't work for you what questions
you have and I'll review those questions
and things and reactions to regular
expressions in next week's live stream
where I also look at data okay so enjoy
I hope some of you do this assignment
you can share it with me in the slack if
you subscribed as a patron or you can
simply just tweet at me or share it in
the comments here okay thanks for
watching and see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
