missing pieces in our search for the
meaning functions in JavaScript but and
so this video I want to fill in one
little gap here and I want to look at
what it means for a function to return a
value and what's the syntax for that and
why you might want to use that now this
would be kind of like a short video I'm
just going to kind of really lay out the
the quick syntax of it and I'm hope that
in future videos this scenario of
needing a function that returns value
will come up a bit more often and then
it will make more sense in a kind of
more involved context but let's just
sort of see how this goes for a second
so I think to begin the discussion the
best way to begin the discussion is to
look at these two fun
functions that are part of the p5
library there's the ellipse function and
there's the random function okay what's
the difference there's a lot of
differences between these two functions
but what's a key difference between
these two functions ellipse draws an
ellipse in the window random provides a
random number between a range between a
minimum and a maximum and so I say
provides what I really mean is it
returns a value it evaluates to a number
when the random function finishes
executing its hands back this answer and
that answer is often used to you know
it's stored in a variable or it's used
you know you might use it a fill random
255 right this is using the random
function to pick a random number between
0 to 255 and use it instantly inside of
this fill function to set a color
ellipse does not evaluate to anything it
just draws a circle and finishes and
this is that distinction random is a
function that returns a number so what
does it mean these functions are in the
p5 library they were written by somebody
and this function was written with a new
kind of line of code that line of code
has returned something so let's look at
the syntax for that and I'm going to
kind of just make up a somewhat of a
silly scenario and I'll will just reveal
the quick exam
that does this but so the syntax for
defining a function is function the name
of the function that's something that
you make up the parameters to the
function that's also something that you
make up open curly braket in n curly
bracket and then the code that goes
inside the function so this is whatever
code you want to be and typically if a
function returns a value that returns
statement this new statements going to
come at the end of the function now
there's exceptions to this of course but
here is the new line of code return
something you know that's the question
you know what goes there so this looks
just like our the definition of a
function that we wrote a flower function
before function flower with some
arguments it drew some stuff to the
screen now this is the same but we're
adding a new line of code return so
let's think about conversion so this is
oh boy this camera keeps shutting off um
hopefully this will fix it hello I'm
back okay so let's think about a
converting number so something you can
do in p5 that comes up quite often is
you know you have an angle and you want
to know what its value in degrees is I
don't think I've talked about ankles in
any of these videos maybe I have I
talked about it in class but let's just
look at this for a second oh boy this is
a bad example of so if you're not
familiar there are two ways of thinking
about angles one is degrees zero degrees
90 degrees 180 degrees these are common
degrees
another is radians so ratings is a unit
of measurement for angles pi divided by
two radians is ninety degrees so what
this function should do is it should
take the value pi divided by two convert
it from radians to degrees and we should
see 9t print out down here and by the
way let's hopefully I'm going to get
this right so and you can see that
that's what we got here so this function
converts a number to another unit of
measurement
and provides that and prints it out so
the thing is let's look at something
different something that's not in p5
let's say what you want to do is you
have you know a marathon is a twenty six
point three or four I don't know I can't
remember six point three something like
that miles so I want to have a function
I want to know how many kilometers is
that so I need a function that converts
that number from miles to kilometers so
if I run this of course we get uncaught
reference air miles to kilometers is not
defined because that doesn't exist so
it's up to us now
to write to define that function so how
do we define a function okay what
function the name of the function and
then whatever the parameters are one
parameter is miles so when that function
is called 26.3 will get sent into that
miles variable the parameter to the
function and then what's the formula
miles times 1.6 so you know I don't know
if that's 100% accurate but one mile to
one point six kilometers you know it's
one point six point zero something like
that but you get the idea this is a very
simple formula to convert and now we
have the answer the numb the kilometers
is miles times 1.6 all we need to do is
say return km so this is this new line
of code return a value that means when
this function finishes executing up here
it will evaluate to a number and so
let's look at this and now we can we can
do it again km 2 you know what is a
ultramarathon I don't know what an
ultramarathon is 100 miles you know so
I'm you know so we're looking at this
function twice so we can see twenty six
point three miles is forty two point
zero eight something something something
kilometers and say 100 miles is 160
kilometers so this is how a function can
return a value now
you might as an exercise just come up
with some other type of conversion you
know Celsius to Fahrenheit is a good one
it has a bit more of a complex
don't look it up online to be honest I
can never remember to do anything I
would put it in the description for this
video and you know the weight your
weight on you know the moon versus earth
is another thing you could think about
kilograms to Palam there's so many good
you know dollars to some other currency
so you come up with some kind of
conversion formula maybe try to
implement this function that would be
something I think you could try what I
want to do in the next video that I'm
going to make a start looking at how
functions can be inside of objects and
in that case I think there's another
scenario that I want to demonstrate
which is having a function let me think
about this for a second if you have an
object and you want to know if the mouse
is on top of it could the object itself
have a function that sends you back true
or false
based on whether the mouse is over that
object or not so that's what I'm
thinking about this wasn't the best I've
ever made but hopefully it kind of
succinctly just least gives you a sense
of the syntax and how it works and I'm
going to hit stop now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
