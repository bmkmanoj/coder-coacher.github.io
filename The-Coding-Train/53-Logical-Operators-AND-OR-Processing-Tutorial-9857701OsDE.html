watch the previous yeah other still is a
complete disaster
so what I'm going to try to do at this
point is make this really short just
talk about one simple topic it's going
to be like I didn't I'm going to turn
the clock on clock is now going we could
see it when we try to give this like
three or four minutes simple topic we're
going to discuss it going to make one
quick example the video will be go over
Apple is my train of thought I'm gonna
like keep the energy going and you're
gonna really it's going to be great okay
here we go
today's topic for this particular video
is logical operators so what have we
just been doing it you know the previous
video I actually made this example but I
talked for so long the cameras like
Larry Bird for 12 minutes they cut off
but I got to this point where we made
this nice example where what we're
saying here is ah
if mouse X is greater than 500 draw a
red background 400 yellow background
let's see where are we going in here ah
who paint this beautiful pink background
it's 300 blue 200 and in all other cases
green so we learned about how we can
have an if statement whether condition
is met execute that code we can join an
if statement with else if saying if this
is true otherwise if this is true and
else tells us in all the cases do this
and I probably don't need to recap the
previous video because in most cases
you'll just been watching it but I'm
going to figure that out eventually it
will make sense and there's redo all
these okay but there's one more piece so
this is actually everything you need to
know to design the logic of your program
is right here in this example if else if
it else you basically with variables and
conditionals you could program
absolutely anything you know we're going
to introduce a lot of things to make
this better and it's already been a min
and a half of us at three minutes I'm
going to get back to this logical
operators what we're talking about we're
going a lot of operators
and and or because sometimes we want to
say things like if I'm hungry and it's
evening have dinner if I'm hungry and
it's morning have breakfast right so we
want to be able to join two boolean
expressions if they're both true do this
if only one of them is true do this if
only one of them is true that is or by
the way there's something called
exclusive or try to go I bring this up
right now but it's kind of interesting
exclusive or means they can't both be
true just one of them true so maybe you
need that for something but let's just
not worry about that right now there's
nothing to do with anything at the end
no solvent of a business we watch these
but why are you mention XOR okay it's
like talk about double buffering or
something like that here we go and then
or what what how do we say that so what
if I have an a boolean expression and I
want to know if this point expression is
true and this boolean expression is true
then execute the code that's in here
well you might be thinking oh you could
just write the word and there that might
be nice that would sort of make sense
and would look right and since matches
with the logic what we're talking about
the thing about processing is it's built
on this language called Java which many
ways had follow similar syntax to the
program and I'm going to see and the
logical end is written with two
ampersands I'm very good at drawing in
percents it's actually not true at all
to buy those horrible ampersands this is
an N so if this expression is true and
this expression is true the ampersand
joined those sometimes because I like to
be a little bit for anal about stuff you
can put parentheses around the whole
thing too because truly this whole thing
is one boolean expression the whole
thing evaluates to either true or false
it just only happens to evaluate to true
when both of these sub boolean
expressions also evaluate to true so
what if I wrote something like this if
Mouse X is greater than 100 and Mouse X
is less than 50 X cubed s code what's
wrong with this it's completely
illogical it'll work but it's impossible
try I dare you I'm really getting try to
come up with a number that is both
greater than 100 and less than 50 you
know take your time as long as you need
get back to me whenever I will do some
sort of exciting thing like eat a
cupcake and dance on top of a small
little stand while wearing a pretty
outfit or something I can't come tonight
if you can come up with that number it's
not possible so just because you have
these options doesn't mean we should
automatically that are right all this
great code that's going to do this stuff
it's still up to you to come up with the
logic to implement what you want let's
look at a scenario where this ampersand
could make sense so we want to say and
if when you get rid of all this stuff
if Mouse X is greater than 100 and if
Mouse X is less than 200 and let's put
those I think it's useful I shouldn't
gotten rid of it to draw lines on the
screen in this case just so we can see
them and know where the mouse is in
relation to those numbers so okay so
what's the problem oh look at me and
this this is good that this happened
unexpected token ampersand you can't
really see that there's a way to zoom oh
how do i zoom stare with pause look up
something on Google I can't I gotta
figure that out the you know I used to I
got to do it on my laptop but this is
like a regular keyboard so down here you
can't read it but down here at the
bottom it says unexpanded taupe
unexpected token ampersand so something
must be wrong with the syntax back here
but this kinda looks like how we wrote
it here but we put these parentheses
around here so it's a little bit goofy
and you know I'm just going to show you
if I took these parentheses out it's
going to work so this is going to be
fine remember you need to have
parentheses
that are going around the entire boolean
expression the way I had it before like
this there are no parentheses going
around the entire building expression
this will also work because we can have
parentheses around those all those other
boolean expressions this I would say is
like probably a good way to write it
just to be most clear right now so if
now sex is granted 100 and mouse X is
less than 200 the okay over here we've
got a black background over here we've
got a black background it's in between
we've got red in between because here is
where the value is both greater than 100
and less than 200 6 minutes and Counting
okay we gotta talk about or I mean how
could I not make a video about an and or
and how it just could be done in three
minutes don't know what's going on gonna
work husband's okay or the thing about
this stuff is what's nice about this
boolean expressions and logical stuff is
it really just follows your intuition I
mean you don't have to explain what and
means just try to say it in English
if Mouse if the mouse X is greater than
100 and mouse X's book less than 200
which is the correct to the way that we
put there then execute this code it
works out what if we say or now in this
case or is written in it even more
cryptic way or is written with two pipes
that is or okay so I could say if the
mouse X is greater than 100 or it's less
than 200 what's going to happen no
matter what I do it's always read why
try to come up with a number that is
neither greater than 100 nor less than
200 right every number on 300 is greater
than 100 by the way 50 happens to be
less than 200 150 extra 100 and less
than Jordan so this is always true both
of those together with a whore of
numbers kind at least one of those are
going to be true but now we have the
case where what if we said if it's
greater than 200 and or less than 100
what's going to happen now it's greater
than 200 we have read it's less than 1
or I've read but now if it's here
neither of those expressions of I ways
to true
it's neither greater than 200 nor is it
less than 100 and we've got we've got a
black background now in
middle this brings up an interesting
point there is another logical operator
it is called not right if X is greater
than 100 do something what if I are
saying F X is not greater than 100 to do
something this is very very useful
oftentimes you want to sort of do the
inverse so I could say right here if
this entire boolean expression is not
true and that's not the right syntax
let's put another set of parentheses out
there you know I don't know what's wrong
with me today I just completely lost my
mind but so this is the exact opposite
so now if if you know you can start
paying these crazy by the way we just
have gone off the deep end here let's
not you know this is a nice little
demonstration but the point of this was
to kind of understand or and and not so
you can use these in all sorts of
combinations you can say if this and
this or this but not this you can create
these very elaborate boolean expressions
in the mode for the most part you know
it's very hard to do this in a vacuum
we're kind of coming up with these
arbitrary scenarios what you want to do
now is figure out where is this going to
be useful to you and I think our next
video where we're following a return to
that moving ball is really going to
demonstrate that and you're ready for
this now how could you say for example
with these structures we're going to do
this in the next video if you have a
ball moving over here if it reaches this
edge or if it reaches the other end how
to turn around that's one place where or
would make sense right that's a yep it's
really you know this would be much
easier if you were just standing there
and said oh I have this idea what kind
of logical expression do I need well
then we would kind of like work that
through with the absence of an idea
we're just kind of spinning in the wind
so even when I make smoothies videos in
the future more specific examples this
is probably 10 minutes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
