from A to Z course video this video I'm
gonna look at a feature of what really a
feature of the world's the web the
browser and look at in the context of p5
GS in JavaScript
how do you get text input from a user so
first I just want to talk you through
over here what the basic what the three
or four methodologies I'm going to use
so number one is if you want to get text
input from the user you can use
something called an input element so an
input element is a little box that
appears in a browser window where you
could say you know in a web form you
might say like name and then you know
you write your name in here
you could also use something called a
text area and a text area is the same
idea it's just bigger and it's usually
resizable the user can kind of drag this
corner around for a longer bit of text
entry so if you want the user to type in
a paragraph of text and use that in your
program you can use a text area and then
you could also get you could ask the
user to submit or or you could simply
load there's four there's so many other
ways that I'm not gonna get to because
you could use api's and crawl the web
and scrape it we'll get to that stuff
later in a future video but what I'm
thinking about right now is you could
also get input from a text file itself
and you could use for that you could use
the load strings method in p5.js where
you could simply just reference a actual
text file that you have us in your sort
directory of files you could also use a
file input if you've ever seen in a web
browser you have a little button that
says like choose file and you can
actually create that with a p5.js
function I think called create file
input and I'll show you how to use that
as well and finally you could create a
div a sort of area a box of stuff on
your screen that you could in the
browser itself that you could drag a
text file over and I actually have a
separate video tutorial that just goes
over that which I might just rest
rather than included in this video
tutorial so I'm gonna go through all of
these and then you can also look at the
draggable area video and you'll see
these as possible ways of getting text
input because what I'm gonna do is say
hey user submit some text and I'm gonna
generate a poem of from that text for
you so that's kind of the ultimate goal
that I'm going to do a couple videos
from now okay so let me come over come
over here and let's see so first of all
so I'm gonna start to implement some of
this stuff and go over how these
functions work okay so this is my code
so far oh yes no I'm still in the same
video forgotten huh everybody take a
deep breath I need some like calming
sound that's not coming down I got it
okay so this is my code so far one of
the things you'll notice in all of the
examples that I'm pumped not all but
many of the examples that I'm publishing
is that even though I'm using the p5.js
style methodology structure of there's a
set up function which is kind of like
the page is loaded function there's a
draw function which runs this continuous
loop I actually and use it calling a
function called no canvas meaning there
there is no drawing canvas associated
with this program that I am writing I am
simply writing a program to mess with
the webpage other elements other than
the canvas paragraphs headers that sort
of thing so if I were to look at the
output of this page which is over here
you can see all there is is a header
that says welcome to A to Z week one now
where is that coming from
one thing I'll notice nowhere in my code
do I say hey display that on the page
that's because I actually have that
simply hard-coded into the HTML file
associated with this itself so this is
something that I'm going to touch on in
this example in future examples is when
should I put something in the HTML file
when should I put something in the
JavaScript file and there's no real
answers to this question it's sort of
case-by-case basis and personal style
that sort of thing okay but what I want
to do first is just simply show you how
can I create text input on the page and
I'm going to do that by saying create
input
and now I'm gonna run this code look at
that and there it is there's a place
where I can type some text on the page
wonderful once the user has typed in
some text I wanna I might want to access
that text in my program so let's look at
how I might do that so first of all this
create this input text box that I've
created on the screen I need to store a
reference to it in a variable so I'm
gonna create a variable like input I'm
gonna say input equals create input and
by the way I'm actually gonna take out
the draw loop
I don't want there's no reason for a p5
to be at continuously looping right now
because I'm not using that aspect of p5
which I might later but there's no
canvas there's no animation and so what
I now want to do is I want to have
access to that stuff that's in that the
text box now when do I want to have
access to it I could have access to it
in a draw loop by saying input dot value
I'm gonna skip that for right now what
I'm going to show you though is just I'm
gonna open up the chrome developer tools
here and make this a little bit bigger
so let's say I put my I would say I type
rainbow into there and then I'd set type
input value you can see this by
referencing the variable dot value I
have the text that's in there so
anywhere in my code I can simply
reference that text box dot value and I
know what the user has typed rainbow so
now I might want to know what they type
only when they hit enter so the way that
I can do that and I've done something
rather horrific so well actually no I
haven't done it horrific yet I'll show
you later I'll fix this later
so all Dom elements the text input box
being a Dom element have events
associated with them I mean I click on
it's an event when I hover my mouse over
it it's an event there is an event
called changed and there's a p5.js p5
Dom library function called changed
which allows me to execute a function
when that event has been triggered so I
can say input dot change new text which
means I can just write a function called
new text and I can say console dot log
input dot value
so what I'm saying is whenever the input
box has changed meaning the user has hit
Enter
I want to see the results of that in the
in the console so now if I go back and
refresh this page and I type in rainbow
and hit enter we can see here and
somewhere I have rainbow here if I type
in unicorn and hit enter we can see I
have unicorn there so now I am accessing
that content whenever the user types
enter and I might do something like say
create P input dot value create P makes
a paragraph element on the page so now I
can say unicorn and I can say rainbow
and I could say swirly happiness right
and I'm getting all of those things as
paragraph elements on the page now
here's a question for you what if I'd
want to know every time the user types a
team not just when they hit enter but
anytime anything changes in that text
box itself this event is not the changed
event and this is where I've done
something which I really don't like
which is that the name for that event is
actually input just a little bit of so
technically what I need to say is
something like this but I sort of hate
hate how I've named the variable input
and then there's also an input so I want
to rename that variable so I'm gonna
just call that you know text field or
something and that way we can have less
confusing they're less confusing that I
can I can make this a little more clear
so what I'm going to do now is say
function new typing and I'm gonna say
I'm also gonna do create peace so let's
comment out that let's just for the
moment comment out the changed event and
only have the input event so now watch
what happens you and I cor n anytime I
type anything I'm getting an event and
I'm kind of continuously making new
paragraph elements for every keystroke
that I type so maybe what I want to do
instead just as an exercise here to do
something different is to what if I had
a single
paragraph element that I altered the
content of every time I typed a key so
here's where this like in Shakespeare
Hamlet there's an essential question to
be or not to be and I have a different
question for you today and my question
for you I maybe I shouldn't be erasing
all this because it's a nice reference
for later but it's too late to select or
not to select or maybe it's just to
create or not to create to select our
two crane what I'm saying to you is when
do I want something on my web page to
appear based on code I write I'm
creating a new Dom element and now it's
being appended to the page or vs. when
do I want to have something that exists
on the page that I access in my code
exists in the raw HTML that I accessed
in my code and manipulate and here's a
case where I'm going to do there's
demonstrate to you that what I want to
do is I am going to in the HTML file
itself I am going to add a paragraph
element and I'm going to give it an ID
and I'm gonna call it output right I'm
going to call it output and you can see
that it is empty and what I want to do
instead of saying create P in my code
instead of creating the paragraph
element I want to select this paragraph
element I want to access it so that as
the user types I want to update what's
in it with the word with the keys that
they're typing so let's do that right
now so how I do that in the code is so
I'm gonna leave that in there so what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna say I'm gonna
make a variable called output and I'm
going to say output equals select and
then I need to I'm gonna use its ID and
the indicator for an ID is the pound or
hash symbol select output that's what
the ID I gave it and then here now what
I want to do is in new typing I'm gonna
say output dot HTML the HTML function in
the p5 Dom library is a function you can
call to access the existing content of a
Dom element or place content in it and
what I want to do is I want to take
what's currently in the text field and I
want to put that in that paragraph
element so let's look and see if this
works now and so as I'm typing o cannot
read property HTML of No so I've made
some sort of mistake here Here I am back
and if you are wondering what was wrong
I forgot to hit command s in my if I
index dot HTML file meaning it wasn't
saved so now that I've saved it the code
works as expected or as I wanted to
which is I can say hello every time any
character that I type here you can see
that that paragraph element is being
updated and now when I hit enter you can
see that I am also saving that with so I
have two events that I'm tracking each
key being pressed and enter being
pressed now a couple other things I want
to mention one is if you want to have
this pre filled in with some text then
one thing you can do is you can in this
create input function you can say this
you know like enter your favorite food
or something or just say like your
favorite food right and I could then say
you know blue berries okay and so happy
I wish I had a bowl of blueberries right
now and I could just do this sort of
weird internet thing right eat
blueberries on the Internet okay so you
can see that you're gonna have something
some prefilled text in there I could
also make this a text area instead so
what I want to do actually right now is
what is I'm going to show you
one isn't going to show you two things
at once where's first of all instead of
saying create input I could have
actually just put an input element in
the HTML file and you select to access
it you can try doing that as an exercise
for yourself and what I'm gonna do in
this video is change this I'm going to
actually add a text area and I'm gonna
give it an ID which is I'm gonna call it
text field we're gonna say text area and
you can see now if i refresh this you
can see there's now a text area that I
can expand over here so if I wanted to
type a paragraph in here and I could
also actually precede it with some text
please type a story and you can see now
it says please type a story there and
what I'm going to do is in the code I'm
going to comment this out instead of
creating the input I'm going to say text
field equals select and text and the the
ID is text field so I could probably
think of better blueberry I'm gonna call
it blueberry and I'm gonna go back to
the HTML and I'm going to say give it an
ID blueberry and I'm gonna say tell me
about how much you love blueberries so
that's in there you can see that's in
there and now you can see this same
program works the only thing is that
event enter is no longer relevant so in
this case I should probably create let's
do this I'm gonna go to the e I'm going
to actually just create a button element
and I'm gonna say submit and I'm gonna
give that an ID which is submit and then
I'm gonna go to my code and I'm gonna
say bar submit and I'm gonna say submit
equals select submit and by the way I'm
doing a terrible job I'm single quotes
double quotes everywhere all of you can
argue on the internet single person
double quotes I'm just gonna use it both
I don't care and I'm going to say submit
dot mousepressed which is an event
and I'm gonna say new text so when you
click the submit button I'm gonna call
the new text event which will create
that new paragraph
so mousepressed is an event for when you
click on a button so I should be able to
do this and you can see da-da-da-da-da
and I can hit submit and I get this is
how much I love blueberries okay so oh
it's did it twice why did it do it twice
now spread Oh cuz I have the Oh
interesting
oh and maybe want to hit tab or
something I have this no oh yeah text
field change so that event is still in
there maybe it's somehow figured out I
don't know I don't know why that
happened yeah someone needs to by the
way so it needs to write a command s for
save song okay anyway uh finished with
this video okay so this is the end by
the way here's a little exercise
technical exercise for you to do and I'm
going to show you how to do this as I
make some video tutorials about how to
manipulate strings but basically the
next thing you should think about is how
could you instead of just reproducing
the exact text that is that is in the
text area or text input box right there
on the page how could you even emulator
text so how could you show the user back
what they've typed but reverse the order
of the characters or reverse the order
of the words or replace certain words
with their synonym I mean that's you
know connecting to an API or something
and so you can come up with some clever
idea this is a kind of a technical
exercise that you could try okay thanks
for watching this video about how to get
text input from the user using an input
field or a text area and the next video
I'm gonna actually show you how to load
from a file using load strings or the
create file input okay thanks very much
and I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
