expressions video and in this regular
fashion video who I think this might be
well I probably will never ever stop
making regular expressions videos but at
least for this sequence that I'm making
right now today who knows when you're
watching this in the future
this is the last one okay so this video
what I want to focus on is the replace
function so in the previous video I
looked at the split function split
function is a function that you call on
a string you give it a regular
expression and the regular expression is
a way to match a delimiter which
indicates where you should split that
text up into an array of chunks tokens
so to speak now I want to look at the
replace function which is a function
that you also call on a string with a
regular expression but wherever that
regular expression matches you give it
something else to replace it with right
just like find and replace in any text
editor but because it's regular
expressions because it's code there are
all sorts of powerful things that you
can do that you couldn't just as easily
do with your standard computer
find/replace
so um you know what you might do with
this is come up with some sort of like
translator web application so you know
that you can find you know websites that
take your text and translate it into
pirate speak for example so if you're
looking for an exercise or something to
try to do write a web page like this
where you enter in some text you hit
submit you do some kind of crazy
replacing magic and you get a new text
whether it's translating into some other
funny way of speaking or that sort of
thing so I'll encourage you to come up
with some creative ideas from what I
show you here so let's first just look
at the basics of replace so I'm going to
make a string that's just says equals
unicorns and rainbows okay
so that's a string and now what I want
to say is f dot replace and here's a
regular expression unicorns and I want
you to replace that with cupcakes so
sorry that this is kind of like breaking
into line weirdly so you can see replace
anytime you match unicorns and replace
it with cupcakes if I do this and now
we've replaced it we have cupcake
rainbows very very simple idea now let's
just look at something look at the
original string the original string is
still unicorn and rainbows so one thing
that's really important about this is
you're not modifying the actual string
if you want to modify the actual string
in your code you're going to need to say
s equals the result of itself replacing
unicorns with cupcakes is this really me
replacing unicorns with cupcakes
I think it is ok ok so you can see now
the value of S is cupcakes and rainbows
okay
this definitely needs some sort of
background music but whatever ok so this
is how replace works now obviously it's
more powerful than this because I
haven't really done much in the regular
expression other than simply simply
replace a literal word with another
literal word so let's do this a little
bit differently and say something like
by the way one two three four five six
seven one two three four five six seven
eight eight so unicorns is seven okay so
let's let's let's uh let's let's say
asses unicorns and rainbows and cupcakes
and what I want to do I'm going to clear
this out is I want to say s s dot
replace and what I want to do is replace
any sequence of word characters that is
between six and eight characters with
rainbows unicorns cupcakes what else is
there is there anything in this world so
just make them all I don't know really I
waiting for the chat to like catch up
with me and give me a suggestion but the
chat is 15 seconds behind so you the
poor person in the future watching this
video with no live chat yes kittens
thank you very much
kittens I need to replace it with
kittens so and I forgot my slash here so
I'm gonna run this it was worth waiting
for the kittens right so we run this
syntax error what did I what's what's
wrong with this missing parentheses oh I
forgot the parentheses here sorry now
that's the curly bracket kittens and
rainbows and cupcakes so wait what's the
original ah and guess what okay
fascinating fascinating thing that
happened I believe that rainbows which
has eight characters and cupcakes which
has eight characters should also be
there like kittens no sorry
unicorns has one two three four oh they
all have eight characters they all have
eight characters so let's do this again
replace any a character word with
kittens but still it only replaced the
first one why because I forgot about the
global flag so the global flag is very
important the replace function is only
going to replace the first instance of
something it matches without the global
flag kittens and kittens and kittens and
gets kittens and kittens and kittens and
kittens kittens kittens and Gittens and
kittens I'm really losing my mind
someone please make a song out of that
okay um now okay so that's what replace
does that's the basis of replace now let
me show you that you can also use
capturing groups I'm gonna get a lot of
thumbs down I'm its video I can tell
already uh you know some people will
like it but a lot of people on internet
doesn't you know okay um so you can also
use capturing groups so let's just say
that what I want to do is anytime I see
a vowel
anytime I capture a vowel I want to
double the vowel so I'm going to clear
this and I'm going to do s so that's the
string right so what I want to say is
replace what I want to match a e i o u
right I want to match any AEIOU and I
want to replace it with what well what
did I met so what if I put the
parenthesis around the whole thing
so I'm not doing anything too
sophisticated where I'm you know
capturing subgroups but of course I
could do that you could do that phone
number that I showed you
with capturing groups in the previous
video but let's just say I want to
capture the vowel and I want to replace
it with what what I captured followed by
what I captured so this uh I probably
think of a more clever example but you
get the idea so here I am capture taking
I'm replacing anything I capture with
itself whoops ah whoops of course I'm
sorry
this always needs to be in a string so
even though it's a little tricky about
this is this is a regular expression so
forward slash forward slash this is a
string so it's in quotes but javascript
is going to figure out that this is the
secret code for the back reference even
within the string itself I think you
knit uh uh but look at that it only did
the first one why because I forgot the
global flag yet again uni chords and
rainbows and cupcake is there we go see
so you can choose back reference um you
know maybe look at the sort of double
words thing or double words or you know
what how much you don't know it's
another clever way that you could
certainly do oh and sometimes why yes I
forgot about this sometimes why okay so
um anyway so that's something you can do
with back references okay now here's the
thing I'm really getting to something I
need my drum roll sound effect that I
don't have someday I'll have a drum roll
sound effect this is the real magic of
using regular expressions in JavaScript
is what I have shown you is regular
expression and the string that you
intend to substitute but
what happened if you pass a function
into there this is incredibly powerful
and somewhat unique to JavaScript that
you can actually have a callback
function so let's see how this works so
I'm going to do this in the code because
I don't can't think of another way to
easily demonstrate this using the
console so let's look at this okay so
I'm going to go to the code for a second
and I'm going to write a regular
expression I want to match any I'm going
to match a word boundary followed by a
word boundary followed by some amount of
word characters one or more followed by
word boundary okay so that's my regular
expression then what I want to say and
I'm going to give myself some line
breaks here to raise this up now what I
want to say is var okay here comes here
comes here comes no no s dot replace
with that regular expression and I'm
just going to say something like
replacer now I can write an anonymous
function right into there I can write an
anonymous function right into there but
just to make things a little bit easier
to follow I'm going to write a separate
function down here replacer and I'm
going to give it an argument match and
the only thing I'm going to do is I'm
going to say console dot log match and
autoformat gave got got rid of all my
line breaks it's gonna do this again as
soon as I hit command s that's very
annoying to me I'm gonna put something
down here there thank you okay so what's
going on here the replace function is
going to execute a callback for every
single time you and I want to say that
I'm going to say var new string and I
also want to say console.log new string
and I would say create p new string uh
camera
come back to me camera okay so
well we'll just sort of look at what's
happening on the inside here so let me
just run this hit refresh going to move
this over a little bit I'm gonna hit
submit and then look so first of all it
got it matched a and then it said
undefined rainbow so that's a little bit
crazy huh what's going on
well first of all what did it do first
thing is it executes replacer for every
single match of this regular expression
but notice the regular expression does
not have does not have the global flag
so in console logged the match which is
the first thing it found a and then it
replaced it with what it didn't replace
it with anything it will replace it in
the string with whatever you returned
blueberry so now let me run this again
it replaced a with blueberry now let me
do something let me give this the global
flag blueberry blueberry blueberry
blueberry blueberry blueberry blueberry
blueberry right what it's doing is it's
saying for every match of that regular
expression return blueberry meaning
replace it with this but do you realize
what's now possible this function has
two lines of code I'm console logging
the match and I'm returning blueberry
but now you have the entire known power
of the programming universe to put in
here so any logic you could possibly
imagine you could put in here so for
example this is not going to be that
interesting but I could say if match dot
length equal equals four return match
dot to uppercase
otherwise just return match what is this
going to do this is saying if the thing
you matched has four characters return
an uppercase version of it otherwise
return it as it is let's look at this
now so you can see all the four-letter
words are now main all uppercase this is
not that of innovative of an example but
imagine what I could do I could make an
epi query here I could check the day's
weather here I could do anything
every time this regular expression
matches so I can't have this I sure
enough how much is possible within here
and I wish I could make this video hours
long and just kind of go through all
sorts of crazy ideas but I'm leaving it
to you the viewer to try to come up with
your crazy ideas right here so let's
though let's look at a little bit more
I'm trying to think of how I can make
this a little bit more interesting let's
go back to the phone numbers for a
second okay
so I'm going to put some numbers in here
999 - one two three four and you know
one one one - eight seven six five and
eight eight six seven five three oh nine
okay so I put in a put a dot in there so
I just keep the dash in there so I just
want to look at what happens with
capturing roots because this is even
more sort of crazy what you can do so
now if I go back to my code and I change
my regular expression to match the phone
numbers so I'm going to say done this so
many times now I want three digits
followed by a dash followed by four
digits and I just want to I'm going to
log that match I'm going to take this
out I'm going to just say return match
so the replacer is doing nothing so I
just want to make sure that this regular
expression is working and you're going
to run this hit submit and you can see
and I don't I don't want to log this and
the console I just want to see the
matches you can see there we go
so I'm matching those phone numbers in
the text now what happens when you add a
capturing group and this really will
unlock you know so much more I said the
you know entire power of the known
universe is right here watch what watch
this so
so first of all let me make a capturing
group I'm going to put a capturing group
around here for making one I'm going to
put a capturing group around that first
group and now I'm going to run this
again nothing different happened why how
do I get access to that group well let's
look at this function notice how this
function has an argument this callback
replacer function has an argument it
gets the first argument is match group
zero the full match the full match is
always group zero guess what the second
argument is group one guess what the
third argument is group two now there is
no group two but I can just list them
there because maybe a you know maybe I
want a group - I'll have a group two
right here so what I'm going to do is
now I'm going to say console dot log
match console dot log Group one console
dot log Group two we run this again hit
submit and you can see look at that I
now I'm able to have the callback
separate out the different groups if my
brain works any better I would have all
sorts of creative ideas what I would
love for you to do I say this already
tell me your creative ideas of what kind
of crazy replacer stuff you could do
with this and I'll come back and do some
coding challenges with some of those
ideas or share them with me and I'll but
but this is really unlocking a lot of
possibilities for all sorts of strange
text replacement algorithms that you can
use the last thing I just want to
mention though is that instead of
actually having to have these arguments
listed as separate variables you can
also use a secret or variable in
JavaScript so I'm so secret called the
arguments array the arguments array
exists for any function that just stores
all the arguments passed into the
function that the values of the
parameters as in an array and I have a
separate video which actually covers
this which you can look at but I just
want to show you what that looks like
here and so you can see here and by the
way look at this if you look at that
there's actually more stuff that we
didn't even realize there's the full
match group 0 group 115 I think is
the length of the string I guess that's
just the length of the original string
no what is that
somebody tell me and then the full
string is their case you needed that as
references the fourth argument what is
the 15 I'm trying to remember what the
55th somebody the chat tell me
Grove the chat is 15 seconds Miami so I
don't know I'm gonna have to look that
up I'm gonna get so many YouTube
comments of telling me what it is
because I can't remember but you can see
that there's matted it's the length of
all the groups together okay position
and string someone says position and
string someone says length of all the
groups together but I have a feeling
that that it's probably is a let's just
quickly test out this idea let's add
those groups all together 15 yeah so 15
seems to be the length of all the groups
added together I don't know what that's
useful for exactly but seems to be
useful for something okay
so this is the basic gist of it there's
so much that you could do with replacing
text think about types of different sort
of interesting creative possibilities of
how you might do text mashups text
translations API queries mixing up text
reversing order swapping things out but
and so I encourage you to play around
with this replace idea play around with
the groups and let me know if you have
some creative ideas or some things that
you make with it and I'd love to hear
about it and I'm going to do a coding
challenge where I use some of this just
to show you how to sort of interact with
words on an individual basis okay I'll
see you in the next coding challenge
video
