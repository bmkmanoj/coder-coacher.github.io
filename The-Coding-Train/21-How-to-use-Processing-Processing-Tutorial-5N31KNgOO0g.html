so we're ready now to take a look at
processing itself and see if we can take
some of this knowledge and apply it in
processing itself write some code draw
some pictures of the screen so what is
processing where do we get it how does
it work this is what I want this video
to really cover to get you comfortable
to make sure not only do you have the
basic understanding of the coordinate
system and how to write some functions
that will draw to that through a process
to a window but also how the processing
software and environment actually works
as well so if we walk over here
this is the processing website
processing dot work I will include a
link of course below to this site this
is where you can click here to download
processing processing is an application
just like anything else you can download
it install it and run it I'm not going
to go through those steps right now in
this video that's legal about the only
piece of information that I'm assuming
knowledge of which is that just the
knowledge of how to install software on
your computer so but you know if I have
forgotten something you know call right
and send your complaint letters to me
okay so once you've downloaded and
installed processing and run it you're
going to get a nice little window like
this so the processing is it's many
things in a way it's a programming
language the truth of that matter is the
programming language you're writing in
which we talk about is the Java
programming language but processing has
a whole set of functions and things that
have been added that are going to allow
you to sort easily draw to the screen as
well as it's stripped away some of the
obnoxious and I don't like to insult
Java I actually really love Chopin even
though that makes me just about the
least cool person in the world but it's
taken away a lot of the stuff that makes
it uncomfortable to begin with Java and
make things simpler so it is a
programming language you know really the
language of writing is Java it's
certainly an environment this is the
environment that you're going to type in
hello
I love processing but this could
theoretically be a processing program if
we ran it we're going to get some sort
of errors like I have no idea
that means but it's a environment this
is a place where you can type your code
and execute your code which is one of
the wonderful things about processing
because you don't have to figure out
which text editor should I use and how
do I compile and then where do I go view
it and where do i do bucket everything
is here in processing itself the other
thing the industry is really it's a
community so if we go back to this
website there are examples there's a
forum there's it's open source there is
a rich community of people there's lots
of other sites that I could link to
abusing processing sharing code teaching
with processing making project with
processing so in addition to just being
software there's also this vibrant
community which will hopefully help you
feel happier and more comfortable kind
of diving into this new world of
programming for the first time ok so
once you've downloaded processing you've
run it you've got this window so a
couple things I should point out there
is up here right this is kind of the oh
I don't know what to call this a toolbar
a little set of buttons there's a bunch
of things you can do this is the one I
think is the most important this
triangle is the Run button it looks kind
of like the play button on some media
device like I don't know a VCR heart an
Apple TV today I don't think an Apple TV
or a Roku box has play buttons but
anyway the point is this is your Run
button but it does not really play what
run means is compile your code compile
your code and execute it so it's going
to run through your code compile it into
binary execute and run the program which
is why when we ran this one we got this
error it's an unexpected token hello now
one of the things I like about
processing is it sometimes gives you a
nice friendly error message and
sometimes it doesn't but we can just dis
or what I didn't mean to talk about this
now but whenever you have a mistake in
your syntax you're going to get an error
and that error will hopefully lead you
to how to fix that but your syntax but
here we're saying it says unexpected
token hello because Hello is not token
meaning a sequence of characters in
between spaces and punctuation a word so
to speak it's unexpected because it
doesn't know what hello means perhaps
it would know what lime means so for
example if instead of writing that I
wrote line and what did we say a hundred
comma fifty a 600 comma 250 and I put a
semicolon and I ran this program we
would see I'm not over here hi I
apologize this is uh I can't go back and
fix it it's just going to have to
someday I'll fix this video I'll have
the way like dropping sub again or I'll
just probably need to rerecord all of
these because I'm just you know this is
like a rehearsal oh really for that
video that I imagine will be so perfect
but you can see I was able to run this
program and there was no error so this
is fine syntax it's the syntax we learn
how to draw a line from point X from the
first X Y to the second X Y now the
window we got here doesn't actually have
the line and it's also very small didn't
we say that our window should be 640 by
360 well one of the things that we did
haven't learned is actually how to set
the size of the window we can see that
by default if you don't specify a size
we're actually getting a 100 by 100
pixel wide window so here we're now
about to learn another function size
size-8 a 640 360 semicolon and now we
have a look at this two lines of code
we've really got a program now size line
and if we run this one which I can also
do command R which I'm doing we see
there it is
there's that program I sadly erased the
drawing of it over the board we could
see this basically mirrors exactly what
we draw out on the board so now is a
moment where you could save yourself
this drawing that I made with pencil and
paper let me see if I can recreate it in
processing can I write the instructions
to create that drawing this is sort of
your first practice in programming I
should point out that even though these
were I said we weren't in the
introduction anymore because we're
actually making stuff and using
processing or still in the introduction
we're not really programming well we are
programming our writing code we are
compiling and executing that code but
there's no real logic here we're not
saying hey you know if this happens then
do this we're not creating this
kind of flow this complex sequence of
logic we're just kind of issuing almost
a linear list of commands that ends with
a static picture so really what we want
to get to in the next set of videos is
that flow of the program that lodge
we're going to really do so much more to
start understanding the foundations of
computational thinking right now we're
just kind of practicing by getting used
to syntax and the Run button and I hope
the kid the camera might cut out in a
second but um huh just tease me for a
second I'm coming right back hello I
just had to press a button in the other
part of the room okay
so now this brings us to my next point
so let's say that what we want to do I
knew that would happen
I'm not even going let's say hi okay I
have to dress another bun this is
terrible I really should edit this
somehow and someday I will you could if
someone wants to download this video and
cut out some parts and then send it to
me I'll be upload it um but let me see
so so let's look at this list over here
these are the list of functions we're
going to start with rectangle ellipse
line in point and this is our window
which is 640 by 360 and let's say we
want to kind of draw this I don't know
what I'm doing something like this this
could be our kidding drawn while you
guys are hopefully in such words it's
been me and you go for something more
creative but all we know is how to draw
a line now we need to discover how to
draw rectangles so you could guess we
could I wish I had a little dialogue
here today what are some ideas you know
how would you design the rectangle
function for processing what arguments
would you require and you might say oh
what about the X Y at this point and the
X Y at this point that's a possibility
what about the XY of the center and the
width and the height what about the XY
was a corner and the width and height in
fact all of these are possible but the
default way of drawing a rectangle in
processing is with four arguments so
rectangle has four arguments X Y width
and height the X&amp;amp;Y being the location of
the top left the width being the width
in pixel
fools and the H the height the H being
the height in pixels so let's go add
this to our program over here let's say
okay we want to draw a rectangle and
just to sort of see that it's working
let's make the X Y the same as the top
left corner of this line and let's make
a very skinny rectangle that's only 20
pixels but rather tall that's 200 pixels
and if we run this we can see look we
now have a rectangle we've created all
this this kind of like slide thing we
have this line and we have a rectangle
over here with the X Y and I could zoom
all the way into this I'm not sure the
point of that but the X Y being the top
left the width being 20 pixels and the
height being whatever I typed 100 200
something like that 200 pixels okay so
we can see okay now we learned how to
draw rectangle and I could go through
and show your lips in line a point there
are lots of other drawing functions in
processing but I mean once I I'm not
going to sit here all day and talk
through every single possible way to
draw everything in processing the punji
there's got to be a better way right it
doesn't just happen and you should want
there's some interesting lots of people
of lots of interesting ideas on how to
make this more intuitive while you're
actually doing the programming itself I
mean what is instead of typing this out
you could just draw the REC end on the
screen the code would suddenly appear
but that's not really the point of what
we're doing here what what I want to say
is what one of the things you want to
get used to is how do you look up this
information how do you look up how to
draw a line if you didn't know if you
were just if you didn't just enjoy
watching videos for somebody with kind
of slightly messy hair or just talks and
talks and talks all the time so um the
way you do that is through the
processing website which through the
reference so over here there's a link to
reference on the left over here and if I
click on reference we're going to
suddenly see this web page has a list of
all these possible functions and these
are the ones I want us to kind of look
at right now
2d primitives arc ellipse line point
quad rectangle triangle here is a list
of basic drawing functions and
processing each one of those is a link
if we go to that link it's going to show
you hey here's the syntax here's the
name of the function here are the
arguments here what the arguments do
here's an example so just let's go to
rec
which i think is a good one to look at
we can see hey look here is the name of
the function rect
and here is an example of what it looks
like for numbers oh I don't know what
those numbers are but by the way you can
do down did rectangles and slightly
there's all sorts of stuff and you can
read the description but really and we
can see here this is what we're doing
we're making a rectangle with ABCD now I
often think of those and I did on the
board of there's X X Y WH because X for
X Y for y w4 with and H for height but
we could see here the reference it's
going to describe that for us and I'm
going to zoom out slightly not all the
way we can sort of see here and we try
to get this in a way that you can see it
we can see here rectangle ABCD a is the
X court of the rectangle by default B is
the y coordinate of the rectangle C is
the width and D is the height so we can
see that this page is giving us what the
syntax is what those arguments are what
the arguments actually do and then at
the top here a few examples and I'm not
going to go through how the rounded
stuff works this is something you can
explore on your own and ask questions to
buy new weekly program Aska processing
question which will start sometime in
September I don't know I've liked
plugging the video within a video for no
reason I meant that to be strange and
humorous and it was not I laughed
sadly inside by myself okay so this is
really where we are I think I'm actually
kind of coming to the end of this video
now what you can do for your exercise is
in the next video we're to look at color
what you can do for your exercise is go
through the reference pages for ellipse
line point rectangle try to type the
code in make a sketch and design your
drawing now I'll show you often suggest
to make a little alien or monster it's
kind of a nice thing to start with but
really any pattern that you might want
thing to make see if you can create it
with numbers and again let me just point
something out this is kind of a silly
exercise it's almost like a red herring
it's not the right expression where it's
kind of a diversion
programming is not about hard coding
numbers into functions to create a
picture programming is about creating a
sequence of instructions a logic to
execute a task but just to get started
and really we want to avoid we want to
really a Hello over here we want to
avoid this way this type of convention
we're saying we want to avoid this we
don't want to have a lot of all these
hard-coded numbers and this this is not
there's not that it will all become
clear as we move on but this is not what
we're doing eventually but it's a good
place to get kind of started and just
kind of get used to processing and get
used to what errors you're going to get
like when I forget that semicolon again
let me let me forget this semicolon
instead yes good with that one at the
bottom here it's a syntax error maybe
missing a semicolon so you can see you
want to just get sort of practice what
kind of syntax errors are you going to
make are used to fixing them can you
look up stuff in the reference can you
make that that that picture with
processing so work on that the next
video we'll go over how to add color to
this as well as kind of fill in some of
the blanks for some of these functions
and we'll be kind of wrapping up this
sort of first group of videos about just
kind of the basics of syntax and the
basics of drawing and processing great
thank you
