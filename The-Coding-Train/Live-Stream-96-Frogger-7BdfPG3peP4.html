Friday it is the day for a coding
training with me pan hello this is
welcome I'm hoping that I'm
live-streaming which I probably
shouldn't say she just assumed at this
point that things work because they
typically do I'm a little bit earlier
today than I often am on Fridays due to
a bit of a scheduling change some day
the universe will come together with
some way that I establish regular weekly
timeslot that I do every single week but
at this point I'm still kind of a bit of
an ad-hoc YouTube streamer if that makes
any sense and but anything that I do
will be archived and available to watch
later and then of course this livestream
will also be chopped up into little bits
and edited tutorials so looks like we've
got a bunch of folks here I see a chat
scrolling I see everything so ok so
what's happening today oh no I got a
marker if I have a marker things will be
ok I'm going to program something I
think I've been if you've been following
my livestream for the last few weeks you
know that I have been on a path telling
a story about machine learning
artificial intelligence but today we're
gonna take a little break from that I
will be returned I will return to it I
think I would I need the next big
example that I'm going to build is a
full multi-layered perceptron neural
network example and I think that's going
to need somebody actually made a comment
I know I know
on my perceptron video which I took to
heart which was like you know your
videos are great they might be a little
bit better if you prepared for them so
while I do think that some of what I do
in particularly some of the coding
challenges works well due to the lack of
preparation or maybe it doesn't work
well but that's just sort of the thing
that's not ever going to change that and
that's part of what I'm going to do
today with no preparation whatsoever is
program a game but I do think with some
of the deeper more complex topics that a
little preparation or a little
allocation of time could help so I want
to make sure that I have a good
block of time or maybe two days in a row
or I can do two to two to three hour
sessions to really build this much
larger example that has a lot of pieces
of components the neural network example
okay so that said uh that said what will
I do today my kids who are ages five and
eight suggested that I do a fidget
spinner simulation which I'm considering
you know I don't want to just latch on
to the latest craze I don't know if I
have my pet rock somewhere around here
to do a pet rock simulation or a
hula-hoop simulation perhaps earlier
crazes I suppose what's another one
anyway uh but we'll see maybe I'll maybe
I will do that but it has been requested
for a while to look at the game Frogger
so let's see here I'm gonna open up a
web browser does anybody know where I
let's let's look I think Crossy Road is
another version of this game let's look
on Wikipedia for a second okay so
Frogger apparently is a 1981 arcade game
I have definitely played this game
before I have never programmed this game
before them they'll ideal loosely let's
see if we can find an image is that you
are a frog let's sit let's look at this
you are a frog where's the Frog there's
the Frog down here at the bottom and
your job is to get from the bottom to
the other side in those little
receptacle end points and you must not
be hit by a car and so this is the road
so don't get it by a car and then when
you get up to here this is a ripper so
you need to jump on either these lily
pads or looks the Frog is in the middle
of the game thank you sorry that's where
the Frog is thank you Alka this is how
many lives I guess you have left and and
this is how much time is at the bottom
so and you can see there's a score so I
think that I can do this I have some
level of confidence we will need
a rectangle rectangle collision
detection right because I can really
consider the Frog as a rectangle and
each of these cars are the rectangle the
logs the lily pads is rectangle so I
just want to know if the Frog is hit a
car the Frog is jumped on a log
I expect that when I make this I will
leave out things like the timer number
of lives score visual design so I just
want to build a simple framework for the
basic functionality of the game and then
let people create their own versions of
it okay all right so I'm looking at the
chat make no I'm not going to read that
comment it's way too upsetting to me uh
okay so that's pretty good now is there
a place I think that's probably all I
need but maybe maybe I can least play a
version of this game online
does anybody know in the chat does it
you know there's me I am so me in the
chat is saying the grid behavior is a
bit odd on the logs and turtles if I
recall correctly so I think there's
probably a lot of nuance to how this
game was originally programmed a lot of
these early Atari games you know had a
lot of limitations in terms of memory
and speed and I can be a bit more
flexible with just I don't need to worry
about a grid system exactly but but ah
yes yes okay so I'm gonna we'll see what
happens okay uh somebody in the chat
says this is ideal timing can you please
start streaming every Friday at this
time I typically this was my regular
time at one point the afternoon worked
better for a variety of reasons mostly
that I had a conflict in the morning and
right now I sort of summer and I just to
be honest summer schedules going to be
so wacky in terms of travel and
different other things going on so I'm
just going to kind of on a week-to-week
basis schedule live streams when I can
but I will take note that I know that
this meant that this time for some
people is very good I will say that if
you want to support what I'm doing other
just watching and giving some helpful
criticism or supportive words is always
helpful but you can go to
patreon.com/scishow
channel can get access to a slack
channel where I am very good at where
I'm very good at announcing when I'm
going to go live in a slack channel
there ah Simon in the slack channel says
use Opie and in fact I really think this
is a great suggestion I think that this
particular game is a really excellent
opportunity to use certain principles of
object-oriented programming like
inheritance and possibly polymorphism
and so I'm going to actually program
this in processing using Java which uh
you know which i think is just a place
that I'm a bit more comfortable with in
terms of the object-oriented programming
stuff and also I'm really living in this
place where I want to explore this
summer more about programming in
JavaScript from with es6 and with
functional stuff I've been getting a lot
of feedback in the patreon patron slack
group that's been discussing and giving
and kind of pushing me in that direction
and I'm a little bit cautious and I like
to do things in the simplest way
possible but um I feel so conflicted
about that that sometimes like I just do
the soup processing that I don't have to
worry about kind of what flavor of
JavaScript I'm doing at the moment so
that's kind of a plan Ted in the chat
asked please use p5.js thank you for
that comment I will and you have to
guess it to keep me honest about this
either on Twitter in the comments but I
absolutely am always happy and usually
somebody from the community does this
too just post a port of the code in
JavaScript and especially for something
like this I want to do that because
people will often want to share their
versions of it and sharing and having
some friend on the web just so much
easier for that okay why did the Frog
why did the Frog across the road because
it was stapled to the chicken
here's another one why did the Frog
cross the road because the chicken was
on vacation these are the jokes we tell
in my household okay uh I guess their
dad jokes is apparently the term okay me
I am so me has volunteered to port after
I'm done which is great thank you
and I even am NOT opposed to doing a
second pass over the video if with in
JavaScript's - okay I'm just reading the
chat for a second who can you please
make a game with matter a s and the
votes I always get this a lot of people
are telling me matter dot jsn neural
networks but yes but I'm definitely
gonna do some stuff with neural networks
and games and training AI agents to play
games and it's just going to take me a
while to get there but I will be doing
all that I often get I'm speaking a
little quieter because I can hear that
there's a class going on in the room
next to me and I don't once what I did a
live broadcast somebody came in and said
I was making too much noise so I wonder
if can can you guys let me know if the
levels seemed okay in particular in the
slack group is a little easier for me to
follow can I start
yes a lot of you are new here probably
because I could see that you said hey
your camera shut off this is something
that happens to me it's unlike sisyphus
here I could probably fix it but the
cameras go to sleep the cameras I'm
using go to sleep after 30 minutes after
button to wake them up because you never
know I might fall asleep in the middle
of my my my thing okay so this is what's
the music can't be talking
have the levels are a little off with
Kentucky are you ready for Frogger
how are the levels me okay so I'm going
to wait to get some information from the
chat and then I think we're going to
start with Frogger I'm just curious
is this a topic that interests people
create poll this is now my straw poll 8
fe Fe 2d if you guys could vote there
I'm not going to I'm going to do Frogger
first the other thing that I would like
to do today if I have time is a
follow-up video about the perceptron
because there's a few pieces of that
that I didn't get in last week's coding
challenge the music is louder but I
don't see that much the concern levels
are fine oh god no I'm just saying this
is my kids requested I you know I have a
sucker I will do anything for YouTube
views and likes okay I would like to say
that that's not true I would like to say
that I'm just here to teach and just
here to give some entertainment or to
impart some knowledge or to help but
really I'm here because some chemical
reaction goes off in my brain when
people click like and watch the videos
and a different chemical reaction goes
off my brain with people right I hate
your videos that's okay it happens it's
on its youtube there's no way you can
get around that but I do appreciate the
constructive criticism which I've been
particularly getting as I've tried to do
for more difficult maths topics a little
twitchy today okay um all right
oh what's with that coffee
yes but interestingly thing about the
coffee is that has a green heart on it
so I don't know how much well you can
tell this but look at this I have an
invisible coffee I also have
a window a green window now maybe what
I'll do is to show you what I'm holding
here this is a preview
I shot I'm working I we did a video
shoot for a new music video theme song
trailer for the coding train and this
was a green window to use for the train
window so that will be coming to YouTube
sometime later this summer
ok back to here my five year old sis is
watching with me high five year old sis
my daughter is a five year old sis
she will be six those summer she is at
kindergarten right now and when this is
over I'll be going to pick her up from
kindergarten and then we will be having
our tennis lesson this is my day today
okay do I ever stop and ask is this what
my life has become yes all the time
although honestly I usually ask it this
way this is what my life has become you
know I said I think I was I did a
podcast interview the other day where I
really just a failed musical theater
wannabe person that's all I wanted to be
was you know actually I didn't really
want to be in the musicals I don't think
coz first of all even if I did I cannot
say but I just wanted to be a part of
the Broadway I loved it I saw the great
comet the other day got tickets to Evan
Hanson I'm a big Broadway fanatic
theater nerd okay where are the this dot
shirts does anybody want to design at
this dot shirt I would totally be open
to that I have the you can get these
coding trained shirts at coding trained
dot Storenvy comm I think we better get
started here I also have hoodies and
kids t-shirts and other things you can
get and this is another way you can
support this channel and finally a way
that you can support this channel less
directly but probably somewhat an
organization that needs more support
than I do is the processing foundation
so I just want to mention the tools that
I typically use processing and p5.js
there's also processing Pi which is a
mode for processing are maintained by
nonprofit foundation called the
processing foundation processing
foundation or you can find out more
about it and if you are interested you
can become a member and support the
foundation financially okay what else
did I miss that I usually need to
announce or thank I don't think so let's
take a look at this view results No oh
that's so sad come on people
make me happy there's already 200 votes
I want to see some yes votes here come
get me up - yes I got to tweet this am i
logged into Twitter Here I am as the
coding train account okay I have two
Twitter accounts at Schiffman and also
at the coding train the coding train
though really just auto posts when I
post a video
I don't really check it that often you
can see that I have 36 notifications
here um help get me - yes okay so I have
a cipher to say no no no don't worry I
won't do that before the oh yes it would
be interactive the idea is that you
would be able to click on it you would
twirl it it would spin we would deal
with like friction and angular velocity
this would be a reasonable actually this
is basically one of my nature of code
examples already okay I just rebranding
it to try to get let's see view results
how we doing here well get getting a
little closer getting a little closer
okay but I got to go to Frogger that
seems to be more interesting to people
okay let's see let's try where some like
train conductor costume that's another
question okay well look a machine
working machine learning fidgets better
that is genius
I have to think of a way to figure out
to make a machine learning that way if I
just did neural network fidget spinners
or some code of like all these like
buzzword things people wanted to learn
fidget spinner that would be amazing I
didn't even bring a fidget spinner with
me I own I mean I don't get to play with
them because because I never am allowed
to be the one who gets the hold but I do
indirectly own many of them okay let's
move off of this and go to Frogger I
don't think I need to play Frogger I
think that with this here this is going
to be good enough uh yeah genetic
algorithms and fidgets spinners
evolutionary design a fidget spinner
there we go that's a great idea
good joke did two peoples just at the
same time Amir and Alka angular momentum
exactly there's physics there stuff okay
um let's see here let's check how this
whiteboard is I mean let's see if this
pen is a good one mm I don't love it I
don't love this marker let's try another
one
got one up here this one's better it's
not the best but it's better can you
guys read that okay looks pretty good um
let's try one more
it's pretty good okay this one actually
has even a little bit better all right I
think I'm going to be ready to do the
first coding challenge so my plan is to
do this it text seems fine on the
whiteboard great my plan is to do this
in multiple parts I think what I'm going
to do is just create the basic mechanics
of the frog moving hmm let's think about
this oh boy I I forgot about this whole
like get into the want to make a simpler
version where you get to the end I can
hear sound finish I'm thinking about
this so one thing that I've learned is
that I think sometimes when I try to
implement every single detailed feature
of a game my videos tend to spiral out
of control
in a way that's when I did pong that
kind of happened and so I really want to
keep this simple there's like a buzzing
coming from the room behind me Oh
it's okay if I just meditate this might
my Fitbit has this thing where I can do
this like relaxed breathing for two
minutes do you guys mind if I just do
that you know might just take a break
for two minutes I'm gonna do some
relaxing breathing stuff no maybe I
should Prager okay get it I got it um
okay so two parts one is I haven't seen
anybody type cringe in the chat for so
long it's been so long makes me so happy
okay um I will have to make a grid for
the Frog okay okay I hear this feedback
and I'm gonna figure this out I think
I'm gonna do something a little y-you
know what I'm gonna just start the video
because here I am just talking and
talking and talking this might as well
be part when I say start the video such
a weird thing but what I mean is that
and this will get edited into a tutorial
a set of different videos and multiple
parts so I'm just going to start the
actual coding challenge some rose
movements are faster or slower than the
other oh it's by row so the though so
you're saying to me Alka that these cars
move at the same rate right and do they
always stay does the design stay the
same so it's like different cars
different speeds okay that's interesting
okay it's by row because it's by car
okay how much time is this going to take
good question what do you guys think
knowing that I tend to ramble that I
tend to make a lot of very basic
mistakes how long will this take
okay let me get processing open I'm
going to do this in processing I'm going
to use object-oriented programming for
this you guys I wish you could hear the
music that's playing if it's like a film
class that I give you let me get the
most recent version of processing which
is 3.3.4
as always I always forget to this stop
this stop this stop this done and then
beating this stop this stop underneath
this this stop this dock just donÃ­t
ever using this stock will stop using
this table just dock this time this time
this dock just gotta go get to the stop
this stop stop stop this stop this dock
is done then we can get to this stop
this stop this stop this done and then
give me this stop this okay looks like
I've got processing now we open this up
and oh make do this here how is this
font size for you guys gameplay Bergner
in the chat just mr. Bergner in the chat
just posted a YouTube video with Frogger
gameplay let's see if I can get that up
here
what's the link here oh boy
I bet sure I can just search for it
right Frogger ark gameplay youtube just
the one I think this is the one that was
just posted
so let's take a look at this
I love all the little animations so see
there's it interesting out the fraud
moves on a grid but the Frog when it
gets on a log gets to move sort of
independently of that grid which is kind
of cool when there's a little extra
thing there can you guys hear the sound
by the way it's like Crossy Road is it
doesn't Frogger predate Crossy Road
Crossy Road endless arcade hopper game
Crossy Road for me
1980 I think of Frogger okay this is
great I'm actually going to use this
video and start it as the background I'm
going to get
okay so here we go ups I'm the chat we
can hear this sound okay all right now
how we doing everybody you ready for
this I'm gonna go and look like I agreed
you will get no argument for me there
okay so here we go we are going to begin
only because you all said cringe in the
chat that means I am bringing out the
train whistle okay here we go
oh hello welcome to another coding
challenge with me coding challenge
person YouTube thing okay this is a game
called Frogger I'm gonna play this video
here oh oh so Frogger is a game where a
frog tries to get from the bottom right
there there's the Frog the Frog is
supposed to get from there all the way
up there the idea is the Frog needs to
avoid the cars but then the Frog when it
gets to the river needs to land on the
logs or the lily pads wherever they are
to make it across so I would like to
make this game now I'm going to make it
in something called processing which is
a programming environment built with on
top of the programming language Java
that you can download from processing
org I will also release after the this
video is finished this is probably video
view a bunch of parts it will also
release a JavaScript version of the code
so you can make a browser-based version
of this game okay I have to stop this
because it's distracting me too much let
me say another couple things I'm going
to keep things very simple so I'm not
going to implement all the features of
the game there won't be any sound all
these little like beautiful animation
details
we won't implement and you know as well
sort of the graphics visual design but
it is my hope that the internet the
wonderful world of the Internet will
watch this video and take this code and
make all sorts of crazy fun extra
interesting versions of this game so
let's get started pause timeout okay
Frogger is 81 and Crossy road is 87
thank you okay
cars are slower than the turtles oh
those are turtles not lily pads what I'm
being told that those that these are not
lily pads but rather they're Turtles I
mean come on you kind of look like lily
pads that's a turtle that's a turtle
okay all right so okay Oh guess what
this is going to be a great opportunity
to practice some object-oriented
programming techniques right because
there's a lot of things like there's
cars their logs they're similar they're
different but there's a lot there's a
lot that we could use in terms of making
objects that relate to each other or I
don't know what I'm saying now but I'm
gonna get into stuff like inheritance of
polymorphism in this video
polymorphism just say polymorphism three
times and the Java monster shows up at
your door
whatever that is the Java monster says
system out cult but please I've lost my
mind I you know I really got a I need
some more written I think I need to
write my time out this isn't that my
actually live stream up the guy for a
moment I just imagined that I was
rehearsing which would be nice right
okay all right volume is too low I can't
a lot of people are telling me this
let's see what I can do here I will
raise the volume a slight amount just
because I am getting that comment from a
lot of people which sorry hold on a sec
which one am I plugged into three
and I'm going to turn this up well if
you can see me where I am
let's see test test test
hello hello hello how is that is that
better I think I'm a little bit louder
now so hopefully that's fun uh River
does not make sense because frogs could
swim I totally agree
uh okay volume is fine um all right
people are saying I'm fine but if some
people are saying it's better okay all
right so let's let's start by mapping
out some of the pieces of things that
we're gonna need okay so one thing that
where I can see I've never programmed
this before
this is scouts honor or whatever uh we
do that again I want to say scan okay
okay so let's think about some of the
things that we need
I have not programmed this before but I
did think about it a little bit this
morning on the subway so one of the
things that we're definitely going to
need I'm going to consider the Frog to
be a square I'm going to also consider
the cars to be squares or if it's a
truck a rectangle same thing for the
logs or the turtles all of these things
are essentially just squares or
rectangles really and you know then
eventually if I were visually designing
this I could put whatever I want inside
of these elements but what I'm going to
need to do right I need to know is a
rectangle intersecting another rectangle
or not because what I want to know is
for example did the Frog is the frog has
the Frog hit a car so I need a function
that tests whether any two rectangles
are overlapping or not and this is
actually kind of this is not too
difficult of a function to implement
because if I know the left the right the
top in the bottom left right top and
bottom of any rectangle I can just see
is the I can just check to see if
um this is this is what happens by the
way when you program something live you
do this kind of like live stuff stuff
that's just so intuitive or you feel
like it's easy suddenly you get this
like frozen moment of like oh my god I
don't know if I'm going to get this
right but we could do this I can do this
let's think this through okay so if I
have two rectangles each with left right
top and bottom if the left of one
rectangle right if the left of this
rectangle is less than the right of this
rectangle or the right of this rectangle
is greater than the left of this
rectangle then right that's these cases
right these are overlapping but one of
these has to be true and the top of this
rectangle if it is if the top of this
rectangle I've um let's take it five out
here maybe it will help if I drink some
of this coffee
I usually don't I've got the a get a
good night's sleep last night it's funny
I think it's almost easier to work this
out for me if I were programming it than
to try to map it out here right if the
top of this rectangle is less than the
bottom or the bottom is greater than the
top now so actually what does it have to
be it's actually a different way to
think about this would be to just say is
the left in between in between the left
and the right or is this in between
left in the right and is this top in
between the top and the bottom and is
this bottom or is this bottom between
the top of the bottom okay that makes
more sense that makes more sense right
because this top is in between the top
and the bottom of this one that's
spending way too much time on this so I
think when I actually released this as a
tutorial I'm going to want to figure out
a way to edit this down and not go
through this whole elaborate me thinking
this through maybe better come back and
explain it again this top is in between
the top and the bottom right but I can't
just say this top is less than the
bottom because it could be up here and I
can't just say this top is in between
the top and the bottom because it could
be over here I know I've gone off but
one of these also has to be between
these two okay look I already have
somebody I could see on the computer
over there I think I can see like alkis
icon has already posted a really quick
version of this right which is uh-oh we
can do the negation ah that is a
wonderful idea so I can say ah I can a
more efficient way to do this and I'm
going to I'm going to double back is
just saying let's actually just test if
they're not intersecting right oh this
is so great
okay let's start over let's start over
this an exciting moment thank you thank
you Alka uh okay this is you can see how
I literally do not prepare for this
because now this seems so obvious to me
and if I just googled I would have seen
this on Stack Overflow and maybe I would
have thought of it eventually once it
started programming it this is going to
be so much better I'm so excited I'm
erase all this I don't remember where I
was I'm just going to come back to the
beginning we're gonna just we're going
to we're going to start this we're going
to start this tutorial over I know that
thrills all the live viewers to go and
open a window get some fresh
ergo get a cup of tea just take a couple
minutes to do something else because I'm
gonna I'm gonna get this happening a bit
speedier okay okay here we go
okay so let's map out some of the things
we need no I didn't just do this a few
minutes ago I mess it all up let's back
out of some of the things we need to
program Frogger
so I'm going to consider everything in
the world of Frogger to be a rectangle
so the Frog is a rectangle the cars are
a rectangle see and there might be a
long rectangle if it's a truck or actual
square you know the frogs gonna be a
square the same thing the logs the lily
pads everything is a rectangle because
what I want to be you know invent you
know I was like to put my own image in
there there could be a little animation
I hope that's what you guys will do if
you make a version of this after
watching this video but the only thing
that need is to be able to know does the
Frog intersect a car or does it
intersect a law so I need rectangle
rectangle intersection and it turns out
after like a messing you're getting a
little confused and doing a little
research there's a really nice way of
doing that so I could actually do
something so if I have a rectangle and
what I what I keeping track of is the
left side the right side the top and the
bottom and if I had this is r1 for
example and if I have another one that's
r2 that also has a left right a top and
a bottom I could say something like well
is the top of r2 in between the top and
bottom of our one if it is and also like
the left sides but that's actually going
to be a lot trickier than just what if
instead of trying to determine if
they're intersecting what if I just try
to determine if they're not intersecting
right so if they're not intersecting is
a much easier thing to test because I
know they're not intersecting if the
left of rectangle two is greater than
the right of rectangle one right that
means a rectangle is somewhere over here
no matter where it is vertically it
can't be intersecting or if the right of
two is less than a the left of rectangle
one that is over here same things the
top if it's above it if the same thing
from the bottom if it's above it and the
top if it's below it so if I can
determine if it's not intersecting then
not not intersecting is intersected so
let's go write that code really quickly
um there's a music playing that you guys
can't hear but I can hear it and it's
not just in my head there's a room back
here okay
so what I'm going to do this is a little
bit silly and unnecessary because there
is actually a java class can you hear it
now much much laughter there is actually
a java class called rectangle that i
could make use of but I am going to just
make my own and I'm going to give it a
left a right a top and a bottom so I'm
going to create a rectangle that has a
left right the top and a bottom and when
I make that rectangle going to write a
constructor for this object
where I can what I'm actually going to
do is I'm going to allow the rectangle
to be defined with an X a Y and a width
and a height and then left is the X
right is the X plus the wif top is the Y
and bottom is the Y plus the height
right so often let me save this as
Frogger so often in programming which
you guys could hear the sound Thunder
copy items not talking about them
because it's just gonna be weird for
people who are watching this and can't
hear them and you think I'm a crazy
person with sounds in my head which
would not be such an unreasonable thing
for you to think if you've watched any
of my tips but nonetheless I digress
typically in pro in a lot of computer
graphics environments if I'm going to
define a rectangle that's going to
appear on the screen I'm going to define
it with an X a Y and a width and a
height but here I want to actually keep
track of the left the right the top of
the bottom for this intersection test
then what I'm going to do
is I am going to write a function here
called intersects and that function who
could people that chatter tell you they
can hear the sound I'm not completely
insane only just you know mildly up
boolean intersects I want a function
that returns true and let me zoom out
here and it receives another rectangle
so I want to function that tests a
particular rectangle against another
rectangle whether or not they're
intersecting so the big expression that
I want is I want to say I know they're
not intersecting if I say that this dot
left is greater than the others right or
right so I actually don't in job I
technically don't have to save this dot
but you know come on if I have an
opportunity to write this knot I'm going
to write this dot so I want to look at
this rectangles left versus the other
rectangles right or this rectangles
right and maybe I can just put a line
break here is less than V is less than
the other rectangles left or this
rectangles top is greater than the other
rectangles bottom or this rectangles
bottom is less than the other rectangles
top so if I return the result of this
boolean expression if any one of these
things is true right if oh if any one of
these things is true right if this left
is greater than that one's right or this
right is less than that one's left etc
etc then I know they're not intersecting
and the inverse of that would be if it
would be they are intersecting so
actually all I need to do now is say
return the result of not that whole
expression and this is a really fast
operation to do
determine if two rectangles are
intersecting time out for a second yet
Alka says I think the left right top and
bottom should be calculated on the fly
and keep the XY WH for ease and
manipulation I think that's true except
one of the nice things that this is a
good point and what I could do actually
is I'll come to that later if I need it
one reason not to do that and this is a
match yeah this could be this could be
this could be sorry I think processing
actually has a rectangle mode called
corners which allows me to draw a
rectangle based on the corners but
you're right if I'm gonna be using
images and sprites and other things so
but I can always double back and add
those as variables here I think there's
a lot of different ways I could work
this out okay so the question is how far
we have room I me I am so me right to
the chat remember premature optimization
is the root of all evil like I could not
agree more and I would say should report
it in es6 or not the I am to be is
asking how about both you're welcome to
pour it in es6 and I'll do the nany ass
export if you prefer but I definitely
want to have a not be a six port that
matches kind of my other examples I
really should have both okay um okay
let's see how we do in here I'm I'm
trying just keeping track of like parts
here I might want to do this in multiple
parts okay gender ik asks why don't you
negate all the comparisons and change
the ORS to Anne's
I think I could do that this to me feels
a little cleaner in terms of writing it
and the way that I thought of it I mean
wisc it came from a suggestion from Alka
which I think probably came from I mean
maybe but I just based on the comments
like it came from somewhere else
but it's for me it was easier to think
of the whole test for if they're not
overlapping and then just negate that
whole test but you're right and again I
have actually tested this code so I
don't know if it's gonna work okay
all right so and okay so I got to keep
moving here so we're gonna make the frog
now I have an idea I have a crazy idea
oh I'm excited okay so here we go all
right so now I think it's time right we
have our sketch what I ultimately want
to start with is I want to be able to
write some code like this frog F our
frog frog and then I want to be able to
say sighs you know I want to have a
canvas it's like 640 by 480 I'd only be
just a frog equals new frog and I want
to say things like frog show and maybe
frog dot update or something like this
so I want to write the code in an
object-oriented fashion or I could just
create this frog object now
interestingly and I made this rectangle
object just to keep track of the
properties of a rectangle so there are a
couple options here things I could do I
could make a new class right I want to
make a frog object so to make a frog
object I need to say class frog and then
I need to you know have a constructor
function and I need to have a function
that's like show and a function that's
update so this is the skeleton of the
Frog class the class being the template
for making an object here I have the
Frog object and now you guys have no
errors in my code now there's nothing I
didn't like right the actual information
that needs to go into the Frog class but
I have a question I have a question a
frog is a rectangle so there's two
approaches I can take care very excited
about this because I haven't covered
this in a lot of my videos I'm going to
look at something called inheritance
what I might have done previously in
other videos to avoid talking about
inheritance is I might have said ah a
frog has a rectangle associated
with it so the Frog keeps track part of
it data is the rectangle which defines
where it is and in some ways I kind of
want to do that because I think there
will be some simplicity to that however
something else I could do is I could say
frog extends rectangle meaning meaning
the Frog is actually a rectangle and it
the Frog itself has an intersects
function I don't have to retype it the
Frog inherits all of those properties
left right top bottom the Frog inherits
the intersect function and now I can add
additional functionality to the Frog and
the reason why this is maybe will be so
powerful is I'm going to say car class
car extends rectangle two so the idea is
that the rectangle is the foundation for
all the other things that will be in the
world but cars and frogs behave
differently so they also need their own
code so this is how it's going to work
so let's comment out the car for a
second and let's start working on the
Frog now we do have an error here it's
giving me this red squiggly line the red
squiggly line of dulu root squiggly line
so let's at least look and see what is
that error here and it's going to say oh
boy we do not like this error I don't
have my sound effect for this error
display this one implicit super
constructor frog or rectangle is
undefined so one of the odd things about
working with inheritance is I need to
define the constructor the way an object
is made in a somewhat of a special way
so the Frog I'm sorry the rectangle has
a constructor make a new rectangle what
I want to say is that the Frog also gets
a an X a Y and a width and a height
right that's how I want to define a frog
but I need to figure out how when I
define a frog with those values do its
inherited properties get set and the way
that I could do that is with a keyword
called soup
super XY wh and what this does is this
says when I say new frog with an X Y
width and height then make sure you also
call the super super being the parent
the super classes constructor function
passing in those values so this
initializes the inherited properties of
frog okay
so now I have a frog that has
essentially a rectangle and I can also
do this thing where you know what maybe
it's going to be useful to me to
actually keep track of the these
properties here and I'm going to put
little underscores here just to like
differentiate I know this is getting a
little bit cryptic and I I have an
allergic reaction to cryptic code and I
really try to avoid it but let me just
try to explain what's going on the Frog
keeps track of an X Y width and height
there's some redundancy here the
rectangle keeps track of the left right
top and bottom so all of those
properties are all together and then and
then so I initialize the stuff that's
inherited from the rectangle through the
super function and then I'm and I think
this is probably overkill here and I
almost I regret doing this and I want to
go back and not do this because I think
I could get away with just the pausing
for a second frog and car is XY size
says Simon truck is XY width height
that's a good point I could just keep it
as a square only needs one property
people are talking about which text
editor they prefer in the chat I'm
trying to think if I I kind of out
through alkyls comment do do I want I
kind of I feel like I went on a too much
of a digression here and then it's
actually going to be totally fine to
just draw it using left right top bottom
please don't do that
that is cringy this dot x equals x yeah
i should probably do it that way okay
hold on i'm gonna
I'm going to back up here this is one of
these days where I just feel like
sometimes I do these coding challenges
and I want them to have no editing and
then other days I kind of just go off
the editing deep-end today as an editing
deep-end day okay so some where I
stopped before I started going on adding
the X&amp;amp;Y
I think I explained what super does
roman lino says don't use inheritance
it's a bad idea most of the time
including this yeah I got it got excited
about it I could have just put the
rectangle in the object let's I'm gonna
keep it we're gonna the super thing made
me want to like stop and crawl into a
hole but you know um why not
I'm gonna keep going I look and then
somebody says inheritance makes the code
beautiful so we're just trying a lot of
different things but I'm not going to
add the redundant variables it kind of
was making things a bit of a mess I
don't actually need them at the moment
so okay so Matt yeah
for if you're able to follow this
somehow I'm going to edit point from
where I explained what super does and
now I'm just going to add the show
function okay so now that I've written
the Frog constructor which essentially
just calls the parent constructor the
super constructor in rectangle I can now
give it let's have the Frog start
somewhere
arbitrary 100 150 and you know what the
Frog is a square so let's do one little
goofy thing here which is the Frog is
never not going to be a square so I can
just reuse that I can just show you a
little trick here the Frog only needs
three variables and then what it makes
the rectangle it uses that with for both
the width and the height the little
optimization there for no real good
reason and then I'm gonna get rid of
this update function I'm going to say
background 50 background zero let's just
make it black and then frog dot show so
I want to see that frog so I'm going to
write a function now that says fill 255
a rectangle left
right top bottom left right no no left
top right bottom right I want to draw
there's a way that I can draw a
rectangle and I haven't actually done it
yet by referencing this point which is
left comma top and this point here which
is right comma bottom left comma top
right comma bottom and processing will
do that for me if I say rect mode
corners so this is a particular way to
define a rectangle by its corners but
since those are the properties
that music is coming from me
I clicked something by accident by hope
I don't get a copyright violation on
this video hope to edit that out
actually that looks looks edit that out
actually oh it's still playing oh I had
some Mozart that I was using that was
royalty-free I thought but okay let me
go back here the left right top and
bottom come from the rectangle okay so
now I should be able to run this and
there it is
guess what you've watched a video now
for insert number of minutes so far here
and what did I do
I programmed Alice Cooper a white square
on a black background so in a way I'm
kind of disappointed with the way that
I'm doing this but hopefully you know
because I spent all this time setting up
all this structure and all I've got is a
square on the screen but hopefully this
is going to give us the foundation to
really start getting the game going so
let's try to move a bit more quickly now
let's let's start the since the camera
went off
okay
so let's try to move a bit more quickly
here and let's start moving that frog so
I think okay so here's the thing if I go
back to that gameplay video which is
here where's the Frog come on frog
where are you frog frog oh there's the
Frog you can see the Frog always moves a
distinct amount of space with each
movement and it looks like the Frog is
actually moving essentially based on a
grid which is about the size of the Frog
itself there's some nuance to that but
so what I want to do here is create a
function I'll call it move and the Frog
will move by some amount or maybe a
direction so let's have a global
variable which I think I'm gonna call it
grid so let's think again I'm going to
be very fast and loose with this idea of
a grid some games operate entirely fixed
and locks to a grid system like Tetris
for example I'm going to kind of just
sort of think about this grid as a loose
informal way and use it when convenient
and not use it when when inconvenient
but let's just say the Frog right the
frog's size was 50 so let's also right
now have the grid be 50 and I'm going to
say the Frog size is the grid like minus
4 so I'm going to kind of think of just
this idea of there being grid over the
window over the whole window and but the
Frog kind of being a little bit smaller
than that actual grid and there's gonna
be like centering issues forget it
Olympic I'm gonna keep things really
simple I'm just gonna have the Frog be
the exact same size as the grid you know
eventually someday if you were used like
a sprite or an image
actually just have some transparent kind
of like buffer border that keeps it a
little bit small I mean I'm going to
keep things simple here so we're gonna
have the Frog be the same size as the
grid and so the Frog when it moves a
given direction which we could say give
an X direction and a given y direction
it can only be can't move diagonally but
let's just write it this way we're going
to say X plus equals oh no left there is
no X right I've defined this frog
entirely by its rectangle which is the
left and the left and right in top to
bottom now maybe I want to have some
redundant variables to keep track of
it's X Y maybe one its center well
there's so much I could do here but
let's just let's just keep going let's
just fast and loose left plus X
direction and then top plus y direction
okay so that's what I want to move it
now
I want to move it when I press the arrow
keys so I'm going to write a function
global event called key press this is
part of processing and I can say if the
key is coated um
right isn't it no hold on time out time
out I need to look at the processing
reference reference key code
oh if key equals coated yeah I don't
know if I actually really need that
because I could just check the key code
because that's all I'm going to use is
the arrow keys so let's go back again
I'm going to say if the key code equals
up and this is all built into processing
else and I could use a switch statement
here I know everyone in the comments the
switch statement but I started writing
an if statement and I just never
remember the syntax for those switch
statements so I want to just check all
four possibilities up down right left so
I want it I want the frog to move if
it's moving up I want to
zero common negative one if it's moving
down zero comma one if it's moving to
the right
that's one comma zero if it's moving to
the left that is a zero negative one
comma zero and then when it moves up the
whole point of this is x grid x grid so
I always want to move it by the amount
that I've considered this grid there is
no actual grid here the grid is just a
figment of my imagination that I'm using
to think about it when convenient but
I'm not actually keeping track of like a
2d array of cells with States and all
that kind of thing that I might in a
more tile based system okay
so let's run this now again and let's
see ooh interesting what is going on
with this crazy I have never seen
anything so it's Oh guess what guess
what goofball my ridiculous oh you guys
the chatter always right this is kind of
a bit I programmed in this most
ridiculous way that I that I should have
known would become a problem but if we
go back to the code here what am i doing
when I move the left when I move let's
say I move the right or I move the top
if I move the top up right this is the
rectangle and I move the top up it comes
from here now my rectangle looks like
this
I'm like growing and pulling and I'm not
actually moving the whole thing so I
think what I probably want to do in this
case is actually keep track of the
center of the rectangle and its width
and height separately and move and then
calculate the left right top bottom on
the fly I'm going to need to do okay
so let's figure out how to do that so in
the Frog what I'm going to do is I'm
going to create a separate set of
variables X Y and W and I'm going to
initialize those with this dot and this
dot so I'm going to keep those separate
from the rectangle bed if I put those
and then when I when it moves the X
moves the Y moves now you might be
asking why did I use this dot here so I
have this thing where I have the
arguments coming it off Java whoa Java
and programming we should just all quit
now go to something else
but what what I have is I have the
constructor arguments and those are sort
of temporary local variables to the
constructor and I need to differentiate
those from the actual variables that are
tied to the Frog object itself which are
the so I want it if I want to specify
those I'm going to say this dot and
these the the X these are just the
constructor arguments okay so what I
want is to change but down here there's
no confusion so I'm going to leave out
that this dot this is probably a
terrible idea for a variety of reasons
as I'm sure I won't hear from all of you
but that's what I'm going to do right
now okay
so then I'm going to draw it I'm going
to actually say I'm going to say rect
mode I'm going to just leave the default
rect mode and I'm going to say X Y with
with okay so now if I do this we're at
least moving the Frog correctly now I
fixed the moving of the Frog someone to
the chat row this is going to be pawing
all over again I'm going to do this in
multiple parts though I fix the moving
of the Frog but the rectangle is not in
the right place anymore so what I could
actually do just for debugging purposes
I'm going to say rect mode corner sorry
rect mode corner rect mode corners left
right left top right bottom I'm going to
show you what right so now if I do this
you'll see the rectangle data is not
moving but the X Y is moving so what I
want to do it's so convoluted the way
that I've created this wreath
during later leave me I'll do a whole
video that's just refactoring this
Frogger thing you'll enjoy that it's
coming coming eventually left right top
bottom okay I don't need that anymore
what I want to do now is whether when I
move it I should say update update X Y W
update update based on XY w w ok so I'm
writing a function called update which I
will put in the rectangle function which
really just does exactly what the
constructor does and I'm actually going
to now just in the constructor change
this to this so in other words the
rectangle has a way of always updating
the left right top bottom which I need
only for the intersects function and it
will do that whenever the x and y
changes so okay so this now if I run
this we should see they're both in the
same place
pause super calls yeah so you know I'm
kind of regretting a little bit my sort
of like inheritance idea because I don't
know if it's making it more convoluted
than not but you know we might get the
benefits of this later make this top
less than this dot bottom I'm just sort
of seeing the chat that people are lost
oh I could have just moved the left the
right and the top and the bottom yeah
maybe I should go back because that made
it kind of convoluted right maybe I
should just fix my move function by
moving the left right the left and the
right and the top and the bottom but I'm
not to do that with everything I like
totally want to start this over again
because I made it in such a convoluted
way
it's really just so simple like all I
needed to do was in the was in this
intersect function just calculate the
left and the right dynamically and just
always have the rectangle B and X and Y
and a width and height anybody there's
no way to know because I've gone off the
deep end with like stopping and starting
I'm wondering how long this is so far
and maybe when it gets edited down it
wouldn't seem so crazy start over to Oh
people that shadow tells me they want me
to start over I'm going to go back to I
have an idea I'm not going to totally
start over as much as I would like to
but I'm going to go back to this update
thing was kind of crazy
I'm going to go back to the part where I
moved
everything will be okay everything will
be okay
I have to pee now also I have to take a
break good laughing I got very anxious
okay let me go back I want to go back to
this part this is pong all over again
but this will be edited so this is the
part where why am I not seeing the Frog
this is the part
wreck mode corners left right top bottom
left right top bottom what what am I
missing here why am I not what did I get
wrong here where's the Frog should be at
100 100 I just went back to JavaScript
might be better
oh the strawpoll the finished I just
quit do the fidgets better now thank you
very much um Oh things take so long I'm
terrible at this
you guys notice how terrible at this I
am uh left right Oh left top right
bottom thank you thank you brain okay I
think maybe that class ended behind me
if it's not convoluted it's not Java
yeah start over we'll wait okay okay yes
I have been doing Frogger since the
stream stream started okay um okay so
I'm going back to here and what I'm
going to do I'm gonna be at the I'm
going to be at the problem I'm gonna
take a break I'm good at I'm gonna put
on some waiting music I'm gonna take a
one-minute break
because I also forgot to refill my water
bottle and this is now finished and then
I will be back and we will finish this
we will finish this oh my god
time for a nap okay I am now pressing
this button which I will mute myself
okay I am back I have some water
I know what the problem is not staying
hydrated also I feel like this is a
little bit low and my neck is hurting me
just like hunched over okay it's
brilliant idea to use inheritance which
now seems so unnecessary
okay oh um let's go now okay I think
people are trolling me in the chat okay
keep the music on okay here we go I
forgot what I wanted to do okay here we
go so I'm gonna go from where this gets
messed up ooh okay so what's going on
here so obviously I Joe did something
very silly which is dead I'm only moving
the left and so I'm only moving the top
so if the top moves up the top moves
down and I'm just growing or shrinking
the rectangle so this is a problem and I
could get around this by saying like oh
let me move both the left and the right
and the top and the bottom but I think
what I'm realizing is it's just going to
be better for everybody involved it's
for the future of this boob gaiba
Frogger for me to just actually consider
the rectangle itself to have an X a Y a
width and a height and then when it
comes time to test for intersection
that's where I can just calculate these
values on the fly and so I need to do
that for this particular rectangle
and then for the other I'll call it oh
right oh oh right oh top oh bottom which
would be other decks so what I'm doing
is and again I'm sure this could be
optimized in some way but if the
rectangle itself keeps track of an x and
y and width and height then I can very
quickly just calculate the left right
top and bottom of one rectangle the left
right top and bottom of the other
rectangle and then I can test those so
I'm doing a little refactoring and I'm
sure I'll come up with a reason why this
was a terrible idea sometime later but
for now I can rewrite this code like
this so this is exactly the same but the
rectangle is keeping track of X Y with
it now I have a little bit of an issue
here which is that I made the arguments
here to the constructor X Y width height
and so honestly what I what I need to do
to different I'm going to say this dot X
this dot y this dot o this dot W is W
this dot Y is y and this dot H is H and
this is because in Java if I have
variables with the same name and the
temporary / am arguments to this
constructor the parameters are XY Y and
H and I want to use those to set the
rectangle object's actual XY w at X Y WH
then that's where I want to use the vist
stop here to differentiate them and I
don't have to down here because there's
no confusion so if I don't say this dot
it is this dot but I could if I wanted
to add this dot here okay but this dot
this dot I'm always talking about that
this dot okay now everything's good I
don't have to define it by I could just
define it by X Y and W and then I could
just move the X and the y so now my frog
is just so much simpler the rectangle
can have all the gobbledygook about the
how the rectangle is being considered
but the Frog just has an x and a y which
I move and now there we go I am moving
frog around the screen um okay
he went away when you left up okay whoa
eight hours all right
okay so now oh right that's a good
variable name okay so here's the thing
do I dare now go on to part I think this
might be part one I think the whole part
one was just programming the Frog so I'm
gonna start the Frog at the bottom okay
so intersect has an error all right oh
yes oh that's why everyone's saying oh
right not just because that sounds funny
oh right all right I'll come back to
that okay so I think that this is going
to be the end part 1 programming Frogger
I in the chat that's going on live right
now I have now been told that I have an
error in the rectangle which I forgot to
say oh right I just said right where
this should be
oh right and then the other thing that I
want to add to this is that I want the
Frog to start at the bottom center don't
worry I'm not leaving there's going to
be another video after this I'm just I'm
just differentiating them so I am going
to have the Frog start at width / 2 -
grid / - that's the center - half the
grid as a little bit no well and then
I'm going to say height - no no I just
want to say width / 2 - grid and height
- grid I want to put it right there I
guess I in the center so that should be
grid / - right yeah so I want it to be
there so now that I can start playing
Frogger my screen is not divisible by 50
so let's fix that let's use a let's make
this I don't know it maybe should just
be
square for simplicity 500 by 500 there
we go so now hey I won Frogger yay ok so
that's the end of part 1 in the next
video I'm going to add the cars going by
once we and that's going to be part 2
and then eventually part 3 I'm going to
add the logs and the Turtles so see you
in part 2 so um the reason why I'm doing
this I'm not going I mean I have another
40 I'm gonna be here for another 40
minutes I might just stay till I'm going
to be here for another hour and what I'm
going to do is I'm not leaving I just
want to have these divided into parts
over there shorter videos that people
could watch and maybe this will actually
only be like 20 minutes even though it
took me an hour cuz I kept stopping and
starting ok now I'm going to get in do
part 2 have a headache terrify okay so
let me think about this before we get
going each kind of car has a different
speed has a different row so maybe what
I should start first by doing is just
have one car and then cars should get
assigned a row then I could have one car
per row and then I eventually could have
multiple cars per row and the spacing is
probably somewhat random and as they get
to the end they just come back to the
beginning okay okay yeah I know I'm like
for some reason I have so much trouble
with these little simple games and yet
I'll be like I'll just do that neural
network programming thing okay here we
go
so we're going to be now in part two
stay hydrated for part two get some
energy so I know I should about doing
these live sessions before I have lunch
I need
eat a bigger breakfast clearly I didn't
have my wheeze all right I might not be
getting to that follow up perceptron
video today but okay here we go
hello welcome to part 2 of Frogger so
what I need so far in part 1 if you
could believe it I don't know it's all I
got so far was a rectangle that I can
move around the screen by pressing the
arrow keys and now what I want to do is
add some cars so I want to add the cars
that are moving across where which I
have to avoid so what I want to do is
first I already have a car tab and
hopefully I'm hoping bully am i hoping
that all the work we did to figure out
this rectangle thing and this frog thing
will pay off when it comes time to
program the car and it's going to be
really simple so let's just first do one
car eventually I'm going to need an
array I'm gonna have multiple cars but
let's just have one car and I'm going to
say car equals new car and I'm going to
put the car at zero it's going to start
at zero and it's going to be its y is
going to be height minus grid times 2
and it's size is also just going to be
grid another car and truck could have a
variable so and I'm going to I'm going
to make it up so what did I miss here
car so I'm going to have the car I'm
working this up I'm just gonna stay here
so I'm gonna have the car be start at
I'm gonna comment this out for a second
ah-oh edit this part out he screwed up
again I was going to just use the
nevermind I can describe this
this is having the car start at the
bottom two row two rows up from the
bottom and having its width be the side
of the grid and its height being - no I
want its width if it's a truck it's
going to be longer so I'm gonna have it
be a little bit wider just to try that
out and its height be just the grid then
I'm going to say a card show and let's
just see if we can see the card now the
car is not showing hmm what if what if I
dare have the car no this is a bad idea
because ultimately in some level
probably going to be drawing the cars in
different ways let's just have the car
extend I could was thinking about having
the car extend frog and I would inherit
the show function but I'm actually just
going to leave that here and I'm going
to make the car like a slightly
different color just for right now
and I'm going to I need to have the same
exact constructor basically except I'm
going to include a height and so this
now is the car so if I run this we
should see okay what happened here ah
whoops with height there we go
what did I get wrong super XY with
height something is wrong I got to debug
this that's what I was expected to see
but I want to see it wider so what I
want it to be is grid times 2 this value
goes here which goes ah whoops just the
way that I'm drawing it there we go that
was just a little bug and now there we
go so there is the truck there is the
truck or the car and okay so now we've
got that now what I need is for the car
to have maybe an update function and the
car should also have its own variable
called speed so let's just set the speed
equal to two so this is one of the
wonderful things about inheritance is I
can inherit
the properties from rectangle and then
add my own so the car is also going to
have a speed and then speed is going to
say x equals x plus updates because say
x equals x plus speed so I'm going to
say camera shuts off so I'm going to say
car update and now we have the car
moving yet I can go past it as it moves
by now when the car goes off I probably
want it to re-enter so what I prom in
update I'm gonna say if X is greater
than width then x equals negative height
never negative width so I want it to
start off the screen and re-enter so
what I mean by this is when the cars X
which is its left side gets past the
right side then it should reach on the
other side and I might want to you know
maybe have that be more of a delay or
something so I could like you know maybe
if it's you know further off the screen
I could use W I could actually probably
let me just use the grid size which is
probably oh but that I definitely want
to do a negative w u- w minus grid
there's just so many ways I could do
this but I just wanted to have a little
bit of buffer so it's got to go more
than just width and then it reenters so
you can see now I've got look at this
we're moving along now we've got the car
moving so what do I need I need to have
multiple cars okay so let's just think I
could use an array list which allows me
to have a flexible amount of cars but I
for simplicity I think I'm just going to
have a fixed amount so I'm going to say
car equals cars cars index 0 is that new
car and cars index 0 show and cars index
0 update I want to make sure that just
works what did I get wrong I didn't
initialize the array cars equals new car
with you know one
cars so let's say there's not going to
be let's just let's go look at Frogger
for a second what's a reasonable number
of cars so you can see there's one two
three one two three one two three one
one two there's some configuration but
that's three six nine ten eleven twelve
thirteen thirteen what a lovely number
let's have oh no no that's actually
twelve but whatever so let's just have
ten ten is a nice round number right now
there's only one car okay now what I
need to do is okay so how many how many
rows of cars let's say I have ten cars
and I have five rows that would give me
two cars per row I mean this is sort of
all arbitrary making this up but let's
let's think about how many rows there
are so I'm going to say for int I equals
0 I is less than let's just say there
are going to be three rows for right now
I plus plus so I'm going to say row
equals zero row is less than three row
plus plus I almost kind of want it maybe
I should do this much more manually
let's do this let's configure this
manually let's just say I'm going to do
let's keep track of an index which is
zero then this is going to be the first
row I'm going to put three cars in the
first row so the three cars there they
need a starting X location x equals I
times 100 plus 50 so what I want to do
is arbitrarily space them out and let's
just say those are there's only going to
be three cars right now there's only
going to be three cars you'll see where
I'm going in a second so I'm going to
and you know what I can actually die
forget I can use this enhanced loop
which is like a for each loop for every
car in cars
car car show car update so this is a
nice way you could say well whatever
amount of cars there are show and update
all of them okay so now what I should
have here is three now you can see I
didn't do a very good job of spacing
them out
so let's space them out more I times 200
I don't know why I have this plus 50
there I'll just take that out right so
now we can see there are there's the
bottom row right so I can now that looks
like really hard it's probably too hard
so let's just have a two cars in this
row and spaced them out by 300 pixels
and I just need to match that I only
have two so far there we go so we can
see that's one row yay yay this is
working I got distracted by my own game
so let's down dude so I'm going to put a
comment here oh and the whole point of
this is I wanted to do index I want to
keep track of the index boy and
ArrayList might be easier here because
what I'm going to do this is Row one I'm
doing this and again this could be
optimized I could do this less manually
I'm going to do Row 2 which is now I'm
going to I'm going to also add two cars
to road two so now I have a total of
four cars let me move this down here and
for Row two I'm going to add those cars
height minus grid times three right
because I need to go up another row I
want to make these just square and they
are separated by 200 pixels and let's
take a look at this now I probably want
to offset that by some amount so they
look in again this could be random and
there oh they're moving at the same
speed so each row should also get
differently and and Radek and the chat
is making a really great point which is
I should make an object which is just
like a row or a car lane object
and it can keep track of its own cars
and its position and speed I'm going to
say that's like a refactoring thing that
I'm going to suggest maybe people do as
a exercise for after it cause I'm going
to keep things kind of simple here but
that is a really great suggestion so one
thing that I want to do is give these a
speed so let's say for also I'm going to
add a fourth argument here so this has a
speed of two and this is going to have a
speed of three point five and so now the
car should also get a fourth argument
called
speed s the car constructor should get a
fifth argument so I'm going to want to
be initialized so now also these cars
which are all in Row one have this
particular speed and these cars which
are all in Row two have a different
speed okay let's run this now and there
we go
we can see this looks a bit more like
Frogger let's see oh right whether this
is difficult or easy I'm not sure let's
add one more row row three let's put in
a four cars they're going to be their
height is going to be one more spot on
the grid up and their speed is going to
be really slow but they are not spaced
out by as much I'm just picking some
random numbers this is Row three and
what did I mess up so I have two plus
two plus four is eight cars total there
we go so now I have again now I have a
whole bunch of cars and I you know again
I could also have them each have an
image associated with them at their own
animation but is this playable that's
the question yeah it looks like I made
it but have I actually so we've got a
row of cars I'm going to just keep three
but what I need to do I've got one more
feature I've got to add to this part
which is that I need to check that
intersection thing but guess what I
don't know why I spent the part one of
this videos tutorials
making Frogger doing the intersection
because just waited now but thank
goodness we did that because I have this
function already so what I want to do is
now say here if car intersects frog or
maybe I want to say frog intersects car
it doesn't matter
frog and car both extend rectangle
rectangle has in itself this convoluted
but it works we don't know that it works
and never tested it intersects function
so now I could say if they intersect
then let me do something like let me
just print let me just do a print line
you know game over or something so now
we should see look if I look down here
in the console oh is it doing it when I
wonder if there because of yeah it's
actually intersecting so I've got a
little bit of a problem which is that it
considers that when they're right next
to each other intersecting so I think I
maybe need to space out these lanes a
little bit which way I you know to give
them a little bit of buffer let's do
that I'm trying to think of which would
be the best way to do that here I've
kind of got such a ridiculous way so
let's add so let's I need to say a row
is - so - grid times actually one way
that I can do it let's just do it this
way as I'm just going to add a little
bit of buffer to pixel buffer to grid
this boy I really this really need some
serious refactoring but very good you
can see now there's a little bit of
there's a bit a little bit of daylight
and daylight in there so I shouldn't be
getting I don't see game over here I've
got a little bit of daylight so now I
can move ah
game over oh look at this oh but I
messed up the goal point of the grid
thing now my frog is off the grid
okay so Oh
timeout for a second uh what do i what
do i what do I want to do here change
the intersection code to less than or
equal great suggestion so what I'm going
to do forget about that I'd love it let
me go back we go back that was the Dyke
that was a bad digression we undo this
that's a much better idea I mean
visually I'd love it to have that
daylight there that's why I was doing
that because I think it looks a little
nicer so let me go back to running this
I don't know that you can really go as
far back as you can Matt yeah so we have
a problem here which as you can see I
see the game over already which is that
it's actually intersecting when they're
right on top widths when they're right
next to each other and that's because I
as because in my intersects function I'm
actually checking right remember I'm
negating whether they're not overlapping
and so they shouldn't be overlapping if
those edges are equal and so I think if
I add this in here that should fix that
problem oh and it's less than or equal
not equal less than less than or equal
okay all right game is not over okay so
now let's see if I can do this can I get
through them I did it
I saw no game over down here now let's
make sure the intersect function is
working game over game over
ah-ha so we have actually what do I want
to do let's let's actually just have if
instead of game over let's um let's just
reset let's call a let's call a function
called a reset game and I'm going to
make that function I'm going to just put
it up here at the top reset game and
what I'm going to do is and I think I'm
just going to just reset the frogs
location and I'm I'm gonna I'm just
going to put this here I'm going to make
a new frog object and then I'll just
call reset game here so I could be more
thoughtful about this there might be a
lot of other things
you know ultimately I'm not really doing
lives or levels and this isn't really a
reset game but one thing you can notice
here if there are a bunch of things that
you want to reset that happened when the
game starts but then also happen later
when you make when something happens
like the frog in the car collide I can
have a separate function that does all
that call that both in setup and also
down here so let's see now if I can make
it through not too hard to play actually
let me run it again and mess up yes you
can see if I mess up it just puts me
back at the beginning so we've got we've
got the basics of Frogger now part two
done I'm gonna end this part two and in
the second part I'm going to add the
logs the third part that is I'm going to
add the logs at the top that instead of
avoiding the Frog has to actually jump
on to and and ends up sticking to okay
thanks for who keeping going with me I
guess there will be a third part to this
okay
oh I still have row equals to make their
size smaller than the grid yeah all
those things would be good ideas Frogger
is supposed to move a bit more smoothly
he visually hops across he can be caught
mid jump by a vehicle oh that's
interesting
I'll let somebody else fix that where's
my water
how kiddy I haven't checked the I would
check the spinners let's check the
spinner which I won't have time today
well I forgot what the I think I closed
that do I have it here fidget spinner
stimulation let's take a look at that oh
look at this I got two yes I'll have to
come back and do that another day
it's 12:40 I so I want to do the okay so
what I want to do now is create a should
i refactor this before I do the logs to
create a lane object and the lane object
store
a certain number of cars as I'm just
going to run into this horrible problem
now while that manual hard-coding when
when I get to the next step as I also
need a safety zone I can see I need a
safety zone here please to the fidgets
spinner I think I should finish this
don't you think I only have one more
part to do I think I might not bother
with the top thing I'll leave that as an
exercise and also what happens when I
need somebody to tell me what happens
when the Frog lands on a log and the law
goes off the screen do you get to like
come back with the log right this is the
most complicated part because you have
to be attached to a particular log with
an offset okay let me fix this thing
that I still have Row 2 in the code by
accident for no reason
you die so you have to if we do you have
to jump off the log before it gets to
the other side that's sad
okay I think I can program that
confirmed okay yeah okay pushes the Frog
off okay um all right so how do I want
to do this
do I want to refactor a lean object I
think I don't I think I want to keep
with my I think I want to keep with my
lazy way of doing this because that
could come later cuz up that could come
later
you don't die straightaway it slowly
pushes you off oh you mean you stay on
it while the log is going and then and
then if the log goes you fall off the
edge ah interesting
oh car should be moving in the opposite
direction oh right I forgot about that
so I could that's easy
bye-bye just messing with the speed so
I'll do that I'll do that when I get to
the logs okay okay let me let me have
the cars move in the opposite direction
no I'm not doing machine learning today
negative speed okay let's come let's
let's go into part three data program
this okay
oh my goodness
700 some people are watching ok I gotta
head to a better job energy actually
jazz hands ok
ok welcome to part 3 of making Frogger
in a way that's terrible and I'm doing a
terrible job
I'm just trying my best here but
hopefully you're learning something or
you will make a much better version of
this what I have so far in parts wanted
to I made the Frog that moves around in
parts in part two I added the cars and I
also may implemented that if you if you
hit one of the logs hit one of the cars
I kick you bet anything straight you it
resets the game now there's a lot of
nuance to this and you know in terms of
visual design and there's a lot of ways
this could be improved but I'm just kind
of keeping it simple and I look forward
to everyone's creative improvements of
this but if you need to add something to
this all the cars are moving in the same
direction and that's not actually how
Frogger works on some rows the cars move
in the opposite direction so let's
before I get into the logs let's at
least add that so let's just say what
happens if I in row two gives the cars a
negative speed so negative three point
five instead of positive you can see
that's working but I don't have the code
for them to come back so what I need to
do in the car in update is if speed is
greater than zero so if they're moving
to the right check if they get off that
edge else by definition they're moving
to the left else if X is less than
negative grid then X then x equals a
with plus grid right so this is just the
opposite of checking instead of checking
if they're off that edge if they're
moving to the left I need to check if
they're off that edge and now we should
have yeah there we go so this is much
better already just sort of in terms of
what's going on okay
so then there should be a sort of safety
so I might maybe I'll draw these
there's like a safety row at the bottom
again and really this this project
really needs a lane object and the lane
keeps track of what's in it and I think
that that's something I'm going to leave
maybe I'll do it like a part four or
something that I make that but I just
want to visually draw something in for
those lanes so I'm going to say a
rectangle from zero height minus grid
with the full width two with a height of
grid and let's give that a sort of I
don't know what to what color to draw
this let's try let's try this okay so we
can see that's the safety lane and maybe
maybe I should give it some transparency
actually would make more sense so you
can see that's the safety lane down here
I'm going to add another safety Lane
which would be height minus grid times
where hundred we get you so far
we had grid times to grid times 3 grid
times 4 so now I'm going to add the
safety lane at grid times 5 there we go
so we can see that's a safety lane okay
so now what I need to do is start
putting some logs above okay are you
ready for logs I'm ready for logs ready
for looks ok um so what do I want to do
I already have this whole car object
could I possibly I think I could get
away with having a log extend the car
right because a log is going to have a
speed a log is going to have the same
update function a log behaves exactly
like a car there will be some difference
so let's try saying and it could be a
dog or a turtle but I'm just going to
keep everything a log right now I'm
going to make a class called log and
have it extend car let's see how this
goes then what I want to do is what's
the car constructor look like this so
what I'm going to do is just say super
right because Oh log a log is created
just like a car then okay so this is
actually pretty good we don't have any
different functionality just yet so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to create
yet another row which will actually be
like row it's actually row five
technically row I guess if the rows have
number eight the Rosa the rows are
numbered by I let me let me look at
what's what's here actually
whoops what just happened comment this
out my row numbering is horrible zero
one two three four and I'm drawing them
at but the problem is I'm drawing them
from the top so it's really getting
drawn at row plus one okay so again
ideal hole I can really need to refactor
this Oh ro Lane thing I'm kind of I
probably should do it now but I'm just
going to keep going so the next one is
not at times five that's the safety lane
that's at times six but it is row five
and I'm going to put two logs in it and
I'm going to say logs I'm going to
restart index over at zero and I'm going
to put two logs and this should be x not
five but times six and we need to have
an array called logs and right now I'm
going to say I'm just going to say I'm
going to just start with two logs and
then I'm going to logs equal to new what
did I what did I get wrong here logs a
log not logs how am i doing that I'm
adding the logs now what I'm going to do
is I am going to have
same exact loop here but I'm going to do
it for all of the logs blog so I just
want to see do I now have there we go so
you can see that those logs are
identical now let's change them up let's
make those logs have a of that row have
a whiff that three-wide let's have them
go a bit faster and let's space them out
by quite a bit more okay so now we can
see and to something else is moving
exactly at two let's um so let's move
them a little bit faster than that okay
so those are the logs now I can't
visually hmm how come they're not coming
back
Oh cars are missing what happened oh I
have a bug what's going on here cars
going to the right are no longer in the
right spot when did that happen because
I use and and not a nested oh yeah look
at this my logic is way off here oh you
excused everybody had told me this like
ten minutes ago do I have to go back
yeah I need to I really need to say hi
Agatha right I really need to say this
right I'm just testing this before I
yeah that fix it okay hold on now it's
okay can I live there for a little while
right right you can live there for a
little while okay so there was a pretty
major bug that most of you probably for
at least like five or ten minutes there
we're probably yelling at your TV
television machine I don't know how you
watch this stuff if you're even watching
it which is that anything moving to the
right
actually never came back on because of
the way that I have this this if
statement is quite long because why is
it flawed if if speed is greater than
zero and it's over to the right do this
otherwise just check if it's less than I
really need to check I really need to
also check speed here wait hold on I got
to why is that I'm like my head is
hurting here why can't I just check if
speed because things moving to the right
oh oh because oh
I understand it now I think let's say
that again
things if speed is greater than zero and
otherwise it could still be a thing with
speed greater than zero if it's no
longer over that so it gets like set
back and then it's less so it gets set
back over there so it's getting set back
and forth so I really need to check it
only I only want to do I only want to
move things back to the other side if
there actually are things that are
moving to the right so this should
really fix that problem and there we go
thank you
now we have cars and now I'm ready to
jump on a log so here's the thing oh my
goodness I really need that Lane object
right because now I need to know I
really want and if I'm on if I am not
intersecting a log and I'm up here we've
got a problem okay so I'm going to do
things very manually where I can really
just check the frogs location right I
only want to start thinking about the
logs if the Frog is we're above this
safety line what value is that so let's
just see if I could get this right I'm
going to say if frog is I'm just going
to say right now if frog dot y
if frog dot y is greater than oh no is
less than what was that safety Lane it
was grid height - grid times five height
- great I really could have done this
from the top service eight - thing but
that's my height - grid times five
background let's just test this out ooh
I have to get through the cars to test
it there we go okay so that's good this
is the correct test - now no the game is
over if I'm not intersecting a log so
let's figure that out how do I check
that boolean so what I need to do is
check all logs and if I'm not
intersecting any of them so let's do
that inside this loop if frog if the
Frog is up in that region I'm I'm going
to assume that I'm not okay I'm going to
assume that I'm not okay I'm not okay
but if log intersects frog or if frog
intersects log then okay is true right
so now if all of that is done if I say
if not okay reset game so what a thing I
want to do right now is I want to start
the Frog in the middle so let me start
the Frog in the middle which is the Frog
starts at height - grid times five right
I wanted to start the Frog there and so
if I jump just into the books if I jump
into the river but I should be able to
jump on can i why can't I jump on a log
what did I miss here what did I get
wrong here
if frog intersects a log my okay should
be out of the loop oh yeah of course
so the okay has to be out of the loop of
course because I have to start I'm just
doing this one time through draw with my
frog I'm going to assume the Frog is
okay and this also should be out of the
loop right so after all is said and done
so this now should allow me to hold on
oh wait I'm trying to jump I got it oh I
have a problem yeah I'm on a log and now
I'm not I'm on a log you can't okay
so first of all I want to draw the Frog
last so I can see what's going on here I
want to draw the Frog last so you can
see I can jump on to the log now why
can't I move do I have this wrong should
this be times six why can't I move in
the safety Lane why can't I move in the
safety Lane
Oh Oh No
so also of course oh my god crazy a
silly obvious problem here now which is
that I wonder if I should do this in a
separate loop you know what I think I
want to do this in a separate loop just
for cleaning just for sort of clarity
sake because I always want to here's
here's the reason why I always want to
show and update all the logs but only
want to deal with this frog log
intersection thing if the frogs within a
certain zone so I'm just going to do
this you know big deal let's loop
through all the logs twice so I'm going
to assume that I'm not okay cuz clearly
I'm not okay I would assume that I'm not
okay I'm going to go through all the
logs if I understand the logs I'm going
to be okay and only in this instance if
I'm not okay I'm going to reset the game
so this only happens all of this only
happens if I'm within this region over
here so now I can move freely I can even
move back down but now I am no good if I
jump into the river but I'm good if I
jump on a lot but guess what what's got
to happen now if I jump on a log I
should move with the log I should move
with the log so I need to be attached to
a log oh this is great so let's have the
Frog have a variable part of it which is
an attached log then I'm going to write
a function I'm going to call it attached
and I'm going to say attached equals
that log so this variable is going to be
by definition no at first okay now what
I'm going to do is if I intersect that
log then I want to say frog attach blog
so I want to attach the log to
talk to that log I'm also going to need
an update function so the Frog needs an
update function and the Frog it's funny
I thought this would be functionality of
the log so far the log doesn't need any
additional now I'm putting it in
the Frog which i think is okay what I
need is an update function and if
attached is not equal to no so if this
frog is attacked to some log frog dot X
plus equals that log speed it should
move according to that log speed o
attached speed okay I might need it I
don't know that I need a detach function
because when I can only be attached to
one log at a time and when I jump I'm
either going to end up in the river and
so I'm going to be the game's going to
be reset or I'm going to attach to a new
log so let's look at this now let me try
to jump onto this there we go look at
this I'm attached to it jump onto this
attack but you can see if I try to jump
off I'm reset there's a little bit of an
animation issue I really should see
myself jump off and see that I'm in the
wrong part maybe animate and then and
get reset but let's add let's add some
more lanes with some more logs okay so
this was Row 5 now I want to add row
let's add one more row row 6 let's put
three logs and those logs are less wide
and they move in the opposite direction
more slowly and they're spaced out by a
different amount just like making up
random numbers here oops and then if I
add three logs I need to make the array
have 5 in it oops and those should be at
up one more why location okay so now we
see ooh what's going on here the those
are disappearing
too early ah I have another error
I wonder if somebody I'm kind of I'm
going to when I jumped back the Frog was
still moving I definitely need a detach
okay good point good point
so reset game in reset game this is
pretty easy I should just say frog
detach also so let's add that function
or you know what I can do I don't
actually need a new function I could
just stay attached null so that's kind
of essentially detaching it just set the
attach thing to no that'll fix that
problem but I have a different problem
I've lost track of where I was the in
car right if X is less than if speed is
less than zero it's moving this way and
X is less than negative grid no no no
not grid this should not be grid this
should be this should be with plus that
should be with plus plus grid because
that's the X but I need to find when the
left side right the left side is X plus
width so W if it's less than negative W
minus grid right it should get all the
way off there we go okay so I just fix
that so now I should be able to jump
here and jump there and jump back down
and jump back up look at that jump back
down and jump back up I just could do
this all day jump and then I get reset
now the question is can I jump on to the
edge of it let's try that can I jump on
to the edge ooh come back oh it's still
moving why am I still moving oh because
when I jump down I did detach ah okay I
got you everybody so if I jump back to
the safety zone which is if I'm out of
this zone I should also make sure to
detach attach null Oh convoluted code we
could refactor this there'll be a whole
video on refactoring someday okay so now
I can jump up and jump back down
and I'm not still moving what I wanted
to show you was that Oh am I left I can
hang off the edge which I think is okay
let's make the Frog a little bit
transparent let's give the Frog a little
bit of transparency just so we can see
that better you know visually I
encourage you to think of a better way
to visually do this but we can see kind
of where the Frog is okay so I think
we're kind of done
I should add another row I should add
the buckets at the top what am I missing
call us for a second I should all oh I
know what I'm missing the Frog can't go
off the screen create a new frog they're
not require oh I can just create a new
frog not required to detach yeah good
point okay okay so there's one thing we
need to deal with this problem here goes
to frog frog my frog is gone so the Frog
can't ever actually leave the window if
the log starts to leave it needs to get
pushed off and I think there's a way
we're going to be able to do this I'm
going to do this just in the update
function I'm going to say frog dot x
equals constrain the X can never go
farther than zero on the left side and
it can never go farther than with minus
the frogs width on the right side so
let's look at this what's going to
happen now and it gets reset that was so
remarkably easy there we go and the Frog
is now going to slide and then get reset
so if I don't jump off in time so if I
let's see if I can jump off in time now
there we go it jumped off in time can
jump up so that fixes it oh my goodness
I think I said one more row and then we
can kind of be done if I just make my
Frogger thing right a little shorter I
mean I should do the buckets at the top
but you could probably do that let's add
one more row
row 7 row 7 is going to have two more
logs so seven logs it's going to have
two more logs those logs will go in the
other direction positive direction
really faster really slow
let's just make them really slow let's
make them super wide and spread out by a
lot and let's and they need to be one
row up so much hard coding here there we
go
I made this kind of easy so now yeah so
let's let's let's reset that frog back
to the bottom and now let's play Frogger
doot doot doot doot to do Hey doop do
doop do to 3:53 to do what's the Frogger
music ok I got to get past ah shoot I
did it
okay now go on this log on this log on
this log and then oh I went the river at
the top I should be allowed to get to
the top so the whole top should be
another safety zone which is like I'm
going to add another rectangle at the
top there zero zero I'm just going to
have the top be double height that's my
safety zone and so now I should be able
to say if frog dot Y is less than this
and and frog dot Y so the Frog should
really just keep track of which row it
is in oh boy the grid system the time to
refactor the whole tile based system of
this frog dot Y is and it's greater than
grid times two so this should allow me
to get to the top now okay yay
that is bugger in three parts in what's
probably like about 72 hours of
programming time with just
simple result there is a lot of
spaghetti as in this code I think I
would definitely like to come back this
won't be released as quickly as you
might I would like to come back and do a
refactoring of this to make it better I
look forward to hearing all of your
comments about refactoring so what can
you do to up soap if you're looking for
the code for this and you're at the end
of this video you can find a link to it
in this video's description there will
be both this version this processing
Java version there will be a JavaScript
version using the p5.js library and I
encourage you to add your versions to
the readme make levels make lives make a
timer add visual design add sound make
the frog green I will make the frog
green at least I will make the frog
green I will make the frog green right
now we really have Frogger and I could
very easily with inheritance that I have
so far I could and also the actual game
of Frogger has those buckets at the top
let's look at let's look at this what
did I miss
so think about this visual design create
your own visual design little animation
make your own version of this thank you
for watching this boy has this been a
struggle I am really really struggled to
make these what seemed like such simple
games but I am somewhat pleased with
this result if we put them side by side
there we go a Frogger Frogger Frogger
okay see you guys in a future coding
challenge and I will come back I think I
would like to come back and revisit this
after I get suggestions and feedback so
look forward to that video and when it
comes I will link to it in the
description see you on the next ride on
the coding train okay alright what time
is it is 1:10 unfortunately this does
bring me to the end of today's
livestream oh my goodness that was hard
and stressful um I think that what I
need is um really appreciate the nice
comments oh I feel like I did a terrible
job today umm
my neck is really hurting me I think
something about this setup
like maybe this needs to be higher but
if it's much higher that's too high okay
so let me think here if do you know I
think what it might need to do in the
introduction I think I was fine in the
introduction I don't think I need any
additional intro to the first part of
the coding challenge do I I think it was
fine so I can take five minutes and
answer some questions oh I've got to get
out of here by 1:30 and it's gonna take
me a little while to like turn
everything off make Galligan next no it
was fine okay
did I mention processing and Java at the
beginning I think I did yeah it's funny
how like such a simple thing like just
adding some color to the Frog I don't
know why whoops I couldn't think of that
I'm actually excited this is to me one
of the much more interesting games that
I've made in terms of you know snake and
Space Invaders I feel like there could
be a lot of expressive variations of
this River should be blue well I just
need to do a lane I'm going to I'm going
to do a fourth part to this so things
that I need to do I should remind myself
I should let you guys know that I'm
going to be out of town next week
Tuesday through Friday so I'm going to
hope to do a livestream this coming
Monday or Tuesday morning and what I
will do in that livestream is frogger
lane refactoring our lane slash grid
perceptron follow-up and fidgets spinner
simulation so these are the things that
I hope to do in my next livestream and
then when I come back from my trip out
of town there's a good solid three weeks
where I'm in town
and so I hope to really dive into the
neural network stuff then it'll be
around the sort of July 4th sort of
stuff here
okay um make it all more squared ok I'm
exhausted
this was 2 hours and 15 minutes my neck
hurts tired
I hope editing magic makes this
interesting and enjoyable to watch yeah
I know the face pump of the fidgets
better add color no no this is for all
of you to to recreate this magic with
your own visual design I will keep mine
lame color can we do the same coding
with JavaScript rather than Java or it's
going to be very different so I will
release me I am semi volunteer deported
but I will if anybody else can help
deport it and I will certainly be happy
to port it myself it will look very very
similar the thing that will be the most
different is how the object-oriented
stuff works I'm not so convinced
honestly right now I kind of don't know
that this inheritance thing really added
a lot of value here I mean I did get
because the log could actually really
just be the car it's just like a and it
really I'm just interacting with it with
the frog in a different way so but the
rectangle could just be a piece of data
inside of the car object but c'est la
vie I learned a lot today thanks that's
nice hi from France Bonjour it didn't
add much about you
oh the object-oriented thing not my the
not my whole loot session ok that's good
yeah I you know it's funny like I I have
a new appreciation for game programming
and people who teach game programming
and you may sort of take it for granted
that intern eyeing patterns because I
think that I'm just sort of flying by
the seat of my pants or these things and
you clearly can see that there would be
some there's some like reusable ideas
and patterns and libraries that would
make doing this stuff so much easier ok
so thank you guys I will put on my
goodbye song
I feel silly before you use two and a
half minutes
Thank You mantra okay I'm going on a
vacation to Canada sometime later in
July are we going to Newfoundland I have
any drinks of bird-watching go see the
puffins I hope your st. John's if I have
any viewers from that part of Canada
please let me know give me your
recommendations you can do a live nature
coding trade episode
any plans for the hundredth livestream
what number of my own what number of my
own I don't have plans for the hundred
fly stream I need ideas for that
hopefully the time he works up you know
what should I do for the hundredth
livestream one is I could wear a full
train conductor outfit that's what idea
I have one sitting over there that's
idea number one for the hundreds
livestream no that's the I'm on the 73rd
coding challenge signing the live
streams actually have a different number
so I think I'm um this is like 95 or
something
in terms of wive streams
oh I didn't read a read burns quote
today I don't remember what the last one
I read was I think okay here's another
one if you can resist the temptation to
run back to the shelter of your comfort
zone yeah you know I have to say doing
this YouTube channel as much as I it is
definitely exercising because this does
not feel comfortable at all today so
that's a piece of advice you can take
with you today do the hundredth live
inside a tree uh yeah the London trip
that I didn't speak about at one time
unfortunately did not have is that
happening I will post about my travel in
the slack group for those of you who
would love to have a meet-up or
something
european meetup some point so have to
put that on hold for another summer or
another time but i am still trying to
plan a nigga be next fall hundredth live
should be entirely sad let that idea
mine I always wanted to be
okay make railroad tycoon sounds hard
okay oh five more seconds thank you
everyone for tuning in I will be
actually be back this coming Monday or
Tuesday if things go well and then there
will be another week hiatus before
another live stream so thanks for
watching
patreon.com slash coding train
processing foundation org to support
processing coding trade Storenvy comm if
you want to get this t-shirt I don't
know why you would want to but if you do
and I will see you all in a future live
stream at Schiffman on twitter is a
great way to get in touch and I will see
you all again soon
goodbye enjoy your weekend</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
