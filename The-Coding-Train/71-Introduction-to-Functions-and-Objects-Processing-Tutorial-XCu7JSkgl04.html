new section of videos all about
object-oriented programming is my
microphone on it is on we are recording
okay great so here's the thing we have
been learning all this stuff without
programming and it's been great but now
comes the time where we need to start to
look at tools and ways of organizing our
code make it more scalable for the
future you know we just rewrote some
variables up at the top and put some
stuff and set up and put some stuff and
draw and it's getting bigger and bigger
and bigger we need to start being able
say hey here's the part of the code that
does this here's the part of the code
that does this I want to set this aside
over here set this aside over here start
to organize our code with two key
principles principle number one is
essentially what I've just been talking
about right now modularity we need to
make our programs more modular we need
to understand them in sections and so
that we can come back to them later and
see what part is doing what in addition
to modularity we need to think about
reusability maybe that's one word maybe
I don't mean that - there reusability we
just wrote all this code which figured
out how to make this ball fly on the
screen in this really cool pattern well
we want to be able to reuse that code
again later if you want hundred of those
balls in the same program or if we later
when we're writing another programming
processing we want to take something we
did before and reuse it again okay so
that's what we want to do so let's think
about on what this really means okay
energy is coming up here this is the
next videos cuz you're much better this
is just a little intro and you can
actually skip the next one if you want
but if you want a little bit more
thinking on what I'm going to do right
now in the next minute or two before we
move on to the nuts and bolts here is
just look at the picture where we want
to be at the bare
end of the next five six videos over
here we have a simple bouncing ball
sketch this is one of the basic things
we've written in processing we have an x
and y variable we have an x be 2y speed
the ball is bouncing around it
increments by its speed every frame it's
drawn as a circle we check if it's in
the edge down here and we send the speed
in the opposite direction this is a nice
lovely program but again it's got some
variables up here just one little
function and set up and a whole bunch of
stuff happening and draw what if we
could instead write this very same
program like this what if I could say
I'm going to have a ball object called B
and in setup I'm going to say hey B is a
new ball object and draw I'm going to
say things like you know B should move
about the screen that ball B it should
move about the screen and that ball B it
should bounce off the edge and that ball
B it should also be displayed this is
where we're going towards this is where
we want to be look at this it's so
beautiful it's like look at all this
gobbledygook stuff and what's that x4
what's that Y for this program is so
nice and relaxing we have a ball we're
going to start that make that ball and
set up and we're going to move that ball
bounce that ball display that all we're
going to ask you to do things this is
more readable now this is not making our
program more efficient for processing
from the computer no one really cares
about it from the computer standpoint
but we the human thing right here can
feel more comfortable with this it's
modular we have sections we have the
code we have a function that's being
called to move the ball we have a
function three call to bounce the ball
we have a function to call to display
the ball these are modular pieces in our
program now we have this idea of
reusability we just have this ball
object if I wanted to add another one I
wouldn't need all these new but I would
need another excellent otherwise another
XP
otherwise I could just maybe add another
ball object because a hey I want to have
two of them b2 is my second ball object
so this is where we're going towards we
want to be able to start taking all this
stuff that we're writing to all this
stuff is conceptually centered around
the idea of this ball bouncing around
the screen can we take all this and
package it up into this mini program in
the way this mini program that's going
to live somewhere else that's going to
be called a ball class we're going to
write something called class ball
there's almost as if this is like a
little mini program that has everything
embedded inside it to to the bouncing
ball it's got the variables that a
bouncing ball needs it's got the
functionality that a basketball needs
this is where we're going if we can
write this program that it's this sort
of modular piece it's all the stuff
about the bouncing ball and we can reuse
it we could make balls in this program
we could make balls in another program
balls everywhere yay ok so this is where
we're going for it before we can get all
the way to this point you know there's
lots to hear what's the syntax that's
dot you know what does this mean that we
have a variable of type ball it account
would be and how are we going to write
this class in the first place there's
lots of details we need to fill in there
before we can get to any of these
details what we need to understand first
is a little bit about writing our own
functions so this the next video is
going to start with saying hmm
what does it mean to call a function
processing we're doing this all the time
line rect background fill etc what does
it mean to write our own function so
that's where we're going to start once
we get from functions and learning how
to break our program up into separate
functions then we'll start to build put
those functions together wrap them into
an object and that's where we're going
it's going to be very exciting it's
going to allow us to have lovely
relaxing soothing code just like this
and it's going to be great I forgot to
do the time around to actually no idea
how long this video was but this is
where I'm going to stop and we're
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
