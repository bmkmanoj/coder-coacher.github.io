called git and github for poets and I'm
very excited about this particular
section because what I'm going to do in
this session is sort of crucial to your
life as a user of git and github what I
did before was show you all of these
concepts right here's my list of
concepts you have a git repository you
can make commits which are like changes
you can make branches you can merge
branches you can fork you can do a pull
request all these types of things that
you can do with the get software you can
do all those things just using the
github website through its interface
however the truth of the matter is if
you're going to be working with this for
open source projects or even other kind
of creative ideas of how you might want
to work with git you're ultimately going
to want to work on your own laptop so in
the previous video I talked through the
basics of just using this terminal so if
you don't know how to use terminal go
back and watch the previous video but if
you do you're in the right place and
you're ready to actually download and
install git onto your local computer now
I'm not going to do this in the video so
if you're watching this in real time
pause go to this URL get - SCM com
download install git once you've done
that open up terminal and you'll be
ready to continue with me so to make
sure everything's working what you want
to do and I'm going to just oh whoops
I just want to get into the right place
so I'm in the trash okay I want to be
just in I want to be on my desktop okay
so I am now on my desktop that's where I
want to be be somewhere and your
Documents folder your desktop where you
can start adding files desktops going to
work for me and we'll thing that I want
to do is just type the words get so if
you see this you're in good shape now my
fonts kind of big so this looks kind of
like a mess it'll hopefully look nice
and neat on your particular laptop I'm
gonna hit clear if you see this now well
I misspelled get to make sure I got this
error if you say get colon command not
found then you're get get is not
installed properly try again ask a
question in the comments here hopefully
I can help you figure out where you
missed that or make another video for
one of the common problems but hopefully
you're actually get is working and when
you only type get what you get is a lot
of explanation of well you need to
you also a command so everything about
using it locally is all about saying get
something like you can imagine what this
is get commit make a commit make a
change make it save a change so the
first thing though like if I just type
this the first thing that's going to
happen is think not again repository so
this directory is not a git repository
what is a git repository remember this
thing this rainbow poem this is a git
repository so what you need to issue git
commands is a folder on your computer
which is a git repository this is
essentially a folder on the github
server you now want a folder on your
computer so I could just go and grab
this exact repository and bring it down
to my computer and then work with it
there and I'm going to do that in either
this video or the next one but I think
it would be useful just to show you what
happens again when you start fresh so
there are two ways of starting fresh one
way is actually just saying get in it
and I'm going to show that to you at the
end of this video or in the next one but
I think an easier way for you to work
when you're getting started is make your
repository on github and then download
it to your computer and I keep saying
the word download but in a mobile suit I
got to start saying push and pull
because ultimately pull pull it or clone
it is actually a new term so we're going
to get some new concepts here and this
idea of cloning so cloning is the act of
taking a repository that's on a server
like github and cloning it to your
computer downloading a kind of copy of
it to your computer that you can work
with and then you could push it back or
you could pull from the server again if
there are changes that are server that
not or that are in your computer we'll
get to that in a moment okay so here I
am so let's go back to github and I'm
going to go over here and I'm going to
say create a new repository and I'm
going to call this one rainbow song this
one will be a song and a song about
rainbows and and one thing that I want
to do that's kind of important here is I
want to check this box here initialize
this repository with a readme the reason
why I want to do this is it's going to
make a lot easier to work with if the
repository on get
has a file associated with it already
and I'll show you the difference when I
show you get in it a little bit later
okay so I'm going to select that and I'm
going to hit create repository and now
something really so this is an empty
repository I did this before it's my
rainbow song but right here this is
what's really really important there is
a special URL here this is the URL for
the repos file for its for its porous
repository this is the URL you need to
clone it to your computer now there are
different options choose a clone URL
HTTP recommended so this is what you
want to use if you don't want to get
fancy there is it in other words I'm
going to do it this way and it's going
to ask me for passwords every once in a
while if I'm trying to save changes and
that sort of thing
there is a way to store your user and
password name permanently to be able to
on your laptop be able to push and pull
and work with github that requires this
other SSH option which I will show you
in a separate video because it's kind of
like this convoluted thing so for now I
just want to use this HTTP and I want to
hit copy and I want to go here
back to terminal and we're going to do
our first local terminal git command
here comes everybody
I need my drum roll sound effect doesn't
get clone I'm by the way pasting works
in terminal so I'm going to hit command
V and you can see there it is and you
can see that's the URL github github
comm slash rainbow coder slash rainbow
dash song dot git incidentally this is
exactly this same exact URL just with
dot get at the end because dot git is
actually kind of like this sync saying I
want the URL of the repository itself
not the sort of web interface to the
repository and so once I'd hit that and
I wish my font I wish it fit all in one
line let's see if I there we go that's a
little nicer once I hit enter you can
see it's cloning out for a large if this
was a repository with a lot of files
this would take quite a while as its
downloading everything but you can see
it counted objects three total three
reuse the blah blah blah blah 100% done
checking connectivity done so it's
giving you
debug information about what's going on
and now I can say open dot and I'm on to
the desktop and we can see look there's
a repository called rainbow song now
there's nothing in it but that readme
file because that was the only thing
that was in the repository in the
repository on github so let's say I want
to actually make some changes to it now
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
drag this down here and I'm going to
open it with I'm just going to open it
with sublime text I was using whoops so
any text editor will do you can use atom
actually there's some nice things about
using atom with git I mean I'll use that
in a different video and I can just go
to this file you can see there's the
that readme file now this readme file is
written in a format called markdown and
this markdown is just a markup language
to like and the pound sign means a
header that sort of thing
so I just do a testing a song about
rainbows in the key of C major so I'm
gonna make that change I hit set save
and now I'm going to show you another
git command so we're making a list of
them clone as one here's another one
that's very useful get status okay so
I'm coming back over here and I'm going
to show you get status get status ah not
a git repository why is it not a git
repository I cloned it the directory is
there but I'm not in that directory so I
need to CD into that directory and I can
make sure I've been there by saying I'm
in desktop rainbow song and now I should
be able hit get status
look at this it's telling me lots of
information I'm on the branch master
remember branches I'm up to date with
origin but I've modified this file so if
I've modified this file now even though
so this is what's different when you
were on github and you edited a file and
hit save you actually made you change
the file and committed it to the
repository at the same time right now
this file is just floating there is a
change I could get rid of the change I
could just I could keep it whatever but
what I want to do is actually say that
change I made I really want to commit it
so what I'm going to do say is get
commit that's another command in this
list now local commits are
be up here so that's not a new command
but we want to issue now this command
commit and I want to issue that command
locally now commands need arguments the
first way I'm going to show you how to
do this is with the argument - a the
argument - a essentially stands for all
just like anything that was changed
anywhere commit all of it in probably in
a separate video I'm going to show you
about how you can only commit certain
changes and not other changes and
there's a add command which is like a
step before commit but this is a good
way of getting started git commit dash a
and I'm going to now oh and then if I
want to add a comment I'm going to - M
for a message - M for message I'm going
to say adding the key of C and in quotes
so this is now get commish commit get
commish git commit - a commit any
changes I made to any files - M with
this message
adding the key of C so I'm going to hit
enter and you can see ah now here's the
thing oh boy so this is that it's going
to happen to you once and only once in
your life unless you change your name or
email that sort of thing so it might
happen to you again what it's telling me
is it's saying I don't know who you are
like I need an author to be associated
with this particular get change now if I
were on github in the browser and I made
a change it knows who I am because I'm
logged in right I'm logged in as the
user rainbow coder so it doesn't have to
ask me who I am but on my computer it
doesn't know who I am
so what I need to do is tell my computer
Who I am who I'm going to be when I make
get changes now if you want to have
multiple get users that can get very
like messy and complicated there's
probably way of doing that maybe I'll
give you about that someday but for now
I'm just going to do this I'm going to
actually just copy this command get
config - Det so to set my username
rainbow coder that's my username then
I'm going to copy this one and set my
email now this is very important I don't
know if it matters whether your username
exactly matches
Hubb you probably should have it matched
you your email needs to exactly match
the email you signed up for github with
and I actually signed up with Daniel dot
Schiffman plus rainbow at gmail.com so
I'm going to enter that in so that
should be done and by the way it hit
clear again if I want to check to make
sure that worked another command is a
git config list I think nope git config
- - list there we go so you can see this
is listing all of the configuration
settings forget on this local computer
and you can see my username and user
email is now set so I should and if I
type git status whoops I want to go back
and hit git status so uh it actually so
we managed to make that commit it did
actually do that commit but it just it's
uh it's it used like some anonymous
username or the username that's on my
laptop so that's not good so one thing
it doesn't really matter let's you know
I'm gonna I'm gonna let that be there's
a way there's an amend command which I
could amend my previous commands commits
to be now with my particular username
that I am now but what I'm going to do
is just make another change and I'm
going to say in the key of C major the
song is a happy song and I'm going to do
git status I made a change I'm going to
do get commit I want to grow back invite
ups I want to find that command again
get commits there it is and adding a
happy song so now I'm going to show you
another command that you can use log so
give the command log allows you to see
locally the history of your git commits
to be honest it's much more convenient
to look at this stuff on github because
you have a nice visual interface for
doing that but every once in a while you
might want to see that and what I'm
actually going to do is type git log - -
which should show me only the last two
come
so they only have been two commits so
you can see here it is and now you can
see the difference you can see this
author is coding rainbow Daniel dot
Schiffman plus rainbow jet Gmail whereas
the author the first commit is
processing it made some default user
based on my computer's law so you wanna
you what you want to do is set your
username and email before you do that
first commit okay oh oh something very
important that I didn't show you you can
get into this place this very dangerous
place by accident called vim then I'm
using sublime as a text editor Adam is
another nice text editor that you can
use text edit is a text editor
vim is a terminal based command line
based text editor and when you type in
things like git log you're actually in
this place that you can never get out of
I am in vim because somehow I'm in this
weird text editor thing where it wants
me to do stuff that I don't want to do
so I can always type colon shift colon
and then type Q to get out of it so
often when get if you end up in that
text editor you could just you on type
colon and queue and it will get you out
of it now you may be you're a kind of
person who wants to use vim and vinz I'm
sure is a wonderful place for many
people but it is also a place of
heartache and despair and danger so : q
: Q that's the new song for today if you
get stuck in Vinland now I'm going to
type git status and here we are now I'm
reaching the end of this particular
tutorial video because I've been going
on and on and on or not what is it that
I what is it that it's missing now here
my readme file here in this particular
repository has changes that are not
reflected on github itself and you can
see that right here that we're seeing
the old readme file here on github so
now I want to talk to you about the
concepts of push and pull I mentioned
these concepts when I talked about pull
requests so I'm adding to here push and
pull so let's review this
this is github this is you working
locally in your terminal pushing is the
act of sending to github pulling is the
act of receiving from github so what
I've done is I've worked on my
repository here locally and the changes
that I've made here no longer exist are
not reflected on github so I want to
push to github when would you want to
pull from github well maybe somebody
else is also working on your repository
and they push some changes to github and
you don't have those changes on your
laptop then you would want to pull so
github being the sort of central place
for multiple people to contribute to and
you could always push your changes there
and pull other people's changes back
down to yours so let's just look at push
back over here now Here I am again I'm
going to say get push huh it doesn't
know what to do now I've discovered
there's another really key aspect of
this there is another command to add to
our list called remote this is me
working on my laptop on my git
repository github is now an example of a
remote a remote is a duplicate instance
of your repository that lives somewhere
else on a remote server you can have
multiple remotes for a particular
project in most of the cases into my
tutorial videos I'm just going to have
one remote github as that particular
remote so what I need to do is say where
when I say git push I need to say git
push where so you might think that what
I would say is get push github because
what I want to do is get pushed to my
remote github now it doesn't know what
that is
so it doesn't it gave me a bunch of
error messages so I'm going to type
something get remote ah this lists me
all the remotes associated with my
project one of which is called origin I
can actually also say git remote - V
the vs meaning verbose and it's showing
me more origin is actually this
particular URL so now I don't want to I
want to say git push origin so origin is
the name of the remote it's just
whatever default name that github and
get used when you clone your repo
originally it just calls it origin it's
the where it word where it came from
it's it's it's the origin of this
particular repo so git push origin
should be enough right nope gave me some
more actually it didn't give me those
Eric gave me a lot of a lot of error
method junk I think it tried to do it
with sub default but I'm missing one
piece I need to say the remote which is
origin and then I need one more argument
which is the branch see how much more
work this is to work locally through
terminal it just all I did to do is it a
commit button on github and I was done
but I want to push origin branch master
so I'm just working in the master branch
right now we're going to do fancier
stuff with branching and all that sort
of thing later get push origin master
get push origin master denied to
shipment oh you I'm not shifting
I'm rain vocoder timeout pause this
video tutorial
I'm back and ready to push to github the
reason why I had a problem is I've
logged into my computer previously as a
different username and it still thought
I was that so I fixed it now and I'm
ready to say git push origin master here
we go get push origin master now this is
what you should see of course it's not
going to just let me do this because it
doesn't know who I am you need to if
whether I have access rights to that
particular repository on github now in
fact I do and I should be able to enter
in my github username right here and
then I should be able to enter it in my
github password so hopefully I remember
right here and hit enter and it happened
there we go
now you can see it gave me information
about the stuff being sent to github and
I can go here and I can hit refresh and
you can now see the new text is here and
if I go under commits you can see here
now the good news is remembering this
particular commit has an incorrect user
name I didn't go back and fix it because
I don't really care who big deal but you
can see that this particular commit is
assigned to the correct user because my
git settings on my laptop are the same
username as my username on github
username and email okay so this video
turned out to be a little bit less than
my original II intended but let me just
recap for a second and talk about what
I'm going to do in the next one
so all we did in this video was create a
totally new repository on github cloned
it to our laptop made some changes to it
and pushed it back and while doing that
we realize we have to install git on the
laptop we have to know about Unix
commands and I have to also make sure
that my global username and email
settings are configured once you've done
that you're kind of good to go for a
much longer period of time and in
because you don't have to do all that
again
nope just say that I always spent like a
half an hour try to get my username
correct if you're watching this that's
why I've gotten lost my train of thought
here in the next video I'm going to show
you how to make a fresh repository from
an existing folder on your computer and
send that to github because a lot of
cases you might actually have already
made something on your
that you want suddenly turn into a
repository on github so I'll show you
that not using the git init command in
the next particular video and from there
I'm going to keep going with more and
more types of things that you might want
to do with working with other people's
repositories and branching and merging
and all sorts of other possible things
that you might need to do at some point
okay see you in the next video maybe if
you choose to continue to watch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
