moment this is an exciting moment in
time you know what are we really doing
here I have no idea but we are getting
to the point where we are almost ready
for this circle when it reaches this
edge of the window to turn around and
come back come on you can do it okay
almost we are getting there we're ready
to do that so how are we going to do
that we're going to use a conditional
statement that's what the last two
videos that you may or may not have
watched one of them was kind of a
complete disaster so you didn't watch
that one
well we're demonstrating how to
conditional statements work well let's
let's let's take a look at our scenario
here we have a processing window we have
a circle in that crossing window the
circle is drawn at an excerpt X that is
the circles X location the circle moves
every frame a certain amount in our
program here we can see it says circle x
equals circle X plus 2 so it moves two
pixels every frame we can think of that
as the X speed for example that's the
speed it's moving along the x axis you
know this should really bring about for
you what's the thing that we want to add
to our program if we're talking about
the fact that there's this value that
goes here that we could gain XP well we
should have a variable for that and I
kind of jumped the gun with this because
that's something we're going to discover
if I had not mentioned that right now we
would discover this in a moment that we
need that to be a variable to execute
our task but I'm just going to add
another variable at the top you're going
to call it X speed equals 2 and we're
going to say circle x equals circle X
plus XP the nice thing about this is if
I decide I want the circle to be really
slow because I want to have it be really
dramatic I can change that to point to
what we see moving there
very very very very very slowly across
the screen we can let that go for a
little bit you can talk it see we could
get back here before it reaches the X
that's a good challenge so I did two
minutes at Bart we're doing well okay
so first we have to decide for ourselves
what's our condition for when the circle
reaches the edge well you can say if the
circles X location is at the width of
the window well what does it mean to be
at the width of the window maybe you
want to say if it equals the width of
the window if circle x equals with turn
around that's what we want to say turn
around so this is reasonable but it's a
bit of a problem area treat a little
ball is still good let's get over there
stop it stop it okay so let's add that
bit of code and I'm going to say if
circle x equals the width of the window
do something I'm going to just print a
statement turn around so and I'm also
not going to have it go at point two
pixels let's have it go at two pixels
and let's run and see what happens oh I
lost my line of code so now I delete it
by X and X equal circle x equals circle
X plus X speed run this again it's going
it's going it's going it's filling
moment we should see a little message
pop out I just want it to reach the edge
and it printed her around sure you can't
read that says turn around but it says
turn around
is that how did the screen no it's not
out of the screen it's just out of my
preview one just ignore me this is all
magic how this all works who tubs okay
see this is the problem I just start
like losing nutrients on a minute goes
by okay so we see but what's the problem
to stain it this is a big problem this
is kind of good
but it's not great what if I were to say
X speed equals I'm gonna make up some
number two point eight nine because it
this is really really important this is
exactly the baton that I've always
imagined X speed should be I mean come
on two point eight nine eight two six
seven two six three six four that's such
a good speed right okay so here it goes
here it goes we're going to see it's
going to get to the end it's going to
get to the edge okay nothing printed out
why because if you add this up a bunch
of times it's not going to be exactly
360 pixels so a much better way of doing
this would be to say if Circle X is
greater than or equal to or greater than
the width this way if it just so happens
that it was here and then the next frame
it was here we're still going to
register that as long as it's gotten
past the window now we want to execute
some tasks so a little bit of a
digression just into revealing with how
you deal with something along the edge
but an important one nonetheless that's
greater than is going to be much better
than equals here
okay we're five minutes is okay okay so
now we're good and we're going to say if
it's greater than with now just to be
simple for a second I'm going to say
well how would you say okay think how
would what would you write there to have
a turn around well how do you get it to
go forward to get it to go forward you
say circle x equals circle X plus speed
right so David go backwards you say
circle x equals circle X minus speed so
it gets greater than width why don't we
just tell it to go backwards right okay
good I don't know I like your line of
reasoning there it was pretty reasonable
that's what you were thinking right
that's not what I was thinking but
that's because I already did this before
circle X with circle X minus XP right
let's run that this seems pretty good
okay it's getting the edges can the edge
gain entrance very chromatic was kind of
it well that's kind of a good effect we
got it to stop at the edge this is a big
moment for us it stopped at the edge but
is it really stopping at the edge this
is where you really first of all we
could debug this problem by putting a
print statement in there and seeing what
the value of circlex is but this is not
right we need to figure out how to get
it to turn around it's not turning
around so what's happening here okay so
let's just say for a moment that the
value of circlex it start
zero let's give it a speed of 10 so it's
like super fast this is like the fastest
circle moving across the screen I've
ever seen boom is stuck there it's 10 is
that greater than with no so it's 20 is
that greater than with no so it's 30 is
that greater with no it's doing that
over and over again eventually gets to
be 350 is that greater than with no is
360 brother with nobody is 370 greater
with yes so we don't say circle X is 370
which equals 370 Highness 10 so now it's
360 is that greater than with no so we
go stranded 70 it's stuck on the edge we
don't want it what this is saying here
what this code is saying is when it gets
to the edge have it go back one time and
then keep going forward and then have to
go back one time and then keep going
forward we don't want to do that we want
to say having to permanently start to go
backwards so how do we have it
permanently start to go backwards well
why is it permanently going forwards in
the first place it's permanently going
forwards because it's X speed is 10 so
what if I actually here manipulated its
X speed value and said XP equals
negative 10 it's zooming across and boom
in something back again we can
accomplish that that we can we can deal
with that we can handle it if circle X
is less than zero set it to go forward
boom boo-boom we have a bouncing ball
ladies and gentleman this is very
exciting this is a big moment of what we
have now is two conditional statements
one what kind of so confuse I used to
draw this but not just got this thing
here um what is is telling it to
whatever reaches the right-hand side of
the screen
to set it speed to be negative whenever
reaches the left-hand side of screen to
sense feed to be positive here's the
thing if you're thinking about this if
you've learned about if you watched our
overly long video about logical
operators ahead and an aura net could we
say more generically if it gets to one
side of the screen or if it reaches the
other side of the screen turn around how
could you say turn around well let's
think for a moment ten means go this way
negative ten means go this way so if the
value is 10 you want to switch it to be
negative 10 if not was negative 10 we
want to switch it to be 10 how do we
reverse the polarity of a number if it's
positive make it negative its negative
make it positive
multiply it by negative 1 we get
negative 10 10 times negative 1 is
negative 10 10 times negative negative
10 is negative 1 is 10 genius so here we
go and we say we can say X speed equals
x speed times negative 1 and we now have
exactly the same effect but we've
reduced it into one statement if it's
greater than with or if it's less than
zero reverse the speed of that now as it
there's a couple things you might try to
do as an exercise now that you've
watched this video one is add Y I have
it bounce around along the y axis 2 is
having speed up or slow down each time
it hits the wall this is kind of an
interesting problem and actually I'm
going to show you in a second so if you
don't want the answer to how they can
slow down pause or quit out for a second
I feel like I'm like the NBC and um you
know the Olympics have already happened
but I know but I'm not going to
broadcast until later so I'm telling you
to stop watching never mind it was
ridiculous right okay so um the other
thing that you should try is is to think
about gravity so how could you make
gravity work and that maybe I'll do a
little video about that but that's sort
of like that's that's part three that's
a little bit advanced when we have this
is from overworking those three
exercises or we'll be like right below
you like on this browser page that
presumably you're watching this on
whatever um so anyway just just as
interesting a little token here we could
do something like have it always slow
down something it cost us a problem to
watch yeah
you know those cameras only record for
12 minutes and for good reason because I
apparently can't get myself to stop so
I'm actually going to leave this here
but I'll leave this as like as this open
question why did this not work why did
it suddenly get stuck I mean if I
increase the speed it's not going to get
stuck let's say it gets and let's start
it a little slower because it's going to
happen so quickly so let's say each time
it hits a boundary speed up a little bit
multiply yourself by 1.1
so you're speeding up by 10% right you
can see you son hits the wall starts to
go a little bit faster faster and faster
and faster but if you could watch this
on your own time because I only got
although the stuff was still recording
but I think I got like 10 seconds left
but as an exercise and I'll come back to
this why does this break it figure that
out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
