coding challenge in this challenge I am
going to attempt to add networking so
this is where I last left off obviously
this is not the fully formed game agario
it will not be by the end of this video
but it will give you a lot of the tools
and basics if you wanted to recreate it
but hopefully you're watching this to
learn about how to do some of this up
and invent your own idea anyway so this
was what I had before
I have this sort of like world that I'm
in that I can move around and I can
start eating other little dots so but
now what I need to do is take this this
is a one player version of the game
there's no all the dots are just created
randomly I need to make a version where
if I launch it one in a browser and you
launch it in another browser we're both
seeing each other in each other's canvas
so I'm not going to start from the very
very beginning with this because I do
already have a playlist and set of
tutorials about node and WebSockets so
I'm just going to show you the that
drill makes this example see how this in
this canvas I am drawing a little
pattern here I'm gonna refresh that
because really what I want to draw is a
nice rainbow
that's the worst rainbow ever drawn in
the history of time but you can see as I
draw here it shows up over there as I
draw here you know it shows up on the
other screen so what is the what is the
schematic what's the diagram of the
things that are happening here
there is browser instance one that's a
browser there is browser instance two
and in this case both browser instances
are on my laptop and that's how I'm
going to demonstrate everything today
but certainly the idea here is that I
could be playing this here in New York
and you could be playing it in London or
in Rio or in Tokyo or an Istanbul
whatever any city that you could think
of around the world I don't know why
those cities popped into my head but
they did so um and then there is a
server which is written in node J s and
the canvas the game itself is written
just in using p5.js
inside and what's happening here is
there is communication these clients
don't talk to each other they both talk
to the server and when one talks to the
server I can send my position to the
server and the server can then send my
position back to the other one so I
think this is the way there's a lot of
different ways you could probably
implement this I think what I'm going to
do is have each client drive around its
own world and broadcast its position to
the server and then the server will
broadcast the positions of all the other
clients back to all the other clients so
they can draw those other clients in
their own window that sounds a little
bit like loop-d-loop Dee but hopefully
you'll start to make sense once we start
a program okay I'm going to come back
over here and this is where I have the
code for both of those projects so this
is a this is the code for the first
agario example and this is the code for
that sockets example that does the
shared drawing canvas so now what I want
to do is I want to grab there's this
public folder right here this public
folder is where the client-side code
lives so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to take the agario folder and I
actually I want to leave this I'm going
to I'm going to do something a little
weird I'm going to do canvas I just want
to be able to refer to this code I'm
going to put that in a different folder
and I'm going to take agario
and put that into here so now you'll
notice the note server is running on the
port 3000 so if I take localhost 3000
like I don't see anything but now if I
go to canvas you'll see this is that
program and if I then go to agario
oh that didn't show oh because you know
I didn't show up
let's check Oh a gauri oh one I forgot
that I called it agario one there it is
there so I'm just now my note server is
serving both the shared canvas client
code and the agario code and that's
useful to me because right now I want to
be able to pull pieces of the code from
the shared canvas into a gardius oh I
can so I can
get now have to retype all that socket
code from scratch okay so now let's go
back to Adam and what I want to do is uh
so I'm not going to adjust the server at
the moment this is all the code for the
server and again it does the sort of
basic stuff of setting up a poor
listening for connections
spitting something out to the console
when somebody connects and then there's
some messaging stuff the massive except
is all going to have to change the
messaging stuff is what is happening for
the shared canvas drawing I'm going to
have to change that but what I want to
do is I really want to look at the
client code so I want to look at the
canvas sketch and I want to look at my
agario sketch so I both of these open I
have the agario sketch and the canvas
sketch and what I want to do is add a
socket first I want to add a socket
variable and and then I want to connect
I want to connect when the sketch starts
to the server so this is the basic idea
the first thing I want to do is add a
web socket to add a web socket to my
agario code now I'm missing a piece I
believe because now I believe if I were
to run that we're going to see an error
message where it's like IO is not
defined so I actually in addition to
that I need to make sure I actually
access the I so I'm in the wrong place I
need to make sure I actually access the
socket library as well so I can access
the socket library by referencing a link
to socket IO in the index.html so I'm
also going to take that and go to the
Agha Rios index.html file and add a
reference to the socket IO library and
now you'll see there we go and if I look
back at the server you can see we have a
new client so I'm going to restart the
server and I'm going to refresh agario
and you can see this agario sketch has
now connected to the server great okay
so now we've got step one we've got the
sketch connecting to the server are you
guys with me here are you with me please
be with me I'm very happy and that's
really like it's just an exciting moment
just to have it connect so let's look
now but one thing we've really got to
think about is I've got to look at my
agario code now this should go away
notice how I had this bit of code at the
beginning that just makes a whole bunch
of blogs but there's no point in making
these random blobs anymore the blobs
should only actually exist if they're
actual people playing the game so I am
going to get rid of this in addition
when I connect I should in addition to
just connecting create a new instance of
a blob this server is going to have to
keep track of a list of all the clients
that are currently connected and I think
we're going to have to figure out some
way of giving those clients an ID number
and there are probably some very clever
and sophisticated ways I could come up
with assigning IDs I might just to get
started use the counter 0 1 2 3 so we've
got something that's going on here that
I want to just think about here the
server needs to keep track of list of
connected clients this is data that the
server needs to keep track of and that
list is essentially going to be mirrored
in the client as well and then the
server is just going to update the
positions continuously so when I go back
to the server code right remember now
it's very tricky to keep track of what's
the server with the client especially as
they're both written in JavaScript
there's a nicety to that but I'm going
to go back to the server and what I want
to do is add a variable so I want a
variable at the top and I'm going to
call it blobs okay so that is all of the
blobs that are currently connected okay
and I think it would be useful probably
to create a blob object a little unsure
about this but let's let's do this for
right now what if I create I don't know
if I really need a constructor function
but let's just do it just for the sake
of argument a blob has an X
a blob for the blob has a why and a blob
has an ID so I don't know but in other
words that list should always be keeping
track of what's the blobs ID and where
is it so I'm wrote a constructor
function just in case I need to use it
but I'm not entirely sure I do
you just yet because just doing this on
the fly so when we have a new connection
oh the socket gets an ID what a one I
have an idea why don't we use that hein
and we might end up using like some kind
of like hash table II thing where we
look up we look up the client and list
based on its ID there's so many things
we could eventually add to this we'll
see but basically at this moment when we
have a new client what I want to do is
create a blob which is a new blob object
with socket ID now I don't know how I'm
going to get the XY position just yet so
we'll figure that out later I'm just
going to type in zero zero right now and
then I want to say blobs dot push la so
in other words the moment that someone's
connected we then have a new client now
I think that actually to the truth of
the matter is even better I have now
have an idea maybe there the client
should in addition to just connecting
send a message like start so maybe there
should be right because can I get when a
user socket ah okay hold on I have to
think about this when the server gets a
message called Mouse does the do we I
AAA yes we should get the particular
sock we should still have access to that
socket ID so let's let's try something
let's say there's a message called start
and the message that comes in is receipt
is data is data dot Y and I don't want
to broadcast that back
what I want to I want to leave that so
what I just want to see is I what I want
is for and I want to see a socket sorry
I'm figuring this out as I go it's hard
to like talk it through and do it okay
this is what I want to do I don't
actually want to create the blob the
moment that connected I mean the I want
to I want the client to explicitly also
send an additional message because here
what I want to do is make a new blob
object and they have the client send in
its XY position so let's now go to the
clients code and here what I want is to
send Brooke how do I send something up I
need to go back to my previous example
which this is how I send something to
the server so I'm going to grab this
code and go back to my agario sketch and
I want to send to the server right the
server is going to make ups the server
made that I lost a little bit of code
there sorry sorry sorry let me get that
back socket emit so and I want this to
be start so I want the data to be blob X
blob dot Y and by the way the blobs all
need a size so does the server keep
track of the size does the client keep
track of the size I guess they both do
for right now they're both going to keep
track of it so let's make a size which
is I think blob are I assume which by
the way can I just omit the blob it's
going to have all this other stuff in it
so I I'm gonna do this right now so
there's definitely a way I can clean
this up right essentially what I just
made this blob object and then I make
this data object which is what I'm
sending I can clean that up in a bit but
okay so I make the blob object and just
to be sure
it's our yep and then I want to send
that so let's see if this works let me
go back to the serve
code and I realized what I'm going to
get I in addition I also want the blob
to have an R to keep track of the size
and I want to see that here as well just
to make sure it's all coming in and make
it with a data dot R so there's a lot of
redundancy here but this should give us
the basic idea right if I restart the
server and I now refresh the client we
have connected I got undefined undefined
so I got the ID and I've got 64 why did
I get undefined for the X's and Y's so
I'm going to have to debug that where's
my debugging music someday I'll have it
let's look into this so we're where are
things being set oh I bet you I know why
so the blob is actually using vectors so
it has a position vector so instead of
there when I'm sending the information I
actually need to see blah said blob
pause X blob pause why so now if I were
to refresh this and see you can see now
the client connects and it sends its ID
it's X and it's Y and its size so just
to make things kind of have a little
variety right now what I want to do is I
want the blob to send in a random
location and a random size and the size
will be smaller between 8 and 24 so
let's refresh this again and and
interestingly there's a zoom thing
happening because everything's based on
having a size of 64 but that's fine
I'm not going to there's that thing
where we're zooming I'm going to just
leave that be for right now so whips I
went to the wrong place and we can see
that you know it's very hard to debug in
node because now I'm printing out these
floating-point things we're getting all
these
but you can see the stuff is in
different places so this is really good
right we both have a we have now a
client who connects who gets a unique ID
and who broadcasts it's starting up I'm
attached here who broadcast it's
starting X&amp;amp;Y and sighs okay here we go
let's keep moving everybody I'm excited
we're getting we're getting to this so
okay so now here's the thing every time
through draw the blob updates its
location so what I think we need to do
right now is update the server sense of
where I am so what I need to do here is
now say in draw I want to do this again
but I want to omit an update message so
I could probably combine these two but
in the beginning a start message means
I'm a new blob and now in draw I want to
update my X &amp;amp; Y location continuously
now latency and scale and all that are
going to be complicated questions we're
gonna have to deal with at some point or
maybe I won't deal with it but you will
have to deal with it
but this is kind of getting started
right the chat of someone writes don't
forget to uh don't forget to delete
blobs of disconnected clients which I'll
certainly have to do at some point okay
so now what I want to do is in the
server I need what sorry I have too many
things open I'm going to just go to the
server in the server code I need to deal
with another message so that's the start
message
and this is an update message and I'm
going to leave this in here and now
instead of instead of instead of
creating a new blob and putting it in
the array what I want to do is find the
blob with that ID now I'm going to do
this in a terrible way I'm going to do
this in a brute-force method of just
looping through the array to find the
correct blob later I would love to
improve this by using kind of like a
dictionary lookup but I'm going to just
to have the simplicity of having an
array right now I'm going to just leave
it this way so which is I'm going to
start with a blob called witch which is
the one I'm just going to save our blob
and then I'm going to loop through the
lengths of that array and I'm going to
say if blob dot ID oh sorry
if a socket dot ID equals blobs index i
dot ID right i want to find the blob has
the same ID as the socket then I want to
say blob equals blobs index I and then
what I just want to do is update the
location so I want to say blob dot x
equals data X blob dot y equals data dot
y and blob again I could certainly
improve this and just copy the object or
make it the same object but for
simplicity or say blob R equals data R
so this is essentially here now updating
that array so what I'm doing now is as
the blobs update their location the
array keeping track of where all the
blobs are gets updated as well okay now
I don't need pause dot X here this is I
this is accidental because the way that
I programmed it maybe you could do this
in a different more better way but I'm
using a vector in the client but I'm not
using a vector in the server vector
object that is okay so let's see what
happens now when I restart the server
and I also
do this we should see now you can see
here the you can see that the location
is moving continuously and it's just I
know it's going down let's see if I move
let's see if we can I can like move into
the client to see it now it's going back
up so we're not seeing anything move
right because it only moves that it's
drawn relative to itself but you can see
that this is actually working on some
level and I by the way I'm going to have
to put some you know constraints around
where the blobs can move to okay so
we're good
we've got now every blob and you can see
now if I were to connect a second one
you would see here and if I kill the
server for a second we should see I only
see one ID so let me try that again when
we hit refresh here and we fresh here
and there should be hmm
and the new client oh okay hold on
there's an error here cannot set
property X of undefined so I got some
sort of error I must be oh this if I
don't restart the server no we did get
two clients so this is straight always
just restart the server because the
server's got this persistent a list of
clients and if somebody connects and
then can't find that can't find that in
the list we're going to have a sends an
update message so we start the server so
you know there's some cleanup here I
need to do but I don't know why I'm not
seeing more than one client message um
I am back after some debugging which I
realized aha browsers will play tricks
on you sometime notice I'm only seeing
the updated location of one client it's
not because it's not working it's
because my browser is actually only
showing me one client and the other tab
which is hidden has gone to sleep this
is a smart thing because why update an
animation in a tab you can't see but if
I pull this tab out and make it visible
now you can see that I have both of them
showing up as they're both neither is
asleep so this is something I just have
to keep an eye on as I develop things
further so okay so I'm going to put this
back I'll pull it out or just actually
close it I'll pull it out later when I
need to so now we need to add a feature
there's a problem here which is that I'm
letting these blobs just go infinitely
off into a like an infinitely large
space and you can see it's location
currently is its location currently is
like negative thousand thousand
something so I need to put something in
the code to constrain them to a fixed
space in the screen and the I could be
there's a lot of ways I could do this
but I'm going to just do it in a really
I'm just going to write a blob constrain
and in the blob object I'm going to
write a function called this constrain
and I'm going to make that blob haha
equals constrain blob pause X 0 and
width and actually I'm going to say
negative with 2 with and I'm going to
say Y negative height - height and
because it's 0 0 I think is technically
the center the way that I've written
this if you remember from the previous
tutorial so again I could make a bigger
world I can make a smaller world I could
make it a flexibly sized world depending
on how many blobs are there but I'm just
going to do this and this should give me
a nice now if i refresh this you can't
see me moving but if if I look at this
location at some point I remember what
the size of the window is I think it's
around 600 you're going to see that it
sort of stopped at negative 600 so this
is really useful because as I'm testing
it I don't I want to be able to see
things within sort of like a similar
world ok so now what I want to do what I
want to do now aha so I have everything
working I have a server which is
receiving information from clients each
client having its own blob that's moving
around the screen what I'm not doing is
broadcasting back to the the clients
where everything else is so oh boy I'm
realizing there's a big complication
that's going to arise in a moment but
it's okay ah we're gonna we're gonna
we're going to get through this together
being a happy place figuring this out
but what I'm at least want to be able to
see a step to here I want to see
somebody else's blob up here on my
screen I want my blob to appear on their
screen ok so here we go let's figure out
how to do that what I need to do is I
need the server to broadcast and if you
look if you look here I'm trying to
think of the best way to do this to
start let's go back to the kid this
sorry the server code or have I
I think the server code I've destroyed
it I need to go and grab sorry
so what I want to do is what I want to I
just want to create a I want to create
mmm
I'm trying to think here I want to think
that I want to do is create just a
heartbeat that every so often the server
sends a list of all the current blobs in
their location so I am going let's go
back to the canvas example which I sorry
I lost my original code let me find it
ah let me find it this way sockets
server so what I'm looking for is this
i/o dot sockets emit sorry I could have
this with what I want to do is I'm going
to write a function called set interval
and what I want to do is have a
heartbeat function happen every I'm
gonna have a once per second now just to
make it really slow to update and I want
this function heartbeat to emit a
heartbeat I call it a heartbeat I think
that's a common word in networking like
it's like your heart is continuously
beating at regular intervals this is
something that the server's just going
to do at regular intervals and what's it
going to do it's going to send out the
full list of blobs and actually right
now it's just going to send out hello so
I just want to see and I I just want to
see a message I want to see that I can
get the client to receive a message from
the server every second okay so let's
see how that works let me go back to the
client code and a client code I need to
go back into the canvas and see icon I
need to add this this on method I want
to do something when I receive that
heartbeat so I'm going to bring that in
and I'm going to put it in set up and
when I receive the heartbeat
I just want to say console dot log data
I just want to see that message come in
okay so now I've added a heartbeat to
the server and a heartbeat to the client
so let's run this again let's run the
client and we should see hello hello
hello hello hello
servers setting up now let's change the
server to do something else instead of
sending hello I've got to go back to the
server let's actually send that array
let's just put the array in there let's
see what happens if we just put the
array in there we might have to
stringify it I'm not sure but let's just
put the array in there and see what we
get oh I was a loud noise okay so I'm
going to restart the server and I'm
going to refresh the client an object
object let's look in object there it is
it's an array with so it's actually
sending it as an object which is
terrific you can see the ID are so I'm
actually getting all this information in
the client now bear with me here let's
connect to second client and a third
client and a fourth client and let's
look at what that heartbeat looks like
now I got to go look look at this an
array of four things there we go all
four things right there so what is it
that we want to do all I've got to do
now is loop through those four things
and display them on the screen the
server sending me here's where
everything is here's where everything is
here's where everything is oh this is
wonderful
so let's go ahead and do that so I'm
going to add to the client code where's
my client code so many different things
here it is I'm in draw okay so here so I
need an array oh that array blobs I
already have it I'm going to say blobs
equals data does that was an array and
then what I'm going to do is they're
going to say for VAR
I equals zero I is less than oh I have
that they're so funny that I have this
year already and I was going through it
backwards but they're not actually blob
objects boy I'm just going to draw just
to see that through the hair I'm just
going to draw an ellipse blobs index IX
blobs index I dot y blobs index i dot R
times two and I'm going to draw it I'm
going to make it a different color and
I'm going to say let's just make it like
a blue or something so we see it as a
different color so let's just see how
that works
there we go look those are the other
blobs and I can kind of walk around and
try to find them those are from the
other clients and I could go to the
other client and I could try to find
probably presumably I have to refresh I
could find the other blocks now one
thing I might like to do is actually
display the ID is that's going to kind
of kind of help things I don't know
what's going on there new blobs are
connecting continuously let's just see
blobs dot length whoops
there we go yeah I don't know why I have
so many so I there's some debugging that
I've got to do here seven no it's right
I guess I have seven tabs open do I
books do I have seven tabs open a geeky
track you know what though the server
hasn't been restarted and I've been
doing all sorts of crazy stuff so in
these kind of cases it's generally good
to start over so let's just do two blobs
and see if things are working so I'm
gonna whoops and I went to the wrong
server the wrong project 3000 here we go
okay so back in I'm drawing myself and
I'm drawing myself only once per second
so as I move around it sort of looks
like it's like I'm still drawing myself
in a previous historical location so
that I'm going to fix as I stop drawing
myself which I need to do so one thing I
want to do is I want to draw the blobs
with their ID so let me just for a
second see if I can make that happen
really kind of quickly you know like a
not so awful I'm going to say fill 255
text blobs index ID and then I want to
say blobs Dex I dot X mobs index I dot y
plus R plump blobs in index I dot R
times three let's have it appear below
and let's say text-align:center am I
getting the ID yeah okay we'll go away
that's not so let's make the ID a lot
smaller I think probably the window
yeah text size 12 and the times three
was unnecessary okay so I want to see
let's make this six well what's going on
with text size okay that's kind of what
I wanted to do so I just want to be able
to see quickly the ID below each of the
blocks okay we're getting somewhere
we're getting close now here's the thing
I want to not draw myself there's going
to be a third part to this clearly we're
getting pretty close
I'm gonna release this code and you guys
can kind of get further on your own and
I'll come back and do the third part at
some point but the couple things I want
to fix here number one is I wanted I
want to know my own ID and not draw
myself so I need to have in this
particular sketch my own ID and I would
like the I would like to send from the
server a message just back to myself now
so when I send this first start I want
in server - I want the server to send a
message back with the clients ID like
the client needs to know its ID so the
question is how do we in how do we use
node WebSockets to send a message only
to this particular client and it's
probably something like socket dot omit
or something but I'm just going to look
this up set node sockets send message to
want specific clients so here so so how
do we do this you have to grab the
client ID and we can just say i/o dot
client session ID
dot sin let's see if that works so let's
see if this works like what if I then
say this and so I want to say socket I D
I wonder if the client has this built in
somehow does the client have this built
in somehow let's look at this
oh look there's the ID look the client
already knows its own ID isn't that
wonderful so I don't need to send it
back the client knows its own ID now why
is the client have to have it as with
alpha without the extra numb / in number
but that's fine we can work that out so
what I want to do here now so I don't
need this what I want to do in the
client is I want to when I'm drawing
them I want to only draw them if the ID
is not my own ID so I want to say as
long as blobs index ID ID does not equal
socket ID but the problem with that is
blobs ID has a couple extra characters
at the beginning so I'll just do this I
can just chop those off I think with
substring substring is a method that
will give me a part of a string and if I
go back to the sketch and look please
don't move around you can see that there
are there are just two extra characters
0 1 so I want the substring to start at
2 so I want the substring to start at 2
, and let's just let's make this simpler
let's save our ID equals blobs index I'd
ID and then I can say ID dot substring
to 2 the length of the string so I want
to make a substring from the second
character all the way to the end and as
long as that's not the case then I can
draw that particular blob okay so let's
see here
so we should be good in that well
there's a whole lot above now we can see
that I can find other blobs of varying
sizes if I kind of poke
the screen but I am NOT drawing myself
so we're in pretty good shape here let's
let's change a couple things first of
all let's restart the server I think
that we can now in the server do away
with this console dot log that's
happening over and over again as
everyone updates itself and we can what
we can do is now really test out two
particular clients so to do this what I
want to do is kind of divide my I'm
going to get rid of the I want to divide
my win screen in half here and I'm going
to just go to I have two windows open
that aren't connected yet to the server
then I want to run the server connect
this one to sorry agario one and you can
see there's a client connected then I
want to connect this one to agario one
and there's another client connected so
we can see what their locations starting
locations are and I should be able to
now move around and try to find it
anybody anybody where are you other blob
okay okay I am back okay so I'm going to
just console.log the blobs x and y
position so I can take a look at that
and the other thing I was going to do
here is only say if mouse is pressed
then update the location so I'm actually
not going to move a particular blob
unless unless you click the mouse so
what I want to do is I need to find
terminal again this is going to help me
debug so I'm going to kill the server
I'm going to hit refresh which will make
it so that it doesn't actually connect
and then I'm going to restart the server
I'm going to start one blob and it's
saying undefined sold I need to fix that
blob pause X love dot pause dot Y so let
me refresh again you can see okay so and
that's now showing both of them so hold
on I'm going to restart the server and
refresh this okay so you can see here
this particular blob has shown up at
this location 150 comma 24 and let me
make this a little bigger there we go
and now I'm going to go to the other
blob I'm going to start a new one
whoops and you can see there it is so
now I want to move this blob a little
bit whoops and let me see if I and that
worked there we go and the thing is it's
only updating it's only updating once a
second and so I can move closer and you
can see okay so let me fix that and so
this is totally working by the way but
let's kill the server again I'm going to
make this look a little bit better so I
should I don't know what's reasonable
but I'm gonna have the server have its
heartbeat 30 frames per second
is a and there's a thousand milliseconds
in one second so let's say let's have
the heartbeat happen every like 33
milliseconds let's see if it can handle
that so I'm going to restart the server
and I'm hit refresh here and I'm going
to take that out and I'ma hit refresh
here whoops
hit refresh here and we should see now
as I move and let's get a third one
going let's get uh OOP ah this is I'm
gonna get a third one going and one more
come on you can do it
Oh Gauri oh there we go
so we can see here if I were to move
around they're all responding to each
other we've got a multi player kind of
beginnings of a multi player agario here
so okay everybody this is the end of
part 2 I don't know how long this video
was or if it was it all understandable
or useful at the very least you sort of
saw how difficult this is and I will
release the code for what I've got so
far
so there's a big missing piece here
which is that I've got a check
intersection and figure out what to do
actually add the game mechanics where
you when they intersect the bigger one
eats the smaller one just what you're
gain the smaller ones game is over maybe
you can start again there's a lot more
steps to add to this but this I think is
going to get you a little bit further as
you can see the sort of basic mechanics
of having a server keep track of a list
of everyone connected have the client
implement their own motion physics
update their location to the server and
if the server send those new locations
back to the clients so that they update
so you know there's a question of you
know how do you deploy this what would
happen if you suddenly had a hundred
thousand people playing this all at once
there's no dude WebSockets going to
support that but you can sort of see the
basic ideas of how you can have this
more sophisticated networking
multiplayer networking working so thanks
for watching this particular video this
was part 2
when at some point I will release a part
three which I do a few more steps
although it might be a while before I
get to that thanks again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
