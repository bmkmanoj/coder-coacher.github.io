really sure but maybe now you have a
sense of okay I kind of get what
programming is I've got to write
instructions with a specific syntax and
I could choose all these different
languages and all these different
environments for different kinds of
applications and for a different
operating system and for different
hardware but here we're going to use
processing what advantages does
processing give us what kinds of things
can we make with processing what is the
lens that we're going to look through to
learn the fundamental concepts of
programming and this is key we're not
I'm not it's not my intention here for
you to learn processing it's my
intention for you to learn the
fundamental tools of computation we're
going to use processing as the
environment to learn those tools but
those tools those concepts will go
across any programming language or
environment that you choose to use in
the future
so why as I said processing we it's a
thing we download we can open it one of
the first things you might do yourself
and I'll kind of do this for you is take
a look through the examples so you can
see here there's a little window that
you can pop up that has examples and you
can kind of through look through these
basics and some of these basic things
would give you a sense of what is
processing doing could learn about color
you could learn about form you could
learn about math so if for example if I
just go here and let's say we want to
learn about hue with processing I can
run this particular example and you can
see that what it's doing here is as I
move the mouse back and forth across the
screen it's changing the hue of a color
that I'm drawing so there's a range of
examples and you'll notice these
examples generally speaking have a
visual design component so if you're
interested in design animation images
creative applications of software
processing is a good environment to
explore ideas in that area another thing
I'm just going to kind of give you a
quick range as you look through you
might start to look through a lot of the
examples under topics and one of the
ones that's dear to my heart that you
might look at is ok simulate so there's
a lot of nice examples we can look at
this idea of what of simulating physics
elements through processing we can see
there's
circles on the screen as I click them
and move them with the mouse ahead as
always I really this is very poorly for
what I'm doing here they they have this
spring-like motion so one of the nice
things about processing is there is a
wah when you download it there's a wide
range of examples and to get a sense of
what can I do what are some ideas of
things I might try to make you could you
could spend a whole day just clicking
through and running all of the examples
the other thing that I will just mention
is that processing has in addition to
the sort of 2d drawing engine which
allows you to draw simple and kind of
complex shapes and animations in 2d you
can do a lot of stuff in three
dimensions as well I guess I'll just
open up this one called planets and we
can see here is a nice whoo this is
beautiful I'm going to have to use this
for something but here we can see this
nice little demonstration of how you can
do 3d rendering and processing as well
and you can see you can do all sorts of
different kinds of camera stuff lighting
stuff textures all the things that you
might find in a 3d computer graphics
environment that's if you can and you
can do with the processing environment
as well so this is such as close to
everything that is the examples the
other thing okay so something else I
really want to mention about processing
so okay so here's something I kind of
should have might have wanted to mention
that we have this like crazy list of all
these programming languages and I was
kind of saying okay so here we're using
processing and one thing you might think
it's like oh is it just processing it's
like this toy environment that I can
kind of just do a little like
experimental ideas in but I can't really
make a large-scale projects with so one
of the things that I like about
processing is both its ability to allow
you to get started very quickly and
learn the basics but also you can build
fairly large-scale sophisticated
projects in it and one of the reasons
for this is is you aren't learning the
processing language yes using the
processing environment yes there is a
set of processing functions that are
that are that are native to processing
itself but really the language of
writing kokkonen is java java is
probably felt virtually right now the
era that we live in in 2013 is probably
like the least cool fig you can learn
it's much cooler solar JavaScript or
Ruby and and there's lots of great stuff
you can do I mean with JavaScript
especially on the web noun canvas and
WebGL and all this amazing stuff that I
also encourage you to learn but there is
an advantage to using Java or the fact
that processing is built on top of Java
you know Java is kind of in many ways
I've heard this said about Java human
Bruce emphasis fee but it's not the best
language for anything but it does
everything so if there's anything you're
thinking about doing if you oh you want
to like read your email into your
processing program and then draw a
little bubbles on the screen for every
email you've received or you want to
connect to the Microsoft Connect or you
want to use this physical piece of this
hardware you want to use the sensor you
can really do just about anything you'll
find a Java library out there for just
about anything so processing because
it's built on Java is incredibly
extendable through libraries now what
are these libraries and you can see I
meant to if I go back to that examples
window we're looking through those
examples there was topics I could go
down and start to look at libraries one
of which I'll just demonstrate really
briefly to you right now is video so
under capture I'm going to look at one
of these examples I'm going to run this
mirror example and I think this will
work this is where you could edit
because it's taking a minute or so here
we can see oh look what's interesting is
this is a green screen so you can see
the green wall in the actual camera so
the camera here is reading my image so
processing can connect two pieces of
hardware through libraries connect to
your camera and what this example is
doing is it's taking every single pixel
from a regular good old-fashioned image
and instead of drawing that pixel as a
it's drawing that pixel as a rectangle
on the screen rotated according to
brightness or something so you can see
that we can create this abstract
visualization of the data the color data
that's coming in from a camera and this
is something we'll explore in great
detail in a future video how to do write
these kind of examples how to capture
images
how to read pixels and a draw stuff
based on those pixels so the the video
library is something that comes with
processing when you download it but
processing itself has a hue as a large
community of people making libraries and
I downloaded one an arbitrary one called
the Yahoo weather library we can see
I'll just open up this example this
library allows you to connect to Yahoo
Yahoo Yahoo weather data and you can see
here that this processing sketch has
grabbed the weather information from the
city of Berlin it's fair the wind
direction is 310 which must maybe as a
an angle but your um
and the wind speed is 8 kilometer killed
metros - French also km/h so you can see
then this there's these particles these
dots that are drawn on the screen that
are moving according to that wind
direction so connecting two data sources
there if you have an idea for something
and processing doesn't do it if you can
write the Java code for that you can
make it into a library and you can do it
in processing so the processing is
tremendously extendable through all
sorts of libraries and if you want to
get a sense of what the available
libraries are for you if we go back to
the processing website and go to
libraries you can see there is a nice
list of tons and tons of libraries and
you can also get them which I this is
not through through this library manager
that comes with the processing software
itself so we can go through this list of
libraries and if I want this library
which is a lightweight library for
creating animations and trend
transitions I can click install and it
will install that library and I can use
it in my code ok so this is kind of at
least a little bit of me getting started
showing you okay here's the processing
development environment here are some of
the examples here some libraries here's
the kinds of things that can do and the
next thing I want to kind of briefly
look at is just a quick range of some
projects that have been made with
processing to get you thinking about
looking at a kind of larger scale
installations and animation
and things that people are doing the
first project I'm going to show you is
called chronograph by Casey Reis one of
the creators of processing and tal
Rosner I apologize if I pronounced the
name in here incorrectly this is a
project which I will just sort of skip
to the end here to just show you this
time-lapse you can see this is a
projection piece that's projected on to
the side of this building which is the
new world Center in Miami Florida for
the New World Symphony so this is a
time-lapse of the piece running this is
showing it more quickly but you can see
this idea of abstract visuals projected
on the side of a building this is all
generative procedural this is a piece of
software that generates this content
that's projected on the side of a
building this is something that's done a
lot with processing I teach a class here
at ITP where the students create work
for a large video wall here are a couple
examples of projects there this is a
project called Beluga I'm skipping the
sound but this was a dance performance
and you can see that there are these
dancers that are moving and jumping on
tramp trampolines this is a 120 foot
wide video wall it's about 12 feet high
and the visuals were generative this
seascape and they responded to the
movements of these dancers who are
bouncing up and down on trampolines so
this was actually it's using processing
but there are three separate computers
running three processing sketches each
controlling a section of the video wall
so even these types of large-scale 3d
performance graphics for performance are
made with processing another example of
this for the same space this is a
project called replicas which here there
was a dancer live in the space where the
camera pointed at her and her image was
then projected onto the wall and
manipulated with a series of different
kinds of time-based effects and there
was music the dancer and all happening
in real time all happening live okay I'm
realizing I'm forgetting just mention
people's names but I will there'll be
links below where you can find out the
wonderful people who made some of these
projects so another thing that
processing is used a lot for is for
motion graphics this is a great
object by Molly Schwartz where she did
an animation about eels now a called a
belly full of eels if you look at this a
lot of this is done with After Effects
but here in in in this particular part
of the animation these eels that are
actually swimming through this
underwater pipe sewer like space those
were actually made in processing
rendered out from processing and
incorporated into a larger animation
project and there are lots of wonderful
examples of music videos that have been
made with processing or different types
of elements that you wouldn't want to
hand animate that need an algorithm a
generative process to whether its
behaviors or repetition we're done with
code with processing okay another
another cuck like popular use of
processing is for data visualization I
will show you a well-known project by
Jer Thorp this here is a visualization
it's grabbing data from Twitter and
looking for people who said you know who
are very excited about the fact that I
just landed in Hawaii for example so
anyone who posted just landed in Hawaii
if it was me I wish I had gone to Hawaii
I've never been there but my home
location on Twitter would be New York
Jer the the project parses out the
locations New York and Hawaii and the
time that the tweet was posted and draws
a this kind of arc path from the origin
location to the landing region so it's a
visualization of people posting on
Twitter about their flights and you can
see different views there's this kind of
like horizontal view now that it's
spinning around all this is done through
code through an algorithmic process to
visualize this data and you can see kind
of that well you can't really see that
but up here at the top left this time
scale showing where we are and this
where we are in time so this is a great
use of processing it looks like oh my
goodness this very like complicated
crazy using 3d how could I ever possibly
learn how to do this we're going to
start with some very basic things like
how to draw a circle how to move a
circle this is really just doing that
also it's just lots of circles a little
bit of 3d so what's happened
those circles is controlled by data so
all this stuff is possible through
learning the foundations of programming
and a little bit about how to draw and
do stuff with computer graphics as well
so this is a great project by Mary Huang
if you're interested a lot of wonderful
work is being done with processing to
create physical so if you want to do
print design with checking out the work
of rune Matson and a course he teaches
called printing code there's a
tremendous suite of examples of using
computation to generate print designs
this is a project that Mary Wong made to
create a fashion designs through through
a generative process so you can see here
the mouse this is a processing sketch
running where the mouse is able to draw
over the figure of the human form and
that and that what the mouse is drawing
is then made into geometry which is used
to generate the design for a dress and
Mary actually created these dresses and
physically fabricated them and wore them
as well and so a lot of stuff can be is
being done with processing in terms of
take a look at the work at nervous
system I'll include a link to that as
well for making jewelry designs you can
print stuff off you can generate stuff
for a MakerBot with processing to do 3d
printing this is a something that you
could explore as a as an application
that you might an idea that you might do
throughout if you're following along
with all of these videos also doing
creating a physical computing interfaces
this is a project called the mud tub
which kind of answers that question
what's the thing that you might want to
get least near your computer a big pile
of mud this is by Tom Gerhart and so
this is kind of also interesting to say
like you know we don't need what you're
learning here might not you might not
need to make something that has this
really obvious practical like I want to
make an app and I want to like sell
billions of them to become a zillionaire
which actually would be nice but you
know anyway they're bored of life then
selling your apps but this you can see
here there's a projection on this tub of
mud which is other graphics what's being
output is done through processing and
processing
is reading these sensors that are coming
back in from the mud there's actually
sensors underneath the mud that's
measuring the weight of the mud at any
point which allows the software to read
the topology essentially of the mud and
you can see that the mud becomes this
controller where you with your hands you
can kind of bounce this ball around if I
kind of skip to the end here you can see
you can kind of play this gain here on a
separate screen by pressing on the mud
so this idea of making your own physical
computing device your own interface a
tub of mud another great example of this
is a scrollable project I'll just show
you this is by filippo venucci and you
can see here is his processing sketch
chute which I Fick here's his processing
sketch which if you look at it makes
this nice ink effect so he's created
this sketch and if I click around here
you can see it draws a bunch of dots and
it makes this animation it has this ink
like quality to it so what did he use
this processing sketch for he used it to
project onto paper and he built sensors
to measure how what that paper is doing
this will become much more obvious when
I show you it in a project called
scrollable x' and you can see these are
these devices that you can scroll the
paper round I'll just skip ahead here by
scrolling back and forth you can control
in animation so of course we're all
familiar with touchscreens
but here we have this physical device
which has real tactile tangible
qualities real paper that you're
scrolling and you can see as you scroll
back and forth you can play for example
the game pong and this ink effect was
created through an algorithm in
processing and our and control through
the physical interface so you know this
is very very really really quick and
dirty kind of I don't know if I missed
anything key that I wanted to show you
really kind of quick and dirty just
quick range of projects that were made
in processing I would also encourage you
to on the processing website to go take
a look at the exhibition so if you look
at the exhibition link there is a ton of
projects that you can see historically
and you can actually go it you can
actually go all the way back
if on the bottom here boy this is this
is getting awkward on the bottom here if
you click on number one you can actually
see stuff that was posted from the
processing exhibition from over ten
years ago so this is there's a if you
want to kind of get a sense of the
landscape of what this processing do
what are the kinds of things that I'm
going to learn you can walk yourself
through the examples you could look at a
bunch of projects that are made with
processing but ultimately the rest of
these videos are going to very slowly by
slowly piece by piece walk you through
the fundamentals of programming through
a whole lot of graphics examples in
processing and that will help you
generate ideas and things that you want
that you might want to make and that's
really what I only one more introductory
video to make and that is a video where
I'm just going to talk through kind of
the table of contents of everything
we're going to go through you could call
it a syllabus if you want but I'm kind
of afraid to do that so I'm going to
kind of just give you a quick overview I
think this I'm kind of having a problem
with these this video and the last one
are a bit too long so then give you a
kind of quick overview of all the
fundamentals you're going to learn and
then we're just going to dive right in
and get started</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
