some exercise or homework ideas that you
can do with this topic of word counting
and text analysis so number one if you
make something please share it with me
twitter at Schiffman you can put it in
the comments here or if you're part of
the patreon crowdfunding which you can
check a link in this description to find
out how to do that we've got a slack
channel where you can share and discuss
your assignments so mostly the first
thing you might try is in my example my
if I go back and look at this word
counting example it's just literally the
word in there count so what might be a
creative way that you visualize this and
the other thing I've said this before is
think about what happens if you're doing
multiple documents how might you compare
them and in that sense the tf-idf video
could unlock some ideas for how you
might present that but really I think
what you want to think about is why are
you doing this what's interesting to you
about text what texts are passionate are
you passionate about is there meaningful
texts that you've written that you want
to look at in a new way and I would
really encourage you to take a look at
penna Baker's research and the secret
life of pronouns look at the website
which will be linked in this video's
description as well to what happens if
you're really just counting a small
subset of words and these function words
these so to speak junk words how can you
get how can you could you create a sort
of interactive lie detector based on the
use of the personal pronoun I me or my
based on that research and you'll see on
the website there are a bunch of
exercises and interactive systems that
do this work already maybe you might
have a twist on that or create your own
the other thing you might look at or
word frequencies as compared you know
your emails versus somebody else's
emails can you find a match Luke Dubois
has a wonderful project called
craigslist missed connections I might be
a link to that reference about that
project hopefully in this video's
description where what he did was look
at craigslist people will post like oh I
saw you on the train and tries to auto
match people based on the style of their
writing is that something you could sort
of think about figuring out how to do
and that's that's I guess that's my kind
of summary so you know you might look at
sentiment analysis also if you have a
pre pre descript premade set of words
that are having
positive connotation or a negative
connotation what happens if you count
how many times those words appear in a
certain text what types of analysis and
also here's another idea word counting
emphasis on the counting not emphasis on
the word what if you count syllables
parts of speech sentences words that
rhyme with rainbow I'd have no idea what
it might be and is you know thinking
back to Twitter bots what if you do this
kind of text analysis analyze stuff on
Twitter using the Twitter API post that
stuff back as a Twitter about there's so
many possibilities here you will be much
more creative and interesting there's an
idea in your head I know there is but
even if there isn't just start messing
around play don't even worry about what
you're making you might discover
something as you're like playing with
the examples so create something share
it with me I would love to know more
about it and I hope to see you in next
week's session which I already forgot
what it's about but oh I think I'm gonna
start moving on to text generation and
maybe looking at Markov chains so
that'll happen at some point the videos
might already be there by the time
you're watching this okay thanks and
I'll see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
