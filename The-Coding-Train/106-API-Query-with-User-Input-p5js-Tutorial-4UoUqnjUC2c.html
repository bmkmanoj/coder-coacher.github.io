how you can take user input from a user
and pass that user input to an API query
get some data have that data come back
into your program and visualize
something on the screen so this is a
example that I built in the previous
video which I'll link to below and what
this example is doing is it's querying
an API called open weather map it's
sending a city the city that it's
sending you can see right there is
London and then it gets back some data
about London what's the current
temperature what's the current humidity
and in this example I'm pulling that
data out into two variables and drawing
two circles on the screen so first I
gotta admit something which is that this
is like a perhaps the least visually
interesting you know data visualization
I you know anybody ever has ever done so
I'm making I don't have I don't have a
visual bone so I'm but I'm demonstrating
the technique so what you would do
hopefully with my with this technique is
thinking of a new way of presenting
information by weather or doing some
type of animation there's lots of
possibilities but what I want to show
you here is no matter how many times I
run this it's always just going to query
the API boom as soon as the program
starts and then it's going to get that
weather from London and it's never to
query the API again so how do we make
something that when the user enters a
city that we get that well that then we
query the API show the information the
user can then enter another city we get
that information query the API again so
how could we have query the API over
time while the program is running how do
we think about as a sequence of events
and how do we tie that to drawing we
being me right now and then you I got
this thing about pronouns it's really
like a problem as in my head all the
time like I only think about what
pronoun I use what's that but I'll link
to something in the description below
about why I think about that all the
time okay so let's make that happen so
first of all I need somewhere to get
user input so right now what this
actually is is a web page just with this
canvas on it so what I would like to do
is add to the web page something where
the user could type in some type in a
city so guess what I'm going to add to
there's an HTML page
with this javascript code it's the it's
the page that's loading this code so I'm
going to go there first
so in this p5.js editor I'm going to hit
the Settings button and say show sidebar
and there's a bunch of extra stuff in
here that I'm not using because this was
built and I'm going to go to this
index.html file and now in the HTML body
what I want to do is add paragraph and
then I'm going to add an input can you
see this I'm going to add an input field
and I'm going to give it an ID we'll
call it city and I'll put London in
there and I'll say city : so now what
I've added is just some HTML that on the
page I want to see a field that a user
could type something into and if we run
this you can see there it is oops and by
the way so I did that incorrectly look
at this so what I wanted to do if we
look back at that window this is this
was going so well until I got confused
like look what's here what I wanted to
do is I wanted to have the word London
populate that sit that that text input
field automatically and I thought I
don't know how to do this but it must
it's sometimes it works this way I could
just create this HTML input element and
put London in the middle but I forgot
that the text that is in the text input
element is actually its value value
being an attribute of this HTML element
so if I want to do that I just need to
say value equals London so now if I fix
that and let me make this a little bit
wider so you can kind of see it and I
run this again you can see there we go
so I now have this text input box at the
top with the word London in it okay
we're getting somewhere now maybe I
should also add very briefly I'll put
like a line break and then I'm going to
add a button with an ID called submit
and I'll say submit so now I've also
added an HTML element of button so I
have a text input element pre-populated
with London and I
a button so when I press that button I'm
going to ask the API to give me the
weather for whatever city is in that
field excellent okay so let's look at
this run this you can see there we go
now I could do a better job like styling
this and putting line breaks in and that
sort of thing but the point here is that
I could do this and then I could type
New York and I want to see what what's
in the canvass what's in the drawing
change based on that current weather so
how do we do that I'm excited you
excited if I don't know you shouldn't be
as excited to be I'm a little bit
excitable it's a bit of a problem
because me a lot of anxiety in life but
I'm but but I'm doing well today and I'm
happy to talk about this with you okay
so let's look first to answer this
question we have to look at something we
have to look at this URL look at this
URL it's a long thing I figured it out
in the last video that I got I have a
path to the API that's whether I have a
question mark Q equals London that's the
city app ID that's my API key units
equal metric that's giving me the
information in Celsius right so how do
we what what do we need to do and to
figure this out I'm going to come over
here to my trusty friend the whiteboard
I trust you friend the weight forwards
and um let's think about this URL so
most api's if you're making a P I query
it's very similar to typing a URL into
the browser in fact if I pasted that URL
into the browser we're going to see the
data associated with it I kind of I kind
of wish I was doing that right now let's
do that for a second I'll come back to
the whiteboard right so let me go over
here and I'm going to copy this whole
thing I'm going to go into Chrome and
I'm going to paste it in up here and I'm
going to look and say look here's the
data coming in and you can see that up
here is the city so even if I just in
the brown up here if I just change that
to New York for example you can see aha
now I have the weather associated with
New York which the temperature about you
know 18 degrees Celsius that's of all
right it's actually quite a beautiful
day sun's shining I don't know why
inside talking to a camera all by myself
is I think the same stupid joke in all
my videos about I'm talking
camera by myself but it is true okay so
that's what I'm doing okay so now you
can see the way that you could get a
different city you know I could now I
could over here I could type Tokyo and
I'm gonna get the weather for Tokyo the
way that I get the data from a different
city is to change the URL so somehow I'm
able to do that manually in the browser
somehow I need to figure out a way of
doing that in code and the reason why I
was coming over here is oops what was I
not know I was here was I in the right
place the whole time
missing London army yeah I'm sorry tell
me in the chat hopefully I record I'll
have to fix this video if I know I'm
lower huh this is like Charlie Chaplin I
could if someone playing like download
this edit this and add some like music
to it um I yeah I'm not like Charlie
Chow wish I was like Charlie Chaplin
that'd be good um okay so alright so how
do we do this huh I don't know this
videos I kind of want to rerecord this
video but um so in my code there is a
URL and it's one long string it starts
with like HTTP it has like open weather
map blah blah blah blah blah blah so
somehow we have to figure out the way
that to do this is to piece together the
URL from its components one of which
happens to be dynamic that's that's
happening with input from the user so
for example one way that I could think
about doing this is I could say var API
equals HTTP colon slash slash open
weather map dot org slash weather
question mark so like this is the
beginning of the API query then I might
have another variable called like city
which I say these are strings which I
say is London then I might have another
variable where I say something like API
key equals you know my crazy API key and
then when I want to make the actual URL
which is the actual URL that I will send
to the API then all I need to do is say
I want to have the API plus the city
plus the API key right
remember the plus symbol with text right
two plus two equals four but the string
two plus the string to it this is
actually a valid use of air quotes by
the way you usually do the air buds is
just kind of an obnoxious thing in
general but I feel like if you're trying
to indicate a string like this is like a
time in my life where I'm allowed to use
air now I feel ridiculous but um this
the two the two in quotes plus two in
quotes is 22 right two plus two is two
- not 22 but two - so what this is - -
like like I think that you wear when
you're doing ballet um so this
I'm trying trying much too hard to be
important just talking about this it's
not going well feels forced today so
this so this is the way that you can put
together the pieces of an API call in as
a as in your hell by having them in
components the whole reason I'm talking
about this is because now this one can
be dynamic
so if City is not a hard-coded value
it's coming from the user and every time
I want to query the API this always
stays the same this always stays the
same this is the thing that changes so
let's go see if we can add that to the
code and make this work I'm over here
now okay so coming back to the program
let me minimize this coming back to the
program we can look now at the
components of this URL so let's say what
I want is all the way up to here is
going to be kind of like the first part
so I'm just going to call this the API
and maybe I'll call like API path which
were like the path or the API let's just
call it API then I'm going to make a
variable called City and I'm going to
make that London then I'm going to make
a variable called like API key and it's
going to be this whole thing and then
I'm going to make a variable UPS and
then I'm going to make a variable called
units and add this so you can see now
and I think if I if think if I make this
a little bit wide unfortunately like
it's sort of hard to fit everything ah
but now I've got it I've got it you can
see now and what do I have some I have
some like weird warnings here missing a
semicolon somewhere and see my semi oh
you know what I did is I used a double
quote and a single quote that'll fix
things up okay so you can see now that I
broke the API call into its parts so all
of these things all of these things are
are not going to the API API teen units
are not going to change I always want to
query open weather map I always wanted
in metric and I always have this API key
now of course you're scenario might be
different but for this particular
scenario the only thing that changes is
the city and so now when I want to load
the data I would say VAR URL equals API
plus city plus API key plus units and
now we can see let's see let's just make
sure this still works as before it still
works as before so instead of having the
full API call as one long string I now
have it in pieces and we could see if I
change this to do New York now I'm
seeing the New York weather you're just
gonna have to trust that that's kind of
the right values again because this is
my pathetic little I'm just drawing the
temperature and the humidity as circles
on the screen okay so we're getting
somewhere though because now I can move
this right I can I don't this this API
call is happening in set up only in
setup where do I want it to happen now
if we look at this web page that I've
made I want that API call to happen when
I click the submit button so how do I
make that happen I need two steps one I
need access to that Dom element I need
to select that Dom element then I also
need to attach a mouse pressed event to
that Dom element so let's add those two
things to this program I'm going to say
oops
whoopsie a VAR button equals select
submit
so if you remember in the HTML page the
button
an ID submit so the ID is a way that I
can select that element in my code and
do things to it so now in my code as
long as I select by the buttons ID
submit I can now say button dot
mousepressed asked for but I don't like
asked you know whether whether asked I
don't know think of a better I'm so bad
at functioning do you think of a better
functioning me but the event that I want
is whether asked so now I can take this
and I can write a function called
whether asked and I can paste that in
there and whoops I need to parenthesis
and by the way I'm kind of standing in
front of my code which is the thing that
always happens so if I move this over
that'll help you so now right I selected
the button when I press the button call
whether asked when I call whether asked
ask for the weather based on this URL
that I've made of all these components
from the API call now run this and every
time I hit and I hit submit
I get that weather now notice every time
I hit submit it's the same thing why
because city is still hard coded as New
York but now we could do something
really exciting that's just a variable
right why not get the value of what this
text input field why not get what's in
that text input field and store that in
that particular variable this is going
to make things really really great okay
so here we go so first of all I need a I
need a variable called input and I need
to also select that input input equals
select now I don't remember what ID I
gave it I gave it an ID city so now I
need to say select city and then what am
I doing here I'm instead of this instead
of city being hard-coded as New York I
can overwrite you know X we don't even
need this variable anymore honestly
because we don't want a hard code the
city so I can take that out and actually
instead of I could make it a separate
variable but all I need to do now is put
input dot value here but
so right because I've gotten that text
input element there I can get the value
and add that to my API call so again the
path of the API doesn't change my API
key doesn't change I always wanted in
metric units but I want the city that
piece of it to be from that text input
field and here we go it's running like
to see its submit and I've got London
and let's try some other cities like
Tokyo Los Angeles you can see oh it's
not very humid in Los Angeles New York
Toronto right okay so you get it it
works oh it's great that it works so
this is a this is a nice thing to
practice with api's I mean this is kind
of one obvious way of doing things you
take some from the you take some
information from the user you send that
to the API you get some data back you
display the data back to the user so I
might suggest you know what else could
you imagine here could you could you
create a check box and whether the check
box is checked you would when it's
checked you would get Celsius when it's
unchecked you would get Fahrenheit so
could you that would be one thing to try
to add to this as an exercise I think if
you're looking for like a technical
exercise to do you know mostly I would
say get what true data is in there what
kind of more interesting way can you
display the data if it's raining can you
make it rain in the canvas you know look
again these are kind of like obvious
literal visual representations of the
data but I think you might be also be
able to think more creatively and what I
would like to do now I think that kind
of covers the whole basis there's
actually a there's a missing piece here
I just realized which is that so we've
done two things one we query the API the
moment the program runs and then we're
done now we've done second thing any
time the user performs an action like
pressing a button we query the API and
we get data back a third thing would be
have the program automatically query the
API every so often and this is something
you want to do if you have data that's
changing a lot and there's a there's an
example of an API that gives you the
latitude longitude of the International
Space Station where it is sort of above
the earth and so that's an API that the
space station is moving I think
continuing
believe that you get different data all
the time so I will also like to do it
maybe I'll do that in the next videos
look at how you query an API you know
over how do you set like to do it every
100 milliseconds or every one second or
every 30 seconds just have that happen
in the background while animation is
continuing so I'll take a look at that
in the next video and the other things I
want to do in these future videos just
look at other api's new york times is on
my list word nick is on my list that
sort of thing so let's see this is Nick
a very long video was like so short for
awhile but I had this like section in
the middle where I just like I wasn't
sure if I was in the right place and I
started like rambling about wearing a
tutu if you're still watching this video
right now you know hashtag Schiffman - -
or something to let me know you weren't
watching because no one's going to be at
18 minutes in this video I swear okay I
think that's a thing that maybe I'll do
at the end of a hashtag Schiffman air
quotes I think I need to put shipping in
there oh there may be air just stop
watching alright it go it's a butyl you
hopefully you live somewhere where it's
a beautiful day and even it's not a
beautiful day being outside is nice okay
like the mouse even my mouse went to
sleep even that's how long I've been
reported</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
