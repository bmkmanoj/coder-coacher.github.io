little bit with variables in p5 may be
used mouse X bounce y-you made up some
of your own variables and I want to look
actually at an example it doesn't really
have a lot more to it this example is
just like the one I made previously
where I have a circle that's just moving
across the screen and but and you can
see here how did I do that there's an
incrementation operation right down here
that every time through draw X goes up
by one so first the circles here then it
goes up by one then it's here at then
it's here that it's here so that's how
you move something on the screen now one
thing I did here is I added a whole lot
of other variables let's have a Y and a
diameter for the size of that circle an
RGB variables for the background so
maybe I could do some things like
increment the red amount decrement the
green amount so and hopefully these are
the kinds of things that you've been
playing with and what I want to do in
this video is show you a way to organize
your variables and while it seems a
little bit silly and premature perhaps
you're like this is fine I'm actually
not going to change anything
about this program but I'm just going to
change the way it's organized and this
is going to set a foundation for later
as well as like help you to kind of just
keep your code in a neat and tidy way
which is something that I'm a little too
obsessed about and that's I'm really
working on it really am I swear okay so
let's think about how that could work so
let's just say for the moment that I
have a variable X and it has an initial
value of 0 and I have a variable Y and
it has an initial value of 100 and I
have a variable diameter which has an
initial value of 50 so these three
variables they go together
right I'm kind of using them for that
circle X I'm using for the exposition of
that circle on the screen the Y position
using from the circle on the screen and
the diameter for that circle in the
screen and while this relationship of
these variables is only something in my
mind JavaScript doesn't care the
computer doesn't carat you can use the
variables for anything I could plug this
x value into the color for something it
would work it might be helpful if I
could put all of these together and
there is a way I could do that I can say
var and I could say circle so I have
this circle on the screen and I'm going
to call it a circle and then what I'm
going to do is say equals and I'm going
to have an open curly bracket and a
close curly bracket so circle is now
what's happening a circle you can think
of it as a container what I would like
to do is instead of having three
variables floating on their own I would
like to not have these three variables
floating on their own but I would like
to put those three variables inside of
this variable called circle in order to
do that I'm going to say x colon 0 comma
boy I really hope I'm getting the syntax
to this right because this is new for me
and if I get it wrong I can always make
it again and I'm sure somebody on the
internet will tell me if anybody
actually watches this why : 100 comma
diameter : 50 now where the line breaks
are don't actually matter the curly
brackets matter the colons matter in the
commas matter so you can see that just
like set up function set up was a block
of code with a beginning and an end
function draw is a block of code with
the beginning and this variable circle
now has a block of code with the
beginning and an end and circle is a
container for these three variables now
container is actually not the technical
term for this and what is interesting
about what you have just seen here is
you have now learned about JavaScript
objects JavaScript objects the syntax
for this is JavaScript object notation
the way that you create an object this
circle is an object
that object has data inside of it it has
an X a Y in a diameter and boy are we
going to someday get to some really
exciting stuff where we see that an
object can also have behaviors and so
much more to it but right now you could
think of
there's my circle object and I'm
visualizing the circle object on the
screen I'm visualizing its data its X is
0 it's wise hundred into diameters fifty
by the way I'm using these terms by
accident what's super exciting about
this is learning this we're not going to
get to this for many many videos this is
exactly how you get data from lots of
things so if you want to get the today's
weather into your p5.js sketch you might
connect to some weather service that's
going to send you data it's going to
send you data exactly like this weather
: temp you know weather equals bracket
temperature : high temperature : so
learning this syntax is that is going to
lay the foundation for just about
everything you do in JavaScript here is
a JavaScript object so let's now look at
how we implement this in the code so I'm
coming back over here and instead of
these three variables and we're going to
find out if I did this correctly syntax
wise X : 0 Y :
200 oops I put a semicolon there comma
is actually correct and then diameter :
50 and I can put a semicolon there so
this is really one line of code it ends
with a semicolon but I'm breaking it
into separate lines I'm going to use p5
editors Auto format whoops which you can
see it sort of auto formatted for me and
this is sort of like a standard way of
doing it
so sorry that was a bit of a digression
when I did just notice a little bug in
the editor which I'm going to file
Susan's over so x is 0 Y is 200 diameter
is 50 so I can remove these variables
from the top and I'm going to hit save
and now I'm going to run this AHA now
look at this we this is also key moment
because boy are you going to have a lot
of errors happening when you run your
code so I'm going to zoom in to the
bottom here and we can see what is this
error uncaught reference error
is not defined on line 20 so I'm going
to zoom back out when you go down to
line 20 X is not defined well X is no
longer defined I didn't declare a
variable named X what I did is I
declared a variable named circle which
is an object and one of the fields one
of the pieces of data in that object is
X so how do I get then that X which is
inside of the circle and the way that
you do that is with something known as
dot syntax right when I just had this
variable variable X I just said ellipse
at X so now what do I want to do I want
to draw the ellipse at what I want to
draw the ellipse at the circles X right
the X inside circle and the way that I
get there is I refer to the variable
name circle and I get to that x-value
inside with a dot dot X circle dot X
okay
let's go back now over here and come
down to here and I'm going to say circle
dot X circle dot Y circle diameter and
circle dot diameter okay oh and look at
this I've already forgotten was going to
almost ran this again I'm just going to
say uncaught error because on line 22 X
is not defined because I need to change
this to circle dot X and circle dot X so
I run this and we've got the same exact
program now again nothing new has
happened here so the same exact program
as before but I did do something
interesting which I organized a bunch of
variables into something which leads to
me to like a point where it's like maybe
this might be useful if I were to make
two of them right circle one and circle
two this way I don't have all these x1
x2 y1 y2 everything floating around so
this way of organizing your collections
of variables that are being used
together conceptually into an object can
really help you organize and keep track
of things
and lays a good foundation for a lot of
things there's a lot more we're going to
do with object-oriented programming
later and it also sets the foundation
for working with data that comes from
other sources because it will have
exactly the same syntax so as an
exercise that you might try for yourself
is see if you can take something you're
working on reorganize your variables
into these objects and you know if
you're looking at this one trying to
make two objects try to maybe take make
your own color object that has an RGB
and alpha perhaps in it those are things
that you could try to do and hopefully
this video was useful and interesting to
you and I finished recording it
excellent okay good bye Oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
