Rainbow episode I'm trying a new
experiment which I hope to do many more
of which is have guests here in the
studio so I'm super excited to introduce
these two guests today Clare Kearney
Volpe and chancy fleek they're working
on a really experienced things but
namely a lot of projects and research
around accessibility and code and this a
lot of the work that they're doing is in
collaboration with the processing
foundation on the various tools that
processing works on specifically p5.js
which is going to have a new release of
a web editor sometime soon which I'm
sure I'll talk about and show at some
point and that editor and how that
editor can be made accessible and
available to blind and visually impaired
people so one thing I want to briefly
mention before I get started I'm asking
some questions is that there if you want
to watch this video using youdescribe
which is a tool that allows you to hear
descriptions on some of the images and
things that will be showing there'll be
a link in this video's description for
you to go ahead and do that okay
I guess it's my first question for you
guys is just how did you meet and how
did you get started doing this work I
was doing my thesis work when Chauncey
and I met and we were working on a
project together to make diagramming
tool that would be accessible and
Chauncey you had like the idea for the
project you want to say what your
service sport was so I'm so glad we were
connected I think we were collect
connected by a colleague of mine from
the CUNY disability studies program of
which time I graduated and Claire was
looking to collaborate with users on
participatory design projects that were
driven by the user's individual goals
which is a really important thing rather
than imagining what a user with a
disability might want participatory
design asks which is fabulous
and one of my abiding wishes over the
years has been to have a tool for
dealing with spatial content and spatial
relationships and the example that I
came to Claire with was that every year
I've got to help plan this massive
technology and culture fair at the place
where I work and it's we've got 30-plus
exhibitors each year and some of them
need a certain type of space and some of
them need outlets and some of them
should be or shouldn't be next to other
ones it's a lot like a like a Law School
Admission like a logic game problem and
it's really at least for me viciously
difficult to do in linear or textual
format and so I wanted to do the thing
that most of you take for granted which
is to drag and drop the happy little
tables until I found an optimal
arrangement and there's no real software
solution that works well with screen
readers
I'll talk more about screen readers in a
minute and so I came to Clarence and
please help this is the thing that I am
missing in my workflow that we really
have an impact and a couple things from
this project was first of all I was like
not very good at coding in general and
even worse at coding excessively meaning
people that use screen readers could
have access to the information and use
the application that I was making and I
was like looking online for resources
and just was met with like really dense
wordy things that weren't really
approachable to like a code beginner
like myself and so that was like the
first issue that we kind of we butted up
against and then another thing was if
this project was going to be truly
participatory Chansey you was gonna have
to like pull up her sleeves and start
coding but when we looked online well
the majority of the resources online for
learning how to code were not accessible
or just like that super user-friendly so
coding was completely new for you or I
do dabbled or done certain things with
it but I mean so here's the thing there
have been for decades there have been
some blind folks that learn to code and
that make livings coding and so I'm not
gonna say that there's nothing out there
but we're in this moment we're in the
broader sense of the term coding
education is being made as accessible as
possible so two different diverse
communities two people that might have
never considered it before two people
that might not want to do it full-time
every day but who might need to
incorporate it into their studies or
their careers and that's where I am I'm
probably never going to be a full-time
coder that's
my aspiration there was nothing at the
kind of friendly novice level that I
could find an hour of code here and
there that happened to be accessible
sometimes a video that was verbalized
enough to be usable but I came up across
just a ton of websites where either the
information was pretty advanced and
pretty dense or if it wasn't it was
heavily picture driven relied on videos
that didn't have description of
screenshots and sometimes incorporated
learning tools like text editors in the
browser that were simply not accessible
to a screen reader so I came up across a
ton of roadblocks and so I stopped with
just a little bit of HTML under my belt
and didn't really revisit the question
until I met Claire you know I think it's
really interesting you talk about coding
just as a skill or a thing that you
might do in combination with what you're
already doing in your work or a hobby
and I think this is you know at coming
from the sort of processing foundation
and working with tools like processing
and p5.js a lot of the way people learn
to program is not to become a computer
scientist or to focus their entire life
on code but to add that as a as a tool
it's in to your bag of tricks and things
you know and learn how to think can do
and I think you know you're right
there's so many things going right on
right now there's a you know new White
House initiative computer science for
all there's a New York City Public
Schools Initiative computer science for
all there's that word all there so I
think it's really interesting to think
about how do we make what now is sort of
part of our culture and everyday life
software and how does software work
accessible for everyone yeah and we knew
people were doing it we knew people were
out there coding and
what we did next was we sent to TAS to
interview people that were blind and you
screen readers and do you want to talk
about screen readers because I think
I've said that word a couple of times
now so I don't know what they're so
that's why I guess it hasn't been said
so I'm lined right and I don't use a
computer screen so I've got to have a
way to access everything that's
happening on a computer screen in some
other non visual way and so what a
screen reader does is it renders that
on-screen output into something that's
more usable for a blind person which is
usually text-to-speech output and
sometimes also or instead refreshable
Braille output if I hold up the Braille
display as that so the thing about a
screen reader that separates it from
just its straight text-to-speech
rendering the way that you may have
heard it is that screen readers are
super selective so it would be really
arduous for me to listen to every screen
top-to-bottom I would never get anything
done and so the screen reader allows me
to jump selectively using different UI
elements to the information that I want
so for example I can move my paragraph I
can move by heading I can get something
spelled out when that's necessary and it
allows me to kind of judiciously ignore
the majority of the information that's
on that screen that I don't need at any
given time so where the magic really
happens is a combination of non visual
output and smart Keyboard or Braille
display commands that are conducive to
just jumping to the right place at the
right time and so what's happening now
with so how are you incorporating
accessibility into current projects that
are happening like the people I've just
web editor
other things that are there these days
so I found since our first time working
together I found a number of resources
that are a little bit more user-friendly
and maybe I can provide the link to the
viewers teach access is one that I'm
really a big fan of right now it's
actually an initiative between industry
and academia to try to like promote
accessible code writing literacy so I
think the industry is in a place now
where like these big companies like
Facebook and Google and Yahoo they all
are really lacking in the area of
accessibility and there's like there
people are getting sued all the time now
because their sites and their tools are
not accessible so they're looking for
graduates from academia from computer
science and design to come out with
skills and accessibility and so it's
really an initiative to like have
education in the schools and job
postings for people that are interested
in accessibility and they have really
great like in-depth tutorials for
learning how to code excessively so it's
a teach access org and I've learned like
quite a bit just over working with
another processing fellow Atul Varma
whose take has taken a really big
interest in the project and has been
working with us pretty pretty closely
just some tips and tricks along the way
for coding excessively it's daunting how
much information there is out there but
it's just about incorporating it into
your practice and slowly like picking up
things as you go is with like all coding
but yeah we've been spending the last
chance E&amp;amp;I how long has it been like
four or five months on the project quite
a while on the project working to make
specifically P fives web editor
accessible to people that use screen
readers and so after the interviews that
we did with people that are blind and
code we call them our expert stakeholder
interviews we started doing like fun
workshops with like 8 to 10 people at a
time learning how to code in HTML CSS
and JavaScript
all of the participants were
screenreader users and blind and we
learned from each other like how people
that use screen readers could learn how
to code or you know what's the sort of
workflow would be like what kind of web
editor or what kind of like IDE is
helpful because a lot of them are so
visually oriented so we looks like a big
learning process focus group workshop
stuff that's happened over the last like
few months and now I think at the end of
October we're ready to release like the
first go at an accessible web editor
whose output is right now it's like tech
space but we're adding some tonal stuff
so conceptually we've we've come across
some naysayers for the project because
p5 is like a very visually oriented
language so it's been a really yeah can
I talk about that yeah okay so this is
one of one of the things that seems to
be cropping up again and again right now
because we're at such a moment again of
increasingly available what you would
call visual technologies they're
everywhere so everything from apps on
mobile to drag-and-drop interface and
sip and I was told so much in school you
know if you're gonna be excused from
this assignment because it's very visual
it's actually not most of this
information and most of these
interactions that we think of that way
are not inherently visual any more than
the text that's now on my Braille
displayer coming out of my Texas speech
for my screen reader is inherently
visual what they are is spatial and what
we need are adequate equitable spatial
representation
there are blind people who you would
think of as visual learners I think of
them as spatial learners and just as
surely as their folks in the sighted
community who prefer a more spatial
language as opposed to a textual one
there are blind folks that would prefer
to the work that way coming back to my
example of the fourth floor plan for the
fair it makes sense for me to do that
task in a spatial way and those tools
need to be designed with accessibility
in mind just as much as textual tools
there is nothing about blindness that
makes us prefer linearity or text it's
just that that's what we have now and
what clearer and the processing
foundation have taken on is a really
exciting challenge and the work is
really groundbreaking because it doesn't
assume that spatial elements should be
just left out or designed around it
really they're embracing the challenge
and making spatial interactions possible
for us which is fantastic and I think
that you can hear the same way that you
might think of painting or sculpture as
this sort of like physical process of
you know working with your hands to mold
something or with your hands to spread
paint and creating a visual art it's
really spatial and physical and there's
motion and an activity with your body
and I think programming the output and
thinking through an algorithm that
generates something spatial in a lot of
ways while you're doing the programming
it's a thing that's happening in your
mind and I think you're right that it's
really exciting to think about how to
represent that how to think through that
and how to have that output in in
different and novel ways than so that
it's accessible to everyone
yeah what we're doing now is we're
working on creating a set of like user
preferences so it's not just like one
stock way of getting
output like an X description but we're
working on having like a number of
different options were able to consume
that spatial information
so if somebody wanted to try a screen
reader and get a sense of that
experience what what would they do well
if you have an Apple device it's very
easy if it's an iOS device you can just
tell Siri to turn on voiceover and later
turn off fights over if you have a Mac
it's gonna be command f5 which is a
toggle and if you are a Windows user
you're gonna want to head over to NV
access org and download the fabulous
free and opensource non-visual desktop
access a couple of things to note you're
probably going to want to pull up some
quick references before you start your
screen reader journey because if you're
running a screen reader on a Mac or PC
you're gonna want to know some vital
keyboard commands for moving around
because for most screen reader users it
is a mouse free life and if you're using
an iOS device you're going to want to
understand that the gestures totally
change when the screen reader is on so
if you were to tap the screen with
voiceover on it will simply speak the
element that you're tapping for example
and a double tap for us is what you're
used to as a single tap and the list
goes on but the good news is that
there's a ton of documentation out there
and there's also a fabulously supportive
community on the Apple side
go to Apple vis Apple viscom for a
really lively well informed and
good-natured community of support for
both users and developers around Apple
accessibility and on the windows side of
course envy access work has quite a
wonderful community
that open-source screen reader was
developed by and for blind people and
has a ton of community support available
it's basic but it's interesting to think
about what might be some aspects of
programming the process of programming
that the screen reader works through
perfectly for whether it's it reads out
you know there's above on this line of
code and it tells you what the bug is
versus other things that maybe don't
kind of work with that model and whether
there's other kind of haptic or audio
feedback that could work and I wonder is
this something that you guys are
wrestling with and thinking about like
does the screen reader translate right
to the editor yeah um so a lot of the
common like UI elements translate pretty
well like buttons as long as they're
labeled correctly but something again I
des have like a lot of like visual
syntax highlighting and stuff like that
it's not that's something that we're
working on right now about like it's
like maybe assigning tones to different
parts of the code syntax and also like
visual linting so like as you type there
error message so you can see there's
like parts of the code that's
highlighted so we've actually
incorporated like a lint warning tone
like a little bell little thing if you
leave like a brace off a coat off of a
line of code for more than like five
seconds it'll it'll be new but yeah one
thing that was really interesting from
this whole experience is that like in
the code learning workshops like I feel
like screenreader users are primed for
learning how to code because of their
familiarity with like different like
HTML OS and stuff like that and it was
just a kind of a dream to to do these
workshops everybody picked it up really
quickly and that's because when we visit
a website we really have to know what
heading structure is and what different
types of form fields are etc just to be
able to move around and get some airline
take
it's or place a lunch order and so I
guess our baseline of kind of knowing
about and living with HTML may be a
little bit higher than than average
definitely I would say so one thing I'm
curious about what the workshops that
you've been doing a lot of teaching and
I do emphasize is learning through your
own project ideas and I wonder if any of
the people have attended your workshops
have kind of come up with interesting
ideas around code or accessibility and
through learning some of the skills yeah
especially to do with the output that
we're working on crafting and forming
there was a really great suggestion by
one of the workshop attendees Gus Chavez
to spatialize the information by like
creating like this is the p5 output
right by creating like a something that
was akin to like an Excel spreadsheet
because you can it spatialize in that
you can arrow through and columns and
rows so essentially they're kind of like
battleship
tomorrow from Chauncey like a way to
spatialize the canvas in a different way
can you tell me a little bit about the
ability project and what that is and how
that plays a role in their work and
research you guys are doing yeah so the
ability projects based out at NYU's
Tannen School of Engineering but it's
really like an interdisciplinary
research project between occupational
therapy NYU's ITP program interactive
telecommunications program and
engineering and basically we're just
trying to further study of the
development of assistive and rehab
technologies as well as accessibility
solutions and we take we take a lot of
pride in our approach which is a very
human centered community-based approach
to developing technologies so Chauncey
can you say a little bit about why
coding is so important to the blind and
visually impaired community I think that
sometimes the industry thinks of us and
sometimes we even think of ourselves as
kind of the perpetual consumers we have
struggled so long to get basic access
to literacy and other information and
that's kind of our baseline now but the
next step is harnessing our ability to
create our own solutions and our own
tools some of the products that I use
that are the most life-changing for me
have been created by blind developers
for example I use an app called
seeing-eye GPS to get around and that
was invented by a blind guy like me and
we need to grow the base of individuals
who are willing to engage with their
everyday challenges from a
problem-solving mindset and then share
those solutions I think ultimately the
most compelling technologies and tools
we'll ever have will come from within
the community if you think about it we
have Braille because if Lewis Braille we
don't have it because of outside and
development and we need a proper
grounding in the fundamentals of coding
in particular and STEM education in
general so that we can develop the next
generation of tools that will liberate
us and help us meet whatever goals and
whatever challenges we want
so if if people are interested in
learning more or getting involved or
contributing to your research is the
cocoon a what are the kinds of things
that are stumbling blocks or things that
you need help with or ways that people
could get involved yeah well we're
hoping to get some help with making some
examples with accessibility in mind
we're hoping to get some examples that
have been created entirely using
keyboard commands and with screen
readers we're going to put up the
documentation for how to use the the web
editor with a screen reader and there
that will probably be a link for people
in the open-source community who want to
contribute yeah another way that I hope
that people can take part or contribute
you know we're such a low incidence
disability group and again thinking
about my education I just I just
remember being excused from so much and
I was a pretty academic kid and a pretty
pretty willing to try things but the
educators in my life weren't sure how to
adapt some activities so I think one of
the most important ways that folks can
help us out is if you found out about
this project if you try the tool and you
know someone in the community who is
either an educator a person with a print
reading disability or a visual
impairment and they may be wondering
whether programming is possible for them
or whether any kind of spatial computing
is possible for them connect them to
this community of practice because there
are tons of us out there that just
assume that we won't be doing this and
the moment that we get connected into
the community we can first start
learning and then after we gain
confidence we can start contributing and
the knowledge base grows and we need
help connecting to each other to make
that knowledge base grow in a way that
we know it can yeah wonderful yeah
that's great well I hope that you know
people who will be watching and maybe
know someone who's interested in coding
wants to get involved and learning
contribute that they can get in touch
and you can always get in touch with me
and I hope you get in touch with Claire
Chauncey or through the right channels
to help contribute and participate so
thank you guys so much I it's really
exciting to me to have this venue of
doing all these programming tutorials
that you know honestly what I'm doing is
so visual through video programming with
visuals the output is visual generative
and so I think it's really important for
for me and for everyone to sort of keep
in mind all the different people who
might want to learn might want to watch
who might want to participate and make
sure that things are accessible so I
hope that I can help thanks so much for
being the guinea pigs to try being a
guest before and thanks everyone for
watching and come back and have another
video sometime okay bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
