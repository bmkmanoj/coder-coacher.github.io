for poets tutorial serious under this
video this is if anything this is might
be the most important one for you to
watch or the most exciting or perhaps
hopefully maybe if I can make it so the
most interesting one to watch so what I
have here is a poem it is on it is in a
github repository I created an account
called rainbow coder and what I'm going
to show you in this video is how you as
someone who is not me could contribute
to my repository now this usually
happens in the case of source code
because you want to fix a bug or suggest
a change but we're going to sort of not
look at source code to make things a
little simpler so you might think of
another line you want to add to this
poem that sort of thing
so how do you do that so there's two
concepts first that I want to add to our
list of git concepts before I start
typing stuff in here in the browser and
we come over here these are all the
concepts I've covered so far in the
previous two videos and I'm going to add
two things to our list here I'm going to
add fork and I'm going to add pull
request so these are the two new
concepts that I covering in this video
now what does it mean to fork a
repository so let's say this little
circle here with the word repo in it
represents a particular repository and
you've been making changes along that
repository on a diagram like this a
bunch of different commits and then also
perhaps you had some branches where you
tried some other things out and you
merge those branches in that sort of
thing this repository is is sitting on
github in my account
rainbow coder what if you loved this
repository so much you want to take an
entire duplicate instance of it and have
it live in your account so you could
work on it separately with the same
stuff but not be mucking around with my
not have to have privileges or
permissions to make changes here but
also not by accident mess something up
if you weren't sure about what you were
doing just yet this is what it means to
fork a repository forking repositories
is essentially like I know I was almost
going to use the word clone but I don't
use the word clone because that's a
specific github term I'm an ad
list for later but it's like taking an
entire other instance of the repo and
just having it under your account so I
have another github account which is my
main one called Schiffman and what I'm
going to do is I'm going to pretend to
be both rainbow coder and Schiffman I
guess I don't have to pretend to be
shifted because that's who I am maybe
anyway this is all getting a little bit
strange but so I'm going to fork it and
then I will have in my account my github
account an exact replica I don't get
this right of this entire repository in
its whole history so that if I decide to
do some stuff I can make as many
branches and do various things as I and
I want without affecting the original
core version that's forking now that's
what it means to fork now what does pull
request mean pull request means let's
say this particular byte
I have come up with the most elegant
poignant meaningful set of verse ever
and I want to contribute it back to the
original repository that would be a pull
request now what am i doing I'm
essentially sending this code to this
repository as a pull request and it's up
for Ray it's up to rainbow coder to
accept or reject that pull request the
reason why it's called a pull request in
github this is so strange but let's say
if I if I want to send something this
direction that's going to be a push if I
want to get something the other
direction pull that's going to be a pull
so sending out is pushing coming in is
pulling so really I as Schiffman want to
push my stuff over here but I can't
because I don't have permission here so
I'm saying would you please rainbow
coder pull my changes that's a pole
request okay so these are the concepts
let's go and actually do it here and if
you are watching this live or if you're
watching the archived version of this
video please make a pull request we're
going to invent the world's greatest
collaborative poem about rainbows and
since today's Earth Day I don't know
what Obi when you're watching this maybe
add some stuff about the earth compared
to okay back over here now here it is so
I am logged in here as rainbow coder and
what I've done already in a separate
browser in a separate browser window is
I am at this exact URL of this
particular repository but I am logged in
as Schiffman and you can see here my
like will smiling icon is up there and
but and I am looking at the rainbow code
or a repository vocoders account and the
rainbow poem repository so the truth of
the matter is all of this stuff I could
fork and then make a pull request and do
all that there's actually a really quick
and simple way to do this because github
will it can't take care of everything
for you I'm gonna show you that first
because you could say we can go to the
poem and you can see look look there's
the edit button and look what it says
Fork this project and edit the file so
github already knows that you don't have
permission to edit the file directly so
it assumes if you're trying to edit it
that you're going to fault that you want
to fork the entire project so if I
actually just click edit it's going to
automatically create that fork for me
another way I could create the fork is
to click this button up here you can't
really see that this button up here in
the top right corner fork so I don't
know which one I want to do right now
flip a coin spin a wheel let's start
with the let's do let's fork it let's do
the fork come on let's be let's be bold
today okay so I'm going to click this
fork button right now here goes
Oh whoo oh look at this so one thing
you'll notice by the way that I as a
github user belong to a bunch of
different organizations and that
organizations of different accounts
interesting to note this you probably
you if you just signed up probably won't
have this happen to you but I'm going to
fork it to my Schiffman account you can
see it's forking it it should only take
a few seconds come on github do the fork
dance look at finished I don't have to
dance anymore so now you can see look at
this I now have an entire duplicate
version of this repository in under my
account and it even sets where I forked
it from this all makes sense right so
now what I want to do is go back to poem
and you can see I'm working in it and I
could just hit edit now so I can edit
this and let's
earth by the way everybody when you're
doing your Forks and pull request please
correct get rid of my original poem
nothing about it was any good um Earth
Day is a day oh wait okay let's just say
I don't know recycle recycle is it okay
so I guess I can enjoy it too but about
Earth Day but so I'm adding a line
recycle and then I'm going to now go
down here and look at this so I can
commit directly to the master branch now
note because I'm working in a fork I am
committing to this master branch in my
forked version the repo not the rainbow
Kotra one but sometimes it's kind of
good practice if I'm ultimately going to
propose a change to somebody else with a
pull request to maybe create a new
branch so let's do that and let's call
this branch
Schiffman recycle and I'm going to say
adding recycle recycle so you know you
should this is on doing a terrible
disservice to the world by not by not
putting in excellent thoughtful commit
comments but you should you should be
more thoughtful about that and then I'm
just going to do propose file change now
interestingly enough oh whoa
that this is so I did this in an overly
complicated way by making the separate
branch but it's fine because what I'm
doing here is what it wants me to do is
automatically I got to restart this
video it's fun to keep going this is so
crazy
but it's fine this is this is normal
this we should we should run into these
types of things and figure them out so
because I created a separate branch it
github is sort of automatically
detecting that maybe I want to propose
to merge it back in here and you know me
and then from there I might do a pull
request let's actually um let me go
backwards and I'm not going to do this
extra step of the extra branch I'm just
going to edit master directly and then
do a pull request from there which might
be a little bit simpler somebody on the
internet is probably to yell at me that
I'm doing things incorrectly but and
then I'll make another video
okay so so so actually know what but
what I'm actually going to do even
though I said something different is
click merge pull request and confirm
merge and so now you can see now that
now you can see my particular looks my
particular version of the repository I
was doing so well now has the recycle in
it so what I just did there was this
extra step of making that extra branch
was rather unnecessary because I could
have just edited master directly because
I'm only working with Enlai version the
repository let me get to the important
point now hopefully I didn't waste too
much of your time what happens now if I
go to here now look at this I there is
an option right here now in my I'm in
shipment slash rainbow poem I can say
new pull request and what that's going
to do is say to the when I click new
pull request it's going to tell the
original repository rainbow coder that I
have now a pull request so I can I'm
going to create a pull request with this
commit adding recycle I'm going to
create that pull request going to say
hey I added recycle please this I am I
am really thinking about the earth and
how much and how much I love rainbows
today okay so I'm going to create this
pull request and now there's nothing
left for me to do I just sit and wait I
wait with bated breath and anticipation
hoping that my pull request gets
accepted and yet even if your pull
request is not going to accept it you
have done a good thing on the Internet
today by learning about and submitting a
pull request not all PO requests get
accepted but they should but but just
the act of doing one is a positive thing
to do in the world anyway
so now I can go to window I can go back
now as the rainbow coder I can go back
to this original posit and I can click I
can select now now this is if somebody
now pretend you're the someone gives you
a pull request I can go here to pull
requests and I can see that somebody
actually added another pull request here
already I'm going to merge that one in
perhaps a little bit later
I'm going to look at this one I can see
like aha what was changed this I can
this is the thing that was changed I can
look at it and say blue green indigo
recycle unicorn yellow you know maybe I
would have put recycle after unicorn but
pretty good so I'm going to because this
video now has probably gotten way too
long I'm going to go back to here and at
first I'm going to write thank you so
much I love this change and I'm going to
and I'm going to it's a commit and then
I'm going to write here and I'm going to
do it I'm going to do merge pull request
and we have now started even though it's
just me doing the pull request the first
the world's first this might not be true
but the world's first collaborative
github poem about rainbows on poem in
your pocket day or the day after poem in
your pocket day okay so that was this is
my this is the end of part 3 I encourage
you to go online try to make bigger pull
request to my repository a link to the
repository will be in the video's
description you find another repository
if you know about code fix somebody's
bug and somebody else's repository add
something go and make a pull request on
the internet on github today and see how
that goes and in part 4 I'm gonna do
something more with getting github look
for part 4 I don't forgot what it is but
I'm going to keep going with this stuff
ok see you soon good bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
