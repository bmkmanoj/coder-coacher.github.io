our first lines of code you've you've
hopefully written your first created
your first processing sketches now
you're running stuff you have stuff
drawing to the screen we've begun we're
on our way
but truth be told we are missing a
massive humungous conceptual piece to
this puzzle of learning about writing
software about programming the computer
that we really need to tackle right now
so so this video and net in the next
video we're going to tackle something
we're going to think about but we're
going to call this the flow of a program
the flow of a program so let's look at
this let's consider this idea of flow in
the context of what we have so far so
over here we have a very simple
processing sketch it's what we've kind
of started with we have size of the
window we draw a background and we draw
a rectangle on the screen if I run it
you can see this is the result what's
the flow of this program well we can
count 1 2 3 4 5 6 lines of code it
executes each one of those in order and
when he gets to the end it's done and
voila rectangle on the screen but truth
be told I don't know why I walked over
here but I like the white background
truth be told this is not that is not
how most programs operate verbs I'm
writing a lot of different ways you can
think of something as event-driven for
example if you're using Photoshop every
time you click something or pull down a
menu item some event is triggered some
code is executed in images process you
can also think of a program as kind of
running forever in this loop if you're
playing a game and if if you're playing
a game or watching some procedural
animation it's happening over time draw
the stuff to the screen move the stuff
draw all the stuff to the screen move
the stuff that's what pong is doing
move the mouse draw the paddle over here
move the mouse draw the paddle over here
you programs run over time they keep
track of data over time they take
different paths based on what the user
does or
inputs are coming to the program we need
a foundation for writing programs
writing processing sketches that happen
over time whether that means they run in
a loop over and over again or based on
some event that happens something in the
program gets triggered we're going to
look at both of these scenarios but
we're going to start I think I'm talking
about the right thing that I meant to in
this video we're going to start with
actually just this idea of an animation
loop and you can think of this again if
you were Pro if some day I will come up
with a better scenario than just
starting with the key of a game but if
you were making a game pong space
invaders something more modern I guess
you would would write a program that
runs over time it draws the stuff it
moves the stuff a draw so if I send out
already okay
so how are we going to do this if we
come back and look at the sketch what do
we need to add to this sketch so that it
runs over time this program really just
executed finished we want it to draw
over and over and over again so that we
can start to animate stuff so in order
to do this we need to introduce a new
concept this new concept is going to be
known as a block of code I will just
write that over here block of code we're
going to use blocks of code all the time
we're going to when we want it sort of
like segment this part of our code does
this this part of our code does this
this is the definition of this this is
the definition of that we need to create
a block of code a block of code is
always noted with an open curly bracket
to begin and a closed the closed curly
bracket to n and then the code that is
contained when that that block goes in
between those curly brackets so we need
two blocks of code let's think about
this the flow of our program is actually
going to be very very simple we're going
to have two elements one we're going to
call setup and one we're going to call
draw I don't know what
drawing over here this is going to be
set up and this is going to be draw we
need some lines of code and setup we
need some lines of code to draw I need a
bigger whiteboard but anyway what can
you do
okay so why do we have these two blocks
of code here is the flow of a program
that we are going to begin with our
program is going to do some things at
the beginning we're going to think of
this as the set up the initialization
conditions and then it's going to do
some things over and over again and so
setup is stuff that's going to happen
once and only once once and only once
draw is the stuff really a good like
hide back here that's going to happen
forever over and over again we're again
in a loop so when it gets to the end it
comes right back up and execute that
code again code that happens once code
that happens over and over again why
does this flow make sense for us this
flow makes sense for us let's just take
for example the game pond again because
there are often a bunch of things you
want to do to initialize a program pong
begins set the score to 0 set the level
to zero place the paddles in their
starting location place the puck in its
starting location then that's the stuff
that happens when you initialize the
program then as the program runs over
and over and over again looping and
looping it does stuff like move the
paddle draw the paddle move the paddle
draw the panel if the puck hits the
battle turn the puck around if the puck
goes past the paddle increase the score
that type of thing so all that stuff is
always happened while that program is
running
when does the program stop I don't know
in this case absolutely never
you know when the computer breaks when
the user hits quick turns it off it's
quick obviously we could create all
sorts of different types of scenarios
where a program stops we starts all
sorts of things but but this is our
basic foundation some stuff that happens
at the beginning and some stuff that
happens forever and ever so let's go
back and look at this code for a second
say ok here are some things in this
program there's the size function
there's the background function and
there's the other stuff that draws a
rectangle
what should happen at the beginning and
what should happen forever in the loop
we can look at this we can ask that
questions you can pause the video right
now and try to answer it for yourself
and then now you've unpause it or you
probably didn't do that because who goes
live in anyway maybe you did thank you
for like if you bring me but um I think
at least there's one thing that's
incredibly obvious which is that size
should go at the beginning size is an
initialization condition we're setting
up the size of our window now of course
you could probably come up with some
scenario where you want a window to
dynamically precise while the program is
running but that's not what we're doing
right now what we're doing right now is
we're saying size is something that we
have to add that we have to do once and
only once now in an animation program
presumably we want to draw our stuff
over and over again we always want to
draw it in the window so I'm going to
say that our rectangle method which I
forget what the numbers are but I'll
just make some up is going to go in draw
and the fill the stroke and all that
stuff for drawing the rectangle we're
going we want to draw that stuff forever
and ever
looping over and over again set up the
initial conditions draw the stuff over
and over again so there was one more
thing over here background I forgot to
start the timer and for how long I'm
going background where's that go okay I
would say there's I'm good to say
there's no correct answer to this
question and for now I'm actually just
going to put background here and we're
going to examine this later what happens
if I put background and set up what
happens if we put other than thoroughly
are no right answer these questions it's
up to it has to do with what you're
creating this is just the foundation you
have stuff in setup that happens at the
beginning and stuff that happens to draw
over and over again how things I was
going to say that one video probably
have done too many already okay so this
we've now established as what we want to
do we want to have these blocks of code
right a block of code that is our setup
a block of code that is our draw but but
the truth of the matter is with syntax
for how we're going to write this is
we just suddenly look a little hot so
this is conceptually I think I've
established conceptually what we've got
we've got a set up which has size in a
block of code we've got draw which has
background a rectangle in a block of
code but what do we actually have to
write in processing so I'm going to
erase everything around this and I'm
going to look at what the actual
processing syntax for establishing set
up and draw is and what it is is we say
void set up parentheses open bracket
closed press get void draw parenthesis
open bracket close bracket so this what
we should recognize at least from this
discussion of a block of code is these
open bracket close bracket this is
saying everything in between these two
brackets is the stuff that goes and draw
everything in between these two brackets
is the stuff that goes in size we now no
longer want any code anywhere else any
stray code just somewhere outside of
these two blocks would not make any
sense code only happens in setup a draw
of course there going to be more
functions and less we're stuff later
but for now we can sort of think of in a
simple way code only happens either at
the beginning or over and over again in
a loop so looking at this we can
understand now aah-ha set up this is the
set up block of code this is the draw
block of code but there's other syntax
here that we don't understand like this
seems so sad like well how do we have
this word void here I mean my is my
programming life the void of beating and
Happiness and why is that weird there if
there's these parentheses there and I
don't understand that and what does all
this mean what does any of this mean the
truth of the matter is on this will of
what the word void means will come later
why we have these parentheses here will
come later but one thing we can sort of
see about this is what I will mention is
what we're actually doing is not to fun
this is a block of code and then it's
contained between curly brackets but
we're actually doing is defining our own
function we're defining the setup
function we're defining the draw those
functions are executed by processing
automatically set up at the beginning
draw
over and over again and we've now
defined what code should be inside those
functions this will become more clear in
video mojodojo most I figure out what
number that is what when I do a video
that's all about writing function more
about the sort of syntax of defining
functions but for now we just need to
kind of memorize this syntax and so
let's go over to our processing sketch
walk over here and let's add this in so
I'm going to add in I'm going to say
void setup curly bracket curly bracket
void draw curly bracket curly bracket
and I'm going to obnoxiously remove my
comments here just for a second oh I did
something ah help everybody stop okay
what I why I auto so I did something
that's like a force of like unbelievable
habit in nature I hit command T which I
didn't want to do because I wanted to at
least demonstrate before I did that that
what the way my code looked was like
this so one convention again remember
line break still no meaning in the way
the code executes the curly brackets
define the beginning and end of a block
the semicolon defines the end of a line
but human beings especially if you're a
human being like me like to keep things
incredibly orderly and very nice and
neat and to feel comfortable and relaxed
in one's life and the convention to be
able to make code a little bit more
readable is when you have a block of
code you always indent the code inside
that block so you can see here that in
draw you can see all those lines of code
are slightly indented but in setup it's
not I could do that manually myself
space space um but one thing that
processing has is under edit it has a
nice little option here called auto
format and auto format will Auto it dent
clean up all of your blocks of code for
you so probably that was a little bit of
an unnecessary digression but it's
something that is Auto formatted
indentation and the code commenting and
something that's very meaningful and
important to me
- but you should not be like me you
should be a free spirit and just enjoy
things that just don't worry about if
like you know if a couple if if if your
code looks like this you should not have
to like you know sit down in the corner
and like breathe deeply for like 15
minutes you know you'll be fine but
anyway okay so I went off on a really
long tangent there which someone will
download this video and edit that out
and send it back to me so I can upload
it again without that but until that
happens you had to sit through that okay
so we've done it we now have setup size
happens once draw this stuff happens
over and over again over and over again
over and over again let's run our new
program our dynamic program that runs
over time we run it we look at it we
have the exciting amazing result of
exactly what we had before this is very
sad this is a sad moment in computer
programming learning history fortunately
it's not gonna be sad very long the next
video we're going to take this step
further but why is it still a static
program the reason why it's a static
program is what if we say to do in draw
over and over again exactly the same
thing exactly the same thing draw the
rectangle at 320 180 draw the rectangle
at 320 180 draw the rectangle at 320 180
it never moves and never changes color
it never grows it never does anything
this is our next step if we have a
program that runs over time how do we
introduce the concept of variation into
this loop so um I suppose what I would
suggest to you before you watch the next
video is fine something you made and and
enter get set up and draw into your
sketch try to type out the syntax see if
you run into any errors just get a
sketch with this with this unwith set up
and draw in something I will say for
some reason you're following along the
learning processing book it does
something which says take your elaborate
crazy alien design and put it in a
dynamic program and actually what I
would suggest to you after some
experience of using this book with
teaching is don't do that I would say
come up with something really simple
make a very simple design one circle one
rectangle because what we're going to
focus on is less about all this code and
gobbledygook for drawing an elaborate
pattern in the screen we want to focus
on just starting to animate
simple element how to how to introduce
variation into our program it's going to
be a lot easier to do that with a simple
sketch and not an elaborate design later
you can kind of understand what it means
to like start building more elaborate
designs but right now I want to focus on
this one flow of a program so boy that
was a much longer video than I imagined
even though I have no idea how long it
was and I will be recording the next one
as soon as I press the stop button at
the start button see I just keep going
this this is artificial that I stop and
start I think I would like them to be
lots more short ones but I don't know
I'm just doing the best I can thank you
very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
