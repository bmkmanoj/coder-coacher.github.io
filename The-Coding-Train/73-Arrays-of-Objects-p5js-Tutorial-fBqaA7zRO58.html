neighborhood coding person who made some
bubbles so if you were watching some
previous videos a while back I made
these bubble objects and there they are
they're moving around the screen and
then there were some videos where I look
kind of different which we're about
arrays just like arrays of numbers and
rays of strings and like it's a list of
things and things have indices so why am
I here now I'm here in this video
because I have this goal I have this
goal in life which is to say I have
defined what it means to be a bubble I
made a bubble class I made a bubble
object and I made two bubble objects
bubble 1 and bubble 2 and I would like
to be able to make 5 bubble objects and
I would like to not have to do this
because I would also like to make 500 or
a thousand or 10,000 I want to be able
to make as many duplicate as many
objects as I want create as many objects
as I want from that template from that
class without having to have all these
separate variables and wouldn't you just
isn't it just so convenient that I'm
right here
having just talked about objects and
arrays if I just put those two things
together we'll be in good shape so let's
do that I don't think I need to yeah
okay so let's just do that oh no don't
go over there okay so so I'm gonna
change this from one variable two
variables to a single variable called
bubbles now remember when I want a
variable to hold an array a list of
information instead of making it equal
to something like an object or a number
I set it equal to open closed brackets
there's other ways you can create an
array also but this is a pretty
conventional way now what I might do is
I might say okay I have this array in
theory I have this array that I could
fill why don't I put a bubble in index
zero and a bubble in index one so I'm
going to put my bubble here and put my
bubble here make two bubble objects
instead of having separate variables
bubble one bubble two I am going to have
a
variable bubbles index zero because
remember the first spot in the array is
zero not one so it was kind of bad that
when I was doing this idea in the bubble
one in bubble - I should really name the
bubble zero in bubble one so the first
thing I could do is just change this
program to say like hey bubbles
zero bubbles one bubbles 0 this is
bubbles zero you get the idea right one
oh this is awful why am I even bothering
with this bubbles one oh no look at this
this is bubbles zero and one and this is
bubbles zero in one ah oh my goodness oh
my gosh no wait a second stop the
presses
I'm so confused I think what I would
prefer to do is move 0 and 1 and then
show 0 and 1 so of course I could do
this in any order but I want to move the
first one and and and by the way this is
not going to be the solution because
even though this now works and I have
the same exact result the only thing
that I've done differently is that
instead of having two separate variables
I have one array but I'm still
referencing the two separate bubble
objects individually so if I want to
have ten of them I still have to keep
adding more and more lines of code so
what I want to do is I want to use that
for loop if I say for let i equals 0 i
is less than some number i plus plus
then inside here i can refer to that
array called bubbles instead of saying
hard-coding in zero hard-coding in 1 if
I just say bubbles index I this is going
to repeat many times with a different
value for I I is zero then it's 1 and
it's 2 then it's 3 so this is a way of
me iterating accessing every single
element of that array so I can use that
too and by the way I know I know there's
like a for each sort of thing and maybe
I'll make a video about that but I'm
gonna just use
a nice for-loop with a counter variable
so I'm gonna say for let a equal zero
eyes less than two I plus plus and now
instead of referencing the bubbles
individually I'm going to just say
bubbles index high which means I can now
do this
bubbles index I that same loop later and
draw this is to use a loop to create the
bubble objects and set up I can say
bubbles index I don't move bubbles index
I dot I don't even remember anymore a
show is that what it was we could scroll
down and look at the bubble claw MC move
and show okay so those were the names of
the functions that I used in that bubble
class so now let's run this again oops
and here we go so look at that ah now I
still have two bubbles but one was big
one was small before and then one was
they were both there were different
spots I lost that so one of the things
that I had in my previous example if I
just go back to here is I had specified
exact locations for each bubble object
and exact sizes and now that I have a
loop I'm in a much happier place in that
I can easily make 20 of these but it's
what do I do about initializing all that
stuff so this thing is here hello
welcome to programming the reason why
I'm coding here is not because I want to
specifically set some exact locations
for bubbles more likely I want to come
up with some kind of algorithm like I
want all the bubbles to appear in a
perfect grid or I want them all to
appear randomly or I want them to be in
a grid that's slightly offset randomly
or I want them to appear in a spiral
pattern I want to always start in the
same place so what is that algorithm so
let me just say so one thing I could do
is I could use the fact that I have this
counter I and I could say let X equal
like well what if I start the bubbles
starting on at like pixel ten and then
add space them out by like 30 pixels you
know so this kind of came to me
immediately because I've done this so
many times but this is now a formula
that when I
zero X will equal 10 when I is 1 X will
equal 10 plus 30 times 140 and if I ever
got to 2 which would one in this case it
would be 10 plus 1670 right so this idea
of spacing the bubbles out so I could if
I made three of them and by the way and
then of course instead of hard-coding
this value here I could say X I could
use this variable to pass in which is
calculated everything and then by the
way this is really pretty bad so one
thing that's bad about this is now if I
if I'm creating three bubbles all of a
sudden right then I left this number two
here so what I want to do is say bubbles
dot length so this way however now I
can't use bubbles dot length here
because the array when I first started
was empty so I'm adding things to the
array a certain number of them then I
can retrieve that length later and again
there are different ways you can
approach how many spots there are and
how you store the length but this is
just a way that I'm gonna do it for this
example
so now let's look at this you can see
look at them they started now let's not
move them just so we can see you can see
there they are spaced out and I could
easily just say well actually I want to
space them out by a hundred pixels and I
want them just to be 20 pixels and and
you can see there we go and I want them
to actually start at least 20 pixels in
and you can see there they are and then
I want to have ten of them there we go
but I can't really have ten of them you
get the idea and now I could put back in
move and there they go
so this is a weight and I look hello do
something kind of exciting about this
video which is that I haven't once
changed any of the code down here this
idea of a single bubble has remained
exactly the same the thing that's
different now is that I can create them
and put them in an array and however
many there are I could just move and
show all of them so I'm gonna show you a
few more things here now here's another
thing I could do let's actually just
make theme let's let's just sort of
prove this point let's give them all
random spots and again I could set them
randomly in the constructor but I'm just
going to do it here so I'm gonna give
them all a Rand
I'm gonna just create all bunch of
bubbles with random locations and we
could same random sizes and you can see
there they are but this is what I'm
talking about now I have this one
program here
it makes ten bubbles I want this program
to now make a hundred how how many keys
on the keyboard do I need to hit in
order to make this change one if I
programmed everything correctly all I
need to do is add a zero here and
suddenly I have a hundred of them and if
I add another zero suddenly I have a
thousand then now my program might be
slowing down because it's drawing a lot
of bubbles and it's a lot to draw and
you know I could sort of start thinking
about what I really want to do here
maybe actually what I want is for these
bubbles not to have a stroke but I want
them to have a fill with quite a bit of
alpha and I could take this out of here
and now I've got this sort of like
cloudy thing going on so again I can use
this idea what I'm really doing here is
I'm kind of on the way to building
something called a particle system I'm
building a system of many individual
elements that together make some sort of
effect like a smokey cloudy thing but I
could just with a with one variable now
with one value change how many things
are in there now here's the thing what
if I'm gonna do one more thing in this
video and I'm gonna I'm gonna actually
put the bubble back to have that so
let's just go back to where I was with
just start with ten bubbles ten bubbles
now what if what if I take this out of
setup entirely it's gone what's gonna
happen what's my program going to do
nothing emptiest no but no emptiness no
bubbles what if what I want to do is add
bubbles when I click the mouse okay
let's think about this the first thing
that I might want to do is figure out
where I get where code executes so when
I click the mouse so that is that I want
to add function mousepressed
now whoops sorry
now what do I want to do I
to make a bubble let be equals new
bubble and I want that bubble to be
where the mouse is and maybe it has a
random size between 10 and 50 pixels so
I've made and I don't love these 1
character variables I should do better
than that but I've picked a random
number and I've made a new bubble what
if I want to put that bubble in the
array well I could say something like
bubbles index 0 equals B right I could
say ah the first spot in the array put
that bubble when I click the mouse look
I only have one though because what I'm
doing here is
every single time I'm making a new
bubble and putting it in the first spot
but if this were a counter and it went
up every single time I could put the
first bubble in the first spot the next
bubble in the second spot the next
bubble in the third spot but I could do
even better than that there's actually a
function there's a lot of functions
associated with arrays arrays are
actually objects too that allow you to
do certain things I'm going to get to
them I can delete stuff I can move stuff
around I can shuffle I can sort but what
I'm going to do is I'm gonna use this
function called push push is a function
that means add something to the array
push it to the array and actually by
default it's going to push it to the end
of the array so now that I have that
every time I click I add a new bubble
and what's interesting about this is
there's no there's a there's no limit to
the number of bubbles I can have other
than the computer speed in memory and
interestingly enough I might just as a
little effect change this to Mouse
dragged and you can see now and I drag
the mouse I'm kind of drawing this this
kind of array of bubble objects okay so
this is all about making an array of
objects so if you're following along
maybe you had an object you made some
variation of the bubble you made a
bouncing ball you made some kind of
flying pig I don't know what it is you
made a rainbow heart take that dope
don't make any changes in your class at
all try to write a program where you've
duplicated an array and you can just
change one number and you can have 500
versus a thousand versus 10 see if you
can add them with clicking the mouse or
hitting the keyboard or some type of
maybe what happened what if you try to
like
one every 10 seconds how would you do
that what kind of event can trigger the
adding of an object and then what I want
to do in a future video which maybe will
be the next one is how could I delete
these when I click on them or how do I
even know how do I communicate over
small there's a couple things how do I
know if these bubbles are intersecting
with each other so I want objects to
talk to other objects and I also want to
be able to talk to the objects bubbles
you bubble a new bubble that's me
talking to the objects I guess but I
don't miss a alexa that's not and it
bubbles name's not alexa anyway what was
I talking about
oh so I want to be able to figure out
how do I interact with the bubbles hit
each bubble have its own mouth pressed
kind of like event how does that work so
I got to get to that sort of stuff and
that will come in a future video thanks
for watching
