so much comfortable with trigonometry
now ready for the next step the next
step is simple harmonic motion what is
that
well we there's lots of examples of that
that we could find it though we're
actually gonna model in in the next
video after this one we're gonna we're
gonna model actual the swinging of a
pendulum we're gonna look at the bobbing
of a spring how can we model those
things through forces but we could think
of lots of examples plucking of a string
maybe the flapping of a butterfly's
wings can we could even a model with
simple harmonic motion so how can we
model simple harmonic motion well there
is one incredibly simple way of doing it
and so to do that let's take a look at
some the sine function so if you've ever
seen a graph of the sine function
because maybe that's what you look at in
your spare time it's gonna look
something like this it's a wave pattern
right if this is a graph of y equals
sine of X now a couple things we should
note about this this looks quite a bit
like a sound wave a lot of what we're
talking about here if you're a sound
person you know way more about this than
me you could correct everything in the
comments below but one of the things so
the sine function gives us this wave
pattern so we think we used sine to do
kind of a polar to Cartesian
transformation thing in the previous
video
now we're just saying hey if sine gives
us this nice wave pattern couldn't we
draw that wave counter on the screen or
couldn't we map the an object's location
its Y location to the results of the
sine function and have something move up
and down notice something about this
sine function it doesn't look like this
right if it looked like this this would
be kind of like our I just learned a
program bouncing ball example right it
hits the side it goes over this way it
sits aside turns around we have this
nice easing to the top and speeding up
and easing into the bottom and easing
out of the bottom and easing to the top
and easy right the fact that there's
this nice smooth curve is something we
can really use to our advantage in
modeling different types of motion and
behavior on the screen so a couple
things about this one thing we should
say is waves have properties to them two
properties that we can think of as one
is amplitude
and the other is period and I'll put
here in parentheses frequency frequency
is really just one divided by period so
let's look at what those mean so
amplitude it refers to the height of the
wave the difference between the maximum
part of the wave and the minimum part of
the wave you might remember some stuff
about this when we looked at Perlin
noise actually maximum part of the wave
to the minimum part of the wave that is
the amplitude period is the amount of
time it takes for the wave to repeat
itself
how long is one cycle that repeats and
we can see here how long is that this if
we look from here to here this is this
section is an entire cycle of this wave
and so this length is the period so a
smaller period is faster oscillations a
longer period is slower oscillations
because I have no props or diagrams I'm
just doing weird things with my body
okay so these are the things we want to
control if we are modeling the
butterfly's wings is it a big amplitude
are those big flapping or small flapping
or the flapping is very fast a low
period or very slow a big period and
frequency by the way is just the inverse
of period of is how many sight how many
cycles in one unit of time so this is a
very high frequency and this is a very
low frequency so okay so that's all kind
of in the abstract but how does this map
to a processing sketch so let's think
about that for a moment let's create a
processing window I'm recording
excellent a processing window and let's
say we want to have this object just
simply oscillate to the edge of the
screen and all the way back back and
forth oscillating back and forth so what
is the amplitude of this oscillating
motion well the amplitude we could think
of as this distance from the center to
the edge we could think of that as width
divided by two excellent
what is the period what is the period in
this oscillation well we say how long
does it take for one cycle what is our
unit of time like how long what like the
aha I just thought of it in processing
our unit of time is frames so we can
think of how many frames does it take
for it to get all the way to this side
and all the way back to get to do one
for from from from the centre and back
again so one full cycle we could think
of in frames
maybe our period we say is 200 frames so
now what we need is a formula we need to
say if if we are if we are trying to get
the X location oscillating with this
amplitude in this period how do we do
that okay well let's go back to the sine
function sine of an angle what is the
amplitude of that of the result of the
sine function
well actually sine oscillates between 1
and negative 1 the biggest number you'll
ever get out of the sine function is 1
the smallest number you'll ever get out
of this high functioning of one trust me
you're never gonna get anything bigger
than 1 or smaller than a negative 1 so
if we say the value of x in this
oscillation is equal to the sine of
something and I'm probably gonna run out
of space here the sine of something if
we multiply it by amplitude if we
multiply something that goes between 1
and negative 1 by with / - we're going
between with / 2 and negative with by pi
PI over 2 so we can take the result of
the sine function and multiply it by
amplitude now how do we get the period
so in processing ok well first of all
what is the period of the sine function
well remember a circle full rotation of
a circle well if we look at this this is
0 what's over here 2 pi what's over here
4 pi so every 2 pi in the sine function
it repeats right if you remember that in
our polar to Cartesian coordinate
transformation it takes us 2 pi radians
to get all the way around you can think
of going around in a circle
almost as an oscillating motion so a
full period for the sine function just
the way it is is 2pi so what we want to
do is say hey if we take I'm gonna just
make these print to these down here
frame count what frame are we currently
on / period and multiply that by 2 pi
now we're going to have oscillation
according to the period we want now why
is that formula work frame count divided
by period times 2 pi well remember 2pi
gives us a full cycle through the sine
function so when frame count is 0
what's 0 / period 0 when frame count is
100 what's 100 divided by period 0.5 so
we're halfway through the full cycle
when frame count is 200 200 divided by
period is 1 so you can see this is like
a ratio of our current frame count to
the period how what percent are we 10
percent of the way through the period 50
percent 60 percent multiply that by 2 pi
and we have this full cycle let's go see
that actually work in a processing
sketch so here we are I have a
processing sketch here which is all set
up and ready to go we have X equal to 0
and we're drawing a circle at X but now
we want to map when we want to have that
circle oscillate back and forth so we
can say x equals so let's give ourselves
an amplitude of width divided above 360
and a period of we said 200 frames so X
is equal to that amplitude times sine of
frame count divided by period and I'm
gonna run out of space it's very sad so
I'm gonna make this a little wider I'm
wasting time in this video doing that
but and I'm gonna say frame count
divided by period times 2 pi so by the
way you can say 2 times pi but there's a
built in constant processing to
underscore pi so if we run this now we
can see we have this oscillating motion
so it's as if doors almost maybe a
rubber band the spraying I'm gonna look
better if it was moving up and down this
maybe looked a little weird moving right
and left but you can see here we go
we've got this nice oscillating motion
back and forth very simple with a period
of 200 now that deck could be flexible
you know we could adjust the period you
can see if I make a period of 30 it's
going to oscillate back and forth much
longer if I make a smaller amplitude
it's gonna just oscillate back and forth
like that so so here's the thing this is
kind of okay a little example mishap I'm
gonna edit this back and I'm starting
now okay so here's the thing okay so
this works we have this nice little
oscillating motion and we've really like
we've got our period down exactly map to
frame count we have our amplitude but
honestly like using this elaborate
formula is not really that practical and
what I want to look at over here right
we've we've written out this formula
which in kind of a messy way but really
I can just I want erase this part of the
formula and I want to go back and put
these parentheses here and ask a
question what goes in there so we had
this what we put in there if we look
over here really quickly is like ants um
frame count divided by period times 2pi
but what we really want in there what
really what is that what is that formula
result in it's a number that kind of
goes up every frame right frame count is
zero and then you divide by the period
then freak out it's 1 divided by the
period then 4 it comes to and you divide
by the period it would be much simpler
if we just made up a variable called a
or theta and said a plus equal zero
point zero run and what is that that's
really angular velocity and it guess you
can't probably see the bottom here um I
gotta work on that I've always said that
before I swear him to get better okay so
what's going on here we could really
simplify this example by using the
concept of angle as position angular
velocity angular acceleration and and we
don't even in this case we could we
don't even need acceleration but we
could see that this is a simpler way to
do it and
with a higher angular velocity we're
going to have a shorter period with a
lower angular velocity we're gonna have
a longer period and let's take a look at
that so here we are over here we're
going to simplify this example fumbling
fumbling here we go
we're gonna simplify this example I'm
going to save it as something and I'm
gonna say hey you know what just put a
variable in there call it angle and
forget about period make a variable
called angle and let's just say angle
plus equals 0.05 oops not a angle let's
run that and see what we get
it's pretty similar oh it's too slow I
want faster oscillation faster all we
need to do is increment that angle quite
a bit more let's increment it a lot more
and we can see I have faster so you
could control that oscillating motion in
a much simpler way and we could even add
acceleration to it as an exercise you
might just add acceleration to this so
this is incredibly simple a really
simple way of using the sine function to
give us angular oscillating motion
simple harmonic motion now what can you
do with this we could easily probably
make this video an hour and just keep
going through example after example and
what I want to do just very briefly is
show you a few additional examples of
how you could take this a step further
and what I would suggest to you is you
know look at these and try to recreate
them yourself as an exercise and you can
always go and look up the answers
they're linked the examples are linked
in the github repo so first first of all
one thing you could do to this is just
think okay it's oscillating along the
x-axis what if I also have it oscillate
along the y axis what would that look
like well here's an example of what that
looks like also with many many objects
all oscillating so different periods
different amplitudes along the x and y
axis and you can see where you have
these sort of different oscillating
motions so you could you could create
this kind of what to call this strange
thing by oscillating along multiple axes
with variable frequencies and amplitudes
another thing we might look at is what
if we took this one oscillating motion
instead of having oscillate left to
right have it oscillate up and down and
what if we put one next to it and one
next
and one next to it a ray of them all
oscillating up and down with slightly
slightly off in a slightly a different
moment in time if we do that we get this
so we can actually use the sine function
essentially graph that sine function all
these are just oscillating up and down
they're just this one starts first then
this one then this one then this one
they're all oscillating but at different
points in time and you get this kind of
wave sneaking pattern incidentally if
you do this and try to do it with Perlin
noise that's pretty interesting as well
you'll get you'll get kind of a more
random oscillating motion now once you
know how to do this with what where you
start to get really interesting wave
patterns is if you say let me add a
bunch of waves together what if I take
let me just describe this to you
are we over here yes what if I take a
wave with this period and amplitude and
take one with this period amplitude and
then take one with it I can't do three I
don't know why I tried to do three right
we kind of looked at this earlier with
pearly noise if we add these two waves
together maybe we get this pattern so
one thing you can do is start having
multiple oscillations adding them all
together to create different different
more sophisticated patterns and I think
I have an example that I can briefly
demonstrate to you here this is example
3 point 9 and the github repo so you can
see look at this wave this wave is the
result of a bunch of different random
waves added together I think if I know I
thought if I click the mouse it resets
but each time I run it's a different
wave pattern so you can see in this
example the way the code has been
implemented and an array of a chain of
of angular velocities and the last thing
I think what you might actually really
look at which is maybe perhaps most
relevant to the stuff that we're doing
here is take a look at this oscillating
motion what if you considered that to be
the legs of an insect or the wings of an
insect what if an object you have moving
all around the screen according to some
in in two-dimensional space what does
that object could have its own internal
motion so it's almost as if these little
legs are propelling it
around the screen oscillating back and
forth back and forth back and forth the
faster it moves the more it accelerates
the more those legs that the the short
of that period becomes when it slows
down the period becomes longer so I have
perhaps what I would look maybe offer is
perhaps one of the lamer
versions of this but you can see an
incredibly simple version of that ideas
that this these objects are moving
according to position velocity
acceleration with attraction this is the
same example as in Chapter two forces
attraction but each one has this little
oscillating dot that the faster that's
tied it's it's period is tied to its
velocity so the faster it moves the
faster it oscillates so it's as if it's
kind of trying to like pull itself
around the screen like that so you could
come up probably with something much
more creative and visually interesting
to that and you could think of like lots
of legs in the centipede that would be I
would say a good exercise kind of
project for you and it was we're gonna
look at a pendulum and spring in a
moment but you could really stop here
and create a whole project around the
internal mechanics of an object that
oscillates as it moves throughout the
screen okay so that ends this video
that's a 70 sub-projects you make and
we're gonna look at in the next two
videos we're gonna look at a pendulum
and a spring modeling a pendulum spring</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
