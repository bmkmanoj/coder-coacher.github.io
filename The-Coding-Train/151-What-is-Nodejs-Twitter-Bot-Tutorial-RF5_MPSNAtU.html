series of videos where the ultimate goal
at the end of this video is to make a
Twitter bot that posts images to Twitter
now why you might do this what what's
the point of making a Twitter bot what
our Twitter bots it's kind of a big
topic and I will sort of like get to
that discussion along the way I'll put
some links in this video's description
of some articles and some examples that
you might look at to think about making
Twitter BOTS but I'm really going to
stick to the nuts and bolts the
technical stuff in this series of videos
so and the first thing that I want to
start with is something called node
nodejs
and working with the command line so
let's say you're someone who's been here
with me watching videos about
programming in JavaScript let's come
over to the whiteboard here and think
about what's going on you are a person
who is working on a laptop and in that
laptop you you have a browser and you
have been making JavaScript sketches you
might have written an HTML page a CSS
page and you have these nice little
animations running in that browser
written in and I have a whole set of
tutorials that you could look at using
this JavaScript framework called p5.js
ok so what's going on there if for
example you are using the p5.js editor
what the p5.js editor is doing is
running something called a server what
is the server so you know we think of
this thing we use this terminology known
as the cloud this is a thing that's come
up a lot at ITP here recently which is
the cloud is really like a lot of
underground bunkers and giant scary
looking facilities they're not really
like these servers floating in the sky I
hit you know on on the wings of unicorns
or something that you might like to
think that this idea of the cloud might
make you think but I've kind of a lot of
topic here the point is if let's just
think about Google for a second Google
has a server and when you type into your
browser google.com you're making or
request to that server and that server
gives you a response all of that has in
fact been happening if you're writing
JavaScript code making web pages on your
laptop your laptop using the p5.js
editor is running a little server to
simulate what might happen should you
ever deploy or upload your stuff
somewhere else and so if you have your
own website like my website is Schiffman
it's it really needs to be redesigned
and fixed up maybe you could help me
with that so I hesitate to mention it
but Schiffman dotnet for example right
if I worked on something I took my code
and I put it here then now somebody else
in the Internet
could make a request to my server and
where I put all of my JavaScript code
and it might respond and send that
JavaScript code so that that person
could see the beautiful animation
happening in their web browser so all of
these with the exception of Google
because their servers obviously like a
highly sophisticated thing was a lots
going on but in this case with p5.js
running it locally or uploading the
thing you made with p5 GS to your own
web server the only thing that's
happening but for on the web server that
the web server is doing is delivering
static content it's delivering an HTML
file it's delivering a JavaScript file
it's delivering some images it's
delivering some Styles some CSS what I
am taught what I would like to talk
about in this video is what what happens
when it when when there comes a time in
your life where that's not enough you
need to actually run a program on the
server now Google clearly does this
because when you ask for you know search
for rainbows you want to find out about
on Google about rainbows a little server
program runs and it's like connects to
their massive like crazy database of the
entire like universe of thought and
information and it processes it and
figures out it figures out what to give
back to you that's a little server
program that's running on Google servers
you know if you log into your
banking and put in your user name and
password a little server program has to
read that figure out if it's the right
username and password give you back your
account balance that sort of thing so
node is a framework a JavaScript
framework for writing custom I would say
servers now the thing is even though so
there's a lot that you could do here and
I in terms of like writing your own web
server but one of the reason why I'm
doing these videos about node is one of
the things that you might want to do in
your life making projects with code and
information and things is make use of
the Twitter API so I have a whole set of
videos all about various API so you can
connect you word Nick New York Times
giffy all these are API is that I've
shot that in previous videos I've shown
you how to connect to from p5.js itself
but Twitter is a special sort of API
that requires something called
oh I think of that as like oh my god
effective Kate that's when I co-op I
think oh ah because it's like a pain and
I don't know I need this extra thing and
I can't do it in the client-side and I
got need a secret and it key and a token
and start to feel very stressed out I
want to lie down is it a cold compress
on my head all of this stuff it's uh I'm
feeling like flushed already just
thinking about it but ultimately an
answer to dealing with OAuth is writing
your own node application you you must
authenticate with your account
information you cannot do that from just
the browser directly the server can do
that however for you so if you wanted to
connect to Twitter from it's a camera
shot if you want to connect to Twitter
from lost my train of thought if you
want to connect to Twitter from p5.js
what you need is a server program that's
serving up your p5.js code and also
talking to twitter for you and there's
sort of communication thing that's going
on there so this is what I'm going to
get to all this eventually there's a lot
of steps involved but I'm trying to give
you the background of what you might
need note for other things you might
need a server for you want to save stuff
to a database on a server you know if
you want to like process a massive
amount of data and pass that back to
your p5.js sketch you might want to
write your own server if you want to
build your own API an example that I was
thinking about the other day is if you
wanted to make an expose like
information about yourself through an
API and you know you put all these
sensors on your body all day that are
like tracking all sorts of things then
on your own server you could expose that
you could write a server that spits out
all that information via JSON other
people could query it so there's lots of
things that creative of things you could
do with the server and I feel like this
is the new playlist creative servers
this is in working with node but in this
section the reason why I need note is
the Twitter API so that was a lot of
background there and sort of like
thinking about this picture let's come
back over here to where I am invisible
because this camera shut off by accident
and now what I would like to do is start
looking at how you actually use node
locally on your own laptop so the first
thing that you're going to need to do is
download an install node and I guess
I've already done that but I'm going to
just sort of Google node and I'm going
to grab the node website you can see
it's no js' org it's the website is
detecting that I'm on OS X so it's
offering me the OS X download but of
course if you're on Windows just about
everything I'm showing you here will be
the same but please if you're lost or
confused ask in the comments and maybe I
could ultimately make like a video that
just sort of covers looking at node on a
Windows machine if that would be helpful
to some of you so once you've downloaded
installed node another question opens up
like well what do you do how do you run
node how do you even make anything with
node so this involves using your
computer's command line so on a Mac
there is something called terminal and I
have it sort of already here like I'm
inside the terminal I can't I can't see
where I am
I think I'm touching my Am I am i
touching the terminal because
anyway uh this over here this is the
terminal unit guys don't need this like
weird physical thing that I'm doing and
if I run it you could see you I don't
need it that big everything's going
crazy the font size is like giant you
can see here is now this is like a
little window into the computer into the
computer's soul in a way so you need to
find terminal you know search for
anything your applications utilities run
terminal suddenly this is a place where
you can start issuing commands for the
computer to follow for example a command
that you might want to know about is PWD
PWD stands for print working directory
and you can see that's where I am I'm in
the user slash processing folder so you
can browse your computer's folder and
directory structure from this terminal
window this is you know this a lot of
this is at all you know these are
essentially Unix commands right and so
ultimately you're learning about how you
might operate a computer that doesn't
have a GUI interface and this is how
much computers used to work only and
anyway I'm a little off track here
so another command that might be really
useful is CD for change directory so I
happen to know that I want to change
into the Documents folder so I'm going
to do that and now I can say PWD to see
yes I'm in users processing documents
and then another thing you could do at
least on a Mac which is really nice as I
could take CD and then I say well
where's the folder I really want to be
well I really want to be in desktop
YouTube code which is where I'm gonna
put the code for this video I can
actually just drag that folder into the
terminal itself and it sort of
auto-populated
the path for that folder I can hit enter
and then you can see I'm in that
directory so why does any of this matter
the reason why this matters is unlike
other things that you might have done
before like processing or p5 or you're
writing code in a kind of GUI interface
hitting a Run button seeing a result
everything that you do through node is
all going to happen through this
terminal view so for example what
this only will work if you've installed
node but one of the first things you can
do with note is just type node now
notice the icon changed from a dollar
sign to a greater than symbol so now
that you have this greater than symbol
it means I'm in like JavaScript land I
could just start typing JavaScript code
like I could say var x equals 100 VAR y
equals x times 2 and then I could say oh
let me type X and look it's the value
100 let me type Y it's the value 200 so
one of the things you can do with node
is just start playing around with
experimenting with JavaScript it's kind
of like a real-time console where you
it's this is very similar to the browser
console if you've ever used that to sort
of debug and figure out what's going in
the browser so first of all no just lets
you run arbitrary JavaScript through the
command line now what if I want to get
out of this I need to type control C
control C the other thing node lets you
do is run small JavaScript programs
through the command line so for example
I'm going to use this editor sublime and
I'm going to make I'm going to save this
file and I'm going to go to that folder
YouTube code and I'm going to name it as
like node 1 I'm going to make a folder
and then I'm going to say hello dot J s
so I've now saved a file in that
directory called hello J s here by the
way is another command that you might
find useful LS you can see Oh lists I
have a directory called node 1 let's
change into that directory another type
LS again and I could see hello J s is
there now what if I were to put into
this program console dot log hello
YouTube I know I might upload this to
video hello arbitrary video website so I
wrote some code in this file how do i
execute that code node I want to run
something with node hello dot J s and
you could see hello and I spelled
arbitrary arbitrary I spelled it wrong
but you could see that that code has run
it's come out so little processes little
scripts little things that I might want
to make happen on my computer that just
I can program them in JavaScript and run
them through the command line number one
that's what note is for now if I if this
were the part of the videos that I
intend to ultimately make where all I'm
doing is looking at web servers then
ultimately I might show you that now how
to open a listening port how to accept
connections to that port how to send
things back to the browsers that are
connecting to that port all of those
things but instead of that what I want
to do is take another direction which is
just look at how can i from here from
the command line connect and
authenticate to the Twitter API and get
information from search Twitter look for
people who have replied to me on Twitter
and then also post tweets myself back to
Twitter how can I do all of that just
right here from the command line without
ever opening up a browser without ever
touching any other Twitter app because
if I can do that then I can make a
program that will run and say every five
minutes or 50 minutes or one hour post a
tweet automatically based on some other
type of algorithmic set of rules that I
might want to make so I think this wraps
up this first video if you're watching
it your download node get it installed
figure out how to get to the command
line of your computer figure out then
you can type know that you can enter
some JavaScript that you can run a short
little JavaScript program that just spit
something back out to the console and in
the next video what I'm going to look at
is how to like use something called npm
node package manager to spin up a sort
of a larger node project and use a
twitter package connect to the Twitter
API okay so thanks for watching and see
you see you in the next video that was
me making like a rainbow symbol this is
you know how like people have like a
sign out think that's never going to
work for me I know sorry I'm embarrassed
for myself too okay uh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
