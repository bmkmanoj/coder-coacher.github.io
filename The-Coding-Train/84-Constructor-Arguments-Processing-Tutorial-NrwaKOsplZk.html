look we have gone through a lot of
exciting trials and tribulations all
through the stage of having a gray
circle flowing up the screen now look at
you think what can you do
you won't actually do something much
more exciting for this but I will live
my life in this strange room with a
green screen an old circle the flips up
and down oh wow that's that's that's
that's the world line anyway um here's
the thing we want to have more than one
of these that's the point that's where
we're really we're going we're going to
go you know videos are now where you get
to this point like I'm recording right
where we get to this array now so when
we have thousands of bubbles on the
screen that's we're going to go but
right now we have a simpler goal in life
we just want to took any two bones so
how could we do that well we know one
way we could start to do that is by
saying bubble be one and bubble b-two
let's say v1 is a new bubble and v2 is a
new bubble and then all those functions
that we did for you one for the first
bubble let's do them for the second now
you probably can already imagine in your
head what's about to happen when I run
this - bubbles - bubbles do bubbles one
bubble it's now truly there are two
levels there there are two bubble
objects there are two ascending or -
displaying there - hitting the top but
they are the identical bubble so they're
on the same spot they're moving at the
same rate nothing will change we need a
way of introducing variety how can we
make two different bubbles if the code
for the bubble is the same for every
bubble objects how can it do something
different
well there are several different ways we
could approach this the first simplest
way is to say well we could we could do
something we could have them move
differently
randomly we could introduce random so
let's just go into here for a second
what if in the Ascend function in
addition to Y going up i said x equals x
plus a plus some random amount now let's
run this code again we can see there are
two bubbles there they're moving up
together they started in the same spot
but they're they have a little sort of
random motion along the x-axis so there
know how much they look like bubbles or
balloons or whatever I'm making but
actually a balloon simulation is kind of
an interesting thing to do I'm able do a
bit about that sometime okay anyway so
this is a good first step we could just
vary the way things happen we could have
some kind of get statement that based on
some interaction with the mouse or
something random this is step one but
what I want this video to be about which
I have to admit is probably one of those
sort of this is going to be a house part
1 hi this probably going to not go very
well
but we're going to make it and we've all
been going for like 4 minutes already so
employer to go for another 3 minutes and
that you're done we want the bubbles to
be to start differently we want to be
able to say make a blue bubble make a
big bubble make a small bubble we want
to do it this way we want to be able to
say make a bubble with the size of 64
make a bubble with the size of 16 let's
just start that off to start we want to
pass arguments into the constructor now
we know about passing arguments into a
function we pass arguments to to a
function and let's think about that for
a second let's we don't need to get this
let's just make up an arbitrary function
for a moment some function void
do-hickey float blah and here's the
function right if we say do-hickey 160
this value 160 goes in to the variable
blah and blah is a local variable that
can only be used in here so we might do
something like fill blonde we are using
we're initializing the variable blog the
argument and using it inside this
function we want to do something very
similar here we can see this is similar
to 80 160 we're saying bubble 64 so it's
got to be similar but what does the
constructor look like eraser is gone
it's gone oh it's over here I found it
ok
okay so what does the constructor look
like this is this is this is hard it's
not hard actually but it's it's weird
and it's awkward and lots of people
probably say profit Java prostates all
these programs are horrible InDesign
does this weird thing time to show you
okay this is what the constructor looks
like the name of the class mumble open
parentheses close parentheses open curly
brackets close curly bracket right now
it says things like x equals width
divided by 2 y equals height what if we
want a third variable to be initialized
with that third variable is called
diameter diameter equals something and
so here is what we need this is this is
where we're going with this so first
let's just put that variable into our
program we need another variable called
diameter diameter is going to equal
something which I'm going to say is 64
right now and then we're going to use
diameter in a couple different places
it's the size of the circle and it's
also telling us where to stop as the
bubble floats up to the top so you can
see now this is the sort of the way
we've done it before
X is initialized with divided by 2 y is
initialized with height diameter is
initialized with 64 but here we're
saying new bubble 64 we are saying fit
over here b1 equals new bubble 64 we
need this value to go here and somehow
get down here to get assigned to
diameter so in this case a constructor
with arguments the arguments of the
constructor become this sort of like
hand off layer that not this like we're
going to put something I'm gonna call it
float I'm gonna call it temp D what it
is it's just a variable temp T is like
sitting there and saying okay okay okay
I gave you the value V I got that out I
got the bag I thought I could go
diameter right it's only job is to take
this value 64 and then we're
a diameter equals 10t it hands it off
immediately to this variable because
this variable diameter is the one that
really matters it's the one up here it's
the diameter that's the thing that we're
actually using to set the ellipsis size
and where to stop it's quite important
that's the variable on a set now I
imagine one let's just put this in there
then we're going to come back to the
weird thing in your imagine that you can
make this so much better yeah I know you
could you could everyone good I'm not
good I can't I I'm stuck I only live
this is the life I live I just it's the
way it is okay so um where are we here
we're going to add float temp d-10 D an
R the value comes in to Tempe and temp T
is used to sign the diameter we're
giving 164 and 116 let's run it there we
go we can see we got a little bit a
little bit both a little bubble in a big
bubble okay and they're moving randomly
still but they have different sizes they
were assigned here say make a bubble
with 64 make a bubble is 16 so I don't
know if I should even mention this maybe
you should think I should just stop quit
while I add I don't think I've had well
I mean not so far behind them um but you
probably imagine why could you just put
diameter up here why could you say float
diameter and somehow that would be the
variable it just this is not what
arguments are the variable that is the
variable for the class is the thing
that's defined at the top arguments are
local variables only to this function
because we want to use diameter down in
display we can't make that intimate or
argument to bump to the bubble
constructor instead we got to make up
some temporary thing it's only local to
here it receives it passes off so if you
put float diameter in here then you're
making that aver only a local variable
to the constructor and you can't use it
and display anymore this is just the
mechanism we're offering the mechanism
or offered is we have arguments we can
give something to an argument we want to
fill this variable I know let's have the
argument receive the value and pass
along do that very well that's just the
way it is so this is just what
Pandora's box is open I don't know
that's not painful response maybe can't
worm so there weren't worms coming out
of the box of my shirt anyway the point
is now you could start to have this is
what the exercise you should do that has
cited with a box big open or something
let's really go crazy with this what if
you want to make a bubble that gets an X
a Y size a color right what let's try to
create bubbles with lots of different
parameters maybe four or five tops work
on this code see if you can make
different bubbles try making three
bubbles we're almost there actually I
think this wasn't so bad was it okay so
but this is something you should try I
don't know you know I'm just looking at
this and thinking about how that Brett
Victor post where you know you don't
know what Enys arguments mean but you
know we have to live with this I guess
it's what we're using right now I hope
you want to cut this video off a while
ago
that's your exercise so um there's a
bunch of just tons of other stuff with
object-oriented programming and there's
going to be a few more videos about how
to have objects talk to different
objects if you want to see what these
bubbles collide with each other or do a
video about that I want to do something
about using push matrix and pop matrix
in an object for transformations
something about just really rambling at
this point they're just waiting out loud
without waiting for the camera to cut me
off
I said other one there's those can be
really good objects communication Oh
objects as data to other objects right
an object has data in it but it doesn't
just need to have primitive very the you
know an object could have other objects
as part of its data there's a whole lot
more to be Georgie program there's
inheritance of parliament it goes on and
on this is just a little beginning I
can't
coming up yet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
