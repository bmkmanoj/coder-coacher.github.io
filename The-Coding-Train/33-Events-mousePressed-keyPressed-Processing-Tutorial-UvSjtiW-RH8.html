established so far in terms of the flow
of a program we know we have two new
blocks of code that we've established
one is called set up and what is called
draw we write write write rewrite code
inside both of these blocks between the
curly brackets and the code here in
setup happens once and only once first
at the beginning and the code here and
draw happens forever it loops over and
over again whatever gets to the end it
loops right back at the beginning stuff
happens here once looping over and over
again so this is a very basic simple
model for controlling the flow of a
program how it executes the instructions
in what order so in this video what I
want to do is introduce one more layer
on top of this this idea of an event now
truth be told a lot of programs don't
have this animation loop at all
everything is just a bunch of events
right this event triggers this event
which triggers this event then the
program waits until this event happens
that is certainly on a model for
building programs a lot of web
applications certainly work that way but
here we have an animation program that's
always running continuously but some
events might interrupt this loop so we
finished your draw and event execute we
go back into draw to obvious events that
we can start with that are very simple
to begin with are this idea of an
interaction event a mouse click or a key
pressed so for example let's just say we
want an event to be triggered when the
mouse is pressed we can now write
another block of code another function
definition this time it's called Mouse
pressed right it's set up we have draw
down we're adding mousepressed we put
our parentheses we put our open curly
bracket and our close curly bracket this
is an event this we can consider an
event and it also only happens once now
I don't mean once in the course of the
whole program but it executes
at the moment of the event setup truly
happens only once when the program first
begins Mass rest might never occur we
could write the most amazing
sophisticated beautiful code ever
written our entire life put it here and
if no one clicks the mouse it will never
have it so this is something we have to
realize this only happens when the mouse
is pressed so the syntax remains the
same as these blocks of codes that
different than these blocks of cup these
blocks of code but the difference is the
name of this method that we're
implementing this block of code is
called mousepressed
ok so let's go over and take a look at
implementing this in our actual program
here if you recall we have this
continuous line drawing application
where I'm just moving the mouse and it's
drawing a line from previous Mouse
position to current Mouse location so
what if I add this event mousepressed
now one thing we should notice again is
you've got to make sure you spell things
correctly if I wrote it as Mouse pressed
with a lowercase P this is incorrect
notice here that it doesn't turn blue
right it doesn't turn blue because it's
not a known word without that
capitalization does matter however if I
were to run this I get no error that's
because I just want to bring this up now
it's technically going we're going to
see later how you can make up all sorts
of other blocks of code that you want
right now we're trying to use specific
ones but so processing things I'm just
trying to make up a new one called mouse
press with lowercase P but it won't
function correctly we want to make sure
we have that capital P and we can see
once we have that capital P we've got
the nice blue color it's been recognized
so what's something I could put inside
mousepressed I don't know why don't we
erase the background we clear the
background clear the background set a
background of greyscale value 50 again
here I'm moving the mouse around every
time I click it it erases what was there
before so we can see here is boom and
event execute that code go back and to
draw boom an event execute that code go
back and you draw so this is really
powerful this is ugly we have so few
tools right now because we haven't
gotten to some of the really fundamental
keys
of defining our own variables and
conditionals to change the course of how
the information flows in a program we
just have these little pieces but you
can start to see that when you you could
it can have you can have different
things happen we could also do something
kind of kooky for example I could say
void key pressed just to add another
event and I could say background you
know this I said do something kooky and
I'm like yeah this is really crazy
totally crazy we're doing a different
color key press but what can you do um
so we could say here every time I click
the mouse it erases the background with
grey when I when I click the mouse it's
very hard for you to see that when I
when I press a key then it does a green
background so you can see how this these
are separate events a key pressed a
mouse press we're going to see later how
do you do something when a specific key
is pressed there's also a mouse released
event right when the mouse is pressed an
event is triggered when it's released
another event is triggered there's a
mouse drag event you can look through
the processing reference and you'll see
there are bunch of built-in events that
processing can handle for you by
implementing that block of code that
function definition and then writing the
code that you want to execute when that
event is triggered inside there okay so
this is a nice little short video
looking at my list of things I think
this kind of covered what I meant to
cover so now we really have control over
the whole flow of a program and what I
would suggest to you is in most of the I
gave you the exercise previously but try
to animate stuff with what you have so
far now you have some events to try to
have different things happen of what
happens what can you do with these
events if background is a draw not as
much of but true you can try different
configurations of this come up with
problems that you that you think you
could solve and in many of these you
might not be able to solve because
you're going to need the concepts we're
going to go over in the next set of
videos so in the next set of videos
right what just to remind you one of the
ways we introduced this idea of
variation into the draw loop was through
this idea of a keyword mouse X I called
it a built-in variable it stands for a
number the the X location of the actual
Mouse what we're going to look at
the next video is how do we make up our
own variables I mean if you think about
it we don't want to always just move
things according to the mouse we want
might want something to move
autonomously we need to store its
position and and manipulate that
position according to some mathematical
formula we're going to start to see how
to do that in the next set of videos
sure I missed something I'll think of it
I'll write it off my list and then later
I'll add a new video
that'll be numbered with these numbers
at the end it'll fill in some of these
details that's kind of my plan right now
because I already have something I want
to go back and add to them the earlier
videos okay goodbye
and I'll talk to you later I don't know
I get it better like like sign off you
know catchphrase but I'll think of that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
