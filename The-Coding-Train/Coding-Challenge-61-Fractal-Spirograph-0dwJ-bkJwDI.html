fractals fire draft day today here on
the coding train choo choo all that sort
of stuff
so what you're about to watch is really
awkward a little bit odd it's going to
have some awkward edits in it
I had several long stretches where I got
sort of stuck on a debugging problem if
you're interested in that longer
debugging process you can go and click
on there will be a link in this video's
description to the long a look like two
hour at this point live stream where I
did the challenge but what you'll see
here is that you have an end result that
closely matches this particular image on
this blog so the blog is beneath -
equation blogspot code at UK and the
creator of this blog is thank you to see
J Chen the creator I believe of this
blog proposing and describing some of
these images so this kota challenge is
going to start twice because I'm doing
this intro and then it's going to
actually happen we're all going to
introduce it again because I think that
I still need this intro and then at the
end it's actually going to end twice
because we have to finish and then
realize and come back and add a few bits
to make this more closely match the
images on this particular blog so I hope
you make something creative with this I
really hope this has some put something
out into the world that's useful because
boy did I spend a long time trying to
make this video with a lot of problems
and a please share it with me at
shipment on Twitter hashtags coding
trainwreck hello welcome to a coding
challenge in this coding challenge I am
going to attempt to make something that
is called a fractal spirograph perhaps
or fractal roulette or sort of like a
workable thing or a pattern thing so
this wasn't requested it's in my rainbow
topics a repository and I'm still trying
to figure out why it's sometimes called
the Denice equation and also how to
pronounce that so perhaps it's called
that because somebody who keeps the blog
maybe their name is beneath and I really
should just research this but I'm going
to rely closely each YouTube audience
here to correct me and building it in
the comments so you can see here that
there's this idea of nested
circles orbiting each other and then you
the smallest one and sort of like the
last nesting of the circle tracing out a
pattern you get this kind of nice
beautiful fractally thing and so you can
see here's a bunch of varieties of it I
really like this one maybe we can try to
do this one so I'm going to try to make
one of these and see if we can get it to
work and you will hopefully then adjust
the code think of your own ways of
making the pattern of using color your
own design and creativity I'm going to
do this in processing now processing if
you're not familiar with it and you know
I'll try not to say this in every video
I make but it is a Java based platform
with a robust drawing library and a
development environment so I'm going to
be able to just write code with Java
syntax call well I've dropped drawing
functions and see the results of my
programs in a quick sketching
prototyping way now another thing I want
to mention is this is quite similar and
let me come over to the whiteboard here
this is quite similar to a coding
challenge I did a while back called
solar system good yes thank you thank
you very much thank you did you hear
that
or am I just doing weird stuff people
started cheering in the hallway I'm not
sure why okay so in the solar system
coding challenge I created a system that
had a circle and each circle had some
number of other circles orbiting around
it and those had other circles or brigs
orbiting around it and I use to do this
functions like translate and rotate and
these function calls were nested so I
would from the center of one circle
translate out and then rotate by some
angle and then I would translate out
again and rotate by some angle so that I
could have nested circles orbiting each
other which is very similar to and so
the idea of this is like the Sun this is
the planet and this is the moon that
sort of thing this is quite similar to
what you're seeing in this orbital
fractal Figgy but I think what I want to
attempt to doing this challenge for no
other reason just to see a different way
of doing it is to actually use some
trigonometry math so if I know the
radius of this circle and I want to have
another circle right outside of it and I
no it's radiance then I can figure out
where this circle should be positioned
based on based on polar coordinates and
this is something that I've used again
and again and again in various coding
challenges where I say okay I have it I
have a two-dimensional space with an XY
coordinate and then I can also think of
that XY coordinate as a distance from
the center R and an angle so x equals
radius times cosine of that angle y
equals radius times sine of that angle
and this is a formula for converting
from a polar coordinate to a Cartesian
coordinate that I've used again and
again and I will once again link in this
video's description to a video that
covers this formula in more detail so
let's start trying to program this let's
start in a very basic way what do I need
I need a circle in the center so I'm
gonna make a global variable which might
not be necessary called R but make it
global just to just to see later how
we're going to use it and let's make
that radius 100 let's start with a
radius of 100 so I'm going to set a
background color of 51 because that's my
favorite background color and I am going
to then say no stroke no no I'm going to
say stroke of 255 no fill so I want to
have an outline of a circle with no
interior and then I'm going to use the
ellipse function which draws a circle at
300 300 with our times 2 as the whisk
and our times 2 as the height and if I
do this I have my 4 first circle so some
things that I might do just to make it
easier for you to see on the live stream
or whatever you're watching this is just
increase the stroke weight a little bit
so I have a little bit of a thicker
circle now I want to position a circle
right outside of it and maybe I want its
radius to be half the size so let's work
out the mass for this so what I need to
do is I also need an x and a y so that's
going to be the center of the first
circle and I think I'm going to need to
do this in the object-oriented way soon
enough
why I really didn't plan this out at all
so this is going to be an x and y so now
I want another circle I'm going to say
and let me not make these global
variables actually I'm just going to
sort of figure out a static version of
this just to get started then I'm going
to say R equals R times 0.5 so R divided
by 2 so I mean I was I'm going to say R
2 for the second circle I'm definitely
going to need to do some object-oriented
way of nesting these but I'm just bring
it this way for right now just to get
the basic idea
so now what I need to do is say X 2
equals x plus R plus R 2 and then I can
say ellipse x 2 y r 2 x 2 r 2 x 2 and
now we can see I have two circles so I
just wanted to see the basic idea there
of putting two next to each other why
does this work here's a circle at XY and
here is a circle at X 2 comma Y this is
r1 and this is r2 so you can see X 2 is
offset by X by r1 plus r2 now of course
things are going to change quite a bit
once I start this to rotate let's see if
we can just make just this rotate around
how do I do that
so really the the answer here is what I
really need is an x2 and a y2 and really
what are what I would I could distance
is oh boy these are terrible variable
names I'm going to clean this up in such
a nice way so soon we've really got to
get to it so let's say our our holy God
let's make this our 1 x1 y1 just for
this let's get the least make this make
some amount of sense for a second x2 y2
and what I want to do is I want to say
our sum equals r1 plus r2 and then x2
equals all
some time cosine of some angle and at Y
2 equals are some times sine of some
angle right what I want is to rotate
this around so I want to do this formula
but this R is actually the sum of R 1
and R 2 so now what I'm going to do is
do this and I'm going to say the angle
is zero so I'm going to start with an
angle of zero and now whoa that is way
off way off what mistake did I make okay
let's look at this R 2 is half of our
one our sum is R 1 plus X two is our up
so it's right but it needs to be offset
by the where original and so this is
just the offset from the center of our
one so X 2 really equals x 1 plus this X
Y 1 plus this there we go so now the
circles in the right place now let's
make this angle a global variable and
let's say angle plus equals zero point
one and we can see there we go so we now
have the circle rotating around so this
is the core mechanic I used I could have
done this in a much simpler if it's
simpler the right word but with less
code and less math I could have just
used translate and rotate and achieve
the same effect see my other video about
how to do that but one of the reasons
why I wanted to do it this way is I have
full control like I can now draw a path
so I'm going to just add something to
this I'm going to say array list P
vector path so what am i doing here I'm
using a data structure that the Java
data structure called an ArrayList it's
like a flexibly sized array and I'm
going to fill it with P vector objects P
vector objects are two dimensional or
three dimensional vectors an X to the Y
and our x y&amp;amp;z so what I want to do in
setup then is I'm going to say path
equals new ArrayList filled with P
vectors and then what I want to do is
every time I rotate this I want to say
pass ad and
oopy vector at x2 y2 so as this thing is
going I'm going to soar all the points
to keep track of a path and then at the
end here I can say for every single
position in the past so this is a nice
Java enhanced for each loop for every P
vector pause in path I want to say set
of vertex at pause X and cos dot Y and
I'm going to say begin shape and n shape
to make this one continuous path and now
we can see that so what we can see that
it's tracing its past so we've got the
core idea down from the beneath equation
that's orbital fractal which is that we
need to have some way of positioning a
circle outside of another circle
rotating and then keep track of the
points of its path and draw something
okay so we're good now we've got a
serious problem here this is not
sustainable right I could maybe do some
kind of like weird for loop here and
kind of just keep building on the
previous one that's a problem so what I
want to do is it's really going to work
well we're going to give it a try what I
might have some angle issues but what
I'm going to do is I what I need is to
make this into an object so let's take a
look at what I mean by that so I need an
object to keep track of what I need an
object to keep track of a circle that
has so each circle let's call it in well
I get yeah let's call it in orbit I
don't know I don't know what it should
be called I'll call the circle so I'm
confused it needs to have an X the Y and
an R and then it would have like a child
so we can think of these as parent-child
relationships
this is the parents of this circle and
if this one has one going around it this
is the child of this one if this one has
a little and so as this one so that's
what we can think of now it also
probably needs it needs to know it try
needs to know a reference to its parent
so that it can pull its parents radius
and then it also needs to have some type
of orbits speed so I think I could call
each of these in orbit and orbit has its
current XY it has its own radius and it
might have a child it might have a
parent right the first one has no parent
the last one is no child so I think this
is a structure of each object that we
can build I think this is going to work
I'm sure you guys can think of a better
way to do this okay so I'm going to make
a new tab here in processing and I'm
going to name that tab orbit and I'm
going to write a class to create orbit
and I'm going to say each orbit has one
now I could use a P vector to describe
its position but I'm going to be a
little bit I'm just going to use an X
and a wire so it needs an x and a y it
needs a radius that's its own radius and
it needs what it needs a parent its
parent is another instance of an orbit
and it maybe has a child you know I
could call it like parents its son and
it's shot the child its moon but let's
just use I think parent and child will
be easier for me to remember and then
what else did I say orbit speed okay so
it needs I'm just going to call it speed
oh and guess what it also needs an angle
right easy keep track of that angle so
angle and angular velocity is really
what we've got here okay
so all of these things are all the
properties this object needs so when I
make an orbit I can maybe get now this
is like a kind of annoying convention
that I follow but the arguments to a
constructor in Java are variables that
are kind of like 10
I mean these are arguments to the
constructor by me using just as
temporary variables to fill the to fill
the the actual instance variables of the
object itself so I kind of just name
them with an underscore to mark them as
different but I realize this often looks
kind of cryptic or confusing but let's
do this and then if I'm making one I
could assign I would assign myself as a
parent so parent equals P so let's think
about how something like this might work
like I'm going to make an orbit it's
going to have an x and a y it's going to
have an R radius and it's going to have
a parent orbit thing so I'm going to
comment all this out because we might
need it again later
but what's interesting about this is I
don't actually need an array of all the
orbit objects I could make one but each
orbit object is simply going to keep
track of the next one so the iterates
RISM I can just go to one which points
to the next which points the next and
this is actually somewhat by accident a
data structure called a linked list so
we're kind of programming a bit of a
linked list here because each orbit is
linked in like a list format so I'm
going to say orbit I call it root like
it's the core but I'm gonna call it Sun
I'm gonna call it Sun and I would say
Sun is a new orbit and it is it has a x
and a y which is the middle it has a
radius which is 100 and what else did I
say it needs it needs a parent and this
one has no parent so I'm going to say no
now I could do some really interesting
technique in Java I could actually
overload the constructor and actually
let's do this just so you see this you
can actually write for an object
multiple constructors in JavaScript you
would just have one you would Tet you
would query the amount of arguments but
I'm going to do it this way I'm going to
write another constructor that does not
have the fourth option and I'm going to
say this which means call
be call a different constructor with X Y
R and null so meaning if you ever
created orbit without the fourth
argument it just does the other
constructor and sends it null is not
really a major point of me doing this
but I don't want to have a parent for
the original one so now one thing I
definitely want is I want some sort of
display function which these days I'm
calling show and what I want to do in
the show function is a stroke 2:55
stroke wait
- and then ellipse at the x and y with r
times 2r times 2 so now if i here is in
Drye just say son show if I run this
again we should see there it is now how
come I guess I forgot no Phil son - oh
there is okay I don't know how long have
you been watching this video and all
I've got is a circle on the screen and
very very sorry but if I'm hoping this
will get more interesting soon okay so
now what we need to do is we probably
want to say how do we add a child maybe
what we should do is say son let's just
write a function to it son da add child
I'm just going to write a function
called son add child
I mean I'm gonna write a function called
add a child so I need to write add child
what does add child do okay so first of
all it has a child so I'm going to set
child explicitly to null here I'm gonna
set angle to zero and angle speed to
zero point one just to give those some
values so adding a child is I don't want
it to be not anymore
I want a child equals new orbit now I
need to give it an x and a y a radius
and a parent okay so the X and the y so
first of all I should say a new radius
equals R times point zero five so this
is divided by half either
probably some appropriate ratios I'm
supposed to use but I'll just try
dividing it by hat by two so I want the
new orbit now I need to get those X&amp;amp;Y
points so a new X should equal X plus R
plus nu new radius right because I just
want to offset it by its own X plus its
own radius plus the new radius and new y
will just be the same so I want to
create a new orbit at X nu X new Y and I
want a new X new Y with new arm I'm just
going to call it new are just to for a
little bit more shorthand and then its
parent is this so I'm having the
function itself I'm having the object
itself create its own child and it's
going to pass a reference to itself to
the child so there's a child that keeps
track of the parent good okay so now
let's see what's happening here so now
what if I say what if I say orbits
current equals Sun Y maps or text up so
what I want to do is I want to write a
loop I want to say show all the orbits
so start with the Sun draw it look at
the suns child draw it well take the
son's child child draw it and when
eventually one of the children has no
child than stop so as long as current is
not equal to no say current show and
then I'm going to say current equals Sun
dot child so this is now an algorithm I
have look at this for saying look at the
curt start with one
this is iterating through all of them
it's kind of like I probably should do
something like you know write a function
that returns it called next or something
but just for simplicity I'm just going
to say the current equals its child so
start with current equal to Sun it's not
at all so show it then get the
child is it no it's not then show it
they get the child and this should say
not
sundial current da child right because
I'm really in a way maybe I'll call this
next while next does not know go to the
next child something like that doesn't
that really cool occurrence or next or
whatever the point is it's a variable
that's iterating through all the things
so let's see what we get now awesome
we've got the son and a child now what
if I have this actually also return the
child so in addition to creating it and
assigning it it returns a reference to
it
because then what I could do is I could
say a Orbitz child equals son done add
child this now this is terrible but I
could then say orbit child 2 equals
child 1 dot add child something like
that right so this is this idea of like
I could have the son create a child and
then the child of the Sun create a child
etc so I probably want to write a loop
there but you can see now I've got a
bunch of them this was pretty good this
is looking pretty good
ok so why don't we do this why don't we
write up why don't we do this a certain
number of times three times and I think
we can employ the same sort of idea
where we can say and this needs to be an
integer where we can say a orbit next
equals son so next equals next dot add
child right so this is a little loop to
start with one and then add a child get
its reference back do it again do it
again do it again so this should give me
oh wait can I start with the son then
they added three children please do
sales like why do I have four I have
four because I did it three times but I
started with one and we could even see
here you know this should probably be a
parameter but if I made them much
smaller like point two
well that's a bad idea let's just leave
it at point five so this is good so you
can obviously places okay
now interestingly enough I just want to
show you something really quickly what
if I just change this to a - look what I
got there so that's interesting to see a
little quick variation right stead of
offsetting it out by the sum of the
radii what if I offset it out by one
radius minus the other that's going to
give you a certain inside so that's
something that you might little
variation that you might play with okay
now what happens if we want these things
to rotate it's just just going to work
what if I write in the orbit okay
so I need to write a update function
update function so first what did i do
back here I kind of figured out this
algorithm here let's grab this algorithm
so our sum in this case is now the sum
of my own radius plus my parents radius
then my the X should update to be the
parents X plus the sum times cosine of
the angle right and the Y so this is
updating should be the parents y plus
the sum times the sine of the angle so
this is me updating its position every
frame right I want to look at the I want
to offset my location based on the
parents X y plus a whatever my rotation
is and the sum of the two radii
so that should update everything and
then in addition to that I want to say
angle plus equals angle speed or what
did I call that just speed so I always
want to increment the angle I was
feeling there's a mistake here so that
should update so let me just run this no
syntax errors I think I'm missing some
pieces but let's throw caution to the
wind and as we iterate through them all
let's also update them okay what's wrong
you're up okay I
a nullpointerexception why because I
don't want to update it if it has no
parents so I'm trying to well yes the
parent never moves never spins so it's
really only for the son so I'm trying it
you know where I put the you know one
thing I could do and there's a bunch of
ways I could solve this but probably a
good way to do this is just to say if
parents is not equal no I just do this
right now just to make sure it's not a
null parent then I'm going to actually
do this okay interesting now what why is
it doing that
I have a feeling it's doing that because
they're all spinning at the same exact
speed let's see if I let's see if I can
create another I'm going to create
another argument here float F for speed
and I'm going to say speed equals F and
actually before I even do that
let's just give them a random speed
let's just try a random speed between
the Z between 0.01 and point 1 and
forget about this for a second so let's
give them a random speed hmm
look this is to the side twice so I need
to get rid of this and like leave these
random speeds let's run this again and
see so you can see now we're seeing some
like slightly different offsets from
each other now there's probably an exact
science to this and they all also
there's a bit of an issue where they're
all have the same they off the same
angle rotation I am looking at the
YouTube chat right now speed reset 2.1
so i think i want to look at the
original the original version of this
again let's pull that up and let's see
if we can kind of uncover what the
relationship is between so first of all
are they this one is moving so they're
moving in opposite that one's moving
this this one's moving counterclockwise
and the other one is moving clockwise so
this would be something to do
so let's actually think about that so I
have a kind of idea let's just actually
leave them with the same so first of all
let me add another let's minimize this
let me add another argument here and
what I'm going to do is just give the
first one point one so I'm going to oh
there's so many different ways I could
do this but let's let's try to be a
little somewhat consistent about it
let's add a fourth argument for speed
right here okay so let's make sure that
works and then speed equals s now they
should all have exactly whoops and here
I should pass in Oh speed so now they
all have the same exact speed and that's
a little bit fast but I think it'll be
easier to sort of figure this out if we
watch it a little bit more slowly so
let's let's start with just kind of like
zero point four oaks zero point oh four
or something okay that's a little bit
easier to look at okay now let's just
try a simple idea of when I make the
child the child should have the negative
speed of the parent same speed but
opposite direction now this looks more
like something the question is is this
exactly the path that is and you can see
this is this exactly the path yeah speed
is actually angular velocity someone in
the YouTube chat rightz which is a good
point it's seaman I'm also getting it
seems that speed is I minus 2 times the
parent speed so maybe it actually is
faster but but in the opposite direction
so let's try that you have this look so
but I've started with it too fast so
let's try it as much slower yeah this
looks good
so I feel like this looks much more like
what the original program has so now
that the original one also have a total
of four circles let's see let's look
back at that original example and I
can't see zero one it also looks like
these they're shrinking more by like a
third
I can't exact
tell you know exactly but it looks like
there's four it looks like maybe they're
shrinking by a third so let's let's
divide it by three and C so this looks
much more like what happened there and I
think we could also start the original
one at 200 I guess that's a little bit
off the window so let's try 150 there we
go so now I think we've gotten kind of
exactly what's in that thing
let's try creasing the past okay so all
we need to do is we need to we need to
to have a reference to the last one so
what's the best way for us to reference
one when this is done next is no
unfortunately so I think I think what
I'll do is just for simplicity is I'll
just keep track of a global variable
called end and at the end end equals
next so the very last child is the end
and then I can actually just go back and
add this back this passed up exactly
back in and I can say NX and n dot Y so
this should now be that path and let's
make the path I don't know pink or
something or purple let's make it just
so we can see it and let's let's also
make the orbits let's make them maybe a
little bit lighter because in the little
alpha and let's do we get well that's
certainly something let me make this
stroke weight a little bit more visible
here and we can now see how it's tracing
that path it's kind of nice does it look
like that fractal pattern at all I'm
seeing in the chat that I'm being
suggested to multiply it by negative
three so maybe I just had that off
negative three let's try that there we
go so this looks more like that pattern
and second circle has five
speed and last has twenty times four so
I think the how those speeds are
changing is actually it's you know we
can see what kind of patterns that's
times four I think they're actually
almost exponentially increasing okay
there was an awkward edit there but
there was a bunch of debugging needs
that happen that I was trying to get
this right by just eyeballing it and
actually a chat nicely pointed out to me
that the formula is just in the comment
lower down in the page so I'm going to
go back down here and look at the
formula which is right here and it says
okay so speed of speed is equal to K a
constant to the N minus 1 power and n
being the level so the first circle is
zero the next one is 1 so n must be the
level and then also something that is
important here is I also need to use 10
or 11 circles where I am in my code I
actually only have 3/4 because the first
one is zero so what I want to do is go
and look how am I getting the speed so
I'm multiplying the speed by negative 2
I think I've tried a bunch of different
things so maybe where I last left off it
might have been four we can see multiply
increasing the speed gives me kind of
more interesting patterns but really
what I want is not what I want to do is
rather than have the speed be this thing
that changes I want each orbit to keep
track of its level so ultimately what I
want to do is just send in the number 0
the Sun is zero so I'm going to add a
variable called n to keep track of its
level and instead of s I'm going to pass
in N and I'm going to set an equal to
that level then speed is going to be
something that I calculate based on the
formula so if I go back and look at the
formula it is K now I don't fully
understand this but K I believe is
usually a
so I think maybe I could just sort of
like pick one of these so I am going to
arbitrarily pick K of two and then I'm
going to say speed equals power K to the
N minus one is that is that correct
k to the N minus one yes and then when I
create the next orbit I just send in n
plus one so the next one is the next
level the next one is the next level
let's just take a look at this really
briefly and why is this giving me oh
this should be an integer I'm using
integers for the level and same thing
here this really matters that much so
now whoa something is way off okay
here's an issue these values are very
large and that's light so one thing I
could do is just that maybe think of
them as angles and convert them to
radians and now we've got something that
Mormon now there's a couple problems
with this first of all I'm getting a
pretty interesting shape even just from
this one thing that I need to do is I
need them to alternate their direction
so the nice thing about setting
something to the power of an integer
is that if it's a negative number to the
power of 2 squares it'll be positive 2
power 3 negative 2 power 4 positive so I
could actually just say K equals
negative 2 and now they're going to go
in opposite directions and you see this
kind of looks remarkably like what I
started with but let's try having this K
to be something larger and we can start
to see now that this resembles much more
closely to the pattern that we saw in
this original this original image now
I'm not getting so much detail here and
I think the way that I'm going to get
more detail is by actually having many
many more levels there's only three
let's add 10 and now we can see now I'm
still my incrementation steps are kind
of large from that conversion to radians
so there's probably a way for me to have
the time
be smaller so I can get more detail out
of here because you know this would be
interesting to try adding a hundred of
these and it can't even I don't know it
maybe it let's just try adding 20 but my
incrementation steps are so large that
I'm not getting that level of detail so
we we've got something that kind of that
kind of resembles it I suppose if I
wanted to really trace it out I could
have the incrementation step be much
smaller maybe I could just divide by a
thousand but add like a hundred it's
going so so slow so I'm have to speed
this up in time-lapse it I'm going to
leave that to you as a challenge so the
challenge that you should do and maybe
I'll come back and revisit this in a
future challenge let me get this back to
a state where we get something is to
take this basic idea and more closely
match the level of detail in these
images and also think about how can you
adjust where how the circles are
positioned relative to each other to
change to get these different kinds of
patterns and I would read through this
entire page and and see look at some of
these kind of amazing crazy pattern and
see what you can get see how you can
color it see what you can do and these
are loving the story I just want to
let's try one more thing let's at least
try the thing where we nest the circles
inside of themselves rather than outside
whoops that didn't work
some where's my son that's what I'm
looking for here yes so let me say -
here with the sum and now we can see
this particular pattern that's very
similar but now sort of more inside of
this particular circle okay so thank you
for watching this coding challenge I
have no idea if this was interesting or
useful at all I feel like there were
some nuggets at the beginning if you've
made it to the end of this hashtag
trainwreck coding trainwreck I think is
the new appropriate hashtag for this
channel you can tweet me at Schiffman
hashtag coding trainwreck with
your nan train racks beautiful
visualizations that you've made from
this beneath the night Vineet a I don't
know how to pronounce it somebody will
tell me I'm sure in the comment equation
orbital fractal thank you for watching
okay I'm back for likes of ten thousands
bags for a quick addendum this train
wreck is not finished of some night I
got some wonderful nice comments in the
chat and I would like to improve I think
it's worth taking an extra bit of your
time to improve my particular drawings
to match more closely what's going on
here so first of all the first thing and
I'm sure everybody who won't bother and
a lot of you I know which is that I
didn't actually line everything up with
the top and you'll notice that if we
look at mine it lines up perfectly to
the right that's the zero angle so I
just want to go rotate negative pi
divided by 2 and negative 90 degrees so
first thing I can do is just very
quickly fix the angle to be negative pi
divided by two and in this case now we
at least have the pattern pointing up
now one of the reasons why we don't have
the same level of detail that's here is
that I might incrementation amounts is
quite large so as it moves the rotation
is happening fast that I want to see
this play out in real time but if you'll
notice this has a kind of like stutter
it means that it's a gift so there's
probably some issues with how it's done
but this is it guys this is actually
probably each time it moves it's kind of
drawn a whole lot of point so I can
emulate that so I'm going to make a
global variable which I'm going to call
a I'm going to call resolution and I'm
going to set that resolution right now
to one hut two one so what I want to do
is here what I want to do is look at the
speed and I want to divide the speed by
resolution meaning I how many how many
incremental steps are going to take in
between each each angular change of that
angular velocity so maybe I just want
each time step is like a full unit of
one so I want to divide by resolution
there and then what I need to
here is each crate each cycle through
draw I want to do this st. updating the
past an amount of time that resolution
amount of time so I'm going to write a
for loop here to do this an amount of
time so there's a little bit of an issue
here where I'm drawing this so I'm going
to be drawing the circle multiple time
but I want to get all those incremental
path points and amount of times that
resolution amount of time so it
shouldn't use ends up being used
somewhere else now if I run this this is
exactly what I had before
now I could if I wanted take this out I
kind of did this all at once because I
practiced this a minute ago house
debugging up so but even if I just
change that resolution now to something
like 10 what you're going to get is
you're going to see this giving us a
finer level of detail but it's going to
be running more slowly because the whole
animation is doing kind of ten steps so
one way I can kind of clean that up is I
can do ten steps each cycle through draw
to keep that same speed the one thing
you'll notice if those circles look much
brighter because they've been layered on
top of each other a bunch of time I mean
one thing I could actually do is just
not bother to draw the circle and we
could just see the path and there it is
and I probably should also you know stop
it from redrawing when it gets around
the full rotation so you can see it's
kind of drawing over itself but you can
see this has much more like the quality
of what's in the original image and you
know just to sort of see you know if I
make the resolution 100 does this really
give us anything better I'm not sure but
you can kind of see now I've got even
more level of detail so the number of
levels of cerca method circles and that
resolution you know it would be I think
a great thing to try making this very
high retinal blowing this up and making
this a large pixel area and trying to
really see how details can you make that
and make it kind of like a high
resolution image version of this okay so
thank you for watching this coding
challenge I think there's a lot of
exciting creative possibilities that you
could build off of it if you were able
to follow this I will post but in the
github repository I will put
both a processing version of this and a
p5.js version of this that you can run
in the browser and look forward to
seeing what you make thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
