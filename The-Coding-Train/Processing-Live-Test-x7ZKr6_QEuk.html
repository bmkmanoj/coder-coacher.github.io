turn that off yeah listen I got here
hello
okay can you hear me yes hold on let me
fix this camera can you hear me I can
yes that's very exciting this totally
works and can you see what I'm doing
here I wiped on the whiteboard
yes hello Internet
now I'm getting a loop you're waiting
you're getting a loop oh the stream is
behind but that doesn't matter okay I'm
looking for a pen marker um I guess
actually maybe no that's a terrible idea
oh it's true okay wait I lost my marker
oh there they are they okay everything's
gonna be okay now did you witness the
loop that I heard no I
there was no loop that I could notice
all those times were you answered
whether or not you can hear me you
didn't hear those no because I only said
that once are you or do you have the
stream open in addition to the Hangout
or only the Hangout oh but I don't know
if there's anybody watching I can tell
by the I think that's Shawn that it is
actually a processing juggling show
these are very hard to juggle these uh
they don't flip and they don't like
softly land in your hand you can also
probably balance one on my nose
they can't never money good though okay
uh are you where are you are you just in
the hallway yeah I'm missing I think I
getting a little meeting you want me to
go see my quieter well I think I can
hear your speaker's no not your son I
feel like my speakers are going into
your microphone maybe not
I thought I heard a little feedback I
just want to make sure it's not a
proximity thing I don't know I don't uh
yeah I don't know how I could be giving
you know you're probably right
okay so I what I want to do here is I
can see if there's anybody um all right
so I don't know I don't see any way on
the YouTube thing to tell how many
people are watching or if there's any
way to there's no chat there's a leave a
comment the YouTube thing is behind so
it's confusing for me to look at that in
a way it is bind Twitter okay okay if
you're watching I posted a question
about processing on Twitter no way I see
no there is somebody left to come in ask
a question is this visible that would be
that what do you think the other thing
is oh I don't know how you can't there's
no I have to invite you to the Hangout
but this works I could just actually do
a half record a list of videos to make
just make one of them it's kind of funny
and would be live but there's no you
know I need I need a like a wall of
screens with faces or something yeah
let's see I don't doubt there's anybody
we watching this all right so maybe we
should maybe we need to find somebody on
the ITP floor who wants to like join in
and ask that is like working on
something you could ask a question to
try no I'm gonna go look around all okay
yeah sure okay in the meantime I will
recite lyrics from make miserable but
now I can't pronounce or wish I had like
interesting strange tricks I could do
but juggling is about it I don't have
anything good to juggle let's see here
so we leave the comments tell me to
leave a comment people are watching
nobody working on any processing stuff
are you guys were any manner or form
what's that bang our yes yes do you want
to ask Dan Schiffman any questions he's
doing live office hours we're trying
things out yeah yeah it is a Google
hangout yeah um so how do we get them
into the Hangout I would have to know so
what I need is the coop I can invite you
to hang out you need to know their their
Google ID yeah that's correct
oh hello wait we're in the conference
room oh okay let's hang out see what I
really need is what I need is a monitor
right here that has the Hangout on it so
I could look at it and talk to it is
right now what I'm doing is I see the
Hangout over here anyway so I'm going to
pretend I'm just I can make me only hear
you I only have audio at the moment so
you can ask your question it has to be
audio your name is Mikey here yeah what
is it
yeah so I'm just launch process I guess
whatever here what what else is a
problem then what is that when you type
and you're on a hangout in a huge your
audio seriously yeah
Reaper oh you able to hear us right now
I can hear it yet okay then get here are
you able to see our screen uh if you do
screen sharing and I walk over here I do
have the Hangout open
so we can do this and he could see the
processing sketch easing so now you can
see our processing sketch yeah right Dan
you can see it yes again you scroll on
oh just screen should I see so it's
whatever would so if you wanted to ask
him any processing questions like this
he could help out yeah so so so in your
experience or if you had some like if
you run it's difficult he's either going
to be enough this would be enough for do
you think he would need to be drivin
from the sketch that would be good here
it's he can like if he could yeah damn
show them what you can do here like what
well here's the thing is is I was
imagining that maybe I might if I'm
gonna do one of these had people submit
stuff in advance from Dropbox so I would
have sketch folders just ready to go
over here do I can like standing I'm
really nice oh we could look that so you
could um I mean I you know baby you
don't actually have anything but you
could give your like email something to
me or stick it in share a drop box with
forget which account this is ah you can
share to count okay so that shipment net
if you share anything via Dropbox to
videos and shipment not net ah then I
can get it instantly over here so oh
yeah oh yeah I did I did it's a button
share via Dropbox this is great videos
how long do they let you do to these
hangouts on here you go forever forever
forever and ever I get a little chamber
pot put over here and then I well
actually we'll get what you are feeding
tube in a catheter
very awkward okay so this is how you can
share your anybody watching all maybe
one of you watching you could tweet a
question or share processing sketches to
your videos that shipment see let's see
what Oh
let's see what's happening on Twitter I
Richard Gill says I don't have a
question but I am watching hello how
often
let's see this is what I see is very
meta it's strange that when you have the
screen sharing up it's a little
disconcerting so it feels like nothing
always there there we go
there's me um I don't want to find a
drop off how do I find your drop off and
there so videos not cheap so I have to
go towards a box we're going to go up
there any our tweets Dan let's see uh oh
yes good question
I shall of annamarie from Wichita Kansas
writes in and says is that even a place
I don't know oh yeah
can you see me out oh it says how
awesome will you do this okay so this is
just a test we don't think we're
completely disorganized I don't really
know what we're doing but the my plan is
starting in the fall starting in
September we will do this at a specific
time once per week or at least every
other week and that there will be a time
I wish you can submit questions so they
got an email box or something where you
could submit questions in advance and
then I will pick a few and we'll do like
an hour an hour kind of thing where you
know do like 4 questions 15 minutes each
or something you'll be officers will be
music and dancing except without the
music and dancing
man 3 okay somebody else writes in ah
okay look oh my goodness this is a very
hard question okay I got a question
is there a processing library for
quadtree collision detection um not that
I know
um so you know if you use so you might
be wondering not the person who asked
the question probably because they
presumably know what quadtree collision
detection is I don't really but I have a
big idea my fine but essentially we have
this problem when you're working on a
sketch that has lots of things in it
let's say you have this sketch and it
has lots of objects in it let's say each
object has to check if it's colliding
with another object and if you just have
two of them each object you know object
a has to check well hey that's a bad
example let's say let's say you have
three you have a B and C object a has to
check against a B and C object B has to
check against a B and C and object C us
to check against a B and C okay
so if you have three things this is one
two three four five six seven eight nine
three times three is nine
this is an N squared algorithm meaning
the number of elements that you have to
do collision detection you need to do
that number squared so if you have three
you've got to do not so let's look at it
this way by the way if you have zero
motion if you have ten you have to do
100 if you have 100 you have to do ten
thousand if you have one thousand you
have to do do 1 million one tell yet
text thank you for pretending to laugh
the one person who isn't watching this
is a great watching ok so um there's no
question here watching three excellent
and possibly a four and five ok so if
you notice we just went up by a factor
of 10
but respect the work we're going up by a
factor of a hunt of 100 so we're getting
these math lesson this becomes
incredibly incredibly slow this is the
problem I forgot we're done once you
have a lot of things on the screen
to check if they're colliding it goes
incredibly slow so there are all sorts
of fancy ways of figuring out how you
could say like oh we could divide the
screen into cells and we could maybe
have just these objects checking this
their cell that's called bin lattice
spatial subdivision and in fact if you
are looking for an example of that look
no farther than chapter six I believe so
this in the nature of code which is
nature of code calm in Chapter six
I think in 615 I kind of goat I kind of
go through and describe at least how to
do sorry lost where this was oh here it
is
didn't let so I kind of walk through
this example of how to do a in last
spatial subdivision in the context of a
flocking example and I think that I have
do I have on this machine it would be
sad if I didn't I do all the nature of
code examples I will just demonstrate
this for you very briefly by the way we
haven't talked to anything about
quadtree but it kind of on the way there
maybe I'll you know I'm kind of avoiding
it sounds like a very complicated topic
that I will possibly understand so much
in that it's like it okay so I go to
chapter six and the example I'm looking
forward to bin lattice facial
subdivision let me just run this example
in processing very briefly so here is a
sketch now I on Google hangout you
probably can't really notice that the
animation is very slow but you can see
this over here
frame rate twelve twelve frames per
second this is two thousand objects each
determining if there tuck touching
another object they turn white if I not
the turn grain only running at 12 frames
per second very very slow that's with no
bin lattice spatial subdivision with bin
lattice spatial shuvit subdivision which
permit I can't say we can see now that
we're getting a nice frame rate of like
45 frames per second exactly the same
crew but it's much faster so um what was
I saying so you know I didn't actually
go through the details of how bin
lattice space
subdivision works because no idea what
I'm doing some weird live Google hangout
a brand like thing but um but it's
essentially an algorithm that just
allows you to subdivide your window into
different cells all of equal width in
height so there are fancier things like
quadtree which allow you to be more what
you know what if suddenly all of the in
a foggy simulation all for Boyd's are
suddenly in the bottom right hand corner
of the window you're going to have to do
something more sophisticated to be able
to get any type of optimal collision
detection but the question was asked is
there a library for quadtree something
around collision detection and there is
it but I'm pretty sure that box2d which
you can use in processing employs if not
quadtree something similar to optimize
its collision detection it's certainly
not doing those I would all of these I'm
almost certain that it's not doing the
kind of world would force collision
detection thing okay is that raw brute
force way that you described in the
beginning the N squared one yes that
actually the brute force way or would
you say is a matrix and beam see oh I
get a gonna run firmly we get into well
I think we have some more maybe some
more questions that are being asked on
Twitter oh no just somebody retweeted
that this was happening
yes yeah hey Dan I actually have to hop
off ok ok ok bye bye guys I'm gonna hang
out here for a little bit longer if
anybody wants asking but how do we yeah
so can you send can you tweet that
Daniel your Google yeah I guess you'd
have to direct message me if you don't
want it to be public I need to join
hangout check where Twitter just DMM
Google I you can also just email to me
or email him your group is Google email
and then he'll invite you to the hangout
yes I'm email me hello
good how are you didn't read that let's
see here what somebody chatter likes you
heard somebody at the door
uh okay let's see I think I getting a
message mean another little podium here
no no messages ah oh somebody send a
sketch okay
uh oh no I need it wasn't it was emailed
to me so I got an email actually which
with a sketch here but it wasn't sent
via Dropbox so I have to let me see if I
can get it up let me see if I can pull
it over I really don't want to login up
the camera cut out hold on everybody
hello okay so somebody sent me an email
I'm going to have to share it via
Dropbox myself because I I don't want to
log into my email on a live three but
people send me lots of very private and
touching beautiful messages that I know
they wouldn't want them seen online okay
um ship share Dropbox started going have
this in the moment
I don't know how what do you want people
to like in the radio there's not ever
supposed to have silence is this car
like a radio Dropbox chair share this
folder with videos at shift move on it
okay so this is coming in from this is
coming in from from Joel Matthew I don't
think I'm not supposed to say people's
names
oh it's going okay let's see if I can
get this sketch now that was sent to me
Dropbox you're not invited to share
except
hit accept right let's go the Dropbox
folder there it is here it is okay so
let's look at this so we've got a nice
little sketch here I think the files are
still coming in still downloading so
we'll wait so let's look at the question
I test a ball the question says
everything I test a ball for collision
the detects collisions 95% of the time
but occasionally the ball falls right
through so I'm not sure if it's a it's
really slow it's not in yet I'm not sure
if this is a ball vs. ball collision or
a ball vs. wall collision but I wonder
well we're gonna look at the sketch in a
second but if you have a sketch where
you have this ball and you're testing
right if this is like a bottom of the
screen height maybe you have an if
statement where you say if Y is greater
than height maybe you're testing if the
ball goes past this part then you're
going to do something like hey maybe
there's a variable called Y speed which
is telling us how the ball is moving
down and you're saying Y speed equals y
speed times negative one this we're
going to see if the if the code is
actually related to this question but
this is potentially a problem why is
this a problem no we don't really know
different things could be happening and
you know you keep seems like an exact
science but we could have a situation
where the ball goes past the height it
turns around but it doesn't actually
make it all the way back it turns around
it just goes to here and then what's
that problem it's still below height so
this would still be true and it would
tell it to go back down so you can often
get these scenarios where something is
stuck below the surface now there's
nobody you know there's no funny good
talk back to me because I don't know
somebody's on the Hangout right now but
um but there's a nice solution to this
which is what we could often do is just
set Y directly to height so that if the
ball goes down in addition to setting it
back we also sneak its location right
back
we kindly nudge it back onto the screen
but let's see let me try to go back to
the sketch which is now downloaded okay
so one thing that's interesting about
this is I'm getting up here we go ah
JavaScript mode intersect whoa okay so
this is going to be a big so this is
nice we're going to run this and maybe
we'll see that there's a problem but
this is probably going to be much too
dude this is a large sketch that without
kind of having looked at it and there's
already some other stuff going on audio
stuff so I'm gonna I guess I'm going to
have to unfortunately speak more
generally unless a unless um whoever
said this in wants to try to ask a more
specific question about this area but
right now I want to feel like you're
like sign-off and debugging side by god
okay wait I got a message you know link
you you just have to share with videos
okay um now let's see what's happening
on Twitter thank you for doing this live
stream it's quite interesting
google hangout with okay so if you want
to maybe I'm gonna check my email maybe
somebody emailed me Oh can't see me
right now grab maybe somebody emailed me
to get invited to the hangouts
okay wait I've got somebody who maybe
wants to join I'm going to try to invite
them let's see if I can do this
I really don't like where this podium is
but I have to work on this later the
invite invite interestingly enough
unless you're the original creator of
the Hangout you cannot invite someone so
let me see it you can invite
you cannot invite some hey yeah alright
we have somebody oh yeah that's me hi
Dan the state Pentecost hi nice to see
you virtually almost in person the other
day but now virtually this is great
running the screen behind you that's a
nice trick thank you okay so what's
going on what's happening today in
processing like well
Andres was around all weekend or
actually Saturday evening to effects
what's that I think you might have the
stream open in a different window
yeah I do hold on all right yes away
it's kind of like in the old days when
they said turn array do down okay I've
stopped it in another window can you can
you see me or am i screwing things up
here no no you absolutely fine I
actually can't see you but I can hear
you I can't see you if I look over here
so now I can see you I said okay I'm
standing over here in this direction I
don't see ok well but now I don't see
you on the right I pick screen there we
go yep so so Andres was here can you
hear me yeah yeah yeah so Andres was
here and he struggled a bit with this
with this hemispheric projection it
turns out the fisheye that's in version
2 is not the right thing that's not the
right fisheye for the dome he came to a
conclusion that it's a lot more
complicated than he expected
and he started working with a different
approach well we know that there's a 1.5
version somebody else came up with and
that we can use with some of the sample
including some of Robert Hodgins things
we could try that with that but for the
2.0 stuff he's still struggling looks
like this picture camera yeah camera
goes off 30 minutes but son okay um so
let me go I don't know that anybody else
is actually watching this but just also
gazaÃ­s the questions just this might be
just an interesting brief discussion
that we can have so you have a
planetarium dome so uh and is it just a
single projector or what's the kind of a
single computer what's the setup yeah
okay so it's a single fisheye projector
I wanted to wanted to make it as simple
as possible for anybody like you or
Andres or anybody any other visualizers
to come in and plug in and immediately
put things up there but the coolest
thing of course would be if we can frame
any of the processed and sketches with a
fisheye view so it it looks in
perspective we can have things floating
around us and the donor right so if you
just took a regular processing sketch
put it through the projector projecting
it would look distorted is that what's
happening without right if if it's yeah
you see a distorted rectangle depending
on the size of of the sketch you'll see
a distorted rectangle we can do that we
can throw it up there
right and but if it's in a circle that's
1200 by 1200 pixels 1200 diameter then
it can fill the dome if it's a radial
sketch it might look cool in the dome
but if it's a 3d sketch we've got to
impose this this hemispheric projection
on it for it to look in perspective so
each ideally should be a circuit
circular and 1200 pixels in diameter
right our our projector actually is goes
up to 1600 pixels but right now we have
the Windows computer that's running the
astronomy software in
a dual link DVI at 1600 and I'm in an
HDMI input which only goes up to 1200 so
1200 is pretty I mean then 1200 is
manageable for computing purposes and
it's pretty simple anybody can come in
and plug in
I wonder if even just using something
like madmapper that somehow have like a
it could take like a little simple 3d
model of the dough and then the process
that the problem is yeah the problem is
you really have to simulate
a 180 degree fisheye lens right so it
you need to create you need to do it
with a you know one of these cubic
projections that are actually like
having a bunch of cameras that you then
shoot the results from and projected
there right well if it is is if there's
anybody well-suited to figure this out
his name is Andres Corey yeah that's
what I thought too but he was pretty
stomped last night he left a little
dejected but he's determined um so I
look forward to having a chance to come
we're going to you were right yet it's
pretty fun as I say you know almost
anything projected up in the dome looks
cool its coolest if it if it's up there
in proper perspective if you're stickler
about that right and also since you're
going to be doing these this unit with
your students about protecting space
which looks very cool
this you know I mean projecting space on
a flat screen that's how we look at
everything everywhere else besides the
planetarium but they might find it
interesting to see it actually
surrounding them so yeah we perfectly
like my kind of idea would be to have
some basic examples that show how to
make a sketch that would run there and
let the students play with it and
actually go over and try them out than
that all right it's going to be once
Andres has the the
the bugs worked out on this it's going
to be a pretty simple matter to drop
your sketch into a draw scene area in
his fisheye great setup right awesome so
that'll be that'll be fun and I think
you'll find it interesting I want it I
want to connect you as I said in the
email I think I want to connect you with
Carter Emery who has kind of spearheaded
this radicalization do you know Carter
yes I met him before he came here to ITV
different presentation okay so you know
you know what he's done yeah yeah and so
a lot I read Robert Hodgins post about
going going trying to figure out how to
deal with the distances and the sizes of
of the astronomical objects and
presumably Carter and his ex students
have wrestled with this and come up with
a solution so you can you can see what
you think when you see that working to
possibly so now I now I've hijacked your
nationhood no no there's no right so
this is just actually a test we were
just trying to test the see if this
system here in this room which I've been
using to record so could also be
broadcast live and the things that the
thing that I discovered is you Google
Hangouts which you can broadcast on
people can't just add themselves have to
be invited so I need a system by which
either of people in advance or that they
can as well as sort of hard to kind of
manage and figure out like if people can
ask a question or whatever but I thank
you for calling in because that was
really helpful to kind of test this and
I'm gonna just kind of see if there are
any other Twitter messages or emails of
other people who might want to ask a
question trying I'm probably always 415
a pointer this time to go suits probably
resolve nothing okay you better better
get on to your other customers I did
have one more question hi how do you do
the superimposition of you on the screen
have you got a little device there so
this is actually been done so you're
referring to the fact that yeah so
the good news is I'm going to remain a
documentation video about how all this
stuff works in this room which I just
need to post which will explain it in
more detail but the short answer is
there is a camera and a laptop and both
the feed from the camera which is
recording me choose me and the feed from
the laptop which is you're saying here
those go into one machine as capture
devices and software called Wirecast is
compositing them and this is just a
green screen so right here is a green
screen which you can actually see I
think I'm in the Hangout right right I
figured I mean you can see this is this
is the actual laptop yep this is just a
green screen and they're being if this
is obviously the non composited view
there and then this is the composite
view yep
thank you awesome thanks for calling can
help you in touch already now okay okay
all right let's see okay so let's see
what else I'm in the wrong place here I
guess I'm going to I feel like that I
should have a song or something to
finish off with let's see either no
other Twitter messages there are there's
a youtube comment that says hi and I
don't have any emails so I think
actually it's 4 or 15 this was a good
test if you like this maybe we'll do it
again I don't know what's a nice song to
finish off with we were testing audio
with fanfare from the for the
common man for second Vegas watching
that I said how it's interesting as I
can't tell us just like I think this ad
right now come through to hang out but
I'd write it out yes Oh somebody's
forget that idea how good to stop this
broadcast thank you everyone for tuning
in if I don't know that I'll do another
test they don't know that I will do
another test this summer uh but I
well I might do one more test this
summer but the we're going to kind of
organize this a bit more and try to make
this a weekly event where you could
possibly ask questions over Twitter
maybe maybe you could join the hangout
to actually be here and ask questions oh
no it was logic um I guess it's gets
recorded so um and maybe some way of
like sharing sketches through Dropbox so
if you have ideas for how this might
work better or if you have a question
you want to ask the like I'm going to
probably do this till September you can
send me an email
um you know getting your sketch attached
so I'm going to figure out how to turn
this off just you have to go to this
computer and click end the broadcast
