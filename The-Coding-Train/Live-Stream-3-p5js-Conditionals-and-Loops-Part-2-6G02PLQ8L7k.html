volume is working unfortunately yes
software update hello everybody oh okay
so I want to first mention something off
the bat I shipped it like minimize this
for a second so I'm having an audio
problem which is that you're hearing
this in mono the videos i'm actually
gonna record an upload later will come
in both the left and right ears but for
whatever reason the stream settings I've
changed it in a whole bunch of different
places I can't get Wirecast to take the
input i don't know in mac OS if i can
change that mono input to stereo so imma
be able to figure it out yet so
unfortunately if you're watching this
live you will only hear the mono signal
so i'm gonna try to like I already did
an hour of video so I'm like losing a
little bit of steam but I'm going to try
to finish off these videos I want to do
one more video about conditional logic
in JavaScript p 5 i'm going to look at
what it means to set a variable to true
or false and i'm going to look at the
mouse is pressed variable as well as
making up your own variable set to true
or false and then i'm going to move on
and look at lukes and drawing things a
whole bunch of times that's my plan so I
don't know if let me just check if any
of you are there oh the latency is still
not so great hello seven people who are
watching now hey I caught that I caught
that boo um so I'm gonna get started in
a second I'm just trying to think of
where where I'm gonna do this okay
thanks hideous
okay you guys are behind I hate that the
chat is lagging behind me but it's not
that bad okay I need a little water look
at this coffee okay so I'm just about to
get going here losing my voice um okay
so i think i just got to get this
started so let me prepare the first
example i want to prepare i'm going to
use both of these conditionals one
conditionals to you know what we need
i'm thinking of so many things i got to
make some notes so i'm thinking of
things that the editor needs it needs a
the editor knee editor needs like
windows so you can flip from sketch to
sketch and then the editor also needs
would be nice to the editor remembers
size and location of the code window
also okay maybe i'll get a fresh marker
okay so if you guys have other thoughts
about the p5 j/s editor and things that
it might need let me know put it in the
comments you can file github issues
yourself you should thank sam levine and
many others too but Samm Levine has been
leading the charge at the editor there's
also a web p5 editor that's coming down
the pipeline that Jason Segel worked on
a lot over the summer with a lot of help
from others as well okay but I gotta
make this video so I'm gonna make one
video where I make a boolean variable
that stops and starts this circle from
moving and I'm going to make another one
that the only highlight said if you're
clicking on it think that's what I'm
gonna do oh boy whoo
this is dangerous okay I'm just going to
do it it's gonna be fine let me make
this I'm also going to change this to
let me just fix a couple things I'm
gonna make this wreck mode center and
i'm going to change this to then this
has to be where is this if req mode is
centered it's at 300 200 s at 250 and
less than 350 and mouse why it's greater
than 150 and mouse y is less than 250 so
now i have a perfect roll over which i
will use to start demonstrating okay
okay you got to start this video and i'm
going to start it I'm gonna check the
chat one more time the fact that you can
watch is totally amazing seven people
are watching this right now but possibly
less fewer than that are actually paying
attention hello I don't know what's
happening okay okay i just got to start
making these videos and I'm stalling
like crazy look at this weird invisible
what am i invisible mug this is the
strangest thing I have a mug it's it
completely invisible it's also just
glass and clear but it like when I put
it in front of an actual human being can
see it but in front of the green screen
just disappears magic okay uh here we go
um I don't know how I'm gonna do this
okay I'm gonna figure it out oh haha rod
one okay here we go again hi so III made
a couple bunch of videos about
conditional statements and I recall or I
thought of during one of them that
there's sort of a key element here that
I think would be worth noting and
spending a little bit of time on in its
own short little video which I'm
attempting to make right now it was
trying to be perky not really inside I
feel like lying down to taking a nap
okay so what is the topic of this video
and what I want to talk about is what if
you had a variable and instead of
assigning the value of that variable to
say a number or perhaps a string or
perhaps an image these are some things
that you may or may not have seen so far
what if the value of that variable I'm
going to call it like going or equal to
true itself or false so in fact this is
a data type now as you know anytime you
declare a variable you just say var and
the name of the variable and then it's
up to you to assign it a value most of
the examples we've seen so far we give
those variables numbers numbers are
useful they can be used to specify
coordinates on the screen sizes of
shapes colors red components of the
color transparency the color numbers
generally are being used over and over
again everywhere in code however it can
be useful to have your own variable that
is either set to true or false now
before I get to that one of the reasons
why I mentioning this to you is there
also happens to be a variable built into
p5 right there are the variables built
into p5 that you likely know about mouse
X and mouse why these variables are
numbers they hold the coordinate as to
where the mouse is on the screen but
there is also a variable called mouse is
pressed and this particular variable is
a its data type is boolean meaning it's
either true or false
so this is relevant because why is this
relevant this is relevant because
sometimes you want to know is the mouse
being pressed or is it not now earlier
in a previous video at some point in
some life where I made this other video
there happen to be a function a function
called mousepressed and I stated at the
time that this function is an event
meaning the code that you write inside
this function gets executed instantly
the moment the mouse is pressed so why
is there a mousepressed event but also a
boolean variable to check whether the
mouse is pressed or not and the
distinction comes down to the following
and this is a really key distinction
which is totally built into the way that
you live your life and use a computer
but you may not have thought about it at
such detail because it's kind of like
just sort of like inherent way of being
but there's a difference between
clicking the mouse I want to click the
mouse to instigate something versus I
want to hold down the mouse to have
something happened continuously while
I'm holding down the mouse and in
essence the boolean variable is
something you want to use when you want
to test if the mouse is being held down
and the function mousepressed is the
function you want to use when the mouse
for the event the moment is in the mouse
is being clicked all the stuff that
happens after that is it being held down
there's also a mouse released function
for knowing when it's released but i but
i digress so let's look at the
distinction between these two and i'm
not sure exactly how I'm going to do
this but I'm going to go back to the
example the rollover example and see if
we can kind of play around with this
idea of it as a button versus a rollover
okay so let's look let's review this
example I'll up since the last time you
saw this example because in my fantasy
world people are just watching these
videos what have to another sequence
which I don't know if it's true I don't
know if anybody's watching I'm doing
this anyway don't have to watch it's
just something I do to entertain myself
during my day and so I'm going to hit
run this and you can see I did a couple
things one is I used this function
wrecked mode so now the rectangle is
being drawn according to its center and
then I adjusted the coordinates and I
added the y coordinate so this if
statement has become very long I'm
checking if mouse X is between the left
and right hand side of the rectangle
between the top and bottom so you can
see this works perfectly now it only it
only changes color if the mouse is
anywhere within that rectangle so we've
got a rollover now what if I wanted to
when when you're inside the circle do
something when the mouse is pressed
sorry okay I know what I'm doing here so
let's look at that if mouse is pressed
variable so I'm actually add just a
completely separate if statement and I'm
going to say if mouse is pressed
background and I actually I think I want
to put this yep but I want to put this
above that one just actually doesn't
really matter but I'm going to put it up
here just the kind of for a second just
to kind of keep it all together so look
I've added another I've had it another
if statement sir lost my train of
thought or but everything will come back
so if the mouse is pressed change the
background so remember this is different
then I click the mouse and one thing
happens at the event now I'm checking
this is the mouse Preston draw so what
I'm trying to do here is check is the
user holding down the mouse this is how
this is used okay so now if I click the
mouse I'm holding it down you can't see
here watch this this is gonna be a
really crazy moment for you this is my
computer rising and this like mechanical
destiny this doesn't really help but it
does give you the air I'm going to now
hold down the mouse it is green I am now
letting go it is not great so I have
this interaction which is different then
I click the mouse and it's green forever
we're going to have to sort of see how
to do that the other thing what I want
to do is only actually have this happen
when I'm on if I'm on this on this roll
over so let's do let's figure that out
so it's kind of silly but the way I'm
going to do it right now is take this if
statement whoa and put it inside this if
statement now I probably could figure
out a way of joining this with another
and but what I'm saying here is look at
this look at this this is kind of
exciting and different if the mouse over
let me put this back down if the mouse
is within that rectangle and it's
pressed change the background but
doesn't matter where it's pressed or not
if it's when the rectangle always change
the highlight so we can see the logic
here that I now have it's always good i
always have this rollover it's going to
get highlighted as soon as the mouse is
over there i could click anywhere around
it doesn't change color but now when i
click here but only when I'm holding it
down ok so now that's using the if mouse
is pressed what if I wanted this this is
this is like a button that you hold down
it's like if you had a light at home and
we heard out the light on you just
always had to hold down the button to
switch as soon as you left it like
turned off so with your light at home
you want to press it it goes on you
leave you come back later you could
press it again now for this to happen we
need who an entire other kind of weight
need another variable ok and we need to
use the mouse pressed events we're going
to piece these things together so now we
have a rollover where you hold down how
97 minutes you hold down the mouse it
turns the light on what I want to do is
press the little button turn the light
on press the button turn the light off
this is kind of like strangely such a
simple thing so a bit of a tricky tricky
interaction problem in tricky
programming logic something like that
problem let's figure it out ok so
ultimately what I want now is to have my
own the way to do this is is not to use
the mouse is pressed variable that has a
value that's just built into the
operating system in 2 p-5 into
JavaScript into the browser it knows
what the mouse is pressed or not I want
to have my own variable I want to have a
very bun call it on might be something
like an issue with using this term on
but for now I think it's going to be
okay and I'm going to start with on
equal to false so then the program first
runs the light is off when on is false
the light is off
and in draw what I essentially want to
do is I want to say if on then set the
background to some other color otherwise
set the background to some other color
so this is the idea here if I have my
own boolean variable that's either false
or true I can just change the value of
that variable somewhere else in the code
when I click the mouse turn this to true
and the light will always be on that I
have to figure out when do I set it back
equal to false so let's take a look at
at doing this with this now in theory i
should upload all these code examples
somewhere and i got to figure out a way
to do that but the very least i'm going
to do is save project as conditionals
button and hopefully that previous one
will be safe so I go to I'm going to
take some of this code for a second and
just stick it at the bottom and put it
in comments because I may be to refer to
it later so down here we might need to
get back this rollover code and maybe we
need to look at the if Mouse's press
thing again but right now instead what I
want to do is just add at the top VAR on
equals false and here i want to say if
on background a green background
otherwise a black background so let's
look at that this is just a simple if
statement if on otherwise becker now I
there's actually like I can't believe I
didn't even mention this really because
we look at this with mouse is pressed we
looked at this with look at the on it's
just sort of intuitive to be but always
before when you had a boolean expression
you needed to have some sort of like
relational operator like if Mouse x is
greater than 100 here I just said that
the whole point of this is this
evaluates to true or false that sort of
off the edge or a bit of glare there but
um this evaluates to true or false a
variable with type boolean you don't
need to check anything about it inherit
it itself just has the value true or
false it evaluates to true or false
that's what it's a toll purpose in life
you could technically say this
you could say if on equals true and this
would be the same thing like if on has
the value true but this is redundant so
this might actually helped you to sort
of think about it this is really what's
going on but code wise it's a little bit
shorter to just write if on and then
open curly bracket ok so now I'm coming
back over here and we see that now if on
green otherwise black so I'm going to
run this you can see there's no green
because on is set to false and I'm not
setting it to true anywhere now if on is
set to true i'm going to hard code that
now the background is green because on
is true so this code is being executed
so now the difference between wanting to
do something when the mouse is held down
versus instigated event the moment the
mouse is clicked is I need to add
function mousepressed so instead of
before remember with the holding down
the mouse I had this if Mouse Preston
draw now I want to have this event and
what I can't do I don't want to put draw
the green background here right remember
draw is always looping so drawing code
here in this case doesn't really make
sense because it will just get
overwritten by what happens in draw what
I want to do is change the state of the
program how do i change the state of the
program well on start such false that's
at the initial value and when I run the
program its false it's black what I want
to do is say when I click the mouse set
on equal to true or on equals true so
now on equals true let's click the mouse
tada it's on click the mouse again it
didn't turn off also when I run this
again a click out here it turns it on so
how do I get it only two turn two on if
I'm within the bounds of that rectangle
well that's an easy thing that's why I
save this code we can now inside
mousepressed test for books we can test
for the location
so the thing that i've added right here
is now when the mouse is pressed first
check see where the mouse is and only if
it's within that rectangle set it equal
to on so let's run this again okay i'm
clicking all around the outside
nothing's happening i'm going to click
in the center here comes it turns on now
i want it to turn off so this is a
tricky one if it's on if it's true it
should go off otherwise if it's off it
should become already confused myself we
want it to toggle at state true becomes
false false becomes true true becomes
false false becomes true and I could
actually type this out I could diagram
this for you but I'm just going to kind
of type it out I'm gonna say if on is
true on should be false otherwise on
should be true now this is kind of like
oh the camera shut off you I'm trying to
get back on so this is definitely again
is like a point of confusion now the
temperature off I don't need to go over
there anymore this is definitely a point
of confusion it's tricky like a sort of
like very circular weird logic but think
about it if it's on turn it off
otherwise it must have been office or
turn it on so let's see if that works
yay so now I have this button every time
I press it I change the state of the
program pretty exciting now this however
can be condensed all into one line of
code and it involves an operator that I
this is perfect because I was like what
operator did I forget the not operator
is something that I forgot so let me I
do need to come over here so I need to
turn this camera back on so I want to
look here at the not operator so we know
that I could say something like if mouse
x is greater than 100 do something and I
could invert this like the opposite of
its greater than 100 would be kind of
like less than or equal to 100 but I can
also say if it's not true that it's
greater than 100 do something and the
not operator is an exclamation point
so for example if not on what does this
mean do something so I have a variable
on its equal to false does this code get
executed yes or no not false is true so
this expression together evaluates to
true therefore this code does get does
get evaluated so let me make another
statement to you and this is like really
this is like very uncomfortable here
we're going to do it on equals not on
what does that mean I want to set the
value of this variable to not itself so
if its value is false not false is true
if its value is true not true is false
so this much like we had that expression
speed equals speed times negative 1 this
reversed the polarity of a number three
becomes negative 3 negative 3 becomes 3
take a number multiply by negative one
makes a negative positive a positive
negative this expression takes a boolean
value makes false true or true false so
if i come back over here and look at
this i could take all of this right here
which has this effect of toggling the
boolean variable and i could just change
it to one line of code equals not on and
i'm going to run this the light goes on
and off I've got a button I can click
outside and nothing happens I click
inside now we lost our little roll over
so I'm going to also add that back in
which is just about highlighting the
color and so we don't need the mouse's
press part anymore sorry and so all
we're doing here sorry Allah is I wanted
to add in also so notice if I want to
check is the mouse over it continuously
that's what I need to do and draw but at
the moment the mouse is pressed
also need to check is the mouse over it
for the button so this is now has the
functionality of if I'm over it it's
highlighted but only if I click does
that button engage so I have a couple
things to say about this number one is
any time you notice two pieces of code
in your program that are basically
identical you should ask yourself the
question is there a better way to do
this now we haven't need to get further
down the road here but maybe there's a
way we could create our own function
that tested if a if the mouse is over a
given point and we kind of do that in
two places without have copying pasting
the same code that's something we're
going to see later that i'm going to
show you later the other thing to think
about you that's super interesting again
i think it's a point that i started with
this we just spent oh my god this is 20
minutes this video crazy 20 minutes just
looking at how to like make a button to
happen you know rollover versus a button
and what's interesting about working in
p5 and in the browser is later known as
i get to further topics i would like to
show you how you can add buttons and
interface elements that you get
essentially for free that are part of
the native browser environments their
HTML elements their elements that you
can add to a webpage with a little bit
of actually code in p5 will let you just
create one and you can kind of hook
different events and the p5 is going to
take care of a lot of this is the mouse
over it or did the mouse press it that
type of thing but I think there's a
moment here as you're just starting out
programming working in the raw canvas
that it's worthwhile to try to program
some of these button and roll over kind
of elements and it's just good practice
and kind of gets you working with all
this logic sup and will be interesting
to compare to it later but I would say
if you're trying to think of an exercise
that are piggyback off of this is you
might have some stuff try have a DAT
putting this kind of button on a sketch
where there's something moving around
the screen and when you press the button
can you make the like thing move in a
different direction or change its size
or what kind of other types of things
can you hook into like a button like
this besides just changing the
background color okay hopefully that was
useful to you I am now going to stop
this video and I'm going to move on to
making some videos about loops not
recording
we go okay now live stream I've just
talking to you now I'm going to see yes
uh shoot oh great Oh interesting the
audio isn't stereo but it's bad oh well
so this video probably need to be
re-recorded now k I don't look at the
chat during it which is too bad is that
so wait a second I just want to debug
this for a little bit unfortunately you
guys are behind me um the audio is bad
now oh yeah look at that oh it's going
back and forth what did I do oh shoot ah
never change settings okay shoot I don't
know what I changed show source settings
darn it did I switch this I don't think
so
silly Wirecast I'm music up and you guys
can't see me sorry I'm going to try to
let me hold on Oh green screen oh no I
really messed things up ah what's going
on oh no this is the whiteboard okay and
audio audio audio audio I can change
anything test test test this is like
this is changing the sensitivity has
test test where did I change the like I
click on something here
oh boy
test test
ok
hi everyone the audio is just all
screwed up so I'm going to unfortunately
stop this broadcast and I might restart
another one if I can figure it out okay
because I don't want to sit here and
debug this live sorry thank you guys for
tolerating this unfortunate i'm going to
have to re-record that video it seems
like just too bad how do I stop this
stop streaming okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
