nature of code intelligence and learning
so this is one of my opening videos for
these sessions if you are watching this
video as part of that playlist for the
intelligence and learning course you
will see a lot of videos in front of you
with a variety of demonstrations and
different coding challenges there will
also be a video at the end where I come
back and pose some ideas for an exercise
or assignment that you can try but what
I want to do in this particular video is
now now at the time this courses were
started with this little warm-up of
thinking about artificial intelligence
search algorithms that graph systems
took this turn and thought about genetic
algorithms and evolutionary systems but
you might be here because you heard
about this term machine learning
maybe even heard about this term deep
learning and you want to have to get a
sense of what does that mean what are
the possibilities with machine learning
and deep learning how do machine
learning systems work what are they for
what's the lingo for this sort of stuff
and and now's the time to get into that
now session three here I will not be
using any neural network yet so what I
want to do in session three is just talk
about what machine learning is what its
applications are so something that is
going to cover here is classification
and regression what are those terms mean
and what are some classic algorithms for
performing classification and regression
and so I'm going to look at something
called nearest neighbor similarity K
nearest neighbor and I'm also going to
look at something called linear
regression and so these will be some
sort of classic algorithms that you can
play around with and do some actually do
stuff with and then in session 4 will
start looking at what a neural network
is and see how we can use that as part
of a machine learning system ok you with
me by the way I barely know how to use
this stuff so you're watching this for
an expert you probably supply something
else on YouTube but I'm learning the
stuff trying it out and hopefully you're
going to come along and join me on the
train right I forgot we're on a train Oh
on this ride on the train in the sky
with me as your guide do sky and guide
Ryan I think they do you'll see I I had
to find a point to the skies igress ok
so um what is machine
learning so first of all one thing that
I might suggest for you if you love
explosion videos about somebody who
really knows what they're talking about
you I would suggest Andrew Aang's
Coursera course a lot of my knowledge
and inspiration has come from that
course and Andrew Aang does a good job
of giving a nice introduction to machine
learning and to particular references
one is this definition this quote from
Arthur Samuels who is a pioneer in the
world of machine learning defining
machine learning as a field of study
that gives computers the ability to
learn without being explicitly
programmed and so here's an interesting
thing we can think about when we looked
at the a-star algorithm in session one
for pathfinding we were designing us the
programmer writing an algorithm to
specifically perform a task the computer
would follow those instructions and get
to a result there was an intelligence to
that algorithm there was the
disappearance of sort of the computer
solving a problem in thinking about it
but ultimately we had written the
instructions the code for the computer
to solve to arrive at an answer so what
if instead of us writing the
instructions we would just set up a
framework for the computer to figure out
what the instructions might be what are
the right parameters for some type of
model to perform some sort of task so
this is the idea of machine learning and
I would encourage you to look at the
work of Arthur Samuels one of the things
that he did was train a computer to
learn to play checkers I just having it
play itself over and over and over again
thousands of times to be able to learn
what a good strategy was so but
ultimately so one of the things that I
want to talk about here is so let me let
me come over the white board here I have
this readme that I'll link to in the
description you can read some of the
definitions and send information that's
on that readme but what I want to look
at is this model for this I'm going to
describe to you Michigan machine
learning in this particular way so there
is some sort of input that input is
going to go into some sort of algorithm
some recipe
I think that's a nice way of thinking
about it some machine learning recipe
and then out of that machine learning
recipe we are going to get an output C
input into the machine learning recipe
is typically numeric so you could think
of it as a classic example that's always
given is what if we want to build a
machine learning system that can guess
the price of a house based on some
inputs so maybe we might say something
like oh the house has three bedrooms and
it has two bathrooms and it has 1000
square feet and etc etc this is the
input into the machine learning recipe
and the output might come the house is
you know 1 million dollars something
like that nice house apparently okay so
this is what machines so typically
speaking another way of thinking about
machine learning is making sense of data
so I have some sort of data and I want
to make sense of it have some input and
some output so two kinds of output that
you'll see in many most machine learning
algorithms are classification another
kind of output is regression so what you
might not have realized here is this
example that I gave to you where the
parameters on the house a data point
goes into the machine learning recipe
and we get this price output this is
actually regression regression refers to
predicting some sort of continuous
numeric output whereas classification
refers to taking an input and
classifying it into a discrete set of
labels so here might be another scenario
I have an image of a cat that is the
input into the machine learning recipe
and the output is something like this
well
getting is usually the Alpha comes at
numeric so we have to sort of figure out
what this could mean but you know I'm
speaking in a kind of higher level terms
here so I'm just going to say the output
is cat
I am labeling it maybe the only possible
options are cat versus dog so what that
output actually is is something like you
know point nine point one like there's a
90% chance this is a cat 10% chance it's
a dog so this is classification
attempting to assign a discrete label to
something like an image we could have
done something with the house data using
class the classification we could say
you know fancy house you know summer
house winter house you know we could
classify into one of two categories
that's classification regression getting
a continuous numeric output so how does
this work so number one is we've got to
at some point start talking about what
are some different recipes that could go
in here and I could name you a few for
example K nearest neighbor this is a
particular algorithm that can work for
both classification and regression I
could say something like support vector
machine or I could say artificial neural
network and then there are a variety of
flavors so to speak of styles and and
artificial neural networks convolutional
neural network recurrent neural network
so this is something I openly intend to
spend a lot of time on what is an
artificial neural network how does it
work and why is it effective to put it
in here but even with all of the amazing
innovation that's happening in machine
learning and deep learning right now
there's a lot that you can do without
artificial neural networks a lot of
simple fun exercises and things so in
this particular session session 3 I'm
going to look at the other algorithms
that are non artificial neural network
non neural network based that become
machine learning must be like K nearest
neighbor but let's take a moment here to
talk about how in overall this works
because the thing is
this doesn't just happen magically you
can't just you know the point of doing
this is that at someday we might want to
put an unknown image in here and get a
classification label for that image but
how could a machine-learning recipe do
that from nothing and it can't so one of
the things I want to talk about here is
how does this work so before you can
actually use machine learning to make
predictions for unknown data you need to
train the system so the training step
involves so there there are several
different strategies for how a machine
learning system can learn in order to
perform operations like this one is
called supervised learning and
supervised learning is is the strategy
that I'm going to use in just about
everything that I do in this particular
course from session 3 right now and on
although I will come back to some other
techniques as well another kind of
learning is unsupervised learning and
another kind of learning that I really
love my favorite kind of learning is
reinforcement learning in fact I have a
whole book all about reinforcement
learning that I'm reading right now ok
so what are these different and you know
there's something called semi-supervised
learning and there's little variations
on this but these are three core types
of learning that can be applied to the
machine learning process let's start
with reinforcement learning for a second
reinforcement learning is the kind of
learning where an agent observes the
environment and chooses an action you
can think of a mouse trying to get
through a maze the mouse looks around
there's a wall here there's a wall here
there's a wall here the mouse decides to
go left the mouse or the mouse decides
to go right and then once the mouse
makes that decision the mouse receives a
reward that could be a positive or
negative reward and you know as the
mouse receives more positive rewards for
certain kinds of actions it does more of
those actions over the long term and
gets better and better at things so
that's reinforcement learning I'm going
to spend a whole session
looking at this at some point and we're
going to see some techniques I have an
example that uses a kind of
reinforcement style learning to Train to
play the autonomously play the game
flappy bird okay unsupervised learning
is a kind of learning that's generally
applied to data that you know nothing
about so I have 100,000 songs and I just
want to kind of learn like what patterns
are there in the song so typically
unsupervised learning is applied to
problems like clustering so I have all
this data and I want to kind of figure
out how can this data be arranged in
groups could I have a net I don't know
anything about it could an algorithm
figure out based on patterns in the data
how to group that data how to cluster
that data so I don't know that this is
something that I'm going to spend any
time stuff on my current trajectory
slash syllabus but it is something that
I would like to do at some point in the
future and there's actually have some
ideas for some stuff I want to do about
that eventually okay but here we're
gonna give a nice little star and heart
and a little smiley face like a little
rainbow for supervised learning because
this is what I'm going to use in most of
most of my examples over the next
several videos the idea of supervised
learning is I have training data
training data so number one I have
training data number two I have test
data and number three I have the rest of
the world universe of data so maybe we
could call this unknown I'm I'm I can't
spell unknown data so how does this work
so first what we do in supervised
learning is we take this training data
we have a huge database of a spreadsheet
of bedrooms bathrooms and square footage
for houses with their actual price that
they sold out so we have a data set that
has the parameters and some sort of
target often called a target
so this would be like the training data
with the inputs and a target the idea
the inputs go into the machine learning
recipe they come out the other side and
some sort of guest is made maybe they'll
have price the house actually sold for
1.5 million dollars but the guest was 1
million dollars
ah so the machine learning recipe got it
wrong so we turned some knobs here put
mess around with it to try to get it to
have a better result that's towards what
that error is we're going to talk a lot
about this error and that sort of thing
or to come back to this many many times
so we do this over and over again with
lots and lots of training data turning
all the knobs trying to get it to do a
good job then what we do is we have test
data now test data is just like the
training data it's data that has inputs
with a known result a known result that
we should get but we didn't actually use
it while training because we have this
issue a machine learning recipe might
perform really really well with the
training data but not with actual other
data so to see how well it's working
we've actually got to give it data that
we didn't use to train and that's called
the test data so we would feed that see
how well it does evaluate and evaluate
the performance and say like ah you know
what it got all the test data right it's
ready it's all grown up our machine
learning recipe is ready to go and we
send it out into the world to start
interacting with unknown data so this is
really the process this is supervised
learning it's saying hey I'm the teacher
this is the machine learning system I'm
going to teach the system with my known
data with known output I'm going to test
the data with separate known inputs and
outputs and then it's going to be all
grown up it's going to graduate I'm
going to send it out into the world and
yadda yadda yadda you no more by the way
I plan on doing a lot of yadda yadda
yadda neural network stuff like I said
we might get to like it then you have to
do this like calculus thing yadda yadda
so I think that's a good good good
practice to yadda yadda yadda
learning as much as possible okay so
that's a brief introduction to what
machining learning is overall and what
some of the sort of key aspects of how a
machine learning system works but we're
going to get into a lot more about the
details here and we're going to look at
a variety of different kinds of recipes
that can be put in here and how they
work with different kinds of data like
which recipes do you want to work with
images which recipe would you want for
working with text for this for this kind
of classification but this kind of
regression but right now I'm going to
move on and start looking at nearest
neighbor what is this thing called
nearest neighbor how can I look at two
different pieces of data so let me so I
have a bunch of pre-made examples in
some of the puke follow along with the
playlist you're going to see a bunch of
examples to write code stuff from
scratch but I won't be able to do I'm
not going to do a video for every single
one of these examples I mean mix I will
someday but for the first thing I'm
really going to start looking at is and
this is an example inspired by this is
an example inspired by Rebecca fie brink
of who has a wonderful course called I
think machine learning for musicians and
artists from the company could end today
I'll put a link to that in this video's
description where she uses a tool that
she built called Weka neener to do
classification and regression a variety
of other things so she does a lot of
stuff with gestural interfaces and
musical output so one of the things I
want to look at I'm going to hit play
here and what you're going to see is as
I move the mouse near a particular note
the note changes c d e f and this is
actually a classification this is an
example of classification what i'm doing
is i have two dimensional data a
Cartesian coordinate system and i want
to classify every XY point to a
particular note
this is classification so the nearest
note is the note that I play I can
actually switch this example to perform
regression and this is an example now of
regression you can hear I make a
prediction based on a weighted distance
so here I essentially have an average of
C and G I'm hearing a little G I'm at a
frequency between G and C you can hear G
C G C so this is these are the kind of
examples that I want to build to get you
started with understanding the
algorithms and have some ideas for some
creative possibilities that you can do
and then we're going to just keep going
so okay so stay tuned there'll be a
bunch of videos in this playlist where I
go through a few different examples and
scenarios I'll come back with another
video with some homework ideas and
hopefully you'll make some stuff and
share with me and live your life in this
world / universe / place and maybe give
somebody a hug or say something nice to
somebody because those are good things
to do - ok see you in a future video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
