talking about a for loop here's the
thing you learned about a while loop you
can actually just totally skip this
video you don't need a for loop a for
loop is just a shorthand way of writing
a while loop a certain kind of while
loop that you tend to want to write over
and over and over and over again but
you're going to be looking at processing
examples you're going to be doing things
in the future that for loop is going to
be convenient for you so you might as
well get exposed to it and use it but I
should really point out that we're not
adding any new functionality we're just
learning a shorthand way to write a
while loop in fact the way we're going
to write it is perhaps a little bit more
confusing spin a while loop but and look
we're going to examine that so that's
all this video is going to be about it's
about let's look at the while loop let's
look at a for loop let's learn how to
rewrite a while loop as a for loop and
let's do that in to processing code so
we have the answer to one of our
exercises earlier i refactored this
program just to make it a static program
so there's no setup and draw anymore and
all it's doing is it's saying hey let's
start X at zero and repeat X all the way
to the edge of the screen let's start Y
at zero let's repeat why all the way to
the bottom of the screen that's what
we're doing in this video to draw this
sort of grid pattern by lines
horizontally and lines vertically so to
do that we know we have to say okay well
first we start with X equal to zero then
we say well while X is less than the
width of the window draw something and
increment so draw something being
violetta the line sorry the line draw
the line which goes from X comma 0 to X
comma height and then increment X by
some amount I think I said 20 pixels an
arbitrary choice this is our while loop
and gives us a lie a line a line a line
all the way to the edge so what are the
elements of this loop there are three
elements one we could say is
initialization condition this is where
we set up what is the thing we're
initializing it right before our loop
starts x equals
what is another thing we're doing we
have a boolean expression we need to
check if that boolean expression is true
if it is continue looping if it's false
finish looping
what's another thing we have we have an
incrementation operation incrementation
operation what we're doing is we're
incrementing some variable every time at
the end of the loop ensuring that our
exit condition is eventually met well a
for loop takes these three common
elements something that you initialize a
boolean expression that you test and
something that you do at the end of the
loop and allows you to write them all in
one statement so it looks like this for
int x equals zero semicolon X is less
than with semicolon x equals x plus 20
and parentheses curly bracket close
curly bracket now I have to walk up to
the camera here for a second yes that
curly bracket is in the shot you are
seeing it that's wonderful
I could also come up and say okay
somebody told me to do that that's what
I did it now I feel embarrassed no it's
kind of stupid okay we'll edit that out
so here we are look at this we have
element number one is right here
element number two is right here element
number three is right here what's
element number four
well element number four is the stuff
that you do inside the loop which for us
is draw a line so you can see these two
loops are 100% identical the difference
is you know this allows you to stick
these three lines of code next to each
other on one line it makes your code a
little shorter you're just saying hey
the loop starts with X at zero we always
check if X this lesson with at the end
of loop we always go up by 20 you know
in some world which is your world if
this is the first time you're learning
this this is actually quite a bit more
confusing because this really says you
know this is all happening in the order
first do this then check the expression
then draw the thing then increment check
the expression then draw the thing then
increment check the expression oh the
expression is false leave the loop
here I hear we're going out of order
first we do this then we do this then we
do this then we do this then we do this
again and if that's true right so it's a
little bit out of order but it will
become intuitive to you but I would
suggest as an exercise what you should
be doing is fine something you made that
has a while loop in it try to rewrite it
with a for loop get the exact same
result in fact you could do that if you
want to pause right now you could do
that with this grid example put this in
your code run it oh wait why would you
do that very good for you but let's just
go you can pick something else
I'll think of something I'll try to
think of something let me I love what
tell we're only at five minutes this is
a brilliant video this I'm just going to
go let's go put this in and improve that
this works so here we have a loop 4x and
a loop for Y which is convenient because
we can see it as both a while loop but
what I'm going to do now just for the
purpose of demonstration you probably
wouldn't do this in your code because it
would be confusing I'm going to have one
the X day is a while the while the Y
change to a for loop and look at it that
way okay so we know that the for loop
the first thing we do is we need the
increment the the initialization
condition okay then the boolean
expression is wireless and height then
the incrementation operation and then
what do we do inside that loop as we
draw a line so you can see these loops
are identical principally identical like
conceptually I'm principally
conceptually identical they're doing the
same thing one for horizontal values one
for vertical values but you can see how
this is condensed it reads got like
three lines of code this is one two
three four five you know if you're going
to do this kind of loop over and over
again it's nice to have the shorthand so
let's run this make sure we get the same
result we got the same result you know
if you want a really simple what's the
easiest exercise I could give you take
this and just convert this first one to
a for loop no actually it's not that
easy
this stuff is weird like look at the
semicolons parentheses with what order
so this will take some time for you
getting used to but hopefully this gives
you a sense of what we understand what a
while loop does and what does a for what
is a for loop it's the same thing as a
while loop but it is a shorthand the
while loop by the way is going to be a
great deal more flex
you could have multiple lines of code
here you could be doing all sorts of
weird stuff in here this is a very
specific format which gives you three
options okay that is perhaps the
shortest video
I think someone's laughing in the
hallway I swear to her if you talking to
myself but they're laughing look the
laughing with me this is very funny for
all of us anyway okay this is the end of
the video there will be another one see
you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
