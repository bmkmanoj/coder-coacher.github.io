continuing series about Perlin noise I
just want to briefly show you what the
noise detail function does and if you
can remember a time a little while ago
and I recorded my first video today or I
don't know when you what never mind
about time thang doesn't exist in the
world of YouTube but I do have a
previous video which you might have
watched where I talk about how the noise
algorithm actually works and if you
recall there was this idea look at the
purple pen there was this idea of
picking random values spaced apart with
some amplitude and then interpolating
between them and then again picking
random values spaced closer together
with a smaller amplitude and then again
picking random values closer together
with an even smaller amplitude and then
interpolating between those and then
adding all of these random waves
together results in some nice pearly
noise this is how the Perlin noise
algorithm works now over here we have a
visualization of perla noise in two
dimensions which I just talked about in
my previous video smooth
randomness each pixel having a similar
grayscale value to the pixels around it
now what we can actually so this is the
default visualization of two-dimensional
Perlin noise but we can look at how that
changes based on based on this noise
detail function so what the noise detail
function does is it actually takes two
arguments let's say say noise detail for
and I'm gonna make this a little bit
bigger you could see nothing changed can
you see but if I say noise detail 8 you
can see that it changed look it's got
finer detail noise detail 24 can you see
that even finer detail so what that
first argument is doing is controlling
the number of octaves so the more
octaves that you have the the further
kind of down this trajectory you're
going in the smaller more fine detail
you're getting now over here I kind of
want to us
okay yeah let's so let's go back to
noise detail for that's the default
there's also a second and by the way if
I were to say noise detail one like what
if I just do one octave you can see now
we've kind of lost that finer detail
just have this sort of smooth grayscale
values now what if we look at the second
argument the second argument is often
referred to as fall-off remember I was
saying how the period of these waves is
shrinking the amplitude is shrinking
well by what factor it's shrinking by a
factor of 0.5 have hats so if I were to
say noise detail for comma point five
hold on I don't like the size of my
things here you can see that's the sort
of default noise but I can now say noise
detail for point nine and look what that
looks like a little bit weird or 0.2 and
look what that looks like or I could say
point four but with you know twelve
octaves you can control the quality of
the Perlin noise actually I'm curious
just for a second to look at whoops what
it looks like with this one-dimensional
Perlin noise example let's just change
the noise detail to one
let's try nose detail one you can see
how this graph really changes you sort
of lost the sort of finer detail that
looks we only have that kind of like
original random noise now if I say noise
detail eight you can see how there is
even more detail in the sort of finer
points of change and I could also say
now noise detail eight and then change
the fall-off to point two and you can
see what that looks like versus point
eight and you can see what that looks
like
so there's a lot of how you how you
alter the the noise detail function can
change the behavior of the noise and
that's something you can control to get
a variety of different effects whether
it's a pixel effects or other</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
