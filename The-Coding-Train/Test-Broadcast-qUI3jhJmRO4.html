live I didn't realize that that wasn't
happening automatically this working can
anyone hear me can you see me I think
you can I see can see me now if you are
on this page watching can you hear my
voice speaking you could type in the
chat i'm looking at the chat down here
so far I have no independent
confirmation that the audio is working
but I do see some green bar moving up
and down yes very clearly okay aha so hi
i am setting up a new video recording
studio i look forward to announcing
where I'm setting it up soon but i'm not
sure yet if I'm ready to do that as you
all know i like to make video tutorials
as you all know i don't know if you all
know this but as you might know my name
is Dan I like to make video tutorials
about programming have a list of topics
that I'm going to do but this is really
just a test I'm seeing it here there are
10 people watching this test so I you
know while I'm here testing if anybody
has any questions about processing or p
5 GS general questions about life the
universe you can ask them now i'm
probably to turn this off in a couple
minutes and then i'm going to maybe
wheel in a white board here try to hook
my laptop up and didn't actually do like
a short video tutorial but I was just
testing to see if this the internet
connection is good enough here to live
stream and if like the camera would work
and all that in this different setup so
I'm just looking at the chat here
probably i'm also want to see about how
much the delay is so i'm going to i'm
going to what i'm going to do is I'm
going to make a very obvious gesture
which I can then see myself do because
I've got a view of that YouTube stream
and I can count about how long that test
it so what I'm going to do is I'm going
to put my arms above my head like this
now i'm going to count one one-thousand
two one-thousand three one-thousand four
one-thousand five one-thousand six one
thousand seven 1008 1910 1010 second
delay so you're seeing me about 10
seconds after live what is the keyboard
shortcut to comment multiple lines in p5
j/s well I assume you mean the p5 jas
desktop editor obviously you can program
java script using any number of
environments you can just open up
sublime text you there's web editors you
can
use but if you're using the desktop
editor i believe it is command slash ok
so i'm going to asked about 3d models in
processing how do you import a 3d model
into processing i'm going the processing
website and i'm going to that you can't
see this i'm about to hook up so you can
see my laptop but I this was just a test
of equipment I'm going to the library's
page see I have a laptop here you can
see a 3d geometry maybe well there is
actually the you can use P shape the P
shape object will load an obj but there
is also there was an obj yeah obj obj
there is a lot for processing you could
look into I was one question in the chat
you need a library probably do that okay
we're looking here oops I have audio
coming here just bought kinect okay
here's another question I'm answering
just bought kinect version to any
suggestions about opencv and connect
version 2 with CP c++ well i have not
probably the right person to answer that
question but I would certainly recommend
looking into using openframeworks so
openframeworks is a c++ framework for
creative coding it's amazing for do it
if you want to work in c++ and one of
the great things about working in c++
it's kind of native immediate access to
a lot of computer vision libraries that
are written in C++ and so open CV and
connect stuff you can kind of do it all
with that so that's what I would
recommend okay next question how do you
feel about Jamie Allen getting a PhD
well completely against phd's as a
philosophical stance but Jamie Allen is
a wonderful person and if he wants to
get a PhD then I I will make an
exception here and think that sounds
like a wonderful idea recommended
readings on genetic algorithms ok that's
a good
so I probably started one of the first
things first places I encountered
genetic algorithms is in the book the
computational beauty of nature by flake
is the last name of the author I Gary
flake maybe William flake I think it's
Gary flake they're awfully here because
on the nature of code calm I believe I
have a page under / book which is
further reading and their evolutionary
design by computers is a good reference
Peter Bentley I'm sure I have a
computational beauty of nature here on
this page another something that I'm
thinking of is the yet Carl Sims papers
there's to siggraph papers artificial
evolution for computer graphics and
evolving virtual creatures these are
both great references to look at ok next
question this is fun it's just like
question-and-answer session ok there's
no more I answered all the questions I
said so the next thing I'm going to do
I'm he is I'm gonna probably turn this
off in a minute I'm going to hook up my
laptop to see if i can get my laptop
feed going into the live stream might
sort of move these lights around a
little bit so unless shadowy i might get
a whiteboard but ultimately next week my
plan is to start doing regularly
scheduled live broadcasts Tuesdays and
Fridays twice a week I have a list of
i'm going to paste this into the chat i
have a list of i have a markdown file
here and pasting this in this is my list
of sort of topics i'm looking to do one
of the first things i want to do is a
whole set of tutorials on just git and
github for the and really without source
code or programming involved whatsoever
so what does it mean to write a poem and
then have that poem sort of exists in
the world of git and github so that's
one of the first things I want to do is
a set of tutorials I was just rambling
more people would ask questions but I
don't think there are somehow there's 18
people watching this which is kind of
amazing
MIT somebody somebody else posts that
another genetic algorithm reference is
an MIT tutorial okay I got to get put a
to get a desk in here this a little bit
higher so I not like bending down to
look at this laptop okay this was an
eight-minute broadcast I've kind of
enjoyed this but I see no reason to
continue that somebody has an idea I
know that you're ten seconds behind me
so I'm gonna wait about 10 seconds to
see if there's any more questions are
those going to turn this off and hope to
be back relatively soon with maybe an
actual lesson where I will then be able
to switch from me talking to you seeing
my laptop screen and well i'll do i'll
pick some programming problem to do it's
kind of a test lesson okay thanks
everybody for watching from this secret
location I've been an underground bunker
walls it but I look forward to talking
more about this location that I'm in and
I'm very excited to spend some time at
and and making more video tutorials okay
ah Zack Lieberman hello nice to see you
christopher aki can i tap-danced I
actually could not tap dance I could try
the tap dance but I'm not going to okay
alright so I'm I don't I forget how to
turn this off I have to figure out how
to do that I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna
give you guys a little clue into what
i'm doing here so right now i'm on a
laptop here I've got a view into my zoom
into this maybe you can see it hello
oh there we go I have a big red button
here I don't know if you can see this
when I click this red button it should
turn off the stream but then that took
me a few more seconds I'll check to see
if there's any more questions oops where
am I here looks pretty dark yes I am
hoping to purchase or acquire some LED
lighting that I'm going to use right now
there's just some clip lights in the
underground bunker so it is dark there's
a shadow I also need to fiddle with the
camera white balance aperture I don't
know any of this stuff pathetic but I
had a fiddle with it it's a camera it
has dials and buttons I will press those
and turn those to see if I can make it
look better okay that's definitely the
end I'm going to do my dramatic clicking
of the button I'm going to click this
button over here which will turn off the
stream and I will be back tweet at me if
you have any ideas for something I might
answer or do later today okay goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
