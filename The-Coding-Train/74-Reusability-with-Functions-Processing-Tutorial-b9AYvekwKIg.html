concept of reusability with the function
so we're looking at functions with
arguments before we maybe thought okay
so let's do this back up for a second
let's look at the scenario that we're
going to present to ourselves which is
over here
hello okay so here's our scenario we
have a nice little processing sketch if
you look up here we've got set up we've
got draw draws all this code we're using
begin shape and shapes sending a bunch
of vertices are all hard-coded and we're
getting this star pattern so we see this
lovely star that's being drawn so we
work this out and we know from the last
video that I could say okay let's take
all this code oops ah come on I can do
it I can do it I think all this good I
got it I got it and I could make a
function called star I could put it all
in that function and then I could call
star phone draw so we now this is
modularity we took all that code that
has to do with your own you star and we
put it there up but I want a second star
okay so let me get a second star two
stars coming right up well it is drawing
the star twice with drawing it in
exactly the same place in exactly the
same size with exactly the same color
we don't have reusability this function
can't be reused in an effective way it
can only be used once how do we make
something reusable well let me ask you
this question when you want to draw a
rectangle on the screen you just say
this no you do not you give it arguments
you say I want to write 10 like this X
with this Y with this width
I don't know what I'm doing here with
this width and this height too we want
to be able to do the same thing with
star we want to say I want a star at
this location 100 100 I want to be able
to draw a star with these arguments I
could add a color to liquid I
sighs to it etc etc but I want to draw a
straw straw the star with these
arguments okay so how do we do that well
we know the way we define a function is
return type function name followed by
parentheses followed by open curly
bracket and good racket so we know this
star function has no return type
so it's void we know the name of the
star function is the word star now we
have a big open question here what do we
put in there look at this this is how we
are asking to call the star function we
are saying I want to give the star in X
location I want to give the start of
wahi location how do we give it to them
well interestingly enough remember a few
videos back and hopefully there's some
automatic way eventually they can be
able to click write to this video and
talk about variable scope local
variables sometimes we need a variable
only for the purpose of a certain block
of code this is a case arguments to a
function are local variables only to be
used for this kinds of the H&amp;amp;K receiving
this is a kind of messed us up we're
just going with it
arguments to a function or local
variables local to the use of us of a
function we want to send this value 100
into a local variable here how do we do
that we actually declare a variable with
a type and a name we declare a variable
X with a type float comma add a variable
Y with type float as many as we want
here as few from 0 all the way to as
many as we can sort of practically
handle so what happens this value 100 it
makes its way all the way up here and
goes into X it says if we wrote right
here float x equals 100 it says if we
wrote float y equals 100 this star
function now can receive values stored
in these variables just for use locally
throughout the star function so I could
say something like
texts and X comma Y I could say
something like vertex at X plus 50 y
minus 20 so I could start assigning
vertices obviously I would need begin
shape and then shape it all the color
all the replicas I could start defining
vertices according to these arguments
that have been received from the calling
area so we are passing these values they
are going into these local variables the
functions arguments x and y which can
then be used throughout the function
let's look at how we would actually do
that in this in this example right here
now because it would take me a little
while this star shape is complex enough
that I would I need to set all the
vertices relative to an x and y variable
I have that already sort of prepared
it's like a cooking show where you know
we've mixed all the ingredients we'll
take a half an hour to cook it so the
whelen just pull pull it magic from the
oven it's not like a cooking show at all
is it whatever okay so here we go and we
have this program here kind of wrong
note that's the wrong one come on
Schiffman okay star function that's what
I'm looking to open we can see here I
have actually all of this code written
with a star shape being drawn relative
to X and y so I can create that star
function like this now if I run this
it's saying it doesn't know what X is
because I need to find those arguments
so look at this we now have our
processing sketch with our star function
that receives two arguments it receives
an X it receives a Y and it uses those x
and y to define where the vertices of
that star are relative to whatever
argument was passed in so now I can do
something really magical I can say give
me a star at 100 100 and give me a star
at 200 300 let's run this
look at this I now have oh it's so
beautiful I now have two stars I've
successfully implemented functions for
reusability in this processing sketch
not only do we define what it means to
draw a star but we defined it in a
flexible manner that it can receive
arguments the value 100 gets sent into X
to 107 to Y then all this code is
executed then the value 200 get sent to
X and 300 get set to Y and then all this
code is executed and we have two stars
on the screen here so here is an
exercise for you here's a couple
different exercise for you one use a
loop with this star function use a loop
to create you know a row of 10 stars or
topkapi make a whole bunch of stars on
the screen of the loop that's exercise
number one exercise number two write
this program in such a way that
everywhere I click a star would appear</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
