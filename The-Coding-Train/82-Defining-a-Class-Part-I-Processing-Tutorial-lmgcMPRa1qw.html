going to dive into the nuts and bolts
details of object-oriented programming
we're going to look at the syntax for
writing an object in our main program
and we're going to look at the syntax
for how we define a class
how does we define the template the
thing that will allow us to make objects
so what do we get is balancing ball
I haven't soccer that's too pedantic
vault nothing what I'm about to show you
is really that much better but we're
going to lose something slightly a
little bit different we've got a bubble
we're going to think about making bubble
objects come on computer we have a
bubble here is our little circle it's
floating up to the top of the screen
it's going to get to the top it's going
to stop so what do we have we wrote this
part it's much like the bouncing ball
program it's just got a bunch of
functions it has display ascend top
display draws it ascends makes it move
up top checks to see if it's at the top
and causes it to stop good this is a non
object-oriented programming ok this is a
non object-oriented program we are going
to turn it into an object-oriented
program how we going to do that ok so
first thing first we're going to sort of
look at this backwards before we can
make an object in our code we've got to
define a class but let's actually look
again at the syntax for using objects in
our code well we know the general
framework they're set up and there is
drawn set up and draw we need to first
declare a variable bubble B this is
pretty similar to something we've done
before int X this is the type this is
the name we have done something super
duper exciting here what we've done is
we've actually in our minds made an
entire new data type we've really only
looked at this idea of oh there's floats
there's in maybe if you've kind of
gotten a little fur
the processing beyond this video you
might have even made something of type P
image of type string these are objects
note the capital letter that's just the
convention lowercase here these data
types are primitive data types a
primitive data type is a data type with
just a single number of 0 will 12.3
something like that a object data type
is more complex it's a collection of
data and functions I think that's what I
talked about the previous video that was
last week when I made that you know as
you can tell by the different shirt that
I'm wearing probably not that I don't
afford the same shirt every day but
anyway um ok so here we are
bumblebee we are made a data type called
Bubble Boy already several minutes into
this video let's keep going ok now when
it comes time to go through into draw we
want to act on that bubble what do we
call that a set you want it to ascend to
the top of the window we want to display
what I said this is what is informally
known as as dot syntax we are doing
something different we are calling a
function but we are not calling a
function just willy-nilly we after
saying hey you display hey I said a top
we're saying no no this object display
this object B dot display we're calling
the function on that object so anytime
the object is B that's the variable name
the type it's a type bubble we're going
to see how we define that type in a
class in a moment we are now saying we
are acting on that we are accessing that
object through the dot we're saying B
dot that thought is like go inside and
display the go inside in a sin we're
saying send that b-but bubble B display
that bubble B this is new here's the
thing though if we were to run this code
right now I'm saying
remember it's like I don't know what
that bubble is it's no no pointer
exception
you really don't want to see
nullpointerexception spirit setting so
you could avoid them if you're at int X
semicolon we declare this variable that
was step one remember with variables
back in our variable videos what did we
forget to do we forgot to initialize
well with a with a integer we might just
say x equals 10 with an object we use
something a little bit funny
the syntax looks like this equals new
bubble new so this is something new that
we haven't seen before put something new
if it's the word new okay so this is say
what it really said if you almost
literally translated B is a new instance
of a bubble object B equals new Bo
that's what we're saying new means make
me a new object this is actually
executing something called the
constructor and we're going to see it in
a little while drawing the greens for
you that we're going to see in just a
little bit
we the constructor is the moment where
the object is born it's the birth of the
bubble object you just constructed they
should call that the birth third no that
doesn't make sense the constructor oh
yeah okay so what this is this is where
you know we're actually gonna go to the
next video in a moment but this is where
we are what we've got now is we know we
have this prop this program here that
conceptually has this bubble floating up
it has some variables and has some
functions for doing that but it's not
written in an object-oriented way this
is the guts of the bubble the guts of
the bubble is all here in the main
program we want to move the guts to a
class so that in the main program we can
actually discuss the bubble itself the
bubble object okay so we're going to
stop this video we're going to go to the
next one in the next one we're going to
write the class you know interestingly
enough you know trying to come up with
an exercise at the end of these videos
there's not really
one for here but you could save yourself
if this is what it say you know but
hopefully maybe you know something
bigger just watching these videos for
five Mike's yeah okay I need you're
watching for fun you're not that fun but
imagine that you never knew anything
about object oriented programming ever
at all in your whole life and this is
all you just learned which might be
actually be the case you're in type this
code into processing copy pasted from
the thing we have below in our magical
web video internet web automatic thing
we don't have yet and then try to decide
what would you how would you write a
programming language so that how would
you define the class for making a bubble
how would you do that where would you
put the functions where would you put
the variables how would you do that sort
of think that through because in the
next video we're going to see how it's
done in processing maybe you've just
invented an entirely new programming
language and that's an exciting thing
okay and now this is the end of this
video
