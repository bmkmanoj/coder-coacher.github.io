images in a slightly different way let's
first though
think about how we've been thinking
about them so far how have we been doing
that we have an image you know our
example is a file called frog dot jpg
can you see that I think so it's got a
frog in it and we load that image and
maybe we have a processing window and
the Frog oh my god I'm going to try draw
a frog is drawn into the window so we
take this image that we've loaded from a
file and we're drawing it into the
window another thing that we've seen is
well instead of just taking the image
and displaying it all but once what if
we look at every single pixel one at a
time let's look at this first pixel and
do something to it and set that first
pixel there let's look at that second
pixel let's do something to it and let's
set that second because their image
processing make it brighter make it
darker a threshold effect bla bla bla
all this stuff that we've been doing
here's a different way that I want to
think about what we might do with an
image in this video okay here is a
processing window what if I forgot all
about the fact that I could load images
or do anything with images and all I
doing is I'm making some kind of drawing
pattern oh maybe I wrote a program that
draws cool squiggly lines all over the
screen or maybe I wrote a program that's
a particle system and there's all these
bubbles and when I click the mouse the
bubbles float up and they bounce across
the top and then they explode into
flying stars and hearts whatever it is
whatever kind of animated geometric
design algorithmic pattern thingamabob
are that you're making you're making it
how do you decide what colors should be
in this thing
maybe you pick your favorite colors my
favorite colors are purple in pink maybe
you pick your random colors and you use
random or made Perlin noise or Gaussian
or all these crazy other ways of picking
numbers but maybe you have something
else maybe you have a database of color
you have this like file with all these
things written in it which are all the
colors that you'd like a palette so to
speak what could be that database of
color what could be that palette it
could be a source image so what if
instead of simply drawing an image or
having
one-two-one every pixel pixel every
pixel pixel I just had an independent
drawing system from which I am pulling
colors from an image how do we make that
work
so this is what I want to start to do
and I want to build a couple little
quick examples to see how this might
work so let's go back over I hope I'm
recording oh great let's go back over
here over to the code
oops you could see my laptop all secrets
are revealed okay hopefully that's
better um by the way I have this watch
this
whoa can you hear that just like
hydraulic desk okay alright so you know
we've got to take some minutes here to
enjoy the the small wonderful little
things in life okay so here's a
processing sketch it loads an image it
draws the image and that's what it does
now let's think about some other things
we might do in a processing sketch like
let's say I make a bat black background
at the beginning and what I'm going to
do is I'm going to draw a circle
somewhere in the window instead here's
my independent drawing system
how should I pick my colors maybe I'll
pick my colors from the Frog but let's
make this a little bit more interesting
let's at least every time we run through
draw let's draw a circle at a different
location so now if we run this we can
see every time through draw I'm not
erasing the background I'm drawing a new
circle drawing a new circle I'm drawing
a new circle and we could say we could
we could we could take ourselves up on
this challenge and say what are my
favorite colors my favorite colors are
you know some sort of purplish color now
I'm drawing Kidd purplish I could say
actually what I wanted is it to be a
random color now I'm drawing them
somewhat randomly now let's do something
finally different what if I were to say
give me a color from the Frog look at
this little bit of code here
the get function now here's a moment I
don't remember what I did in the
previous videos I wish I did but in the
previous video certainly we were
accessing the pixel array we were saying
we were saying we would say something of
this frog dot pixels and then the pixels
index and maybe that index would be an X
plus y times the width right this we
spent we certainly spent all this time
trying to make figure out how this
algorithm works right there's a two
dimensional image all the pixels in that
image are in a one dimensional array if
I have an X and y coordinate I want to
look up at a pixel from that I need to
convert from the X and the y to that
single index into the array and this is
probably how we should do this example
here but just for simplicity and this is
sort of the fastest the the fastest way
of doing these pixel operations but if
you'll notice something about this
example that I'm making how many pixels
do I need to look up in draw here one
every time to draw I just want a single
pixel where am i drawing this ellipse
that single pixel here we can use the
get function get is convenient it's
maybe a little slower but in this case
it's totally fine we just need one pixel
but if I run this I'm going to get an
error the method get' expects parameters
like this int int hope this is a lovely
error message by the way this is if
you're don't not aware I mean this is
going to become quickly out of date this
video then if I say this but this is
version 3.0 a5 a lot of the error
messages have changed in recent
processing versions to make them a bit
more friendly and understandable but
what is the error here
I mean I'm able to draw an ellipse at
pixel X comma Y even though they're not
integers but while processing is a
forgiving and friendly and happy to take
your floating-point numbers and figure
out which pixel you meant on the screen
after all pixels are really integers
there's no such thing as pixel 2.5 or
3.5 I think I think we might have
covered this at some point I really
shouldn't make these videos like weeks
apart that I've no idea what I did in
the previous ones but let's think about
this if I have an image and I have a
pixel location
like 300 comma 215 these are integers
there's no pixel 215 point 2 there might
be kind of sub pixels in our mind and
fancy ways of thinking about this but we
need an integer even if I say ellipse
300 point 5 we're processing is really
going to draw that ellipse it's going to
just take off that decimal place and
draw it at 300 and however with the get
function with the pixel array we have to
really enforce that use of integer so
I'm going to vary an easy way for me to
do this is to simply convert these
values into integers before I ask for
that pixel color and I'm going to do
this we can see oh if only we could just
sit here and wait for a long period of
time maybe we would see our frog so in
my mistakes I stopped and pause the
video and I've returned I actually left
this run for a while which was a good
result which you can start to see that
that image of the Frog kind of peering
through here so we've what we've done is
we're not displaying the image anywhere
we're simply loading it into memory we
cream up with some weird idea which is
like let's just draw circles all over
the screen and then we picked colors out
of the we pick colors out of that image
we essentially that image became a
lookup table a database of color by
which we wherever we drew a circle we
looked up the corresponding color at
that in that location in the image and
drew it there so let's just do a couple
more things to this one is I'm going to
take out the stroke and then I'm also
going to just to make this happen faster
if I put a little loop in draw I can say
like oh just do one hundred at a time so
now we can see now we can see that we're
just like layering 100 random circles
with colors every frame and and you can
sort of see the quality here is kind of
different it has this the resolution is
not very high but you can see all these
circles are picking up the colors from
the image and another thing we might do
is just add a little alpha here
so if I give it an alpha value of 25 you
can see that now these colors are going
to slowly blend in over
time and you get this kind of watery
like appearance and and if you know I've
kind of addicted to doing this if I had
to do 500 circles per frame it's going
to be much much faster and you might
even see almost as if we have this kind
of shimmering version of a frog so this
is one example I kind of let's let me
save this and let me go to a different
sketch you know there's there's not much
different about this sketch other than
instead of simply randomly placing a
circle on the screen each frame this is
their particle objects they move
randomly about and while they're moving
there's no reason why I couldn't say
like okay well we're here where I
display it I'm making them white why
don't I pull up wherever this frog is
this frog this ellipse is going to be
drawn at X comma Y why don't I before I
draw it wherever it is look up the pixel
underneath in that image so if I go back
and actually I need to load the image I
already have it in the data folder I did
that before JPEG and let's go back to
this crucial right let me put this in
here
255 we can see there are my white
circles
now let me instead say see the color
from the frog and you can see wherever
it is it's sort of revealing the color
that's underneath it in that image now
we can't make out the frog at all I
could say like okay well what if I
instead of having 2000 made 3000 circles
and you can see like oh you can sort of
see how that frog is kind of being
revealed as these circles move around I
could start to do things like okay well
let's uh let's give it some alpha and if
I do that you can see like it's like
much dimmer but what if instead of
drawing the background every frame I
move the background back into setup and
you can see oh I'm like painting the
frog now
as these particles move about and I had
so many on the screen I wonder if this
would have been a slightly more
effective demonstration with only 100
you can see how these are moving around
and we're kind of they're kind of
streaking and painting so again I
haven't picked two very creative ideas I
just said okay well why don't I randomly
put circles on the screen or why don't I
randomly move circles around the screen
but you could come up with a much more
elaborate set of behaviors things
bouncing into each other swirling around
and spiral patterns things that aren't
just circles streaks of lines could you
make out kind of like what kind of
painterly non-photorealistic rendering
techniques might you be able to generate
by layering shapes with different alphas
what if you use like images like other
images that you're tinting is there like
smearing across there's so many
possibilities but I will leave you with
a couple exercises one is if as soon as
I have some system where you could find
these code examples although they're
mostly the same as in the in learning
processing chapter 15 let me give you a
couple exercises one is change these
from using get to using the pixel array
just as a kind of practice between get
and the pixel array and seeing the
difference another thing you might think
about is this one that this particle one
that we just made these particles are
moving and they're their color is
adapting to their location according to
the image but what if you drew the
entire image as a set of particles and
then the particles started moving but
they took their pixel color with it with
them so could you make an image can fall
apart and then could it put itself back
together so that's certainly a
challenging problem but one that you
might think of in terms of like
practicing all of these techniques and
and the last one that I'll mention I
think which is worth which is one of the
examples here is you might think about
what this would mean in three dimensions
so if I went I'm open up this example
and I hope this works I think it's just
using a sunflower it's very low but you
can see here we have this image which is
actually drawn as a bunch of rectangles
and I'm ooh
being those pixels in a
three-dimensional space according to
their brightness so this is another
thing you might think about what if you
had if you took a 2-dimensional image
and brought it into 3d could you could
you have a pick a kind of like 3d
3-dimensional space of pixels that are
all moving around each other okay so you
will write some comments or email me or
tweet at me I guess and I will provide
some solutions to some of these
exercises or answer questions or post on
the forum I don't know there's got to be
some better way of being in touch with
each other than be just spouting to a
camera with a screen behind me but for
now I'm going to go this video I meant
to time it it's I don't know it's been a
while
