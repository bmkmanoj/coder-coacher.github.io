trigonometry I hope you're excited about
that okay we said before what what
trigonometry is it is the study of the
relationships between the angles and
sides of a right triangle now if you
ever took some type of geometry class or
some sort of maybe in high school you
learned about trigonometry you might
have learned this very odd and strange
pneumonic device so kah Toa now I'm not
sure how much that really helps you
because it's kind of hard to remember
just that but if you could remember
sohcahtoa then you can remember sine
cosine and tangent so what I want to
first do in that in this video is to
review what sine means what cosine means
what tangent means and we're going to
see how those can be applied in some
scenarios particularly when we want to
draw something on the screen in terms of
something called polar coordinates we're
gonna look at this thing called polar
coordinates we we always draw things in
Cartesian coordinates there's this X Y
location there's this width there's this
height we're going to think about polar
coordinates so sohcahtoa what does that
mean well let's say we have a right
triangle that means a triangle with an
angle that's 90 degrees a right angle
right over here pi divided by 2 and
there is some angle here now often
angles are written into the world of
notation as the Greek letter theta so
you might even see in some code examples
float theta equals or you could always
say float angle equals obviously good
name variables whatever you want but
theta is a common symbol or term for an
angle okay so we have this angle theta
and this side of the triangle this is
the opposite side
here's an opposite from the angle this
is the adjacent side it is adjacent to
the angle and this is the hypotenuse
okay so here's our right triangle angle
adjacent opposite hypotenuse okay what
is sine sine is opposite divided by
hypotenuse so sine of theta is opposite
divided by hypotenuse what
co-sign adjacent / hypotenuse cosine of
phase is adjacent / hypotenuse and
tangent of theta is opposite / adjacent
so these formulas come up again and
again in many different scenarios a one
scenario in particular that we're going
to look at not in this video is a
swinging pendulum if you think this is a
pendulum this is the force of gravity on
the pendulum pointing down but this is
the direction of that the pendulum is
going to move you can see we've made a
right triangle here we need the force of
the pendulum which is a kaput so we're
going to do lots of stuff there's gonna
be lots of diagrams involved in things
that we're going to make that suddenly
have a right triangle in them and we
have to say oh we know this side of the
triangle but not this side oh and we
know the angle or we know the sides that
we don't know the angle right different
scenarios we're going to know different
things and if we know the sides we can
get the angle if we know the angle we
can get the sides etc etc so that's
what's going to come up again and again
one scenario that I want to look at in
this video this hopefully less than ten
minute video is looking at polar
coordinates polar coordinates is a place
for us to use the basics of trigonometry
in a sketch okay so what do I mean by
polar coordinates so let's say we have a
Cartesian coordinate space now I'm going
to draw a traditional one not a
processing window but we'll map that in
a moment to a code example within a
processing window so this is a
two-dimensional a Cartesian space okay
two-dimensional space now we might have
we have an x axis we have a y axis we
could say hey this is the point 1 2 3 4
5 1 2 3 400 oh right this is the point 5
comma 4 that's its Cartesian coordinate
it has an X of 5 a y o4 so everything in
this space we could think of in terms of
what's the text value negative 3
negative 4 negative 5 4 right of its X&amp;amp;Y
a polar
it is a different way of thinking about
a location in two-dimensional space
instead of describing an x and a y that
is Cartesian a polar coordinate
describes an R and a theta what do we
mean by that an R and a theta so you can
get anywhere on the screen by saying hey
go to this X and go to this Y or you
could say rotate by this angle and go to
this radius right so this is a way of
thinking about locations on the screen
now here's the problem what in
processing if I go to say hey let's draw
a circle somewhere I can't say R comma
theta right Processing's drawing
functions point vertex ellipse line rec
they only accept Cartesian coordinates
so if we want to think sometimes we want
to think in terms of polar coordinates
right when would we want to think in
terms of polar coordinates what if we
want our motion to move like this well
that could just be changing the angle
instead of saying X plus plus like X
plus plus moves this way angle plus plus
would rotate the object R plus plus or
bar angle rotating and like what if we
want to do a spiral if the radius
shrinks while we're rotating that's a
spiral pattern so we could get spiral
motion very easily by thinking in terms
of polar coordinates but then how do we
draw a polar coordinates how do we set
something at a polar coordinate well
let's look at how we're going to do that
let's say we know something is at a
particular theta with a particular R so
this is my polar coordinate R comma
theta well this is the Y value and this
is the x value boy did I draw that
terribly we could make a right triangle
the Cartesian coordinate is X comma Y if
we know R comma theta how could we get X
comma Y well what is sine of theta in
this instant sine of theta is
opposite over hypotenuse opposite is y
hypotenuse azar Y divided by R cosine of
theta is adjacent which is X divided by
R X divided by R okay now we're really
this is a super exciting okay what's
happening here we could solve for X or Y
so easily right I know if you were like
doing stuff with equations but if you
like doing stuff with equations you can
see here just multiply each side of the
equation by our right Y is actually
equal to R times sine of theta X is
equal to R times cosine of theta right
if I multiply this side of the equation
by r the RS cancel each other out and I
have y equals R times sine theta so this
is a formula this formula right here
this simple simple formula says if I
know the R the radius and angle of a
polar coordinate I know the Y if I and I
know the radius and angle at polar
coordinate I know the X so we could
think in terms of polar coordinates and
draw in terms of Cartesian coordinates
and that opens up a lot of possibilities
so let's take a look at an actual
example that does this over here okay
hello again now we're over here okay so
let's just say we're going to have some
global variable called RR in this case
let's say it's going to be 50 and we're
going to have some angle I'm just going
to call it a which is going to be 0
stupid page oh okay now I'm going to
make a forgot to draw stuff here a black
background and I'm going to translate
just for to the center of the window
because I think that'll be simplest and
then I'm going to draw a circle I can't
draw it at R comma theta I'm a draw it
at something called X comma Y so now how
do I get X comma Y I know R and angle I
want x and y remember formula right over
there
x equals R times cosine of the angle y
equals R times sine of the angle so now
that we've done that I don't know make
sure our circle is white Oh what did I
we need to declare these variables oh
I'm it's not over here ah sorry just
typing for a little while
sorry about that this one's going to
have to be fixed but I'm going to just
keep going so we have a little circle
now you know radius is only 50 which
isn't that far let's actually draw a
line just so we can see that line also
so we can see there is our let's make
the radius a little bit bigger right
there is our object at a polar
coordinate so it's a radius of 150 and a
angle of 0 what if I change the angle 2
pi divided by 4 there we can see it's a
45 45 degrees rotated and what if I do
something like say hey let's apply
angular velocity angular acceleration
lets all those rules of angular uh oops
all those rules that we use before we
can apply here now we have this world
like you're swinging something super
exciting in the air so ok so what have
we got here look this looks strangely
oddly like the just and I'm going to I'm
going to use a constrain here to limit
angular velocity between zero and just
say 1 that's probably too big anyway but
so what's interesting about this example
is this looks remarkably familiar it
looks kind of like the example we just
did this is just we could use translate
rotate to create this exact same effect
but here we chose let's actually we want
to kind of be in charge of the XY
positions of objects we don't want to
just let translate and rotate in the
transformations do it for us we're using
math polar to Cartesian coordinate
transformations different scenarios
require different options it's a nice to
be able to kind of do both of them and
that was kind of an insane
uh Lee hot large acceleration for me to
constrain to okay so as an exercise what
I would suggest for you to do is try to
think of some type of pattern a spiral
pattern is a good one but if you were to
what happens if our changes by Perlin
noise what happens if the angle changes
by Perlin noise what if you shrink the
angle grow the angle how could you
create some type of motion path that is
different from just like moving in a
perfect circle
what what what ways could you vary our
and vary the angle to create different
kinds of motion that you couldn't do so
easily with just moving an object's
position around okay so I think we're in
good shape now we understand
trigonometry the next thing we're going
to do in the next video is see how sine
and cosine how the properties of those
functions can map to oscillating motion
to wave patterns okay great good bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
