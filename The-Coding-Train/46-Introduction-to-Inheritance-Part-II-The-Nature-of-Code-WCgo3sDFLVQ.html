everything there is to know most
everything there is to know about
inheritance we learned that we could
write a class and then we could write
another class that extends that class
thereby inheriting all the variables
inheriting all of the functions and then
we could you know modify it we could add
some of our own variables we could
change our function by overriding it we
could do a bunch of things now what I
want to do is apply this way of thinking
to our particle system example so here
is our particle system example it's a
simple program and as a particle system
class which manages an ArrayList of
particle objects the particle objects
are these little simple entities that
have a location velocity acceleration
and then they fall with gravity and
there you are you see them there on the
screen so what we want to do is say
let's I'm gonna do something totally
crazy it's not crazy actually it's not
crazy at all I'm gonna do something
incredibly simple let's do the simplest
thing we could possibly do with
inheritance let's write a new particle
class the only thing that's different is
it draws them as a square instead of a
circle okay so we're gonna make a new
tab we're gonna call it square particle
and we'll say class square particle and
now instead of typing all of the stuff
that we would normally have to add and
we need an update method and display
method and we need all these vectors and
we know this if we're just gonna say hey
we extend particle we just inherit
everything that a particle has to offer
a square particle also has to offer but
we want to change one thing we just want
to override the display method instead
of I'm gonna just add some stroke and
fill instead of a circle and with some
size and we'll say rect but Center right
we're just adding in a bunch of stuff to
change a draw it as a rectangle this is
totally legitimate we now have you know
if you look at the particle class
there's all this code all this stuff we
don't need any of it all we need to say
is let's draw it as a rectangle instead
thing is you did forget one thing
it's kind of an important thing and we
didn't cover it in the previous video
because you know the constructor is
always a source of confusion and in
object-oriented programming but here
let's take a moment a deep breath and
let's figure out how do we write the
constructor for the square particle well
let's for a moment go back and look at
how the constructor is written for the
regular particle the constructor
receives a P vector that's the objects
flow gets the particles location where
it is born and it makes an acceleration
and it makes a velocity and as a
lifespan so it does all this stuff III
have something to say I want our square
particle to basically be the same
there's no reason to make the square
particle any differently I just want to
display it in a different way
so our square particle is going to be
the same how do we inherit a constructor
well it turns out that we do always have
to write the constructor and I can say
square particle P vector L which is if
you notice exactly the same is the
signature for the particle constructor
but what I can say is super L I can
execute this constructor in the parent
class with the keyword super and then I
can give it the same arguments so if I
got this P vector argument I want to
call the super Parrott constructor with
the argument L so this square particle
now is going to be born in exactly the
same way that a particle is bored I'm
talking in terms of birth but that's
that's what the constructor really is
it's the moment of creation it's when
the when the object is created so now
that we'd have this hopefully we didn't
make any mistakes I could hit run
compiles it runs and we see our
particles there it's the same but let's
go look at our particle system class and
let's just change one thing instead of
when I add a particle adding a regular
particle I'm now going to add a square
particle and I'm going to run this whoa
there it is I see square particles
change it back to particle I see
circular particles this is pretty
magical look at this code there's
nothing there just a new display method
this is really powerful there's so much
that you can do what's so powerful about
it that you realize is if you build an
elaborate physics engine you you could
basically make that a library for
yourself and every single object you
ever make has the physics engine
embedded into it by just extending this
kind of parent body mover particle clasp
so this is incredibly powerful now a
funny thing has happened that you might
I'm like shocked that this is only
button five five minutes into this video
and I'm gonna end it in a second but a
funny thing has happened here notice
that I change this to square particle
and it runs but my ArrayList still just
has particles in it so this is something
we haven't covered yet and it's called
polymorphism and it's what the next
video is going to be about but what I'm
gonna give what I would say to you is an
exercise now if you're kind of falling
as long and trying to do an exercise
with each one what you should do is try
to make your own child particle class do
something a little bit fancier maybe add
I got it angular motion to it so that it
spins as it's moving maybe add you know
the behavior slightly different does it
actually move in a slightly different
way how could you inherit everything but
modify that particle class so work on
that see if you can write and if you're
following along that the particle system
example need a better way of organizing
all this stuff is the one that you can
modify that I think is is is 4.3 so if
you're looking at the examples in nature
code GoGet example 4.3 find that
particle class extend it and see what
you can make and the next video we're
kind of going to inspect this missing
piece of why it is why it is that we can
somehow refer to this square particle as
a plane particle or a square particle
and it seems to work and that's going to
be the topic of the next video six and a
half minutes that's amazing okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
