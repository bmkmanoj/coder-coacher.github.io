challenge this one is a follow up on a
previous the previous fractal tree
coding challenge one of the first things
that people often ask me when they first
see a fractal tree is oh I want it to
grow from the bottom so how do you have
it grow from the bottom this is also the
same question as oh I want to put leaves
on it and then have the leaves fall so
while the fractal demonstration I did in
the previous video is a good
demonstration and a useful technique you
might need a different way of creating
the tree to be able to do more types of
animation like things with it and that
the way of doing that is to rather than
draw the tree all at once in a recursive
function is to actually build the tree
out of objects so what I need in the
tree that's over here I'll just use this
as my reference is I want to create an
object that's a branch object and the
branch object only needs two things it
needs a start point and an end point and
a display function that just draws
itself there so let's look and I'm going
to build from the previous code and I'm
going to just from scratch take the
previous code which draws this fractal
tree and change it into something that
uses an object object branch objects and
an array okay so let me go back to the
code and here we are and the one of the
first things I'm going to do actually is
just create a new JavaScript file I'm
using the atom editor with the p5.js
JavaScript framework but there's lots of
different ways you could program this
and I'm going to say new file and I'm
going to call this new file branch dot
j/s and then I'm going to go into index
dot HTML and make sure I include a
reference to branch j/s so now I have
two JavaScript files I can work with and
what I'm going to do in branch is is I'm
going to write a constructor function
called branch and what branch needs is
when you create a branch it needs a
start and an end there's actually
different ways of doing this which we'll
see later and I'm just going to call on
I'm going to say this dot start equals
start and this dot end equals end so the
first thing I need to do now start so
one of the things that often happens
which one of these is colored weirdly
start is so it looks like start is maybe
a keyword in JavaScript for something
else it shouldn't really
here but I'm just going to call this
then beginning begin and end just to
kind of get get away from that okay so
that's the branch a branch object and I
know I could use like a some you were
like watching this doing oh maybe you
should use a javascript object literal
and I could do that too but I'm kind of
using this constructor function because
I'm going to add more to it you'll see
hopefully later well that's kind of a
what another way of doing it that could
be useful so I'm going to go back to the
code and right here
when I first call this branch function
what happened in the in the first
program is I translate to the bottom
call the branch function which draws a
line but instead what I want to do is
say I'm going to make a I'm going to
make something called or I'm going to
make a variable called root which is the
root of the tree and I'm going to say
it's a new branch which goes from where
the center of the screen with divided by
two to where like the width divided by
two height oh so so I'm doing stuff and
just programming and like I got lost in
my thoughts for a second you know what I
really need is interestingly enough
let's go back and look at this I said oh
there's just two things involved in this
branch a beginning and an end but what
are those things the beginning and the
end
those things are points with an X and a
Y and one way that I can store a point
in a job in P 5gs is using a vector
object a p5 vector object which is an
object that has its own x and a y so
what I'm actually going to do is I'm
going to say I'm going to be very
long-winded about this just to be quite
explicit and say a equals create vector
and I'm going to make a vector that's at
the bottom of the window with divided by
2 comma height and then I'm going to say
B is a vector that is also in the middle
but not at the bottom it's at the bottom
minus this length or 100-100 and then
I'm going to make a branch which is goes
from A to B and then what I want to do
actually don't need this whole recursive
function anymore
and oh this should be in setup by the
way and I'm going to I'm going to get
rid of this slider we can come
using a slider later because I'm
starting from scratch and in draw I'm
gonna say root dot show what I want to
do is take that oh and this should this
needs to be a global variable so what
I'm trying to demonstrate right now is I
can make a single branch object which is
just the root of the tree and I can
display that root and so I need a
function called show and so I'm going to
add a function called show and all that
show does is stroke 255 draw a line from
this stop beginning dot X this stuff
beginning dot Y to this end X this n dot
y so you're going to see here that a
branch sorry a branch is just an object
that has a beginning and an end point
and it's displayed as a line between
those two points so now if I come back
to here and run this again you can see
there's our first print so we kind of
double back we're doing the same thing
we did before but in a different way
okay so let's think about now now here's
the thing what I need is for every
branch to spawn two branch objects
attached to it hmm how are we going to
do that so one thing I need actually is
I going to have more than one branch so
I need an array so I can what what the
tree essentially is I don't need this
root anymore I'm going to say I'm going
to make a variable called tree and tree
is just an array so it's an empty array
and then this root is the first thing
that goes in the tree and then and I
know that camera just went off while in
the middle of my typing I'm going to put
it back on in the middle of what I'm
going to do is then draw all of the
trees so now my structure is I have an
empty array I create the root of the
tree I put the root in the array and
then I display the array and once again
oh but by missing a curly bracket
once again I still have that one root
now now comes the time where I can
attach to that root two more branches so
how can I do that well one way that I
could do that would be to add a function
this branch object what is this branch
object how to function within itself
that would new where its end is and new
how to spawn two more branches from that
end so let's look at that so I'm going
to go back to this branch object and I'm
going to write a function called and I'm
actually just going to call it a branch
I don't know if I have a naming conflict
anywhere I'm going to write a function
called branch and what that function is
going to do is it is going to create two
additional branch objects attached to
this branch object so how do I do that
so so I'm going to call it the right
branch is a new branch I hear voices
somebody might be coming who knows
there's something there I don't know I
lost my I started think about West Side
Story one of my favorite musicals simply
people here hurt and I lost my train of
thought okay I need to make a branch ah
so where does the let's think about I
need a diagram let me come over here
okay so if I erase this diagram how am i
doing this I have this branch this is
begin this is n now I need a new branch
so this new branch its begin point is
the previous end point and now and then
I need to calculate where is it new
where is its new end point and the way
that I might do that is by rotating this
line so I'm going to need to use some
trigonometry in math for that okay we're
going to get there we're gonna get there
boy this is hard to do without having
just done it you know like just to do
this from scratch on the fly okay okay
so let's see new branch so what I want
to do
is the new branch is going to start at
the previous branches end and now I need
to fill in where it ends so how can I do
that
well one thing I can do is I can make a
vector that is the direction of this
particular branch right I need it what
if I have a vector that points from here
to there a vector being an arrow that
points from here to there and the way
that I can make that vector is by taking
this point and subtracting this point so
I want to create a direction vector and
say p5 dot vector dot subtract I want to
subtract the end from the beginning so
now I have a vector that points from the
bottom to the top of that branch and one
of the nice things about vectors is they
actually have a rotate function built it
to them so what if I were to rotate that
vector by some angle like 45 degrees or
PI divided by 4 and then what if I were
to create a new endpoint new end and I
would say the new end point is where it
is add the endpoint of the previous
vector with the direction so in other
words what I'm saying is we come back
over here again is I now have this
vector wrong wrong side of this pen I
now have this vector ok and then what I
want to do is take this vector and
rotate it by 45 degrees and then I want
to add this vector here so this is the
new endpoint so this is the beginning
and this is the endpoint and that's my
branch so now I can say the new branch
goes from this dot end to the new end
that's to the right
okay so let's see how this works so let
me now go back to the main program and
I'm going to say I'm going to say a new
branch equals root branch Oh what am i I
need to do something so once I have that
new branch I need to return it so I need
to return it so that I can get it and
and then what I can do is say tree index
1 equals new branch so the zero index of
the array is the root and then the next
spot in the array is this new branch
that came out of the root perfect look
now I have both of those now I could
probably cleverly create both of them in
this function and then return both of
them as an array and then add both of
them but I'm actually just going to do
I'm just going to call this function
branch a I'm gonna do something kind of
lazy and just make a function branch B
and rotate the other direction and you
know I'm just going to call this V or B
this is to the right and this is to the
left so I'm just going to have to again
you know good programming exercise for
you it is like how can you combine this
into one function maybe you just pass in
the angle but just to be lazy and
explicit for a second I'm just going to
have these duplicate functions the only
thing is different is one is rotating to
the right one is rotating to the left
and I can go back sorry I can go back to
the main program and I can say branch a
and I'm actually just going to combine
this a tree index one is branch a and
tree index 2 is root branch B so now you
can see this particular branch has two
branches attached to it okay things are
going well now now one thing that I want
to do is remember I want to shrink the
branches each time they're attached so
let's go back into this function here
this direction vector should also be
multiplied by 0.67 in order to shrink it
a little bit and now you can see that it
is now
Runk so what I have now is I create a
single branch object and it spawns to
other branches I need a mechanism for
then having those two other branches
spawn two more branches and two more
branches and maybe what I'll do is every
time I click the mouse I add two more
branches so let's figure out how we
would do that so let me go to sketch and
I'm going to take this out and I'm just
going to say function mousepressed
global and and put this here so in Mouse
press them and add those two branches so
now two branches click the mouse o root
is not defined so I'm going to say tree
the thing that's global is the array
tree index 0 tree index 0 so I'm going
to add those two branches and now I'm
gonna click the mouse two branches there
we go ok so I'm getting somewhere I'm
getting somewhere
now I have this ability to take an
existing element of the array and add to
it so what I really want to do is not do
it manually like this but what I want to
say is hey anything that's in the array
there are some number of branches in the
array what I want to do for everything
that's in the array I want to tree at so
one way to add something to raise with
the push function I want to add tree
index index I branch a and tree index I
branch B so this is now an automatic way
of saying whatever is in the array
currently go through everything in the
array and add to the array with branches
from the things that are the iraq now
there are some problems here problem
number one is if i'm trying to loop
through an array like I'm looping here
so here's the beginning of the right
here's the event end of the array and
I'm looping through it and I'm adding
things to it so as I'm going through the
array the array is growing I'm never
going to get to the end so one way to
solve this would be to say to actually
start from the end of the array and go
down to 0
this way I can add things to the like
I'm going backwards through the array
and new things can get added to the end
that will then get ignored so this
should actually work and I'm going to
run this you can see I can click and
then I can click and then I can click
and then I can click so that's actually
happening now each time I click
everything that's in the array gets two
extra branches but one thing that you
might not be noticing here is that this
particular root has been there every
single cycle so every time I go through
that or right it gets to new branches so
there are multiple multiple new branches
being added over and over again in the
same spot which is very unnecessary so
one thing that I think would be useful
to do is in the branch object
I could add a variable like I'm gonna
call it grown or finish I'll just call
it finished and it's going to finish
it's going to be false and in the
branched function you know let's say I'm
just going to say this dot finished
equals true so whenever and you know
maybe I'm going to actually I since I
have this branch a and branch B I'm just
going to do it out here so I'm going to
say a tree index i dot finished equals
true so what I'm going to do is every
time a tree branches I'm going to say
finished is true and then I want to make
sure if it's if tree index I've finished
only if tree index the tree is not
finished should I actually add those
branches so now you can see every time I
click the mouse I'm adding branches now
this might not seem very exciting to you
because ultimately all I have here is
exactly what I had before but the
difference is I actually have an array
of objects and all of those objects
store their location dynamically where
they are so there's no reason why I
couldn't do weird things like in the
branch function in in in branch I could
say I'm going to write a function called
jitter and I'm going to say this dot n
dot X plus equal random negative 1 1
this n dot y plus equal random negative
1
one one so one thing I'm going to do is
I'm going to add this jitter function in
draw and I'm going to say tree show and
tree index eye jitter so now if I run
this you can see look at this it's
animating and as I click those are all
animating and shaking and doing weird
random things so I'm not suggesting this
is like a great result because I don't
know what I have here I have this random
shaking weird tree but you could imagine
what if you did something a bit more
thoughtful you were changing colors
based on some logic or maybe you were
swaying with Perlin noise or you applied
some spring forces or a physics based
system to the tree boy I really wanted
somebody remind me someday to do a video
where we take this tree and actually
attach spring forces to all of it so it
can you could sort of like pull on it
and just goes blue you know all springy
back into place or something that's
always a nice demonstration so this
opens up a lot of possibilities it also
opens up one last possibility that I
want to show you in this particular
video so I'm going to turn off the
jittering and what I'm going to do is I
am going to say I'm going to keep track
of a counter and I'm going to just every
time I'm going to say a count plus plus
and what I want to do is say if count
equals equals five so if I've generated
five generations of the tree what I want
to do is say for VAR i equals zero I is
less than tree length I plus plus what I
want to do is I'm going to make a I'm
going to make leaf objects so I want to
create an array called leaves and then
what I'm going to do is say for all of
those last branches if the and when I
get to five any branch that hasn't
branches at the end what I want to do is
make a leaf where do I want to make that
leaf I want to make the leaf
at that branch's end point and you know
what I don't even need to say create
vector because it is a vector tree index
I dot and dot copy so I want to go and
grab that end point of that branch and
make a copy of it and then I'm going to
say leaves dot push that leaf so now in
draw I can also loop through all of the
leaves and I can say now I could make
loot I should make the Leafs an object
the leaves the leat I'm going to make
some purplish leaves and I'm going to
just make them circles you can be more
creative top why
so we should get now let's run this
everyone to like zero weight one two
three four five so you see like so let's
do a couple things one is let's make
that angle where did I decide what the
angle is the angle is right here it's
kind of like hard-coded in so this by
the way would be nice to make a variable
maybe it could be slightly random that
could be the thing that's changing but
oh and I did something interesting so I
for some reason I'm going a different
angle to each side which is kind of nice
and let's go in sketch let's actually go
up to six levels and let's let's say no
stroke for the leaves and give it some
alpha also so you can see I now have
little leaves at the end of the tree and
what's exciting about this is they
aren't just circles on the screen those
are all vector objects and what I could
actually do if you go look at any of my
other nature of code tutorials I could
treat those as particles that would fall
with the wind or something like that
and just to sort of show very very
briefly what I could do right now is I
could move all the leaves by some random
amount in the y-direction so once I get
up to six you can see they're falling
now again
I have made a really trivial whoops
this is a trivial result you know I
don't I don't like necessarily that that
that doesn't look like a very nice
glowing beautiful physics movement but
you in thinking about color and thinking
about motion all sorts of possibilities
you could have the branches be swaying
you could have a gust of wind some of
the leaves fall some don't what if you
have a program where you shake the tree
and the leaves fall off and they don't
all fall off at the same time all the
possibilities are now open to you
because the the fractal wasn't drawn
through a single recursive function but
rather was drawn as a set of objects
with position vectors so all of those
things could be manipulated after the
fact thanks for watching this video if
you make something with this please let
me know and I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
