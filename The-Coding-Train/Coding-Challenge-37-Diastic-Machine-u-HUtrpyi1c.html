challenge video in this coding challenge
I'm going to implement something called
a die a stick machine so the die ask
machine is that I'm going to built here
is going to be based entirely on a
technique a die assic technique invented
and pioneered by Jackson McCloud
artists poets composer playwrights who
pioneered a lot of algorithmic chance
operate techniques with around language
to generate poetry without the use of a
computer so there's a long history of
artists and poets working with
algorithmic computational methods or to
generate language to analyze language
and this is something that it's really
easy to forget in the world of kind of
computers and learning to program that
so much of this kind of stuff can be
done manually and I encourage you to
explore ideas similar to this with
manual processes before you start to
implement them digitally as a way of
exploring and playing around you know
there's another famous example is
William Burroughs cut-up method which is
called the cut-up because it's literally
about making new texts from folding and
cutting pre-existing text and mashing
them up together which of course you
could do with the computer but you could
also do with scissors and that sort of
thing but let me get beyond that a great
reference for this by the way that I'll
also mention is a virtual music's
parents in computer poetry this is a
book that you can link both to Jackson
the globe page about Jack to the globe
as well as the virtual use a book in
this video tutorial but let me just read
to you the description of a die a stick
machine from excerpted from charles o
Hartman's book the process began with a
striking phrase from Virginia Woolf
aways ridiculous in Piccadilly this is
going to be known as the seed phrase so
in the program that I'm going to write I
need a seed phrase he reread the novel
this is referring to Jackson mcglue
looking for the first word that like
ridiculous began with an R then read the
next word following that had like
ridiculous I as a second letter then the
next third letter was d and so on until
he had spelled through the whole phrase
so if that didn't make sense to you let
me come over here and kind of diagram
this out for you so let's say surprise
surprise I have
the word rainbow and I have some text
like Ralph sat on that didn't work
actually painful burns okay
I'm designing something I'm designing
something to work precisely in a way
that I could demonstrate this so let me
look in this text for a word that starts
with our AHA Ralph let me work look in
this text for a word that has its second
letter a Sat let me look for a word that
has its third letter I not on but
painful Sat painful its fourth letter n
fer burns so you can see this idea of
taking this C phrase and finding words
in the existing body of text with just
the single letter in the same spot and
creating a new phrase out of that and
this is a way the sense of saying I want
to generate poetry but I the writer
don't want to play a sort of human being
role in it other than from selecting the
seed phrase and the source text let the
algorithm kind of do the talking so to
speak and this is I think that you as a
viewer of this video I would encourage
you reference some other examples of
this to generate your own system for
doing this and see what types of
outcomes you can get maybe you'll make a
Twitter bot from it that sort of thing
okay so coming back over here let's go
and start with I have an empty sketchier
entirely empty p5.js sketch I'm saying
no canvas because I don't want to see a
canvas I'm not drawing anything in this
and I'm going to just find this here and
you can see there's a I put a header in
the HTML file Jackson McCloud I a stick
and I don't see anything on the page so
the first thing that I need to do is I
want to get a seed phrase I'm gonna let
the user type in the seed phrase so what
I'm going to do in the HTML file is I'm
going to say make a paragraph element
and I'm going to say seed colon input ID
equals seed slash input and I'll I'll
add I'll make sure it starts with
rainbow
so now we can see I have on the page
seed and I started that with rainbow now
I need to in my program get access to
that and also I think it might make
sense for me to add a button ID equals
submit and submit will be the text of
the button so I'm adding that in so now
I have seed rainbow and I have a submit
button and I want to attach aa so now I
want to attach an event so this I have
to do in JavaScript because I now if
this is the structure of the page in
HTML and now I'm just going to affect
the behavior of the page in my
JavaScript code so I'm going to say I'm
going to save our seed equals select
seed var submit equals select submit and
submit dot mousepressed now I'm going to
do something I haven't done a lot of my
other videos I tend to stay away from
this I could just say like do the thing
and then define that function down here
but I'm going to take this as an
opportunity to show you something which
is an anonymous function I'm just going
to put the callback right in here
oh that's very awkward looking but it's
actually kind of a nice way of writing
condensed code when you click the mouse
on the submit button button button the
submit button execute this code that's
inside this anonymous function it's
anonymous because it doesn't have a name
so what do I want to do right there just
to see that it's working I'm going to
say create P seed well obviously going
to need to do and not C but C dot value
the text of the seat itself I'm gonna
have to do a lot more there of course
but I'm just going to say that for right
now so now if I hit submit we can see
this page is doing some basic stuff that
is least getting the C so I have the
seed right now I have this seed in my
code I need some sort of source text to
use to be the words that I search for so
the way that of them do that is I'm just
going to load from a text file and I
happen to have a text file here which
just has a lot of text from the
Wikipedia page on rainbows so I'm going
to do it the easiest way possible in my
code with just preload
so I'm going to write a preload function
and I'm going to have a global variable
called source text I'm going to kind of
call it a goofy name and let's say
source text equals load strings rainbow
txt and one thing you might recall if
you watch some of my other videos is
that the load strings function loads in
the text but loads it as an array so it
gives you each line in that text file as
an array and so what I'm going to do in
setup is once that text is loaded I'm
gonna say source text equals join source
text with the space so I'm going to get
rid of that array enjoyed it so I've one
long string so now I have one lump
string and I just got to make sure it's
there and it also says create P source
text so now if I hit run but if I reload
the page I the seed and I have the
source text so now I've set up the page
that's just sort of step one
now I actually need to implement the die
astok algorithm okay so let's go back to
our code and do that this is going to be
fun and actually I just realized here's
something that I want to actually do I
want my for my die a stick algorithm I
want the source text not to be one long
string but I want it to be just a array
of words a list of words so I'm going to
I'm going to create a global variable
called words and I'm going to say words
equals split and I'm going to use the
p5.js function split tokens and I'm
going to say split that source text up
by and split token says whatever these
are the delimiter x' the second
arguments are the delimiter i want to
split it up by space comma exclamation
anything that's basically you know
something that's not so you know I could
I could do this much more effectively
but I'm just going to do that right now
and I'm going to do this and I'm going
to look just in the debugging console
and I can see I have an array of
basically many many many many words so
I've all the word of an array with every
single word as a separate element
arrey and you can see that it's 2132
words long so this is what i'm going to
be able to use now I'm going to search
through that array to find words that
have by the way it's probably going to
find rainbow over and over again but
I'll deal with that later because I'll
give it a different seed phrase okay so
here we go now what I want to do is
instead of creating those paragraphs I
want to say let me execute a die a stick
with what I want to pass in the value of
the see the seed and I want to all of
the words so I'm going to write a and
I'm going to I'm going to have that
function take a seed and an array and
that function will return a die a stick
Freight the results of this die a stick
technique so I'm just going to go to the
top of my code now because I can kind of
worry about this algorithm moment as its
own thing completely and I need I need a
function called die a stick and it gets
seed and a bunch of words and I'm using
the same variable name so what is the
first thing that I need to do the first
thing that I need to do in the algorithm
is look at each character one at a time
because I need to find a word that
starts with R a word the second letter
is a or words third third letters I that
sort of thing
so I'm going to come back over here and
I'm going to say what for VAR I equals 0
I is less than C dot length I plus plus
and then the character that I'm working
with is seed car at boy this is a
function that's part of the JavaScript
string object that I think I need a
vector to mention in some of my other
videos if I say car at AI I want the
character at index I right and in a
string all characters have an index
index 0 index 1 index 2 so if a string
is 5 characters long like Hello the the
index the indices go between 0 and 4 so
once I have that I want to then have
another loop and what do I want to loop
through I want to loop through all of I
want to look through every single one of
the words
and I want to say if see if words index
J dot car at I equals C then I have
found a word right
I found a word that has its own
character at the same spot I as the
character I'm looking for and once I do
that I'm just going to say console.log
just to see if this kind of idea works
and break so here we go
I'm going to run this program now I'm
pretty sure I'm going to run this we
should see a bunch of things so look at
this I got rainbow seven times so first
of all let's do a different seed phrase
this is you know testing one just do
testing one you can see I got test0 e
and that's all so you can see these and
see this worked now I got some of them
twice so here's the thing one thing I
need to build into this is I need to say
after the reason I got rainbow seven
times it's because my loop starts over
every single time so every single time I
find a word I go are matches with are
then I goes a matches with a so one
thing that I need to change about this
is I need to while I'm doing this keep
track of some things so I need first of
all I need to have a frit I want to kind
of have a phrase which starts like this
and when I find the word I want to say
phrase plus equal I want to concatenate
so the plus operator joins two strings
together I'm going to say plus equals
words index J and then I'm going to say
return phrase so one thing that's going
to be nice about this now that I've done
this is I can stop using the console for
debugging and I can say create p phrase
so let me run this again
and you can see I got rainbow rainbow
rainbow rainbow rainbow rainbow rainbow
and I say test I got that meteorologist
will dispersion that so one thing I want
to do by the way is I also want to add a
space so I'm going to do this a sort of
silly way but I'm just going to have two
lines of code there and you can see
rainbow rainbow rainbow rainbow so now
what I want to do is make sure I look
for the next instance of a word after
the first one I found so I'm going to
keep track of that index or like current
word equals zero so I want to start my
loop when I look through all the loops
from current word so I want to go from
current word to the end of that array
and as soon as I find one I want to say
current word equals J plus 1 I want to
go to the next word so instead of this
loop of searching through all the words
always going back to the beginning I
want to save where I last found one and
start from the next one so this should
do this rainbow caused rainbows rainbows
rainbow rainbow rainbow so I'm still
getting a lot of rainbows but I can now
say things like I look is do unicorns
exists question mark
so during good about during moonlit
numerically Direction encounter
dispersion brightness now amazingly I'm
not getting any errors here and I
probably should do some error checking
like what if I got to the end of the
array and I don't have any more we're
more to look what if no word exists with
that in there so I'm going to sort of
leave this as that I'm going to release
this code I you know another thing that
I could do is track all the possible
words that have oh is the second letter
and I can always pick a random one so
each time I hit submit I get a different
one that's something that you might add
to this arrow checking is something that
you might add I don't know if I'm if
there's anything weird happening when I
have a space because I've actually space
is technically a character that I'm
checking so the question mark is in
there but seems to be working let's just
d-ohh space you as forth left so you can
see so I got to do some stuff cleanup
that sort of way so right so um so I
probably missed some things on uh but I
encourage you for watching this video to
play around with this code make your own
Die astok tweak the algorithm generate
poetry share it share it with me shirt
with the world and explore other types
of ideas and I'm if you're in the
programming from A to Z playlist the
next video I'm going to talk a little
bit more about this and a homework
assignment for this set of material and
some other types of techniques and
outdoor achill algorithms like the die a
stick that you might look at as well
okay thanks for watching and I'll see
you in another videos maybe perhaps
someday
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
