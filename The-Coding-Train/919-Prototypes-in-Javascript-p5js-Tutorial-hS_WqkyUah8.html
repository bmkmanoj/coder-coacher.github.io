prototypes nope first I should say right
now you should probably turn this off
and go to something else because I'm
about two particular things I don't
really entirely understand and also a
little bit you know you could kind of
make the arguments obsolete or a little
passe or you know why aren't you talking
about yet six the new verb or this
epiphany sounds it's very long the new
version of JavaScript so what I'm going
to attempt to do I made a coding
challenge earlier today you can go a
link to it from this video it was a
coding challenge I'm just going to show
it to you actually should have had this
up it was a creating the word to train
out of little dots and then as I move
the mouse around the little dots would
move and then they would come back so I
made this coding challenge and I used a
particular bit of syntax where I created
objects and attached methods or
functions to the objects prototype and
so I wanted to try to make a video to at
least cover what is a prototype in
JavaScript and why is it kind of
relevant or why might you use it and how
does it relate to this concept of
inheritance and loop maybe also this
concept of polymorphism okay whatever I
got to workshop this so this could use
some work but I am trying try new stuff
new materials yeah my doing not so great
okay so what is the project so first I'm
going to just sort of work I'm going to
close this and I'm going to come to some
code and in this code I'm just going to
I'm going to write a constructor
function I could probably start further
back but I'm coming with some through a
baseline of maybe you've watched some of
my other tutorials and you've seen me
create objects with a constructor
function so a constructor function and I
will talk about yet six and classes
towards the end of this video so before
you start typing in your complaints
why aren't you mentioning year six in
classes okay and function and I'm going
to say there's a particle I'm going to
use the particle actually night none
it's like particle a function particle
this x equals 100 this dot y equals 99
so I'm the idea
this constructor function is I can
create an object that has those two
properties associated with it an X
property and a Y property and this
keyword what javascript knows that if I
ever say var P equals new particle the
new keywords indicates to JavaScript
that AHA that function right that you
wrote is not a regular B it all
functions are the thing if it's a
function it's a function if the function
if the function is the function it's a
function but functions can be executed
in a slightly different way as
constructor function if you use the new
keyword the new keyword says execute
that function as a constructor function
meaning make a new object and assign
that object to the keyword this so it's
binding the context of the code that's
happening inside that function to the
keyword this point oh I think we need a
whole video about the keyword this I
think I've covered it mentioned it
before but this is this keyword of
JavaScript that can be kind of pointed
through the current context point of the
different things based on what you're
doing and here I want to make a new
object so I need something to point to
it I'm going to use this okay so I'm
making a new object now let me actually
do this rather instead of in the code
let me actually just go to the
JavaScript console itself and I've got
that code loaded in the background so I
can do things like VAR p equals new
particle and we're going to see now if I
look closely at that object there it is
it's a particle object and has an X
property and a wide property what else
does it have well it has this proto
property we need to object
so let's come back to that in a moment
okay we're to come back to that in a
moment hold on hold on okay now I'm
going to go and I'm going to say
something like this dot show equals
function yes equals function
you know this dot point oh sorry I held
off my case I'm in p5 so I'm going to
call the point function this out X this
not Y so like I'm going to add a
function to
object where I draw it as a point so and
actually what I'm going to do is I would
say VAR p just one wants to keep typing
on the console P equals new particle so
now I'm going to load reload the page
I'm going to type P again so now I have
come on
well okay something went wrong here oh
there it is sorry it's there so now it
has three properties show which is a
function you can sort of see that here
and there's other stuff associated with
that oh so much to talk about we could
be here forever we won't talk about it
all and X property in a Y property now
let's think about this for a second I'm
going to make another particle bar p2
equals new particle p2 now both of these
particles of oh boy I've got this
computer here okay both of these
particles have an x and a y proper in
this make sense right they should each
have their own X&amp;amp;Y property because I
might say P 2 X plus plus right and now
P 2 has its X property is its X has
moved to 101 but I don't want P to have
moved I want to be able to treat those
properties of it individually those for
this data of these particles where they
live on the screen so it makes a lot of
sense that those would be attached to
the new object that was made in the
constructor function but let's think
about this do they really each need
their own individual show function
couldn't I just have a show function
that was just kind of living somewhere
that I could say hey particles when it's
time to show go and grab that function
you could both use the same show
function because you're both going to be
displayed as a point you'll use your own
data to show yourself at different
places on the screen maybe with
different colors but you don't actually
need each new show function and right
now when I make two particles to each
get their own X&amp;amp;Y
which they should and they each get
their own show function which works but
is a little bit unnecessary so how can I
possibly make this a bit more efficient
and I'm kind of backing into the concept
of
like this is normally where you would
start but this is one reason why it's
useful I can instead say forget about
having a function defined here I can
write some very strange-looking code
particle dot prototype dot show equals
function so now and I'm going to do the
same thing I'm just going to put that
code in there and now we are going to
look at what does this particle look
like in the console P the particle now
has an excellent what happened to the
show function it's down here oh boy so
now we've now we've lost it and I think
I need the white support this is the
moment where I think we need the white
board okay I'm over here at the white
board I'm walking very awkwardly not so
sure what I'm going to draw yet I'm
feeling a little nervous here because I
don't know this is where it gets a
little bit tricky so what I'm suggesting
here is this object all objects p1 has
an X and has a Y now I could also add a
show function but I could also just add
a prototype and that prototype is going
to point to particle dot prototype and
particles prototype has a show function
so this is kind of what's often referred
to as the prototype chain so it's big
although the chain is it's very long yet
I really want to show how this can then
be changed further and further and
further so this is the Pokes and that's
worth getting show so now if I say p2
and I have an X and a Y and a prototype
this is also pointing to particles a
prototype so if I say p1 dot show it
looks up is it in here somewhere
nope if it was it would execute the show
something I could override within the
prototype by having this part of on its
own
will show function I don't know why I
would do that but you could and maybe
you can take it why not here go look in
the prototype there it is so this object
is going to get functions that are
beyond the program now strangely not
what I'm going to do for a brief moment
is leave this here and show you a reason
why this can actually be incredibly
powerful that's the right word but
incredibly useful as a JavaScript
programmer when you're using existing
JavaScript objects that come from other
libraries so for example am i over here
now yes for example let's say you you
want to use okay a good example is this
array is a good example of this but I'm
going to use the the p5 vector object so
let's say you you have a you have a
vector I'm going to say I'm going to
make this a global variable just in case
I don't look at it in the console v
equals create vector you know one cut
three comma four now V has functions
like and so if I go to the console and
hit refresh I can say V mag the
magnitude of that vector is 5 it's a 3 4
5 triangle actually if you look at the
sides and the hypotenuse that's the
magnitude of that vector now what if I
wanted to say V dot what is the
magnitude actually typed is the function
what if I wanted to just double the
values of that vector so I know I could
say V multiplied by 2 that's a ways that
you can actually double the values of a
vector and you can see now it's 6 and 8
instead of 3 and 4 but what if I wanted
I feel like the vector object because
I'm going to do this a lot by program I
just want to be able to say V double
well of course I'm going to get error
that says uncaught type error V double
where is the multiply function let's
look at the V let's look at p5 vector
right let's look here all of these
functions are in p5 dot vector prototype
all of that is down
here this is all the stuff listing
what's in the prototype so and I got to
talk about what this underscore proto
thing is but down the things listed
below are part of the prototype these
are the properties specific to that
actual object instance the object itself
not part of the prototype which is sort
of a shared amount of functions for all
objects that are created from that
prototype so what if I want to add
something to this well this is not
something you could normally do in a lot
of other programming environments oh I
got this class or this object or this
thing I'm just going to modify it
it's a programmer no problem well guess
what JavaScript you can I could say p5
vector dot prototype equals oh sorry dot
double equals function and what would I
do in that function I could say this dot
X because whatever object gets called
look at that object X property x equals
to this dot y x equals to this dot Z
because the vectors actually have three
components so now I've actually added I
modified the p5.js library by messing
with by adding something to p5 vectors
protists that any vector anytime in my
code in this sketch will always now
suddenly have a double function and we
can see that because if I hit refresh
and I type V and I look at all the
functions available in the prototype
suddenly there's a function called
double right there it wasn't there
before
so I've mostly wrapped up this first
video on perfect yeah there's lots of
little missing pieces here lots of
little gaps to fill in I want to and I'm
going to do a follow-up one which goes a
little deeper into inheritance this idea
of inheritance and then another one
which goes deeper than this other
concept known as polymorphism but let's
just one thing that we need to figure
out here is what was that underscore
proto thing so there's something in
JavaScript called the prototype chain
and right here I made these objects
calling the particle is a constructor
function and this assigned actually the
this this this made these objects that
have the properties x and y with
it's from particle dot prototype but
that underscore proto is referring to a
property of the prototype which is a
pointer in a way a reference up the
prototype chain and what this actually
points to is something called object dot
prototype everything in JavaScript
everything everything everything arrays
functions everything except for some
primitive bar x equals five numbers and
you know undefined everything is really
an object and all objects ultimately
have a selection of top of the prototype
chain where you can mess around with all
this stuff by like creating objects with
null and like destroying the prototype
but that's a little less practical or
relevant to this video all objects if
you go all the way up the prototype
chain go get object prototype and there
are methods here like there are methods
like has own property which is actually
this is actually a really easy
interesting thing to look at has own
property let us just investigate this
function has own property for a second
so I can say p1 dot has own property
because it doesn't that dot property has
a property isn't here oh let's look up
the prototype change the purpose after
outer tech so it's not there oh let's go
to object red project oh it's there I
can execute that function let's look
what that function does it's kind of
interesting it's very useful so I'm
going to say p1 hook Oh just P sorry P
this incidentally this object prototype
is particle dr. auto type and we can see
the function thing I look it result so
it's automatic
property of the prototype constructor
that is set automatically to that
particle constructor function that's
what happens when you say new the new
keyword says the particles prototype
constructor is that function new
particle so you can see here particles
prototype proto pointer points to object
dot prototype and we could see look
these are the other functions that come
from object dot prototypes like has own
property so let me show it what I mean
by that I can say P
like let's say I say Piz well that's
undefined it doesn't exist it's not a
property of particle and it's not-it's
so I could say P dot has own property Z
false it is not a property it's not a
property of P but has own property is a
little bit it's not just easy to
properties it's something that you could
say that gives you a valid result what
if I say P looks at P has own property X
I should get true right look P has a
property X correct but what remember
particle I can say P show right that's a
function I could say P dot has own
property show false why did I get false
the reason why I got false is because
show is a property that's been the
prototype so this is a way you could
detect if the property is something
specific just only that is like an
individual property of that object
instance or something that's somewhere
else in the prototype chain and this is
actually useful time if you want to
iterate over all the properties of an
object even with the prototype chain you
can determine if it's like something you
want to ignore because it actually comes
from object prototype because it's not a
has own property of the object itself so
I kind of went out a little bit of it I
dress in there but hopefully this lets
you see how do we find something up that
prototype chain so this is a little bit
of what a prototype is I'm sure I miss P
I never I don't know if I like
explicitly defined it kind of back into
it showing its how you use it and how
it's relevant and where you find it in
the console sure I missed a lot of
pieces here which I'll come back to but
what I want to look at is what if I want
to make other objects what if I want to
put something else what if I want to
have so let's say I have a generic
particle object that has all of the
physics basic physics of a world that's
going to inhabit and what I ultimately
want to do is I want to have turtles and
fish and bees and all different kinds of
creatures that have lots of their own
functions and properties but they get
all their physics stuff from say a
generic particle object how can I have a
you know a turtle dot prototype which
have a lot of stuff
turtle but has all the physics from
particle that prototypes that has all
the functions from object-oriented how
can I do something called inheritance
how can I have objects inherit from
other objects that I'm defining through
prototypical inheritance in JavaScript
so that's going to be in the next video
but might not come out for a little bit
but it will come out eventually maybe
you're watching this in the future and
they're all there and are I believe them
because these videos or disaster but but
so look for it it might be there now I
should mention one again once again that
what I'm showing you is a part of the
JavaScript language from the version
that is informally known as es6 so
there's a consortium emc a script
blabbity blah that determines and specs
out the javascript language the
interesting complex topic of how that's
done and who has a voice there which I
think we a separate discussion but the
new and it's actually not even that new
at this point but it just you know
there's still some browsers don't
support it the newest version of
JavaScript es6
has a different model and syntax for
this involving something called class
and if you have programs as i have in
java or other classical programming
environments so to speak this is more of
like a classical model of inheritance
and there's a key bump so i some point i
also want to look at that
so in this continuing series but first i
want to figure out this prototype stuff
i want to get inherit also talk about
this thing called polymorphism and i'll
show you some examples that make use of
it okay thanks for watching this
particular video and I will see you in a
future one about prototypes and
inheritance</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
