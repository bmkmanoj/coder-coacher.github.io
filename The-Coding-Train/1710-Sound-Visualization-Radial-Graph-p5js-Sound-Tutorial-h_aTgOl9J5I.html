video and the previous one left us weird
like shaking crazy graphing the volume
of a sound file and what I want to do
now and it was a great suggestion from
Oliver and the chat is instead of
graphing as a graph along say an x-axis
what if I took this graph and wrapped it
around a circle and the way to do that
is to think about a circle as a bunch of
points that are based on an angle and a
radius so if that angle iterates all
around the circle but the radius changes
according to the volume then maybe we've
got something so let's see if we can
implement that so I need to I'm going to
just kind of like simplify the code for
a second so I'm gonna pull this out I'm
gonna pull out the push oh oh that's
fine I'll reverse engineer all this code
later I made a new version but that's
fine I'm going to take out this line and
then run it again as always I've always
pretty great to play this so what I want
to do now instead is say ok what if I
I'm gonna do a begin shape and shape and
I'm gonna say I is less than 360 and I
now I need to have I is the angle right
so first of all I want to I want to have
the sketch in think in terms of degrees
I can by default p5 we'll think in width
of angles in a unit of measurement
called radians but I want to think in
terms of degrees here and I can say VAR
x equals and this is a math formula that
converts from an angle and a radius to
an x and y position which is R times
cosine of that angle that's X and VAR y
equals R times sine of that angle and I
can now have a vertex at X comma Y and I
can say R equals just 100 let me run
this I think there's that circle around
if your
so what I want to do now is right before
he or say translate with / - let's let's
have the centre be in the center and put
a semicolon here and here we go
as always our goal stop there do not let
this stop this is the Cartesian
coordinate systems and now what I'm
going to do is are can be based on the
volume so it can be let's just say it's
between 10 and 100 based on what the
volume is and I can get this out of here
oops that pop is unnecessary and I want
to only ever have 360 elements in the
array and now I can do this as always I
always forget the Vista all right so
there's plenty more I could I could keep
going with this you can make it rainbow
color that could fill it in to stop
colors I could have the colors respond
to something else I encourage you to
this version and stuff in the next video
and then show you had okay thanks for
watching another video where I'm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
