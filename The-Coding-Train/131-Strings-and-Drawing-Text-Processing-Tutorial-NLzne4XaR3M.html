doing well I'm doing okay actually
feeling a little stressed out but I'm
going to go forward with this video
anyway so I'm starting a new series this
series of videos is going to be about
using data and processing so look at a
lot of things where do we find data how
do we get data what if the data is from
a file or from a URL or how do I chop it
up or how do I sort it or this locks and
lastly what format is it if it in
what's an API there's so many things to
talk about and cover here in this set of
videos but before we can do any of that
the foundation the building block the
thing that we need to be comfortable
with and happy with and just feeling
good about our day with is this idea of
a string what is a string now in fact a
string is something that's quite
familiar to you probably I know who
knows who you are or why you're watching
this video but chances are you've seen a
string before in fact if you watched
some earlier videos from just a couple
ago we were load we were using strings
we loaded an image maybe we had
something on a hard drive called a file
dot JPEG and it was some characters and
was and it was in between quotes this is
a string a string is a sequence of
characters in between quotes now I mean
actually the in between quotes part is
just the way that we declare a string
the string itself is just the sequence
of characters and if we want to do
anything that has to do with text
certainly we need a string we need to a
way to represent that text but in fact
most of the data we're going to look at
even if the data is all numbers that
data is going to come in as text so this
is something we need to become
comfortable with so how do we how do we
make a string and processing well a
string is a data type we now have a
variable I made this very up this
wonderful beautiful variable named s
with the data type string and what is
the string it is this sequence of
characters so I think one of the things
we can first start to look at in working
with strings and processing is just
drawing them to the to the window so
let's let's come back over here and
let's say we have a
s to be or not to be and you know
obviously I could say print line s and
run this particular sketch and we can
see down here in the bottom to be or not
to be that's our string we're
representing it as a variable and we're
printing it now let's say what we
actually want to do is draw it to the
window we know how to draw things can
draw an image you can draw a rectangle
can draw a line uh we could draw a
string also so I can say text s and then
now I need to give an X and a Y where I
want that text to appear so let's put
this in some arbitrary location right
here and we can see there it is our
little tiny friendly string to be or not
to be it's there in the window you can
barely read it though let's make it
bigger with with shapes we can set
colors we can set sizes text is no
different I can use the text size
function and I'm gonna say text size 64
and now I have my lovely string here to
be or not to be okay so one of the first
things you might start thinking about is
I'm I'm I'm here to put text in my
processing window and the thing that
means a lot to be is picking my font
that's my joy in life is picking a font
and I don't like this font whatever just
chose by accident or by default which it
looks like it's Arial or something like
that
so one of the things you can do in
processing is you can say text font and
I need to put something in there what
goes in there I need to reference a font
the way to reference a font is to make a
P font object so I'm going to make a P
font object and I'm going to say create
font and I'm going to use the font
Georgia it's one of my personal favorite
fonts and I'm going to run this sketch
and now we can see to be or not to be is
in a different font isn't this life good
and happy and wonderful that we have we
can just pick whatever font we want okay
you know the thing is I'm kind of like
you know just going through the motions
here because in the end well I'm not
less concerned about drawing text to the
screen I mean that's that's a not that's
something that too it's okay to be
concerned with but I'm trying to get to
the data stuff that parsing that the
chunking of data so let's actually get a
little closer to that by looking at a
slightly different way to draw this
string okay
so let's stay for the moment okay so I'm
going to move this string up and I'm
going to draw it again and what I want
to do let's put this down a little lower
okay what I want to do in the the top is
just the string there it is on the
screen the bottom is also just the
straight Barrett is on the screen but I
want a little thought experiment here
what if I were to color each one of
these characters with a different color
what if I were to draw each character at
a different size whatever were to
animate that string so that it like
moves around the screen like a snake or
wraps itself around on a curve
what if I want to visualize text in a
more flexible and dynamic animated way
now I just said the point of all this is
not about drawing text it's about
working with text as data but actually
manipulating the way we draw this text
will actually help unlock some of the
clues to how we're going to work with
text as data so how do we figure out
like well this is a string this string
this string over here is a data type and
in fact its capital S which means it's
an object an INT is a primitive data
type like just a number a float is just
a number a P image is an object in image
it's got pixels it's got with that's got
height a string also has a lot of stuff
it's got this this this sequence of
characters but there are lots of other
functions that we can to use call upon
this object to work to manipulate and
work with this string car at length
index of sub string to lowercase
there are lots and lots of methods that
we can call to manipulate and play with
these strings and we're going to see all
of these in the set of videos I'm
recording today and later today and
tomorrow and later this week whenever it
happens so how do we find out about what
these fun what what are the possible
functions and what do they do well a
string is so commonly used in processing
that it wasn't really prepared for this
unfortunately owing to open up a browser
window here and I'm going to say
processing orgs string and that there is
in fact it's a reference page for
Strings in processing and we can see a
lot of those methods I listed over there
here they are here and there is some
more information you can click on them
in there's examples I should point out
though however that back I should put
this gonna happen to the other camera
soon in a second I should point out that
string really uh it comes from Java and
in fact you know this is kind of like an
awful place to be that's making me feel
very uncomfortable inside actually I
rather like it it makes but you know
anyway
whether the Java talks are very
long-winded with a like way too much
information but and a little bit hard to
parse and find fault but the point is if
you really want to find dig into the
everything there is to ever know about a
string you can string is a class that's
part of Java processing built on top of
Java we have access to everything you
can do with strings in Java in
processing so I encourage you I'll try
to leave some links for you to go look
at that stuff but I want to come back
over here and I want to start looking at
some of these functions that we use that
we can use to manipulate strings let's
look at car act and length okay car at
and length car at gives us an individual
character at a specific index remember
this thing that we that I that we talked
about at some point called an array
array might be some numbers or some
objects or whatever it is it's a ordered
list of stuff we access each individual
element of the array by
it's index starting with zero and
counting up so this array which has five
elements has in indices index values 0 1
2 3 4 guess what this particular string
that has 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 characters each
one of those characters can be
referenced by an index also starting
with 0 8 the last one will be 7 the
length of this string now you can't see
those 0 7 the length of the string is 8
each character is referenced by its
index so if I want to come back if I
want to look at and draw simply the
first character here we go there's my T
if I want to draw the fourth character
there's my B so this works car at works
length by the way will give us the
length of the string so let's say I want
to go through all of the characters in
the string I can do this now I'm going
to draw every single character in the
string oh look they're all on top of
each other right there because I drew
them all at the location 10 comma 300
now before I go a little farther with
this there's a couple pieces of it
there's a kind of a key piece of
information here that the mouse arrow is
right there at the end of length look at
that that doesn't look if you remember
an array of them come over here if I had
an array I would say Val's dot length
length being a property of the array
that gives me the length of that array 5
I'm coming back over here look at that
length has parenthesis length is a
function a method of the string object
so even though it's very similar this is
an easy thing that you'll get tripped up
on even though it looks just like the
length of an array it's actually a
function it has to be executed it needs
open and close parentheses for it to be
called so let's say we want to space
these out I'm going to make up a
variable called X and I'll start it at
10 whoops and
in fact we don't know who can like put
all this up here now I'm going to say
draw each character at X and x equals x
plus I don't know
32 whoops what did I do in two I equals
zero
let's run this okay now I have those
characters spaced apart each one is
spaced apart by 32 pixels hmm that
doesn't look right the actual spacing I
don't know what you who know about these
things like typography that has a term
like letting or kerning or something
like that you know there's all these
nice terms I don't know about any of
that stuff but the these characters are
are are this is obviously not right so
there's got to be a way around this and
in fact in processing there is a
function called text width if I were to
draw the function text with sorry give
me dynamically the width of any
character that's being drawn in the
window
so we can use text width to say draw the
T now move by the width of that
character and draw the o now move by the
width of that character and draw the B
so I'm going to I'm going to just add
something here by putting each character
in a separate variable and by the way
the car data type which is a primitive
type is a data type for an individual
character so I'm looking at every single
character in this string which is a
sequence of characters I'm going to draw
that character and then I'm going to
move by the text width of that character
and look now the string looks just like
the one above now we can start to do
things like say hey give me a random
fill now we have a random color for each
character which we would not be able to
do by drawing the text all at once and
now we also I could do something like
I'm going to actually change this and
just say text size random 12 to 128 this
I think is illustrates the point even
better that now each character is a
different size and but yet the layout is
still correct so here's the thing
there's a lot of stuff you could try
here
this is animated so what if you have the
text grow and shrink or what if you have
each character kind of like move around
or what if you have it not on a perfect
line but kind of on a curve and and I
can show you this if you're following
along with learning processing examples
I'm going to go here to chapter 7
there's a couple that I'll just show you
to open up so example 17.8 this is
drawing the text along the curve this is
a pretty high degree of difficulty
problem but you know what you could
think to yourself is actually could I
figure out how to draw a set of
rectangles along a curve if you can draw
a set of rectangles along the curve then
you just need to place each character
within that rectangle there's there's
another function that I think there's a
there's another little piece of drawing
text that I've kind of missed here which
is text align and this is also going to
be helpful too if I say text align
Center you can see that now that each
character is aligned by its Center and
you can see that it's it's off where
it's located if I said with / - you can
see here now the text is centered on the
syringe so text aligned there's you know
you can look up and there's a lot of
this stuff in processing when I go back
to what it was before so that's
something you would think about the
other thing you might think about
looking at is and I'm going to go open
up another example which is 17 point 10
oh boy okay so let's let's zoom in here
and let's take a look at this so look
this looks just like text on the screen
each one of these characters is
individually placed there's actually an
object like a particle object for each
one it retains its own location it
retains up rotation information and as I
click the mouse you can see they start
to move around randomly and then if I
let go of the mouse they're going to
slowly come back to their original
location so these are the kind of ideas
and experiments you could play with I
didn't really go too far into actually
the fun stuff I was was very much
skipping over that one thing that I
think is worth mentioning is here let's
just to talk for a minute about this
create font function the create font
function is pulling fonts that are
installed on your system
it's pole
pulling from the system fund and I could
actually look at what all those possible
system fonts are by by saying P font dot
list and this will this will dynamically
pull up a list of all the fonts that are
installed in the system and I could you
know I could just like pick one of these
out and put it in here and run this
again and we're going to see now I have
a completely different fun
so whatever fonts are available to you
you can use in processing the nice thing
about this working in this rendering
mode is that the fonts are being drawn
is actual like shape data they're not
like images that are just being placed
on the screen so you can grow and shrink
them and even though I specified the
size 64 it's going to dynamically make
everything look nice no matter what size
you draw it at you have to watch out
though if you're in a different mode for
you in 3d or other modes sometimes the
font has to be rendered as an image and
then if you're starting to grow it or
shrink it it's going to look pixelated
or squished there's also ways of
packaging a font with your processing
sketch itself by including it in the
data folder so you know I'm kind of
rambling here because you should have
just stopped this had gone on to the
next video because where we're getting
to here where we're hoping to get to is
looking more about it is is looking more
closely at this particular string as
data we've seen car at length later
we're going to see index of substring
and look to lowercase the next thing
though that however that I really want
to look at which is a sort of key
component of working with data and
strings are the function split and the
functions join so one of the first
things that I think we can look at in
terms of working with data is I have all
this stuff it's a giant string how do I
split it up it's all these numbers
separated by commas how do I split those
up it's a novel with a lot of words in
it how do I split that up and count all
the words in it so we're gonna look at a
few of these scenarios and then we'll
get even further to we'll get even
further say like oh well if the data is
in a standardized format like XML or
JSON
what's XML what's JSON we'll talk about
all these things as we get from video to
video for now though I would suggest to
you that the first thing you might start
with is just hard code some data
numbers characters as strings try going
through them by character by character
try drawing a try you know what if you
were to visualize each one of these not
as the character itself but as a
rectangle with a color basically if so
many things you could think of in terms
of just playing with strings and drawing
and processing okay so the next video
we're going to look at split and join
and I have to stop this now somehow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
