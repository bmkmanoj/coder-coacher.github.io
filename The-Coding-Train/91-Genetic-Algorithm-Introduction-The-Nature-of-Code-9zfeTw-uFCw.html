a new playlist this playlist is all
about a field of study that loosely you
could call one could call I could call I
am calling evolutionary computing and I
want to talk about something that's
called a genetic algorithm I want to
talk about why genetic algorithms exist
what they are traditionally used for how
you might apply them in different
creative contexts and go through a whole
set of examples so by the end of this
those probably four or five videos
showing you about a range of examples
and ideas of things you can try as well
as code that you can do in both Java
using the processing framework and
JavaScript using the p5.js framework so
that's my goal that's what's happening
if you are interested in that keep
watching if not go and to dance party
okay never mind
sorry I just I just I have a new
soundboard it's too exciting okay so all
the stuff that you'll be watching if you
are if you are watching if you continue
to watch is based on material that is in
a book called the nature of code then I
guess it's a book I wrote this book so
that's why I'm using it if that makes
sense and chapter 9 is the relevant
chapter so if you prefer to read and
text listen to me Yammer on you can go
to this URL and check out this chapter
I'm going to kind of talk you through
now the field of evolutionary computing
really dates back you know I would say
to the 1950s
John Holland working on different models
of simulations of evolution in software
and so there's this problem that comes
up in computer science problems and
problems in life in general a lot which
is I need to find the answer a single
tiny little optimized perfect example in
a sea of so many possibilities it just
would be completely impossible to check
every single possibility until I find
the answer now that might seem a little
abstract what I want to do is talk about
and and since I'm here what I want to do
is talk about this traditional genetic
algorithms that was designed to solve
those kinds of problems so this is like
a slide show that's automatically
playing but over the course of this
video series I'm going to look at sort
of three different scenarios first this
tradish
Oh genetic algorithm that I'm calling a
traditional it's kind of the original
the classic genetic algorithm and then
some creative twists on this algorithm
looking at this technique called
interactive selection which allows users
and audience to kind of help participate
in this evolutionary process an
ecosystem simulation to think of using
genetics as applied to agents that are
moving around the screen and
experiencing the sort of artificial
world the video games for is quite
famous for kind of having stuff like
this built into it so but this
traditional traditional genetic
algorithm a good way to think about why
this problem is necessary and how and
what why this algorithm is necessary and
how this algorithm can be applied is the
the Shakespeare was a Shakespearean
monkey problem so the Shakespearean
monkey problem is this thought
experiment that says if you had a monkey
typing at a typewriter for an infinite
amount of time typing randomly monkey
typing randomly eventually this monkey
would randomly by typing kind of every
random possibility type out the complete
works of William Shakespeare so while I
think we could kind of probably agree
that this abstractly as a concept is
possible is true let's think about what
this really means so let's say there's a
monkey
this monkey here and this monkey let's
actually just say there's not actually a
monkey I don't I don't have a monkey to
bring in or anything like that that
would be interesting though try that
another video but let's say let's say
there's a computer simulation of a
monkey okay and I'm going to say that
let's just say let's simplify the
problem and say that the only thing we
care about is the phrase to be or not to
be that is the question now that phrase
has thirty nine characters in it and
let's say we have a simplified keyboard
I have a keyboard right here which has a
lot of keys and numbers and punctuation
marks let's just say we have a
simplified keyboard and this keyboard
has only 26 letters lowercase a through
Z and it has the spacebar that's 27
letters in total so if you know if you
know about probability I don't have a
coin but right if you have a coin a coin
as a heads or a tails you have a one out
of two Chancellor's one possibility
being the heads there's two
possibilities in total typing at a
keyboard we could sort of say the same
thing there
27 keys I have a 1 out of 27 chance of
typing the T now event probability if
you want to string two events together
if I have a one out of two chance of
flipping heads and then a one out of two
chance of flipping heads I have a chance
of flipping heads twice in a row 1/2
times 1/2 so 1 out of 4 times right and
you could think about that because I
could type I've typed I could flip and
here are my possibilities heads heads
heads tails tails heads tails tails
there are 4 ways that I could flip a
coin twice only one of those is heads
head 1 out of 4 or 1 out of 2 times 1
out of 2 so the same problem here the
chance that I have for typing a T and
then it o is one out of twenty seven
ties one out of 27 okay so that's even
that is kind of like a very low
probability if I'm just typing at a red
keyboard randomly it's quite rare that
I'm going to type a T in a no but it
would happen probably in a day of me
doing this over and over and over again
now the phrase to be or not to be that
is the question has 39 characters in it
so in order for me to have the
probability of typing a teeth and an O
than to space than a B then an e then in
place then an O then R than space then
an end then an O the D that's another
song for somebody to compose a T than an
O then a B oh no space a T then an O
then to space then a B then I would this
is now the probability is 1 divided by
27 to the 39th power that's 1 divided by
27 times 1 divided by 27 times 1 about
39 times now I previously not right now
or this morning like a while ago so
hopefully this math is right I did this
math and the actual answer is a 1 in 66
la ba ba ba ba ba ba ba it's a really
massively like big unfathomable number
so basically this thought experiment is
we were talking about genetic algorithms
right so why is this relevant this is
like an artificial this is a completely
trivial problem right because I want to
I'm going to open up my processing code
I'm going to make a new sketch and I'm
going to say print line to be or not to
be wait I have to say that is the
question that is the question so look at
that I have now just solved this problem
of typing to be or not to be with one
line of code I don't have
sound effect for done yet so I have to
make it right to be or not to be that is
the question one line of code but this
can serve as an example problem right we
know the answer I know the answers to be
or not to be there are a there are 66
gazillion zillion zillion gazillion
possible random phrases only one of
which is the answer I happen to know the
answer so I could just spit out the
answer but what if there's a problem
that's the search space is so vast that
you couldn't possibly and you don't know
the answer and you can't check every
possibility this is what a genetic
algorithm is for and I'm going to
demonstrate this to you in a couple
different ways in a moment so let's go
back though to this particular slide and
just look at a little bit more about
these numbers so one thing that I did
let's say you have a computer simulation
that is typing what just to think about
like really how the sheer vastness of
this solution space let's say you have a
computer simulation with that can type 1
million random phrases per second I
don't even know if I could do that
processing would run that fast probably
could but whatever the point is if I ran
that it would take for me to have a 99%
probability of at least that phrase
coming up once I would have to run that
simulation for this many years nine
point seven one nine gazillion gazillion
gazillion blah blah blah blah blah years
notice by the way is the age of the
known universe is this number down here
this number is a lot bigger than that so
these numbers are so incredibly wrong
sort of mind blowing Lee huge that this
is this again the reason that I'm here
right now is to talk about genetic
algorithms and this problem is a good
way for us to look at ok what is an
algorithm that could solve this problem
without it taking this much time and a
genetic algorithm is that problem now
let's think about this more practically
or what example that I love that's on
the internet somewhere that I'm going to
just pull up for you right now is a
called boxcar 2d I'm in a Google boxcar
2d and I'm going to run this right now
and I'm going to let this run for a
while so I think this is a nice demo oh
come on really you're going to be so
slow oh you know I wonder if this page
or this page I'm gonna close a few
things just
second and refresh this page up I lost
it
refresh this page okay so this is boxcar
2d I did not make this I don't know why
it's running so slow but now it seems to
be doing a little bit better um you
could think about I here's the problem I
want to design a car and I could say
that oh I know so let's say I'm at a car
designer and I know okay I'm going to
design a car I want it to be aerodynamic
so it should look like this I wanted to
have you know small wheels in the front
and big wheels in the back and because I
like rainbows I wanted to have a sign
you know with the rainbow on it and I
also like unicorns so I wanted to have
like a unicorn thing at the front but I
have no artistic talent but this is the
best I could do and I've designed this
car this is like me designing a car but
here let's think about the possible ways
let's say I have I could design a car
out of here are my things any polygon I
could design a car out of any number of
wheels those wheels could be the attach
to the polygon any number of ways and I
could have any mythological creature I
don't think this part is in box to date
mythological creature somebody make a
boxcar 2d with mythological features
like unicorns that'll be exciting um so
you can see like if we started working
this out I probably would also have
gazillions and gazillions and gazillions
of possible card designs so one way of
finding an optimized car design is to
evolve that optimized car design and if
I come back over here I press my button
you can see that's what boxcar 2d is
doing its testing out a whole lot of
different possible car designs it's
using the Box 2d physics engine I do
have some video tutorials about that so
this is ultimately what I'm building -
how can you design a system that uses
evolutionary algorithm to evolve a
behavior or a design or solve some
particular kind of search problem and
there are lots of ways you can apply
genetic algorithms and what I'm going to
do in this tutorial series is start with
what start with a simple problem with a
known answer and if we can get the
genetic algorithm to
solve this simple problem with a known
answer then we can take that genetic
algorithm and start to apply it to lots
of other interesting scenarios without
known answers and the simple problem
with a known answer that I want to solve
poof ah is this one to be or not to be
that is the question without a brute
first force search so I could make a
brute-force search that just tries every
possible care or I could create an
evolutionary search a genetic algorithm
search and that's what I'm going to do
and in that and and and that will cover
the sort of traditional genetic out
there where the pieces of the algorithm
how does it work and how do you
implement that in code so this video is
my brief sort of overview of kind of
covered where this stuff is coming from
what I'm thinking about and in the next
video what I'm going to do is actually
start talking you through the algorithm
itself and starting to write pieces of
code that implements that algorithm and
show it to you in the context of the
Shakespeare to be or not to be that is
the question example okay
thanks for watching and maybe I'll see
you in the next video I don't actually
see anybody and if you're watching this
in a video and just recorded so I'm not
actually even a thing but I have a real
person and you could say hi to me
sometime if you want to do somewhere I
don't know where okay bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
