going to show you how to take a
processing sketch and render it to a
movie so this comes up a lot there's
probably a variety of ways that you
could do this I'm going to show you a
particular technique that hopefully will
be useful to you so you know I picked
this arbitrarily it's one of the
examples from my nature of code
materials it is a simulation called the
game of life a cellular automata system
Tom atta boy I'm never going to get that
right ever in my life and it just it's a
an arbitrary animation but anything
anything at all that you draw to the
screen and processing you can render as
a video out of processing why would you
want to do this well there's a variety
of reasons one is you might want to
upload something to Vimeo or YouTube or
some other website to host a video you
might want to bring this into another
project maybe you're working on the
animation and in something like After
Effects and you want to have some
elements that you've programmed in there
I can think of some I'll try to include
some examples of people have done this
kind of work in a YouTube description
below so you might want to take what
you're doing incorporate into another
project in video form another thing
might be actually that you just the
thing that you made is beautiful but it
runs incredibly slow and you want it you
don't need it to run in real time so you
could render it as a video so that it
could run at 30 frames per second and
playback as as an installation or
whatever it is you might be doing so
let's look at how you might do that and
there's there's there's a bunch of steps
to it and I'll try to go through them so
the first thing that I will show you and
you know what this font is remarkably
small so let me just show you in
processing 3 I can go to the preferences
I'm going to change the editor font 236
and I think that's going to be a little
bit better hopefully you can see that
okay so what's the first thing that I
want to do to this so what I'm going to
do is save so there's there may be some
other processing libraries you can get
to render directly to a movie file but
what I'm going to show you how to do
instead of rendering directly to a movie
file you can always just save what's on
the screen as an image so for example if
I put save the function save and I say
Yoel dot PNG I'm just going to put that
in draw and I'm going to run it you can
see first of all you know if you can
tell if it's running slower or not maybe
it is maybe it's not I'm going to close
this and I'm going to go to that sketch
folder and you can see right there there
now is a file called gol PNG and you can
see it's a snapshot of what was on the
screen now I was doing that and draw so
it was doing it over and over and over
again and what we're seeing now is just
the last frame that it drew so the save
function is away and you might put that
in mousepressed or attach it you know
you might at some point just want to use
save just to save a snapshot of what's
on the screen but if you use the save
frame a function what the save frame
function allows you to do is include the
pound symbol the hash symbol and what it
will do now is auto number the files so
every time you call save frame it's
going to save gol underscore one gol
underscore two so this now if I'm
executing this in draw every time
through draw I'm going to get a new
image file and I'm going to run this and
I'm going to try not to run for very
long whoops I leave it running because
now I'm going to go in and be like oh my
goodness and you can see there here it
is I have an image file for every single
thing that was saved every single frame
now I don't like this this is kind of a
disaster because I have the zillion
files and it's polluting my file system
here so I'm going to delete these and
I'm going to show you what I think would
be more useful to do I'm going to make
just a directory I'm going to call it
output slash gol pound pound pound pound
and I'm going to run this and I'm gonna
let it run tempted incident dududu okay
that was enough time and now you can see
I have this all here and I can just
cycle through it and you can see there
it is every single frame and by the way
I'm using the PNG file format which will
save uncompressed so this way the full
quality is there in each and every frame
this way later on you could choose to
compress it or different codec whatever
you want to do with your video that's a
bit outside the scope so now the
question is what do you do with these
files so you could
bring them into the Final Cut Pro or
iMovie or MPEG Studio 15 9 zy Pluto
magic thing rainbow I don't know it's a
repo in there whatever it is you can
find your own software lots of software
can take an image sequence After Effects
will do this for you and render to a
movie it so happens that if you want the
sort of quick way of doing it
processing up here under the Tools menu
under tools there is a moviemaker tool
so if I go to click here movie maker and
select it it opens up an interface that
says this tool and you know if you can
read that this tool creates a QuickTime
movie from a sequence of images bla bla
bla gives you a bunch information all
sorts of thing you could do what I'm
going to do now is I'm going to go to
the finder I'm gonna find this output
folder and I'm going to drag this output
folder right here and then I'm going to
look here and say like okay my uh it's
it's it's giving me a default height of
640 by 480 but I want to change that
because my processing window itself was
640 by 360
what's the frame rate that I want oh and
I guess I could have clicked same size
as originals in which case it would just
use the size of the file and then I can
pick whether I want to have some sort of
compression I'm going to pick animation
which basically means no compression so
I'm gonna get a very big file but I'll
be able to bring it in to some other
software again if I'm using this in
after-effects it's going to need to be
recompressed later so I don't want to
compress multiple times so I could also
bring in a sound file if I wanted to
include some sound with it I'm not going
to worry about that and I'm going to hit
a create movie and it wants me to save
it somewhere I'm going to put it on the
desktop as test movie move and hit save
and did that already happen did it just
like do it so fast normally shows a
little progress window but maybe I just
had so little a test movie move I'm
going to open this up
come on QuickTime and yep so it just
happened so fast you can see it there it
is so now I have a movie file that I can
save Wow amazingly if it was longer you
would have probably seen a little
progress bar for it rendering it and you
can see this is just
a QuickTime movie that I'm playing
fantastic so that's the basic gist of it
in six minutes I kind of showed you the
main piece but I think we could do a
little bit more here because you might
be in a situation where you want to
start and stop the rendering to a file
you might want to be able to see some
information on the screen whether it's
rendering or not so I'm just going to
add a couple more pieces to this program
just to make it a little bit more
sophisticated okay so so one thing I'm
going to do is I'm going to create a
boolean variable called recording and
I'm going to assume that we're not
recording when the program first starts
so boolean recording equals false so and
then I'm going to say if recording this
is where I should save those frames so
the other thing I want to do by the way
now that I finished and made that movie
maybe you need backups and stuff but I'm
just going to go and delete that folder
because I don't want to save the
previous I don't need to save those
previous RAW files I have everything
that I need right here in QuickTime now
and I will just save that the movie file
again so now only if only if the boolean
variable recording is set to true will
it actually save those frames that's a
useful thing now what I'm going to do is
say let's say what I want to do is have
a way okay so if I say you know this
isn't that interesting let's use key
pressed so if I could say if key equals
R or key equals capital R recording
equals not recording so what this is
going to do is when I'm in JavaScript
Lander of function void what this is
going to do is it's going to say anytime
I press R on the keyboard it will start
recording or stop recording it's going
to toggle the boolean state of recording
if we're not true is false not false is
true so recording equals not itself if
it's false become true if it's true
become false so that's going to happen
there anytime I toggle it and you can
see like if I run this program
and I go to the files we can see that
it's not recording if I hit if I click
in here and I hit R you can see suddenly
new files are appearing
if I hit R again those new files will
have stopped so simply by adding a quick
little something to the program I can
kind of turn on and off the recording
now also what would be nice here is for
me be able to see some visual indication
on the screen as to whether it's
recording or not so what if I just right
here I say okay Phil red otherwise Phil
green and draw a circle I don't know at
the middle of the screen towards the
bottom that's like a circle so if we run
this you can see there's a little green
that this is like terrible visual design
but there's a little green circle there
when it's not recording and when I hit
record that circle turns red when I hit
record again that circle turns green I
don't know if those are the right colors
the right visual indicators you want but
you get the idea I can toggle the color
of that circle and know whether I'm
recording or not very useful but but are
you thinking in your mind oh no there's
a big problem I don't want a big ugly
green or red circle in my video but one
thing that's wonderful about the save
frame function is it's going to save the
current view of the processing window
and guess what the circle is drawn after
I call save frame so save frames going
to save what's in the window and then
draw the circle on top of that that
circle won't get saved to the file so we
should be able to see if I go back to
here and delete that I'm going to run
this and I want to start recording for a
little bit it's recording it's recording
it's recording recording I want to stop
recording and then I'm going to close
here I'm going to go and look let's just
look at these files
no green or red circle so we've done it
we're able to add a little visual
indicator into our window as to whether
it's recording or not I think that's the
gist of it I try so let's just like show
something sort of nice that we can do
here which is that if I were to run this
at 1920 by 1080 like super
high-resolution and I'm gonna I'm just
going to put print line a frame rate in
here so I'm going to run this you can
see that processing is not able to
render the game of life it's might be
hard for you to see this in this sort of
like captured video tutorial but it's
not able to run this super fast at such
high resolution and it's actually quite
fast you can see the frame rate is about
fourteen frames per second but I want to
make this glorious game of life
simulation that runs at 30 frames per
second so now if I do this and I hit
record you can see by the way it's
slowing down
also while recording because there is if
there's some energy and computation and
time that it takes to render these to a
file if I run this now run this to
render this to a file and I stop
recording and I skip out of the program
and I go back to tools movie maker and I
whoops go up here and I get this output
folder and I drag it into here it's the
same folder now this needs to be 1920 by
1080 and of course I could just select
the same size as originals framerate
create movie and I want to do test movie
1080 and hit save and you can see now
you're seeing the little progress window
it's just not doing it as fast this time
it's creating the movie didn't-didn't
them and then it's finished and I'm
going to go to the desktop to look at
what I've rendered and test movie 1080
I'm going to open this up converting so
that QuickTime can render it
come on QuickTime okay there we go
and we make this full screen and then
play it you can see I've got my 30
frames per second game of life
simulation all programmed in processing
so I don't know what just have some old
files in there so it like rendered at
the end that so it stitched two together
it's stitched like the high-resolution
one with the low resolution one two
that's kind of interesting so anyway you
can see all sorts of possibilities I
hope that this helps you with things
that you might be making a process you
can do this with 3d you could do this
with just about anything and let me know
how it goes for you so thanks for
watching this video and I will be back
soon with more videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
