standing in this video in front of a
particle system circles are falling from
the sky it is quite beautiful it is
lovely this is a example you will find
in processing examples under topics
simulate simple particle system why are
we looking at this we know how to draw a
circle on the screen we call the
function ellipse we know how to draw
perhaps a bunch of circles on the screen
we could say ellipse ellipse ellipse
lips lips lips lips lips and we'd have
five circles on the screen what if we
wanted to have several hundred circles
on the screen in that case we don't want
to have to write the code ellipse a
hundred times there's an obvious
solution to this it is saying hey you
know how to draw a circle draw that
circus this line of code draws a circle
well repeat that line of code 100 times
so this is what we want to learn how to
do today we want to understand how do we
take a line of code or multiple lines of
code repeat them multiple times so that
one concept the singular concept of a
particle falling can be done hundreds or
thousands of times over we're not going
to get to this particle system example
yet we'll start to see that when we get
to object-oriented programming examples
but we'll start with something simpler
so I'll leave this running there because
it's a nice little effect while we go
over here well hello okay so we know how
to write a conditional statement a
conditional statement is the clue to how
we will write a loop in this statement
so this is how we write a conditional
statement if some condition such as X is
less than with execute some code this is
a conditional statement if this
evaluates to true execute this code if
it evaluates to false don't execute that
code keep going so we actually have this
already set up in an example that I made
before structure this video does I never
ran it so hopefully this is going to
work
we'll find out it's good to find out so
let's run this example and we can see
here what's happening a circle is moving
across the screen because the value of X
is currently less than width so it's
incrementing it when that's no longer
true we stop incrementing it and it
stops the
those X +1 stops happening so that's a
conditional statement what is a loop a
loop once a looping statement but I
don't think anybody says that what is a
loop
well there are two kinds of loops
there's a while loop and a for loop
we're going to look first I'm getting
better at this back network thing at a
while loop okay
notice this conditional statement if X
is less than with execute this code a
while loop looks like this while X is
less less than with execute this code
exactly the same format with a major
major major difference my way major
difference the word if is here the world
the word the word while is there what is
this
if ensure this can happen this this code
that's here can happen 0 or 1 times it
can happen 0 times if that's false it
happens once if it's true how many times
can this live in this code occur it can
happen 0 times it could happen one time
it could happen 2 times all the way to
in theory an infinite number of times
it's going to do maybe you will write a
loop someday that will happen in
infinite number of times and then you
will also conquer the universe or
something but um so this is a very key
difference while this is true continue
executing this code while this is true
continuing executes its code if this is
true execute this code just once so let
us walk over and now change our if
statement to a while statement and let's
see what happens I'm walking over I'm
turning this way and here we are I think
I'm still in the shot ok so I'm going to
change this to a while and something
goofy happened with the screen turning
gray if I shake it around a little bit
everything's gone wrong I'm good
oh this was good video is going this is
like I feel like my best video yet now
it sort of fell apart ok we're fine ok
here we are let's look at the screen now
here we go while X is less than with x
equals x plus 1 x equals 0 let's run
this what's going to happen
hmm I didn't even see it move wait wait
wait are you sure about that let's run
that again run oh it's already there why
because it got to this moment and it
just did this coat over and over again
so the first time it drew the ellipse it
was already at the edge of the screen
because it incremented it over and over
and over again until it got to be with
and then went down to the bottom so this
is interesting while x equals x plus 1
so so what what's going on here well
first what would what's really happening
here let's take this code and put it
inside the while loop look I don't see
anything hmm what's going on there
interesting question ah so hard to
describe and I want to go back and draw
something but I want to keep this video
short this way this is why you practice
or you plan in advance there's a very
big problem going on here the first time
we go through and shouldn't we see X was
0 then X is 1 then 2 then 3 then 4 and
every one of those times we're drawing a
circle let's just see circles the whole
way across that's what you might expect
well that's what happened the first time
through draw the second time through
draw what was the value of x with so we
need to make sure with this particular
while loop that we reset X back to 0
every time through draw now look what
happened this is interesting looks kind
of like a streak of line across the
screen let's change this to x equals x
plus 20 now we see the purpose of a
while loop the purpose of a while loop
is to say repeat this code a bunch of
times how many times well if the width
is 400 and we're going up by 2400
divided by 20 is like 20 so maybe
there's 20 circles maybe there's 19 if
we're off by one who knows the point is
we have now successfully repeated a
single one circle many times with one
line of code I like standing this way
because I could point at the code so how
are we doing this x equals zero while x
is still less than with keep drawing
circles
the way up until X is no longer less
than with and then leave that leave
leave the while loop and go back and
circle through draw again this would be
a nice time for me asking few questions
but you're not really there but you
might have a question I guess at this
point just email me if you have a
question whatever there are some other
important things I wanted to say about
this this let's just look at this for a
second what would happen if ah this is
really good this is good what would
happen if I put mouse X in here this is
an interesting question I'm going to run
this code oh oh nothing I'm getting
nothing okay here's the essential
problem I forgot to put on a timer so I
have no idea how long this video has
been said Barbara I'm sure it's way
longer than I ever imagined or one
that's okay
you could stop now you could actually
just stop now going to the next video
but I'm going to say a couple of good
things hopefully so okay so let's look
at this while loop while X is less than
with draw a circle at an X location what
if I put here X is equal to zero and
then I said x equals X minus 1 what is
the major problem with this loop there
is no syntactical problem we've got
semicolons we've got parentheses even
curly brackets to the right place
everything is good but we have a
fundamental problem with this code x
equals 0 then X is negative 1 that's
less than with the nexus negative 2
that's lesson with this would get a
stuck in an infinite loop an infinite
loop which happens forever and ever and
can never break out we're never going to
get to end up draw we're never going to
see anything loops must always have an
exit condition and it is up to you to
make sure that that exit condition is
bet logically through the what however
you organize the logical thinking of
your code it's not prospects not going
to say like hey I'm looking at your code
and you know your eggs a condition
never be met if these possibilities
happen and this happens if this happens
you probably want to like look at that
again and make sure you're right better
code no it could only view the syntax
it's fine saying like I'll just keep
looping that's what you told me to do
I'm just going to do it no problem you
won't like the result because this is
what you're going to get so why do we
have an infinite loop in here why what
we're saying x equals x plus sorry Mouse
X well what value of Mouse X would give
us an infinite loop you might be
thinking 0 it's like if your watch Dora
the Explorer I say you shout 0 like you
could talk to the TV probably not
anyway I wish I could hear you sounding
0 but when the value is 0 X is not going
to increment it's never going to be
greater than with this is never going
false there's no exit condition so I
should just be able to move the mouse
now the value of Mouse x is like 200
right it's like it's or around 200
shouldn't I have my I should be exiting
my loop now the problem is Mouse X only
ever updates once through draw so if it
was 0 its 0 we're stuck in an infinite
loop so let's just get ourselves out of
that problem we have to write better
logic more sound logic so we don't have
that problem what is the way you might
get out of that problem well what if I
say if Mouse X is less than 1 say x
equals x plus 1 otherwise then it's okay
so in other words I am only allowing
there's other ways to solve this problem
but this is a nice simple way of using a
conditional statement whoa inside of
loop we have this is why blocks of code
are so important we have the loop block
of code and now we have another block of
code inside this is something you have
to get used to doing we want to say as
long as X is less than with you know and
if Mouse x is less than 1 we better go
up by one so we meet the exit condition
otherwise don't worry we can go up by
now sex because it's some positive
number eventually we'll get out of the
loop and here we go we're going to run
this now and we can see what is exciting
about this is that the displacement
between the circles is relative to Mouse
X right here Mouse X is probably around
50 or something so it's probably a
terrible estimation of the pixels but
you can see what's happening here and
when Mouse X is zero
it just increments by one so so this is
a while</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
