have been a bit haphazard but now that
we've looked kind of at an overview we
looked at the Wolfram Elementary CA and
have the lights on and we looked at the
game of life I want to just kind of give
you a quick list of exercises or things
you might think about it in terms of
taking these systems a little bit
further as well as tying them back to
some of the stuff we've looked at in
previous videos so I'll kind of talk
through these briefly it should be a
short video and hopefully as time goes
on I will be able to expand this or
include links to below to some exercises
or other implementations that are
examples of this so a one thing that you
might start with it first is simply you
know the ca doesn't have to be a perfect
grid of cells right what if it is a
whole bunch of tiled triangles or
arbitrary polygons or some sort of like
crazy
asure like tiling how would you have
this cell state change based on its
neighbors an example of that that I do
actually have over here which you can
find is exercise 7.9 is what if you have
this cell's hexagonal and you can see
each cell it's a hexagon has six
neighbors what type of rule sets and
what type of things could you do there
so for those of you who are kind of
interested in designing your own
patterns if you've made a pattern
could you make turn your pattern into a
CA to create some sort of animation etc
you also might think about it in 3d
which I have which I've kind of alluded
to previously what if you had a cube and
what would its neighbors be and what
could you do in terms of stacking or
three-dimensional design that way
another thing that you might think about
and this would be a sort of simple
exercise to implement is probability
what if you said in the game of life
instead of a cell dying when it's over
populated when it's over populated it
has an 80% chance of dying what type of
behavior would you get if you made the
outcomes they tied to probabilities and
what if those probabilities changed over
time another thing you might think about
is this idea of a continuous state so
we've only looked really scratched the
surface of states 0 or 1 alive or dead
black or white if you look if you look
at Wolfram's new kind of science there
is a wide variety of implement
with with with larger states you know
four possible states 8 possible States
but something you could think about is
what if the state is a floating-point
number between 0 and 1 point oh the
reason that could be useful is you a lot
of things we do in computer programming
the data is it could be a map to numbers
between 0 1 point oh that's nothing to
think about
I mentioned image processing in the
previous video but this is really really
key so if you're looking for an
application of this that you know might
relate to an interactive system are you
doing something with depth data from the
Kinect are you doing something with live
images from a camera from a movie could
you create some type of special effect
motion graphics effect over an image
through CA like rules and this is
nothing new this is what a blur is this
is what a sharpen filter are and I
mentioned stuff about that in the
previous video how could this cell how
could as the color be the state of a
cell and a new color that changes over
time be tied to a neighboring set of
colors so I'll try to include a link
below to an effect that has to do with
water ripple effect so if you think of
the heights of the cellular automata
being filled with the height of water
and L if we have a lake which all the
water is even and we drop a pebble into
it and one part of that water height
changes how does that height ripple out
into neighboring cells so could we do a
one rippling look effect with with Cas
historical I think we also mentioned
what if you were to design a CA where
it's state is not just computed by the
states that are in the previous
generation but many generations over
time or a state in the game of life it's
been alive for a really long time what
would happen to that cell or dead for a
long time moving cells I think this is
perhaps the one I should start the most
I think one of the reasons for looking
at this is you know the CAS are
interesting unto themselves and we can
do projects with them they tiny image
processing but really if we're thinking
about it we had that flocking system in
that flocking system all of these Boyd's
what if we thought of those boys as
having a state and that state somehow
defined its behavior the way it steered
what it was looking for what was doing
the way it looked
what if those what if that CA all these
are Sal
essentially but they're moving and their
neighborhood changes based on who
happens to be next then at a given point
of time so this is a way of taking our
flocking simulation - I hate to say this
but to the next level right what if
those voids in addition to following
these rules actually have states that
change based on their neighbors and the
states drive their motion behaviors so
this is something that would HIGHLY
encourage you to look at if you're if
you're kind of in your thinking about
expanding the ways to simulate systems
of moving elements and then you know
that there's also this kind of idea of
nesting complex systems right you know
this is so this is that you know the
world is a nested place right I don't
know I I
organ is a system of I am a system of
organs this I made a room by myself but
I teepee here is a system of people the
world is a system of I teepees no but
you get the idea right people the city
is a system of people the world is the
system of cities the universal system of
world right this idea of nested complex
systems like this terrible was a
terrible explanation but I think you're
getting the point right what if you made
what if you had a flocking system where
each boyd is actually a little mini Jima
game of life or if you made a CA which
is a grid of cells and each cell on that
grid is its own grid of cells so how
could you what would you accomplish with
nesting complex systems in a way or CAS
and flocking systems in a way that could
be introduced interesting results with
varying levels of zoom okay so this is I
guess this video was just kind of a list
of exercises and thoughts of things you
might pursue I hope that this you can
find ideas here for projects you might
want to make and and I guess I'm hoping
with these videos that I'm making calls
I haven't really pushed on this is that
videos like this could inspire or kind
of out of the video like this could come
become a little community of projects
that people are making and links to them
that relate back to some of these topics
okay I hope I was recording I was I
think this is the last video on CAS and
the next video series will be on
fractals</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
