getting close there's just this moment
it's I can see it there's two bubbles
we're student going to have a thousand
bubbles it's very exciting
so we're what do we have so far we know
how to declare this list of numbers
integers we don't really look at an
example that used a list of integers and
maybe that's a bit of a mistake and I'll
try to fit that in again somewhere but
you know think about that how might you
do that but what I want to move straight
to is saying let's apply this thinking
to these bubbles and instead of having
separate bubble object variables let's
have a single list of bubble objects so
if we look at this syntax the first
thing we have is the type of the array
now we're going to have a type bubble
the object bubble we need to make sure
it's going to be an array great we need
to give our array a name let's call it
bubbles the wires a good job is just
thinking of the wire cuz the name
bubbles but you didn't really need to
know that I think there should be some
magic way where I could just like edit
out unnecessary thoughts okay um and
then we need to say how many bubbles are
we going to have in our array we're
going to have to we're not getting very
ambitious here we're getting with this
very very basic simple we're gonna have
just two um I also by the way notice
that I there's this little monitor that
I look at which is slightly above the
camera if I'm always looking above the
camera but if I look this way I'm
looking right at the camera right at you
okay so let's try to apply this here so
what's going on
look bubble let's close this bubble be
one bubble b-two
first of all you know we really should
have done this just to get us in that
frame of reference of thinking of
counting from zero for the rest of your
life you should just count from zero
from now on always start at zero okay uh
so what I want to do is instead of
having two separate variables I want to
have an array called bubbles it's going
to be of type double it's got the
brackets of Venus's an array the name is
bubbles and it has two bubbles in it you
know it's a lot of bubble everywhere but
you know
this is what's happening to us right now
so we can get rid of this now instead of
initializing a single bubble we can now
refer to the bubbles by their index
value we can say bubbles index 0 make a
new bubble bubbles index 1 make a new
bubble so it's like we had two separate
variables but both of those variables
exist as spots in a list you can imagine
this list with two spots in it and
there's one bubble here and another
bubble there ok so what do we do now we
need to take this idea and say bubbles 0
ascend bubbles 0 display bubbles 0 top
bubbles 1 ascend bubbles 1 display
bubbles 1 top there we go we have the
identical program just what we had
before okay so you know what I'm just
going with this well I'm experimenting
with shorter videos this has only been
like two two and a half minutes but
let's actually stop here so this is a
good obviously this is a huge problem
right we have kind of done nothing to to
get towards our goal of having a
thousand bubbles right yes we put it in
a list but we still had individual lines
of code for each bubble we have to say
bubble zero do all the functions bubbles
one all the functions then if we had a
thousand two and three and four all the
way up to 999 so we're on the way there
but we're missing an important step and
that important step is going to be using
a loop and that's what we're gonna do in
the next video but let's take a moment
to pause here and what I would say to
you as an exercise is go find something
where you had an object and try to make
an array of those objects try to make
multiple objects but use the array don't
just and refer to which object by its
index value and you can do interesting
things like I could say if I wanted to
that this second one shouldn't bother to
ascend only the first one and you can
see that the second one now doesn't have
that function called on it so it's just
laying there at the bottom so that's
what I would say to you make it take
something take your object that you made
make
an array of them and try to see how that
works</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
