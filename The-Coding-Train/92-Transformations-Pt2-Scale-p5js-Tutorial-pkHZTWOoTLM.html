little bit of a part two tutorial about
transformations and what I want to do is
show you what the scale function does
and I don't know that this merits its
own video but I didn't fit in it -
laughs what so that's why I'm doing it
so what does the scale function do so
first of all we see and there's some
other important details that mcfillin
about pushing top perhaps in this video
so we established that translate moves
the point of origin if you translate to
some point you're translating where the
origin is and you're drawing everything
relative to that new location rotate
rotates the view of the canvas so that
as you draw things it appears as if the
shapes are rotating itself so so if we
were rotate by an angle and then draw
something at 0-0 relative to its corner
we might see a rectangle something like
this rotated by some angle scale
stretches everything out or shrinks
everything relative also to zero zero
and there's some really goofy stuff you
can do with scale so scale can actually
take one argument or scale can take two
arguments so I could scale the same
amount along the X and the y axis or I
could scale I could stretch something
along the x axis and shrink something
along the y axis plus I can also put
negative numbers in here and what
negative numbers do is they not so so
what is the number what is it if I put
one everywhere this just means 100% the
default scale that's just what it is if
I were to put two in here suddenly the
rectangle will be twice the size I've
scaled it by 200% point five I've shrunk
it 50% if so I could do two if things
are the different axes the X X and the
y-axis but I can also like flip the axis
so if I were to flip the axis that means
this rectangle would now appear over
here we sort of draw in the other
direction so I can actually use scale to
say Y doesn't point down but Y points up
which sometimes you want to do if you
want to you know create some type of
simulation where you're thinking about
the coordinate system differently so
let's go take a look at this now in
action
so if I have this sketch here we're now
all I'm doing is that I have a simple
transformation where I'm translating the
center and I'm rotating the view so that
this rectangle rotates around on its own
I can do things like say scale for let's
just say scale for and now I have this
much larger rectangle notice this is
something very important something very
important about this look at this what's
the difference between st. scale for and
just saying draw the rectangle instead
of 100 comma 50 let's multiply that by 4
400 comma 200
so let's actually I'm going to comment
out now scale 4 and I'm going to say
rectangle 0 0 400 comma 200 the math is
kind of the same here I'm now drawing it
4 times the width 4 times the height now
I'm gonna refresh and watch closely what
is the what's different just gonna look
the same just look different think about
it think about it think about it well
it's the same size but look at the
outline now the outline is only one
pixel wide because the stroke weight is
1 so scale is not just making things
bigger in the sense that shapes now have
a larger width and height but it's
actually zooming in on that
two-dimensional shape to make your view
of the window scaled up so even the
width of the stroke gets bigger and so
if I go back to here we can do things
like you know I could scale according to
you know Mouse X divided by 100 so if I
do that we can see it's kind of like a
3d effect it's creating a 3d effect in
2d but similarly to how you might work
with something like a map API where
you're zooming in and out of a map for
more detail or less detail and this is
something I would like to do in a future
coding challenge which is to create a
kind of 2d zoom and pan of a scene and
you could do that now of everything I'm
giving you because if I just add
translate to this right if I'm able to
like move the mouse around to translate
then I also have pan essentially you
know how do I click and drag and is
there an offset and that they the
interactivity there's a little tricky
but it's certainly possible so that's
the main thing to say about scale let's
look at
let's look at what what it means to do
this with different values so I could
say scale for in the x-direction and 0.5
in the y-direction as you can see this
weirdness I've like stretched it out
along the X but shrug it's very weird to
look at this let's let's actually say
Mouse X divided by 100 Mouse Y divided
by 100 so let's see what that looks like
so you can see here and it's a little
confusion off also just to make this a
little bit more clear so you can see
this is me now kind of stretching it and
scaling it in in other directions now
one thing I want to do here hold hold on
is I'm gonna say I'm gonna just put
scale 1 comma 1 and I'm going to take
out rect mode Center so look the
rectangle is now drawn route with the
corner at 0 0 off to the right
what if I were to say scale negative 1
scale negative 1 so just negative in the
X direction now the everything goes the
other way so this is quite interesting
and I could back up for a second and put
the rotation back and actually say let's
leave let's put the scale is so now I
have this notice how it's rotating
clockwise clockwise if I say scale 1 and
then negative 1 here oh whoa it's still
rotating clockwise I took a little break
there to figure this out because I kind
of like my mind stopped working I
thought when i chant let's let let me
let me step you through this so I'm
going to turn the rotation off and let
me put scale back to 1 comma 1 so this
is the rectangle drawn pointing down Y
points down if I were to change the Y
scale to negative 1 now Y points up so
that rectangle is drawn up in the
upwards direction and then I added
rotate back in and shouldn't if Y now
points up shouldn't also rotate
backwards well it's not rotating
backwards it's still rotating the same
way but once again I forgot about order
of opera
nations rotate happens before scale so I
rotate the view and then I flip the Y so
it's drawing at the other direction but
it's rotating still before I scale so
this is now before rotate look what
happens now now let's rotate now of
course I could if I just wanted to
rotate the other way I could just rotate
by a negative angle I don't need to use
scale for that the speed of rotation the
animal rotation that could all be
controlled true math that wasn't the
point but this actually comes up because
a great scenario for this is what if you
want to take an image and mirror it so
you want to draw the image mirrored well
you might think I'll rewrite all the
pixels in the opposite direction you can
actually use scale to flip the image and
draw it in the reverse direction and
this can be something that you could try
if you're working with it isn't that
sort of thing all right so that's what I
want to say about scale if you're
looking for a challenge to do try to
make a scene that you can sign it zoom
it almost as if like a map that you can
zoom and pan around in a 2d way using
scale push/pop translate rotate if you
do that share it with me
I would love to check it out and
hopefully I'll interest I'll come back
and do that in decoding John's video I'm
gonna do one more video just in case I
forgot anything I want to talk a little
bit about why it's called push and pop
and why there are some other functions
that have this like matrix word in it
you should probably just skip that video
watch I haven't made it yet
I mean maybe when you're watching this
it'll be there or won't be there I'll
come out but I'm gonna try so who knows
maybe it'll be fine see you thank you
