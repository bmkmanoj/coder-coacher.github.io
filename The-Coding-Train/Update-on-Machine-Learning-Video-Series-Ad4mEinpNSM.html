apologize please stop don't throw the
tomatoes the green wall will have
Tomatoes flats on them but I'm here just
to give a quick update about the my
machine learning videos that I have a
playlist called ten neural networks -
the nature of code I was making these
videos over the summer then I had this
moment where I was like riding along on
a bicycle and I was thinking way too
much about machine learning I had a bump
fell over I broke my elbow I had surgery
on it twice I lost a couple months of
like being able to make content and then
the fall started so unfortunately I was
in the middle of this series I was at
ten point seven I had made seven videos
that's crazy and every time I upload a
video now comments asking could I please
continue that series and I am planning
to continue it what I do here on the
coding train is I make videos about
stuff that I'm currently teaching at my
full-time job here at New York
University and currently what I'm
teaching is an introduction to
programming course and of course about
text analysis so I am going to be making
some videos about chatbots which is kind
of adjacent to a machine learning can be
a tool to drive a chatbot I'm also gonna
make some videos about hopefully long
term short long short term I can't
remember I don't have long or short term
memory but some of these recurrent
neural networks for text generation and
then I my hope is that I will be coming
back to this playlist again after this
semester is over or towards the end of
the semester if I finished up some of
the content so in the meantime I hope to
continue to have some github
repositories where I'm gonna be making
some new examples so stay in touch with
me on Twitter and I would recommend to
you well as you've seen as a guest on my
channel Suraj has a channel about deep
learning and also this is a new video
that just came out from one of my
favorite channels three blue one Brown
but what is a neural network deep
learning part one so now we have an
internet competition we'll deep learning
part to come out before
10.8 the answer is almost a definite yes
so please write all of your complaints
in the comments here I'm going to read
them I'm going to sit with some sort of
like meditative cucumber eye mask thing
on and I'm going to listen to all of
your feedback about why I should do this
right now instead of the other stuff
that I'm doing now and then I will feel
guilty for a while and then eventually
these videos will come out okay so
thanks for watching this short little
video explanation and I'll see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
