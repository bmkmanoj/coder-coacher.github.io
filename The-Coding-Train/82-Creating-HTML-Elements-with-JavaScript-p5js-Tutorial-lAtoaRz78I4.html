can use JavaScript to create HTML
element Dom elements on the fly in code
so what happened in the previous video
if I if i run this p5.js project you can
see here there are some there's a
there's an h1 element there's a
paragraph element and there's a canvas
where did those things come from
so the clips in the previous video I
looked at how in in the HTML file you
can add things inside body like this h1
element gets added and appears on the
page this paragraph elements gets added
and appears on the page but there's a
canvas on the page I don't see the
canvas here so how did that canvas get
added the way that canvas got got added
was in JavaScript
create canvas 200 200 so if you want to
have things already on the page that you
want to sort of like manually set their
layout and content you can put that
stuff in the HTML file if you want your
code to generate elements you can
generate those elements from your p5
file and in this scenario I'm generating
just the canvas now incidentally you
could certainly manually add a canvas as
a tag and access it from JavaScript but
this is not something that I'm really
doing in these videos I want to sort of
focus on the the canvas is kind of where
p5 is kind of like a special case in and
create canvas using p5 is kind of a nice
way of just quickly getting the case off
to the page that aside what I want to
look at is what if you want your code to
make the paragraph or what if you want
your code to make that header element
and of how does that work so you can see
to make the canvas I said create canvas
magic erased whiteboard because I had a
technical difficulty but now I'm back
here so what I'll do here now is make a
list of some of these other create
functions so you know that there is
create canvas this makes a canvas appear
on the page and then there are several
other create blank func
available P 5gs to add other kinds of
HTML elements so here are a few create P
create div create button create image
IMG the list goes on and on and on and
on so in the in the description of this
video when I upload it I'll add a link
to the dom reference where you can see
all of these is a list of all these
functions so let's now now a couple
things about this all of these are going
to need some sort of argument that goes
in here and it's going to be different
so what do you need to create a
paragraph versus what do you need to
create a button create sliders a really
interesting one that I would like to get
to at some point but let's start off
simply with just create P ah and I
forgot sort of a crucial detail but
let's start off with create P and I'll
come back to that detail so right here
and set up after create canvas I'm going
to say create P this is you know what's
something besides I don't know my
favorite color is purple sometimes it's
pink every once a while it's like orange
but mostly it's purple you guys need to
know this about me okay now here we go
and look at this look at that there's
another paragraph on the page and I may
be a little bit too excited about this I
don't usually drink coffee nights of
coffee today that idea um so here you
can see here's the header then I put in
the HTML h1 tag here's the paragraph
that I put in the HTML here's the canvas
that I created with JavaScript and
here's the paragraph that I created with
JavaScript so there's a big question
here which is why would I do one versus
the other and I think what we can do
what I could do to answer that question
right now is just say just breathe
right now it doesn't really matter but
at one place put it the other place who
really cares
um you just want to like experiment play
around get stuff happening on the page
as I show you s'more and more examples
as we go through more and more scenarios
I think there will the that question the
answer to that question will reveal it
themselves the answers were real
sells but in other words different
scenarios there could be advantages to
why you might want to generate some Dom
elements on the fly you know maybe
you're randomly picking different texts
maybe you're making a thousand of them
right versus whether you want to like
set some stuff up in advance so that's
sort of like an important topic I want
to revisit that question over and over
again right now I just want to see that
both are possible okay
so and and we can do some weird things
like I can add function like I don't
have to just do that in setup I can add
in the mousepressed function right the
mousepressed function which fires
anytime I click the mouse anywhere on
the page right any time I click look I'm
getting another paragraph and I can
scroll down we can see and I could start
to do things like you know my favorite I
could say my favorite number is and then
give a random number between 0 and 10
and we give myself a little more room
here right now I'm going to run this and
you can see click click click I get a
different random number and so this is a
reason why I might want to generate
those elements in JavaScript because I
want the number to be random because I
want to do it when the user clicks the
mouse so I don't know how many times the
Jews are going to click the mouse
whereas I'm answering the question now I
know that at the top I just wanted to
say I am making a video so I can put
that in the HTML in advance there's no
reason for me to create that in
JavaScript so this is this balance that
we need to strike so create canvas
create P there are other ones create
button create image creative I my
suggestion to you might be just try like
adding them in your code see what
happens but I do want to emphasize
something in this particular sketch
there is an h1 element at the top I'll
see getting exercise here there is no
create h1 function in p5 now you could
say to yourself like what why not isn't
that an oversight shouldn't there be a
create I really think that should be a
create h1 and you could have this
discussion but I think the point is p5
includes some create X functions for the
sort
common Dom elements you might want to
generate with code there are a lot of
kind of HTML tags
there's list tags and ordered list tags
and under unordered list typing it would
be unrealistic and would sort of bloat
the reference to have a create plan for
every single kind of HTML element for so
in all other cases you can always say
create element to create element
function allows you to make any Dom
element any HTML element and the first
argument is the tag itself and the
second argument is you know the content
that goes inside that tag so let's look
at adding that right now here if I come
back in setup I can say create element
h1 and then I can say my favorite
numbers below and now when I run this
you can see I made this header in a Java
Script I made the canvas then this h1
element and now every time I click the
mouse I get one of the paragraph
elements below so this is what's
possible for you now you can this this
JavaScript code is sitting is loaded
into this page it runs as soon as the
page loads the page has some content
built into it and then JavaScript add
some content to it it adds a canvas it
adds an h1 element and add some
paragraphs so I think I'm going to stop
this end so what I would say to you now
is in for your next exercise take the
sketch you made before with a few dumb
few things in the HTML now try adding
some HTML elements from p5 itself using
these p5 functions and the next video
I'm going to show you some tricks for
how to manipulate those elements have
them change and do some things on the
fly ok so I'm going to stop now and stop</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
