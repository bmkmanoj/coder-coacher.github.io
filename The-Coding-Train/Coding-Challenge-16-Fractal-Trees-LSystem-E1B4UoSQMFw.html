challenge this is a coding challenge all
about L systems I'm going to make this
beautiful tree I think it's a little
beautiful but you will hopefully make it
even more beautiful one after watching
this video but I'm going to make this
tree up here in the browser using HTML
using javascript and so what do I want
to do here I want to define what an
l-system is look at how the algorithm
works and then build the code for
rendering an l-system from scratch ok so
what is an l-system L the L stands for
Lindenmayer for Irish did Lindenmayer a
hungarian botanist who developed this
algorithm for modeling cellular growth
so how what is what you can read more
about L systems I've got the sort of
Wikipedia page here as a reference but
what I'm going to do is just kind of
define for you the guts of it that's
sort of like the actual terminology
associated with an L system so an L
system is actually all text-based we're
going to use it to generate graphics but
at its core it's just text-based and it
involves a few things it involves an
alphabet for example my alphabet might
be the letters A or B these are also
sometimes known as variables it involves
an axiom meaning what is the beginning
of our L system err else Testim begins
with an axiom for example an axiom could
be a and then it involves a set of rules
meaning something like a becomes a B and
B well hold on look I have actually the
one that I want to start with which is
sort of a becomes a b and b becomes a ok
so look at that
I just wanted to use since the up and B
becomes a I don't know I don't the
camera switch while I was doing that but
so it has a set of rules so what does
this mean so an l-system is a recursive
way of generating sentences over and
over again using string replacement so
this is the set of elements in the L
system and we start with the axiom a and
this is generation 0 and in generation 1
we apply these rules to it
becomes a be a becomes a beep and now we
do this again I have generation to a be
a becomes a B B becomes a and generation
3 Hey because I'll stop doing this
eventually a becomes a B B becomes a and
a becomes a B hopefully I did this right
item manually as a human being kind of
doing this string replacement I could
easily get it wrong or contect me
forever be very tedious this is the kind
of thing a computer is perfectly
beautifully well-suited to do and what
what we have here is with this type of
system these kind of recursive fractal
like structures appear in the text the
resulting text itself so it's up to you
to say aha I have this system I've
designed it I have an alphabet I have an
axiom I have a set of rules
I should write rules here and now I've
generated these sentences what do I do
with the sentence it could be read it as
poetry a B a a B or perhaps you use it
to be a song a B a a B or with rhythm or
you tie it to graphics you know this
means a dot this means a square and you
draw a pattern on the screen so you
could imagine there's a lot of ways you
could interpret the L system and what
I'm going to do is first program just
this string replacement structure and
then I'm going to show you how you can
use a certain kind of alphabet to
indicate things like draw a line forward
turn right turn left and create all
sorts of patterns in particular plant
like patterns on the screen ok here we
go coming back over here so we've got
this down now and let's start writing
the code for it so this is the what I
want this is the one I want to do first
and I called it variables here so I'm
going to go to I've got a JavaScript
I've got a JavaScript file here I'm
working in the browser using the p5.js
javascript framework and i'm going to
just put this here at the top and
comment it out
so what do I want to do I want to start
with
and axiom and I'm going to say that
axiom is a now I also need to have some
rules so what would be a good way of
creating a rule in JavaScript a way I
could do that is I could make it a
JavaScript object like I could say a
whenever I see a it becomes a B and I
could say that's rule one and then I
could say rule 2 is B becomes a so now
again this is a highly manual way of
doing this and a and B are my own
made-up things and oh you know it's a
little bit confusing that I did that
because the alphabet so maybe I should I
just it's fine I'll use it once I get to
the next example it'll be a little less
weird-looking but the point is a becomes
B so I'm looking for a and whenever I
see a I substitute it with B so now
let's just I'm going to write a function
and call it generate and what I'm going
to do is in a set up I'm going to say
I'm going to say no canvas and I'm going
to use the P Phi and I don't need draw
right now I'm going to use the P Phi
function called create P which creates a
paragraph element in the page pause get
it back okay so I'm using create P and I
want to say create P axiom and I'm going
to run this now in the browser over here
and we can see there we go I have the
letter A appearing so the first axiom
has appeared so now what I need to do in
generate is what I want to say is I need
to look at every letter in the current
sentence and use and substitute using
the rules so I'm going to say for int I
equals 0 I is less than axiom dot length
I plus plus and you know what I want to
have a new variable and I'm going to
call it sentence and sentence is going
to start with the axiom so I'm going to
say sentence dot length I plus plus
then I'm going to say the current
current card character equals sentence
car at I so what I'm doing is I'm
looking at this is a something you do
with strings in JavaScript I can look at
each character one by one and pull it
out and I can say here if current equals
rule one dot a then and now what I also
need I need next I need next sentence
which is an empty string so what I need
to do is build up the next sentence if
current equals the a part of a rule then
next sentence should get B so if it
equals a substitute be in else if
current equals rule one B next sentence
plus equal rule sorry Rule two a so
right if it matches a from rule one
substitute in be from rule one if it
matches a from rule to substitute in be
from rule two otherwise just keep it so
there are cases where you have a
character and it doesn't match any of
the rules in that case you just keep
that same character so keep current in
so if current is if current is a is rule
one say put in rule ones B if current is
rule tuesday put in rule 2's be if it's
not any of the rules
just keep current and then at the end of
this the sentence should be now then the
actual current sentence is now the next
sentence so I'm going to I'm going to
Sten I'm going to say create P sentence
so now and then so when do i generate so
let's make a button VAR button equals
create button generate so create button
is a function that's in the p5 Dom
library and
attach an event to it and that event is
generate so I want whenever I press the
mouse on that button I want to call that
generate function so I want to go
something or remove some of this
unnecessary styling and now I'm going to
refresh this page whoops
so sketch is line 20 I have some sort of
error oh I used int it should be var and
I've got okay so now you can see here I
have this generate button and I have the
axiom there and I see a B a baa-baa B
and you can see I hopefully this is
right I'm going to generate a bunch of
times and you can see I'm generating
sentence after sentence here so so this
is the idea so you know I could do this
forever and ever and ever I'm sort of
under I'm sure to curious why it's not
like word wrapping but I'm sure that's
just some sort of CSS styling that I
could fix to make it a wrap to the next
line or whatever anyway let's not worry
about that so you see that this is the
idea that works all I need to do is
create an algorithm for generating a for
starting with an axiom having a set of
rules and iterating and doing string
replacement now III did some kind of
sloppy things with that just to sort of
like make it work it would make much
more sense for this to be an array and
for me to say something like rules index
zero equals this and rule in it and
rules index one so it makes much more
sense for me to have the rules be in an
array because there's no reason for me
to be checking both of those as separate
else if statements when I could really
just say for I equals zero I is less
than rules length I plus plus and I
can't use I because I already used I so
this has to be J so what I want to do is
instead of checking each rule
individually because what if a else
system I have eventually has like ten
different rules this will become a mess
so in that sense I can say if current
equals which ever rules index J then
next sentence should equal rules index J
dot B and then what I can do is I can
put a break here
so I can once I can sort of get out of
the loop as soon as if I because more
than one rule can't be true so I can get
out of that and then what I need to do
though however is I need to figure out
how way of adding if none of the rules
if none of the rules are met are found
then keep that current character so one
way I can do that is I can say found is
false and if I found one of the rules
found is true and then at the end once
I've gone through all the rules I can
say if not found next sentence plus
equals current so this would make sure
so this should be identical to what I
had before and if I run this we should
see the same exact result now we aren't
really sure one thing I should do to
make sure this is really working is I
should change this to have this actually
become like ABC to make sure the C's
continue through there at which they do
so you can see this is still working so
now I have a bit more of a flexible
system by which I could just create an
array of rules it doesn't matter how
many rules it'll still work okay now
we've got the basic mechanics of the L
system down the next thing I need to do
is do something more to draw from it so
what I want to show you is I want to now
use this particular L system so these
are the letters of the alphabet for this
L system F plus minus open bracket close
bracket we start with F and this is the
rule seems like a crazy rule but it's
actually gonna do something quite
interesting so what I want to do is here
I want to start with F and actually I
only have one rule so this is actually a
much simpler scenario which F becomes
this and now I should be able to run
this start with F and you can see now
it's now it's wrapping but you can see
this is what I get even just in the
third generation this is what I get so
this looks totally insane but this is
actually incredible
these are entire instructions for
growing this elaborately complex plant
like shape you know and this is really
magic and you can get the computational
beauty of nature or
algorithm beauty of plants there's all
these books and research where you can
find countless numbers of these kinds of
L systems or you can invent your own to
create these patterns but let's make
this one happen so all that we've done
so far is we've only made a program that
renders the text to the screen now what
I need to do is have a program that
reads the text and draws to the window
so how do I do that so I'm going to go
back and I'm going to get rid of no
canvas and I'm going to say create
canvas 400 400 and I'm going to say
background 51 so let's make sure there's
now a canvas appearing great this is
still working but now I want to see is
every time I hit generate I want to read
this text and draw to the drops of the
screen based on it okay so so let's do
that let's now write a function and I'm
going to call this function turtle so
I'm calling it turtle is because I'm
going to interpret this particular text
like a turtle graphics engine what is
turtle graphics so the concept of a
turtle comes from an old programming
language called logo or you could write
code to move a tribe to instruct a
turtle how to move around the screen and
as the turtle is moving around the
screen the turtle is drawing lines so
you could say things like f means move
forward so move forward and draw a line
plus means turn right
- means turn left and what's especially
sophisticated about the turtle graphics
engine that we're about to implement is
that these brackets mean save where you
were so you could be a turtle moving
around the screen at any point you could
say save and you could keep moving and
then you could um then you could say
restore and go back to there and move
from there and that's going to create a
lot of sophisticated possibilities so
what I need now is in the code is to
write a loop and just go through every
single character in that sentence and
I'm going to say current again equals
sentence car at AI so now what do I need
to do if current
equals F I need to draw a line zero zero
zero negative length so this is somewhat
arbitrary but I'm going to start with
the default mechanic that I want to have
this be my original position and I want
to start drawing the line up so from 0 0
up to they are then I want to say else
if current equals plus then I want to
say rotate by I'm going to I'm going to
try pi divided by 6 which I don't think
is right but I'll just start with that
else if current equals minus rotate pi
divided by 6 on the negative direction
else if current equals bracket open
bracket push push
is the function in p5 which is save the
transformation state so I'm going to
move around with translated rotate and
push is going to be save else if current
equals close bracket I'm going to say
pop so now I'm going to pop so this is
everything like this is the thing I
don't even have to really like hit much
about it like all the magic is happening
in this L system itself I just have to
write the instructions to know what to
do but I didn't miss something so one of
the things that I have to do is when I
draw this line I then have to translate
to move to the end of the line so in
addition to drawing the line and we come
back over here I need to say translate 0
negative length so I need to move to the
end of the line so that I kind of draw
the next line or rotate from there and
that sort of thing so and then we need
this to be a variable and say length
equals 100 so what I want to do now is
skewed let me find there's so much stuff
going on here what I want to do is
whenever I generate I want to call so
call turtle so I'm going to call turtle
once and set up just so the axiom is
drawn and then whenever I after I
finished generating I want to
call turtle again okay so here we go so
I know I don't see the line okay so
let's let's see if we can figure this
out turtle foot first of all draw let's
draw the background again and then do
stroke 255 oh I know why we don't see
anything so where is the line being
drawn it's being drawn from 0 0 up so I
need to actually at the beginning make
sure 0 0 is positioned at the bottom of
the window so the very first thing I
need to do in setup before any time
before I call turtle is I need to say
translate to the middle of the screen
and the bottom of the screen and oh
there we go so now you see F the
sentence is currently only F so all I
have is that one line now look at this
let me do generate and now we have F F
plus save plus F minus F minus F restore
etc so let's look at this now
it went crazily off the screen now why
did that happen something weird is going
on here so let's let's investigate this
back after a technical problem I added
in reset matrix in this turtle function
because I'm not using the draw loop this
guarantees that I'll always start my
translations and rotations over again
each time about to draw this else system
does that fix this issue just with the
way that I'm doing it right now so now
you'll see if I hit refresh you can see
that I'm drawing F when the sentence is
only F I just draw one single line
forward and now when the sentence is FF
Plus save plus F then I'm saying go
forward go forward TURN RIGHT save go go
turn right again
go forward turn left go forward turn
left go forward then come back then turn
left so you can see we could you this is
a great exercise for you to do on a
Saturday afternoon outside in the park
you know copy down one of these
sentences and like get out graph paper
and try to be the L system but you can
see here now I got to do is hit generate
again and something much more complex is
happening but I sort of have lost the
picture I don't see what's going on so a
couple things are missing one is I
picked a random angle to rotate by pi
divided by six which isn't actually the
angle
to be used with this particular L system
so let me first fix that so I'm going to
go into the code and I'm going to make a
variable called angle and in in setup
I'm just going to say angle equals
radians 25 so 25 degrees I believe is
the angle meant to be used with this and
then here I could just say rotate
instead of pi divide 6 by angle and
negative angle so now I have a variable
I could change so let's run this again
I guess maybe PI divided by 2 by 2 625
and I'm losing mine looks the same
I really losing my mind but regardless
of that the issue I'm gonna have to
check that in a second the issue is that
with more and more generations I
actually want to shrink the length that
I'm drawing all this stuff so it would
make sense here in the generate function
to each time I generate I could say
length x equals 0.5 so now you can see
that's how I start then next ends next
then type so I had it right maybe pi
divided by 6 was right all along I'm
gonna do one more generation and you can
see how intricate this becomes and what
you know what I might like to do is just
give this a tiny bit of alpha so we can
zoom in on it here and generate generate
generate generate and so you know at a
certain point it's so much for it to
draw but you can see I've got this full
structure beautiful structure now you
just try to imagine drawing this through
some of her mechanism so I encourage you
to play around with this go investigate
find other else systems plug them into
this example see what kinds of patterns
you get the other thing that you might
think about is if you watched my one of
my previous videos about how to turn a
fractal tree into a whole set of branch
objects that you could apply physics to
you can also do the same thing with this
particular example and if people are
interested at some point I could release
an example that does that or make
another video that converts this into
that so thanks for watching this L
system video hope you go forth and make
some L systems and let me know how it
goes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
