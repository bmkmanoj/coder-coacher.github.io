my name is Dan Schiffman broadcasting
live from ITP which is a two-year
master's program at Tisch School of the
Arts at New York University and I'm here
to give you or anybody who's watching
this will get archived so people can
watch it later a one-hour introduction
to programming the context of that will
be something called the processing
programming environment
I just called processing and I'm gonna
talk I'm gonna do it like a couple
minutes just to talk about the
processing foundation and overall goals
I got to turn off my I have a preview of
my stream going over here and add some
audio so first of all if you're hearing
me and you can see what's behind me and
if you can kind of see this white board
over here let me know that the audio and
the images are good but rather than
waste a lot of time I'm just gonna dive
right in so I've got my eye over here on
a chat I see I see that there are some
people saying things in the chat which
is great so people who are watching and
I'm gonna get started so I think
actually the stream a minute ago it
started late so I'm just gonna
reintroduce myself again
somebody will edit this to start right
from this point at some point if this
ever gets archived actually you know
what I'm gonna hit the record button so
this will have a copy of this as well so
I'm gonna pretend down pretend I'm
starting over
good morning and welcome my name is Dan
Schiffman I am here broadcasting live
from ITP 2 years masse two-year master's
program at Tisch School of the Arts
which is part of New York University I'm
in New York City live in New York City
on Thursday morning I want to say
Saturday night and like I any anywhere
near is interested I don't know anyway
that show whatever um put that aside
welcome what am I here to do I'm here to
do a 1-hour it is 10:02 a.m. I'm here to
do a 1-hour introduction to programming
for the absolute complete and total
beginner I'm gonna take about five
minutes to talk about what this thing
called process
thing is and the processing foundation
and give you a little bit of a take on
the hour of code that might be a little
different than I hope then some things
you might be reading or hearing about
and then we're just gonna dive right in
I've got to put processing up here I'm
going to show you how to type some code
make some stuff I've got a white board
over here so I can draw some diagrams if
we need to I'll take little breaks I'll
answer questions in the chat that's my
plan so I'm just gonna peek yes so some
people are asking if they can Skype in I
didn't actually figure that out I'm
gonna do this again this afternoon by
the way to do this again this afternoon
at 1:30 p.m. with this other environment
called p5.js so this morning's going to
be processing which is the java
programming language and this afternoon
at 1:30 is going to be p5.js which is
the JavaScript programming language okay
so I don't see I'm looking in the chat I
see it going there and I'm just gonna
get started so it is about 1003 I want
to give myself just 5 to 10 minutes to
give you a brief introduction so
something that I'm a part of is called
the processing foundation it's a
non-for-profit organization about and I
had a mission statement somewhere in
here but it's later but the idea of
processing is to make programming you
know in a very simplistic way just
briefly to describe is to make
programming more accessible to a wider
audience and there are three tools that
we are currently developing one is
called processing with this P here which
has been in development since 2001 this
is what I'm going to use today in the
tutorial another tool which is new which
is called p5.js which is built on top of
JavaScript and there's also processing
py which is a mode for this processing
which allows you to type Python code but
I can't believe I'm starting this by
talking about different programming
languages here's what I really want to
talk about so I'm gonna just borrow here
from Mitch Resnick and David Siegel
somebody I'm sure could google this and
post a link to this blog a medium post
in the chat who posted a recent article
called a different approach to coding
Mitch Resnick and his research group at
the MIT Media Lab are the creators of a
programming environment called scratch
which you know I would say is something
for kids to get excited about
programming and
creation and creativity of course I use
it as an adult and I find it to be a
wonderful thing so it's not just for
kids and I think what's important about
what this in this medium post is
thinking about I want to talk today I
want to spend this hour about expressing
yourself with code creativity through
code so the hour of code this is the
code org website is a wonderful thing
many new people are discovering
programming and thinking about code and
maybe maybe getting excited about
learning something new
putting getting more people especially a
more diverse set of people of different
genders and ethnicities and countries
interested in perhaps majoring in
computer science as a field of study and
all of that is wonderful but one thing
about most of these tutorials that
you'll find on code org is most of them
are puzzles with a correct answer and if
you've ever made a piece of art you know
art is really about asking questions is
one way of thinking about art so what
does it mean to not have a correct
answer for your code what's lost in all
of these tutorials which are about
solving a puzzle or winning a game type
speak what if you could use programming
for creativity and I'll give you I'm
gonna quote from this medium post rather
than you know I wish I had written this
myself but it really spoke to me when I
read it for us coding is not a set of
technical skills but a new type of
literacy and personal expression
valuable for everyone much like learning
to write this is this quote is talking
about how this many of these coding
activities the students are asked to
program the movements of a virtual
character navigating through a set of
obstacles toward a goal so this is about
that puzzle salt solving but in some
ways this is like offering a writing
class that teaches only grammar and
punctuation without providing students a
chance to write their own stories so
this is what I want to expose you to
today if you can learn the basics of
code what ideas what can you express can
you communicate through code and so I
pulled this really briefly this morning
from Wikipedia I you know I think it's
the other thing that I think is relevant
here in this discussion there's a lot of
energy around computer science education
computer science in high schools
computer there's an in New York City
we've got cs4 all computer science for
everyone this is a great idea in many
ways I
let's have more people learn to code and
more people learn about programming and
what it can mean but this term computer
science a computer scientist specializes
in the theory of computation and the
design of computational systems this is
really important we need people to spend
their lives deep in studying computer
science and build compilers and systems
and all computers and all sorts of
things like that but what if you are a
dancer a biologist a fashion designer
economist a journalist a musician and
painter a poet a baseball player game
designer a teacher a chef what if you
don't want to be a computer scientist
but code is important you know you might
want to have a website you might want to
visualize your own running data as
you're training for a marathon there are
so it's just like you are expected to
learn to write essays but you don't
necessarily and and you need to write if
you're a dancer biology fashion designer
etc etc what does this mean to apply
code to the thing that you're interested
in to the ideas that you want to express
and I think that processing is an
environment which is a great place to
get started in thinking this way with a
look on the chat and people are
listening to me and there's a bunch of
people watching which is really exciting
so I I'm having a little I've done this
before with this many people so I'm
trying to keep an eye on the chat but
I'm gonna keep going but I want to get
to the code stuff first so the first
thing I just want to mention is none of
these ideas are really that new this
idea of art through code visual art
through code expressing yourself through
code you know I learned when I was a kid
using the logo programming language was
the way of issuing commands to a turtle
that walks around the screen to draw
pictures there's something I never
actually used this myself but there's
something called HyperCard which I know
a lot of people discovered creativity
through computers through a hypercar
which is part of the one of some of the
original Mac operating systems there is
something called design by numbers which
is really historically I think the the
thing that came right before processing
so designed by numbers was a programming
environment for I was loosely safe for
visual designers or graphic designers
created by John Maeda
who was a professor at the MIT Media Lab
and was in fact the professor of
k-series and Ben fry who are the
original creators of processing and they
started this processing project in 2001
studying with John Maeda and looking at
design by numbers and thinking about
taking that even further so and then of
course there's scratch which I think is
also developed at the MIT Media Lab with
Mitch Resnick's a lifelong kindergarten
group which is a wonderful environment
in particular for younger kids in the
sense that you don't have to necessarily
type your code but you get to put these
puzzle pieces together to implement
programming like concepts so okay so
this leads me now I got to get started
here it's 10:10 we got to do some
programming we got to really get into
some programming but this leads me to
the processing foundation so everything
that I've been talking about in these
last 10 minutes is what the processing
foundation exists for and I encourage
you to go to a processing foundation.org
I'll put a link in the description of
this video when it gets archived look at
some of our initiatives look at some of
our projects we've got this new
fellowship we're sponsoring it's
particular if you're an educator and you
work with a group of kids or adults who
don't necessarily have easy access to
code and learning these tools we're
looking to fund projects that bring
programming and bring processing to a
wider audience there's pigeons right
outside my window my pigeons I maybe
I'll close the window it's just they're
very hot in here and I might have to
open it again later
maybe the audio is now better so take a
look at processing this is the
processing foundation's mission I want
to just get started in in looking at
code now but the one last thing I'll
mention is I think that if you're I'm
going to move now to the processing
website which I've got here if you're
interested and I would love to spend the
next 45 minutes just showing you
exciting and unique and amazing projects
made with processing and other creative
tools that involve programming but I
might encourage you just to go to the
processing website to look at the
exhibition and sort of if you're trying
to think of like well I get what you're
talking about but I don't like what are
does this really happen or people really
making things there's a there's a nice
set of projects you can take a look at
there so so let me make a note over here
for you guys this is the URL where you
want to go right now if you want to
follow along and start typing
code with me so first of all can
everybody read that somebody say in the
chat if you can read that I've got by
the way periscope going here which I'm
just gonna shut off and I can erase this
smiley face so this is where you want to
go right now processing org and this is
the programming environment I'm gonna
use we've got about 45 minutes - 50
minutes I'll stay here all day but I
think it's good to sort of contain this
into an hour obviously I have not
obviously but if you're if you're
interested in more after today I have
lots more video tutorials and I think
and maybe what I'll try to do is point
you towards some resources some books
and other things you might look into if
you want to learn more okay so coming
back over here what you want to be on
now is the processing website so if you
go to just the processing website you're
gonna be here this like got some sort of
inception thing going on here but there
is a video of me talking about some of
the new features of processing 3 this
video won't be so relevant to you if
everything here is totally new this
videos really for people have been
already using processing and want to
know what's new in processing 3 but
where you want to go is this link
download download that's where you want
to go next I'm gonna go to download now
one thing you'll notice here is it's
asking you for a donation this is your
first day perhaps learning to program
all this is new to you I highly
encourage you right now to click no
donation you don't need to take part of
this like short hour and worry about a
credit card or something but I will
mention again that these environments
they take a lot of time a lot of energy
and mostly at most all of the people who
are building these things are volunteers
essentially so we started this
non-for-profit foundation to try to fund
fellowships and do more and continue the
development so if you're interested in
funding us wonderful ok so I'm going to
now click download and you're going to
see here now it's up to you pick your
operating system are you on Windows are
you on Linux are you on Mac I am on a
Mac right now so I'm going to show you
this tutorial using a Mac and so if I
were to download it we can see that it
is downloading here and it's got 8
seconds left now I'm gonna be like the
cooking show where I already had the
thing in the oven cooking beforehand so
assuming I've downloaded it and
extracted it what I'm actually going to
get is an application and the
application is going to look like this
you can see here this is the
singing application it's got the three
there this is a processing 3 the actual
version you're using right now if you
downloaded that was 3.0 point 1 as
things get fixed and things changes
there'll be a maybe it open 2 and an 0.3
and maybe someday there'll be a
processing for you knows that's what's
going on ok so I see that there are
people in the chat saying a few things
you've got it you're able to watch it on
your phone ok it is a big file it's a
large application it's also on it it's
it comes with it has Java embedded in it
because it's using the Java programming
language ok so now what I'm going to do
is launch processing now I just realized
you're going I just realised right now
that hold on let me double click it this
is like of course what happens when
you're oh it's already open ah it was
already open that's why nothing was
happening so what what you're gonna get
now you're gonna get a slightly
different oh no I think you might get
this welcome message it depends you're
gonna get a different welcome message
whether or not you had processing
installed previously on your machine etc
you don't really need to worry about any
of this right now just click this get
started button and you're going to have
this window on your computer look at
this so this is processing and guess
what this is all you need to start
coding to start learning about
programming to start writing your first
program this is one of the reasons why I
just love processing because it's a
single thing you can download it's a
place where you can write your code it's
a place where you can run your codes the
place where you can import extra code
libraries it's all there all in this one
package obviously not obviously but as
you go further down your journey in life
of programming you might discover oh my
god there's all these different tools
have to learn how to piece this together
was this thing in connected with this
thing and they have to download this and
install this other thing so that all of
that will come the nice thing about
getting started here is this is all you
need
yes could you wait until the down so
people are asking me to wait until it
gets downloaded so I'm gonna I'm gonna
sort of like yeah I can to some extent
yes I can wait in fact I'm gonna
I have I'm gonna have a little bit of my
tea over here you know I don't have a
sense of what the size of the audience
is right now watching it says 34 people
which is really kind of amazing actually
and I know some of you are large groups
maybe watching in a classroom which is
really exciting to me
so but so I'm gonna try to pause a
little bit we're on an older version but
that's fine to follow yes if you are
using an older version of processing I
don't think you need to upgrade right
now I do highly recommend though that
after this is over that you go and
update to the newest versions there's
just so many nice improvements but what
I'm gonna do today is really just using
some of the basic core ideas of
processing and none of that has changed
really since 2001 just the interface the
features a lot of the libraries a lot of
that has really changed okay I hear from
I think one of our viewers in India in
Mumbai I think I can't remember I was
like trying to see where cruller from
that they finished downloading so let's
get good so first of all here's an
exciting moment you are now going to run
your first program all you need to do is
go click this Run button run and there
you go you have executed and are running
your first program
so what processing always does now you
haven't written any code yet this is
what's kind of amazing so behind the
scenes up essentially an empty program
is executed with no content no
instructions that you've written but it
has opened a window on your computer
so what processing does is it opens a
window in your computer and what you are
going to learn what I'm going to show
you today is how to write code how to
write instructions to draw into that
window so here is how every single
instruction will look I'm gonna say this
is the command that you're going to
issue followed by a parenthesis follow
up close with another parenthesis and
ended with a semicolon so this is the
first thing that I want you guys to
learn today is that programming is
essentially the act of writing
instructions for the computer to follow
the difference is I could say everybody
stand up you know everyone
put your hand on your head everybody you
know pat your head and rub your tummy am
I actually doing that or is that maybe
it's the other way is harder who knows
so this is me issuing constructions but
I could have said please stand up or up
stand even though that's weird and
incorrect grammar you probably would
have gotten in anyway with programming
you must must must follow the exact
syntax I will show you what happens if
you have an error in your syntax and
this is one of the hardest things to get
started with right when you're first
learning is you missing semicolon a
missing parenthesis a missing comma
these kind of things can be a problem
nothing will work so the thing that goes
inside of here are art this is a not a
good pen I'm gonna let me try this one
our arguments they're called arguments
so if this is the command and these are
the arguments that are going inside the
parenthesis arguments are things that
modify the command so if my command to
you is walk I could say the arguments
might be walk three steps or walk ten
steps a three or a ten that's a thing
that modifies the command walk so for
example and those are always separated
by commas so here's a command that will
do first size parentheses some number
followed by a comma followed by some
other number followed by the end
parenthesis followed by a semicolon okay
and the question is what goes in these
two spots think about that try I'm gonna
type it with you you can try it yourself
put any numbers you want in there I'm
gonna be really conservative and I'm
just gonna say 640 by 360 I've done this
before so I kind of not not that not
that there is there's no correct answer
here but now if I hit run something
magical has happened this window is no
longer that little tiny window this
window is wider and taller now let's
think about what those numbers could
possibly mean 640 is describing the
width of the window
360 is describing the height of the
window what's the unit of measurement
you might be asking yourself it's you
know is that 640 inches or centimeters
or you know some sort of strange
they're measurement that I can't think
of it's not none of those things you
know you guys would probably all use
computers before you probably
anticipating what I'm going to say that
measurement is pixels so if you've ever
taken a picture with a phone a camera or
downloaded something you'll often see
like oh this image is 1200 by 720 or you
can you're like oh this is HD 1080p
video that 1080 is referring to the
number of pixels of a width of a
particular video I'm gonna just check
the chat do we need to keep an eye on
caps also yes everything is case
sensitive so if you put a capital S for
size it will not work that's a great
question so what I want to do and we're
kind of like ramping up here are 10 20
I'm kind of keeping an eye on the clock
is that as we move over here what I want
to do now is talk about ok so I put 640
360 so let's think about now what that
actually means in the context of that
window that's being opened so here so if
this window oh I'm in the I'm in the
wrong place hi everybody sorry about
that I'm glad I noticed wasn't that long
this happens to me a lot when I do these
because I have a little button here that
switches the camera so well just to
recap for a second I'm looking I'm
unpacking here what I meant by 640 by
360 in that window so if this window is
640 pixels wide and this window is 360
pixels high there's a really important
thing here that I need to show you to
talk to you about which will which will
then inform all the other functions I'm
about to show you other commands that
you can write so I was using the word
command by the way to describe this the
actual word the the programming term is
this is really a function a function
call is a function that I'm executing
but I think why you're getting started
sort of useful to think of it as a
commander instruction so if this is 640
pixels wide and 360 pixels high here's
something really important that you need
to know this pixel over here is the
pixel Z
comma zero it is the origin pixel so
some of you might be familiar you know
depending on what you what sort of math
kind of classes you've taken or what
you've looked at or you might have used
a piece of graph paper you might be used
to a coordinate system like this which
has a zero zero in the middle and x-axis
and a y-axis this is known as a
Cartesian name for Rene Descartes math
addition a Cartesian coordinate system a
computer-based coordinate system
the processing window coordinate system
works in a very similar way but it's a
little bit different here the y-axis you
might count up one two three if zero
zero is here this is pixel 1 this is
pixel - this is pixel 3 this is pixel 1
this is pixel 2 so if you think about it
for a second what is this pixel here in
the middle that pixel here in the middle
is pixel 320 halfway from 0 to 640 , 180
halfway from 0 to 360 so this idea of
thinking of the window as a coordinate
system is really key to all of the next
commands function calls I'm going to
show you I only showed you size so
here's a list of some things that I'm
going to show you next rectangle line
you know triangle ellipse I'm not really
writing use all the way out so you can
see the first thing that I'm going to
show you is processing as an environment
is a is a programming environment geared
towards drawing pictures with code you
could do a lot bored with it and think
way beyond that but this is a great way
to get started
so if you could figure out some function
calls some commands for drawing pictures
you can design your own picture on the
screen using code and of course later
animate it move it make it interactive
all those types of things
so let me come back over here I'm gonna
see if anyone has any questions guys ok
people are asking has this just started
I'm doing this my plan is I've got
another 35 minutes so I you know my goal
is to do this for an hour again those of
you or some people are asking a little
back like Los Padres like I do I'm gonna
be doing a lot of live streams yes I try
to do these every week but I'm doing
this particular one to celebrate this
hour of code
okay and I do have lots of videos on my
youtube channel for those who are
looking for more okay so let's come back
here now here we go
what are some things we can type so so
let's say let's start I don't know
somebody in that know you guys are like
20 seconds behind me so I can't I can't
actually live ask you to like shout
things out in the chat but let's start
with trying to pin
let's start with line I think that's
fine
let's start with line so I'm gonna say
line 0-0 320 180 now you have to think
to yourself what will this make happen
so first of all line is the command the
function call the arguments are 0 0 320
180 what do those mean this is a
question that we need to answer and you
can see it comes right after sighs so
again programming is the act of writing
instructions for the computer to follow
the first one it will follow its size
which we now know sets the size of the
window the second one is line which you
could probably imagine what it does but
let's run this one to see and you can
see there we go
we've got this line and let's think
about that what did we just say over
here this is 0 0 this is 320 180 so that
line function the line function connects
an X and a y-coordinate to another X and
a y-coordinate and here you go an X and
a y-coordinate to an X and a
y-coordinate the first one being 0 0 the
second one being 320 180 so I could
easily just now add a second one and I
could just pick something whatever I
feel like 100 comma 5,600 comma 3 3 hunt
10 and let's put this one actually over
on the other side and let's run this
again and you can see now I have this
other line here that I drew based on
these coordinates 500 comma 50 to 600
comma 10 so you can see that you can
write the line instruction as many times
as you like with different arguments
with different with different
modifications to draw a line in a
different place ok I'm
yes if the whiff goes from zero to three
6:39 the real middle one yes so I'm kind
of being loosey-goosey about some of
this stuff somebody asked and this is
kind of an interesting question you know
if this is pixel zero and I'm saying
it's 640 wide it's actually there's the
last pixel is actually pixel through 639
if you divide by two but you know this
is the thing we don't need to worry
about these fine details right now I
think they're less important than the
sort of basic idea of getting things up
and running and starting to make things
so here's now another question how would
you do this on your own if I wasn't here
it's just like even as much as I might
like to just forever be live-streaming I
think about some functions in processing
if you were just by yourself or with
some friends and you wanted to how do
you draw a rectangle how do you draw a
triangle
I wanted to look this stuff up how would
you know it's not so clear what those
numbers would do just you can with some
intuition you could guess and sort of
figure it out so all of this comes down
to looking things up in the reference so
this if you decide you want to keep
programming after today welcome to your
life reading documentation reading
reference materials reading tutorials so
you have to rely on the language or
environment having a good set of
documentation and I like to think that
the processing processing project has
excellent documentation so what I'm
looking for here that I want to look at
is the reference so on the processing
website I'm back at processing org I'm
gonna go to reference and what I'm you
can see there's a lot of different
functions and that you can call in
processing what where it's kind of what
I'm kind of focusing on today are 2d
primitives and you can see arc ellipse
line point quad rect triangle so let's
look at the line page and a couple
things you can see number one is it's
showing you first an example so that's
the syntax this is how it looks line is
the name of the function and you can see
if you give it these arguments you get
this in your window and you can see some
other in some other examples there's
even a way of doing lines in 3d which is
a bit beyond what we're gonna do today
and you can see here look this is now a
sort of generic way of thinking about so
there's two ways to call the line
function there's also this z axis if
you're in 3d
gonna ignore that for right now so this
first way is what matters
line x1 y1 x2 y2 and if I scroll further
down you can see here what are those
arguments mean x1 is the x coordinate of
the first point y1 is the y coordinate
of the first point x2 is the X part of
the second point so that this page is
doing is explaining this is the syntax
these are the arguments you can put in
this is what those arguments do so now
if you wanted to say how do I do a
triangle I could go back and I could
click on triangle and I could say okay
well here's an example and you can see
what does a triangle do it makes a
triangle and sorry this is kind of small
it makes a triangle out of three points
x1 y1 x2 y2 x3 y3 let's add that to our
code so I'm going to go back to my
processing sketch and I'm gonna say
triangle and I'm gonna say if I can
spell triangle 50 comma 50 200 comma 50
150 comma 200 and I'm gonna run this and
you can see up and I just turned off
because my camera turns off after a half
an hour to save the power and that one
turned off too you can see now there's a
triangle on the screen and the triangle
is made from those three points x1 y1 x2
y2 x3 y3 hooray a rectangle so let me so
I'm just looking in the chat to see if
there's any important questions
somebody's asking if I'm gonna do it
today at 1:30 p.m. Eastern Time I'm
going to do exactly what I'm doing today
but using p5 doing right now but using
p5.js which is JavaScript programming
environment ok so let me come back over
here for a second and let me turn this
camera back on so I'm gonna I'm gonna
take like a not a break but I'm gonna
pause for five minutes to let people who
are watching this tutorial kind of
design their own shape so for example
let me just show you a few things I'm
gonna quickly map out some of these for
you we looked at line and triangle
rectangle takes an X a Y a width and a
height so you define a rectangle by the
point on the corner X Y and some width
and some height and ellipse which is a
way of drawing a circle or an ellipsoid
elliptical round thing
also takes an X and a Y and width and a
height the difference being that the XY
is at the center and this is the width
you can think of its diameter across and
this is the height its diameter up and
down so I might suggest to you right now
there's also that you now you're kind of
assignment in five minutes before we
move on to the next thing is try to make
a picture with some rectangles some
lines some triangles and ellipses of
course there are other functions there's
quad there's arc and there's a zillion
things in there and processing but if
you're really here and just being a
beginner what I would do is let yourself
to these functions look at them in the
reference copy and paste the code
examples for the reference into your
code try playing with the numbers see
what you could design and you know I'm
kind of I'm loathe to even suggest what
kind of thing you might draw because
there's so many possibilities and I
don't want to to send you all in one
particular direction so be as creative
as you can expressing yourself but also
realize just throw some stuff on the
screen because you've just got about
five minutes before guess what I'm gonna
add color to this so and let's see what
you guys get I'm having a little more
trouble than I anticipated like
following the chat and that sort of
thing but now is a good time also to ask
any questions in the chat I'm going to
scroll back and read some of it while
you're doing this quick little exercise
and that sort of thing okay so I'm gonna
be here still but I'm gonna kind of be a
little less talking to the camera for a
minute I'm gonna drink some more of this
tea okay I'm just looking back to see if
there are any other questions Canada I'm
sorry here from Canada hi somebody said
they were from Mumbai which was exciting
so some saying they have to leave soon
for their school or their class tonight
so I'm definitely willing if you're a
school or organization and you want to
do this again sometime and you have a
group we can coordinate it I'm I'm game
it's a very busy time of year now in
December but I think probably we could
look for a time in January or February
for sure
I'm gonna check here
okay I see people are typing things in
I'm just looking here and
okay and okay so how's it going
everybody you have a question type it in
the chat you're from Mumbai okay Chris
Chris Chris one two three four okay so
guess what I'm gonna make something so
I'm gonna sit here and make something
you can follow along with me if you want
I don't know what to make though
somebody give me an idea we look at that
okay I've got a circle it's too big I
make a little circle and the middle yio
180 is where I wanted that to be then
I'm gonna make a line at like let's put
the line behind the circle notice the
order that you're typing things makes a
big difference and let's see okay I've
got it
I'm making a little like alien thing
there we go there's my little alien it's
going to be a one-eyed alien with a
rectangle there we go this is my okay
this is my design so you can see you
know how this is going I'm gonna look in
the chat robot smile face trying to make
an hourglass with two triangles in two
lines these are all great ideas
wonderful okay I'm gonna give us a
couple more minutes and then I'm gonna
start I'm gonna come over here and erase
I wanted to get to animation so we don't
have a ton of time but I think I can do
it color is something we can add
somewhat easily and quickly okay
and we'll come back here and okay so I'm
gonna move on now and start talking
about color
you know realistically if we were doing
this as a day-long workshop you would
have had half an hour hour to try to
make something and there were been a lot
of questions but I think in the interest
of time here and trying to do this in an
hour I'm gonna move on now to the next
thing so this is what I've got I made
this for myself
it's I don't know what it is but it's I
like it and you can see this is my
window
it's 640 by 360 I've got two lines and
I've got three circles and one rectangle
there in the middle of that circle so um
certainly I think what you're probably
imagining in your head is it would be
nice if not everything was black and
white so one thing you might be noticing
here is processing picked some default
colors for you the default being that a
particular objects outline is black but
it's interior is white so you can see up
there the interior of that circle is
white and then the background of the
entire thing is this light gray so all
of this is stuff that you can change on
your own and the thing
that you need to learn about to do this
okay so there's three new commands if
you haven't done this before new
functions that are key to doing color
one is background and what goes in here
is the question
another is fill what goes in there is
the question and another is stroke the
good news for you
is that what goes inside each of those
functions is the same thing it's the
information to describe a color so how
do you describe a color so well actually
so first of all let's let's make one
let's let's make one distinction here
which is that let's say I'm drawing a
circle on the screen the stroke refers
to the outline of that circle so this
assigns the color to the outline the
fill assigns the color to the interior
of the shape and there's a way that
you're gonna have a shape that's empty
in the interior with no fill or and has
no outline with no stroke and those are
things you'll find in the reference but
I'm gonna just focus on the basics here
which is giving every shape a fill or a
stroke now there are two ways there's
more than this but right now I think a
good way to start is there are two ways
to think about color greyscale and what
I'm going to call RGB color gray scale
meaning that I have a single value that
determines the amount of white in the
color so if there is zero white in the
color then I have black and if there is
255 in the color then I have white so
this is the range so the range for
greyscale as defined by default in
processing is between 0 and 255 if you
give if you say fill 0 you will have a
black interior if you say fill 255 you
will have a white interior let's go take
a look at that and see that in action so
at the very top here I'm just gonna say
fill 0 and run it again and you can see
all the shapes now have this dark black
interior if
I were to say Phil you know 75 you can
see they're still darker but not as dark
so it's a continuum zero being all the
way black 255 being all the way white
and in between the fact that it's 255
has to do with the way that things are
stored in the computer and memory and
bits and zeros and ones and that's an
interesting discussion that I mean for
some other time but this is they range
by default between 0 and 255 and that
could do the same thing with stroke so I
could say stroke 255 and you can see
here all the shapes now have a white
outline with this dark gray interior so
that's one way of doing color the other
way of doing color is what I'm calling
not me I didn't this clearly RGB color
so instead of a single number with RGB
color color you need to provide
processing the fill stroke or background
background functions with an amount of
red an amount of green and an amount of
blue each of these having a range
between 0 and 255 so you can kind of
imagine exactly what this might do if I
come back over here and I look at the
fill I'm giving it an amount of red an
amount of green and an amount of blue so
what will this color be if it has a lot
of red but no green and no blue RGB red
green blue right so we could run this
and you can see all the shapes are
entirely rent because it has only red if
I were to give it let's give it a little
bit of blue we can say I mix a little
blue in there and you can see I could
maybe give it an even a little bit more
blue you can see I'm getting this more
pinkish purplish color because red and
blue make purple so you know this now
walks down the road of all sorts of an
interesting long elaborate discussion
about color theory and color mixing and
the properties of light but one thing
that's important to realize here is the
what's going on in in adding these
colors to adding some red and Attucks
and blue is is is is adding light
together so you can think about it if
you had a
flashlights in a blue flashlight and you
shine them on the wall next to each
other what color you get there's a
little bit different than mixing paints
there's a lot of similarity but you know
if you mix like all like a whole lot of
colors red green blue orange pink you'll
end up getting like sort of brown or
dark color the more you add color the
brighter it gets so for example 255 255
255 is white and actually grayscale is
just shorthand for the red value being
equal to the green value being equal to
the blue value so if I were to go back
here and say 75 75 75 you can see now
that I have what I had before but if all
the values are equal I can shorthand
wise just say 75 so now I can also add a
background which I could say let's use
that nice pinkish purplish color and I
can have this fill and Stroke and for
these I can have this stroke for these
lines the other thing you can notice is
the order matters so where you put fill
and Stroke affects all the shapes that
come after it so if I were to now say
fill 0 255 0 and I were to say stroke to
5500 and I'm not really you can see that
the lines are white you can see here
that the lines are still white but the
outline of the circle is now red because
this stroke here overrode the stroke
that was at the top so what I might
suggest is if you want it to be really
long-winded about this is for every
shape and maybe these should both be
white and then I want I want this this
ellipse to be this color and then you
can start putting line breaks you know
and assigning specific colors for every
shape ok so you can see I could keep
going with this and I'm gonna go with
them I'm gonna muck around and make my
strange alien with whatever colors and
things that I want so this is now it's
10:45 I yeah an hour would be just 15
minutes or now we're gonna kind of wrap
up but let's take five you know a little
less around 5 minutes to have you guys
try to add color I'm gonna look at the
chat to see what questions came up
hopefully people are still watching or
listening or have questions and then I'm
gonna add the last step we're going to
add is a little bit of animation to what
you're doing so
oh let's take a look and I'm gonna see
if there's any questions in the chat so
okay great so people are talking about
what they are making an hourglass a
snowman cover stroke weight sure so
somebody asked me to cover stroke weight
stroke weight is a function that changes
the thickness of the lines so you know
I'll add that into mine for put it here
under the for these lines if I say
stroke weight for and run it again you
can see that the the thickness of the of
the outline is much much greater it's
actually four pixels wide and that could
be this is actually a useful thing to
add because it makes it a bit more
visible what's going on to in terms of
the stroke and the fill so somebody who
joined here late oh do values wrap if
you exceed 255 or are they capped you
know there's a kind of a bit of it it
depends answer but I will say they are
capped so if you pass 300 into the
function you'll still get the white
value 255 and somebody asked what is
this programming I'm talking about so
I'm using something called processing I
guess I erase that as processing org is
the programming language environment you
can download to follow along with this
tutorial and this tutorial by the way
will be archived on YouTube as soon as
it's over so you can go back and watch
it again if you really wanted to or if
somebody else wants to watch it
obviously
the live chat thing won't be an aspect
anymore about yet okay so I'm gonna take
a couple minutes to add some colors to
mine i want i like the these antennae
being and so I'm gonna make the so my
alien should be green I like that with
green but I'm gonna make a like a purple
outline okay like that with let's keep
everything kind of purplish there we go
and that's blue there the antenna I
think should be red this is very
important
and some sort of reddish color and green
on the outline let's keep this stroke
I'm gonna just keep this stroke the same
for everything and let me make those a
little bit darker there we go
and then the this last rectangle is the
eye which would be something nice and
blue I don't know what I'm doing here
and the background let's make it a
little bit brighter there we go
okay this is my alien now with some
colors
I guess my outline was is too close to
the let's just make the background a
light gray or maybe something darker
okay anyway I'm clearly not a visual
designer
there's my shape with some colors now
okay
looking here there's more people in the
chat saying funny things it's I'm typing
in their Co snowman you didn't if
someone's asking I did not get a green
color on the shape so it's kind of hard
for me to debug your code from the chat
as much as I love the idea of trying to
do that but so Cam'ron I will I'm gonna
I'm gonna I don't have the chat open on
this computer here with processing let
me look Phil green ellipse ah calm run I
see you have zero dot so the mistake I'm
noticing somebody in the chat has typed
in Miss Phil zero dot 255 comma 100 so
this is just a typo but processing
doesn't know it's a typo they think
you're trying to put in the number point
2 2 to 5 5 so in that case you make make
sure you need to have a comma there this
is a good moment to just show you sort
of what happens if something's out of
place so I'm gonna like remove this I'm
gonna remove this whoa something crazy
is going on down there I'm gonna remove
this semicolon so one thing you'll
notice in process
if you have a syntax error you'll get a
red squiggly line where the syntax error
is and then down here on the bottom
there's an errors tab so if you click on
that errors tab you'll see missing a
semicolon and it will also tell you what
line number that's happening line number
two I could actually even double click
on that it'll take me right there I add
the semicolon and there you go so this
is the you know most of the time the
error processing could figure out what
it is and give you a nice helpful
suggestion sometimes it can't and this
is just the life that you lead now okay
10:49
okay all right so by the way sometimes
like the chat you should know you're
seeing me about twenty or thirty seconds
after something that I'm actually saying
live just so you know because the way
that delay works on YouTube
okay we've got ten more minutes here's
what I've got left to do I want to show
you how to animate something big topic
ten minutes no problem and I want to
show you and I want to just talk about
where do you go from here this is an
hour it's all gonna be over I'll go on
with my day you'll go on with your day
someday we'll meet again I hope but I'm
gonna try to give you some resources
without just like plugging my own stuff
too much of how you might learn more of
this okay so here we go here we go let
me come over here to talk about
animation for a second okay so this is a
big topic you know what we've been doing
here and I said I was coming over here
but I'm going back over here for a
second all of these programs that we've
been writing you and me together here on
this day have just been these static
images programming I said is the act of
writing instructions for the computer to
follow there was a first instruction a
second instruction a third instruction a
fourth instruction that got to the end
and finished the pictures presented
you're done but animation programs are
most programs that you write even you're
the email program you use Photoshop
you're a word processing program these
are things that run over time so
programs need to handle interaction
events that might happen they need to
handle drawing over and over again to
animate something so this is something
that I think we can add somewhat quickly
to the processing to processing today at
least
and you know I'm gonna gloss over some
of the underlying details but the core
idea will be there and hopefully you
will enjoy this somewhat so the thing
that you need to add to your program
looks like this and there's a lot of new
syntax here not all of it will make
immediate sense to you or even sense to
you
in the next 10 minutes but as I show you
further resources and you go further
into this and will start to become more
and more clear but into what I'm going
to show you how to do is instead of
writing your code simply as a linear
list of instructions right there in the
processing editor I'm going to tell you
put your code either in setup or inside
draw these are what are known as blocks
of code blocks of code begin with a
curly bracket and end with a close curly
bracket so this is the way to say that
the code that's in here is part of this
thing called setup and the code that's
in here is part of this thing called
draw and these things these are
functions actually that you are defining
the setup function the draw function
there's special functions that
processing requires you to write for an
animation that setup is a function that
happens once at the beginning and draw
is a function that happens for ever and
ever
looping over and over again draw the
circle draw the circle draw the circle
so if I come back over here and I'm
gonna I'm gonna save this as a hour of
code 1 so I can now I'm gonna save it
whoops I'm gonna save it as hour of code
2 so because I want to just what I want
to do now is only leave this circle in
so you can say I simplified the program
a little bit so it's just drawing a
circle in the middle of the screen what
I want to do now is say void setup void
draw so I put some of my code in setup
and I put some of my code in draw now
what goes where is an interesting
question there's really no right answers
to these questions but there is a sort
of an answer for at least what I'm
showing you right now so one thing that
certainly should go and set up
sighs that is the thing you do when the
program begins set up the size of the
window if I want if my ultimate goal is
to maybe have this ellipse drawn move
around the screen I need to continuously
draw that circle draw it here then draw
it there then draw it here then draw it
there then draw it there then over there
then over there so that is something
that happens over and over again
background is an interesting question
should it be in setup or shouldn't be in
drop well first let's just run this and
see what I even get so one thing you'll
notice here is I'm not getting anything
different it's still just a circle being
drawn in the middle of the window the
code is actually still running in fact
it's drawing that circle it's like draw
draw draw draw draw drew girl but I see
it as a static image because that circle
is being drawn only in the same place
every time but what if this number 320
what if that number could be something
different every time through draw for
example and I'm kind of rushing through
this a little bit because we're running
out of time but for example what if that
location could be the location where the
mouse is what if I could say draw the
circle where that mouse is where the
mouse is where the mouse is
and in fact processing and all
programming language environments have a
mechanism for doing this so generally
speaking not just the mouse it's
something called a variable a variable
is a word that stands in for a number
and it's something that can change over
time it can hold information it can hold
and store data
so very quickly something I can add here
is mouse X and mouse Y you can see those
words turned a pink color because
processing recognize them as keywords
it's variables within the system and if
I do this you can see now look at this
that circle is continuously being drawn
wherever the mouse is and I already all
of a sudden right now I have a painting
program beautiful drawing it where the
mouse is now remember I add this weird
question of where should background be
well notice that background was in setup
so the background was drawn only once so
I'm never erasing a previous circle that
was drawn and you can see I have this
painting program what would happen if I
take background and move it to the
beginning of draw now you'll notice the
circle is moving but I'm not seeing the
previous one because
every time it draws the new circle
before that it erases for the background
so this is the way that you can create
something moving along the screen that's
interactive by assigning its location to
Mouse X Mouse Y but it's also important
remember that these are just numbers so
I could for example put fill in Mouse X
and I could put mouse Y and background
so also you can see that the color is
changing as I'm moving the mouse right
as I move down it gets Becket's it gets
brighter as I move up it gets it gets
darker and the circles value is changing
I could also just keep the circle in the
middle but I could use mouse X and mouse
Y for its size and you can see here if I
come in here as I as I move up and down
the size of the circle changes based on
Mouse X Mouse why so those variables are
just data they're just numbers and you
can assign them to anything in your
program position color size you could
put mouse Y as the exposition of
something so it's that might be very
confusing because as the user moves
along the x axis the thing moves down
but that could be an interesting and
different interaction so there's a lot
of possibilities here and this is just
the first step these are two variables
that processing gives you for free but
ultimately and this is this this is part
of next steps really you can define your
own variables you can make up your own
variables give them they're your own
names the score for a game the speed of
a thing that's flying across the screen
you can make up your own variables too
so we have you know I'm gonna go a
little bit longer than just the one hour
maybe by 5 or 10 minutes so why don't I
give you guys a few minutes to try
adding mouse X and mouse Y in your code
somewhere and see what you can change
color or change position and then I'm
gonna wrap up and some closing thoughts
and try to point you towards some other
resources that might let you keep going
and do more ok yes so somebody is asking
somebody's asking what button does the
auto for me so one thing I'll just
mention this people are asking about it
is there is a sort of standard way of
indenting code code that's inside a
block is typically indented a little bit
to sort of see what's in but it doesn't
affect how the code runs this exact
program would run the same way if I
wrote it like this it's sort of a mess
to look at but a way that you can have
processing automatically adjust all your
indentation and everything to make it so
nice and you know I don't know clean and
easy to look at is under edit auto
format
so this Auto format button which is also
command T or probably ctrl T on a PC so
if I now do command T you can see that
it auto format in my code to be it's
nicely and organized okay some people
are asking questions so somebody asked
about mobile somebody asked about yes so
somebody asked about transparency so you
can give fill or stroke a fourth
argument which has to do with the
transparency that's correct someone
asked about mobile development so a
mobile development that's a big question
there's lots of ways you can do mobile
development but one of the coz
processing is built on top of Java and
Android systems are Java based you can
actually do Android development in
processing and there's something called
processing Android which is essentially
like an add-on or a mode that you can
add by the way you can also do all of
your processing programming in Python by
adding the Python mode which is
something you can add right here through
add mode so you can look at Android and
Python through here this afternoon at
1:30 a.m. do this exact tutorial again
but using the p5.js programming
environment which is a JavaScript base
so Java JavaScript and Python are your
sort of three languages that you can
work with in this sort of world of
processing in p5 ok will you be starting
Java so all by the way this is Java you
are learning Java I mean there's some
nuances and some specifics to the way
Java programs are built that are being
not shown here but you know if you're
interested in Java you know I might
suggest just looking at all of my back
catalog of video
tutorials that use processing that we'll
get into all of those details okay
so we're coming up to 11 o'clock here so
first of all I would like to encourage
you to please share with me anything
that you made from today probably the
easiest way to do that is through
Twitter slash Schiffman Shi iff ma n so
I'd love to just sort of hear how this
was for you or get any feedback up
certainly there's also this will be
archived on YouTube and you can write in
the comments there as well so this is
the question I guess what if you want to
learn more so I'm gonna get some props
over here oops the camera went off so
let me fix that so I knocked over a
glass everything's okay everybody it
didn't have any water in it it was my
water glass but I finished it so there
are lots of books that you can get this
is a particularly wonderful one make
getting started with processing a
hands-on introduction to making
interactive graphics written by Casey
Reis and Ben Frey the creators of
processing I really don't mean to be
selling you guys stuff I'm just showing
you this is a my book learning
processing which has a lot of
information and certainly on the
processing website you can under here
under books you'll see there's also the
processing a handbook which is the which
is also written by Casey and Ben and you
can scroll down here and see that there
are a lot of other books that you could
look at that give you a lot of different
ideas of working with processing I would
also suggest that you go here under
tutorials on my head is in the way here
a tutorials on the processing website
this hello processing tutorial is
actually a kind of recorded version
essentially what I did today but we made
this two years ago so it's still the
same same content it's interactive it
actually has a place where you can type
code into the browser to try it out so I
would certainly recommend you checking
that out and there are also these
text-based tutorials that are here as
well and right up here
at the top here under video tutorials
there are a lot of wonderful video
tutorials I'll mention Jose I think his
is a fun programming maybe or the
plethora project all these tutorials are
great I guess since I'm here if you like
this video I would suggest that you look
at let me just go to this link here
these are all of my playlists and you
can see here that this section here
learning processing and beginner said
these I have probably like 60 to 100
videos that kind of go through all this
processing stuff in more detail a lot of
the stuff that I also have our tutorials
about a natural simulation and physics
simulation and and generative algorithms
that type of thing and it also started a
set of tutorials working with p5.js
which is JavaScript and some things with
the connect the Microsoft Kinect in
different anyway there's a lot more
there so you know I feel weird like I'm
like I did this like I'm advertising
stuff which I don't mean to be doing but
so that I think would be a good resource
for you there are all sorts of
interesting workshops and probably
schools that you could think about
attending one of one of my favorite new
ventures is the school for poetic
computation which is a pop-up school in
a way I might call here in New York that
does work with people with creativity
and programming and electronics projects
and they have kind of one week or ten
week programs things like that there's
another one that happened in Germany
last summer called some like make some
somebody somebody remind me what that is
I'll link to these so I don't know put
your put your ideas for next steps in
the comments of this video when it gets
archived during the chat here and and
hopefully that will give you some ideas
of what to do next if you're interested
in this so I'm gonna look I'm gonna look
at before I say goodbye and thank you
for watching I'm gonna look in the chat
and see if there's some more questions I
could answer how do I export Processing
sketches as a java application okay let
me show that to you here in processing
under file under export application so
this will actually export your
processing sketch as a standalone
application and if I do export
application save changes yes and now I
can pick like well do a which platform
do I want to export for do I want it to
be full screen
do I want to embed Java which I would
recommend if you're attending to like
send it or distribute it that's why it
has Java embedded in it nobody has to
have a separate install of Java so I'm
gonna hit export and you can see here I
have my Mac application which is there
and so it also comes with the source and
you can look at it's sort of translated
your processing code into Java which
really just means it puts a few things
around it and now I could run this and
when I run it you can see there it is my
program just runs so it looks like it's
running with but processing is not open
anymore
so this is now just a standalone
application that's running on my
computer hello France what do you think
is programming natural comes or can we
build that I'm sorry didn't Oh void
setup is this can be call method too
okay so someone's so set up and draw
there's so many questions and things we
could discuss an answer but I will let's
try to let me try to talk about this for
a second so set up and draw our special
functions I was gonna open processing
back up just to kind of have that as a
reference set up and draw our special
functions that processing asks you to
write I'm gonna get this open again open
recent and you don't actually XO
background fill and ellipse are
functions that you are executing that
are in the processing library set up and
draw are like the inverse of that
they're functions that you're defining
but processing is calling them for you
it knows to call setup at the beginning
and knows to call draw over and over
again something we've missed in this
tutorial but I certainly get into some
of my other videos is how do you define
and call your own function and this is
just something that comes up once you
start to build larger and more complex
programs thank you for some of the nice
comments how can I program a function
slide with Java so I don't know if
you're asking about using a slider so
interface elements are tricky topic but
there are different Java or in for
Android
in particular you can use you need to
sort of use the native Android stuff to
get the interface stuff and you could
then combining that with some of the
drawing things you have in processing
but one of the things about processing
that's great that I guess I'll show you
if I go to sketch import library these
under add library because processing is
built on top of Java and open source
people can design and make add-ons for
it essentially like Oh processing
doesn't have code for checking email
I'll make a processing library that
checks email so if I go click add
library what you'll see here is a very
very long list of all sorts of
additional code libraries that are
available for processing and if I just
kind of like scroll down here you can
see you know open connect for using the
Microsoft Connect obj loader for loading
a 3d model from another program QR code
for reading the QR code SFTP for f2
being a file supercollider for working
with supercollider sprites you can just
see there's just tons and tons MIDI for
working with MIDI which is an audio
thing on the computer so there's lots
and lots of libraries that you could
potentially add and use code with - ok
so it looks like the questions have
ended and it's about 1110 this has been
going for an hour and 10 minutes I will
be back this afternoon at 1:30 p.m. to
do my next hour of code with p5.js so
I'm gonna go over here to my console and
hit the stop stream button which means I
will disappear I don't know how long it
takes you to but this will probably up
and archived within the next hour please
stay in touch share what you made give
me feedback Twitter comm / shift min is
probably the best way to reach me for
today and look forward to hearing from
any of you now I'm gonna hit stop
streaming now goodbye thank you see you
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
