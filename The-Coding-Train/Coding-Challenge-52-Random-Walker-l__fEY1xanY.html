coding challenge this coding challenge
is part of my spring 2017 course nature
of code I'm teaching it at New York
University and I have most of the
materials for this course already on
online through videos you can check the
find the links to all those videos and
the materials for the course in this
video's description but what I'm going
to do periodically is do some coding
challenges that fit with those material
for that course week to week and
whatever start with today is this thing
called a random walk what is a random
walk I'm going to diagram it for you on
the whiteboard in a moment but
ultimately a random walk as you can see
here is visualized as distinct that
moves around randomly it's a random walk
and so I actually already have the
program running here that I made in the
coding challenge because I'm recording
this after it and it's like edited
together to the magic of video editing
technology and so what I'm going to
start with here is the very basic
traditional simple random walk a little
dot moving around the screen every frame
of animation picking a random direction
to move from there it's up to you to do
something more creative with this to
think about this what kinds of behaviors
and ideas from nature or the world can
you simulate with this what types of
visual outcomes can get with this at the
end of the video I'll give you some
context and ideas about that so and this
is just the first in a series of short
experiments about random walk and I'll
do some variations on it in terms of
moving this from 2d to 3d thinking about
the step size thinking about vectors
object-oriented programming but this
video is going to be the most basic
simple drop drop drop singing I didn't
say drop the head for some reasons but a
very simple just basic random walk I
hope you enjoy looking at the code for
this and you make something creative out
of it and you let me know so I'm going
to leave I'm going to take the train to
the pewte to the Past like time travel
trade oh to do this coding challenge
okay
I am here to get started with this
coding challenge the random walk so the
first thing I want to do is oh you're
over here I'm over here is talk about
what a random walk is so a random walk
will walk is a stochastic stochastic
in other word for random it sounds about
right right a process where there is a
value that changes with each time step
randomly in one direction or another and
this is the kind of thing that can be
used to model the way an animal forages
for food or the stock price fluctuates
perhaps or a kind of way a gambler makes
decisions playing blackjack there are a
lot of processes by which we decide you
have a random walk and the random walk
would be in one dimension or two
dimensions or three dimensions are used
in various kinds of scientific
simulation it's also related to
something called Brownian motion which
maybe I'll come back in a separate video
to kind of connect these two things more
but what the kind of random walk I want
to talk about is the random walk that
happens in a two-dimensional graphics
space and in a future video a couple
videos from now I'm gonna do a couple
variations on it I will do a 3d renders
well we'll see how that works so the
idea here is that there is a dot in this
two-dimensional canvas maybe it's in the
middle of the canvas the dot has an x
and y position and every frame of
animation there are only four choices
option number one is moved to the right
option number two the order leave
doesn't matter move to the left option
number three move up option number four
move down so every frame of animation
one of these is randomly picked so we
might move to the right and then move up
and move to the left and move up and
move to the left then move down and move
to the left then move down and move down
then move to the right then move up
right you can suggestion how this would
work now I only know weird sort of way
created a pattern there because I'm a
human being flawed in so many ways no
idea but you know one of the things I
can't do but most conveys is produce a
actual random sequence of numbers
because my brain is just pattern pattern
pattern this pattern this pattern is but
computers can produce what's known as
pseudo-random numbers meaning they're
not it's there's a like a you know
mathematical formula that's operating
behind the scenes that generates a
sequence of numbers that we'll look at
over time have an essentially random
probability now these are pseudo-random
because they're
you know it's not like we're actually
measuring and incidentally a random walk
is also related to like measuring
movements of particles as moving around
in a gap but look at this like moment
where I felt like I needed to burp that
was very strange
everything was like coming together and
my brain but there was a point of what I
was saying which is that if you really
wanted to achieve
first of all random numbers itself is
something that lots of people study a
lifetime of study or write PhD
dissertations about getting a really
good random number generator the way
that I can get random numbers with this
pseudo-random number generator is with a
function in p5 called random and the key
thing about this function is well first
of all it takes a minimum and a maximum
as arguments so I want to get random
numbers between 4 and 10 or 0 and 5 or
negative 5 and positive 5 but the key
thing about this function is it gives
you a uniform distribution meaning you
have the same like we go that is picking
the number 1 as you have a picking the
number 3 as you have picking them to the
Porco's number - and one thing I really
want to look at as part of this little
series about random walks is what
happens what I want a different
distribution what if I want to move down
more often than I want to move up or
what if I want to move towards the mouth
I want to have a 50% chance of moving
towards the mouth and a 50% chance of
picking something else random or what if
I want to have a distribution of random
numbers that follows something called
the bell curve or a normal distribution
or a Gaussian distribution and I have
some videos about that so we connect
some of these schemes in these videos
about random number random walks so all
I need to do is have a program with an x
and a y I need to have the random
function that picks and really my random
function is not going to pick one two
three or four I could make it do that
but that's not really how numbers are
ever picked on a computer so I'm going
to pick 0 1 2 or 3 and because array I'm
going to look for a range starting with
0 and then whichever one of those I pick
I'm going to adjust the X or the Y Z
and move my random walker around on the
screen
okay so come over here with me let's
take the train over to the computer okay
here we are okay so let's start
implementing this I'm actually gonna do
this in a non object-oriented manner and
I'll come back in another video and
maybe add objects to this but just in
the most the simplest way I'm going to
have an X variable and a Y variable and
I'm going to start it in the middle of
the screen y equals 200 and I am going
to I'm going to just draw a point at x
and y I'm going to say stroke 255 and
I'm also going to say stroke weight to
just so it's a little bit more visible
and if I now refresh the page we can see
there it is there's my random Walker it
hasn't gone anywhere yet so now I need
to pick a random number okay so that
random number could be so ugly do that
here and draw I'll do it after I draw
the point and I'm going to say VAR r
equals random 0 to 4 so this is where
I'm a star but now first of all first of
all I don't actually have to give a
minimum and a maximum if my minimum is 0
so 5 definition if I only give the
random function a single argument that's
the maximum so I'm going to I want a
random number between 0 and 4 now the
issue with this is the random number in
p5 by definition will give me a random
between 0 and 4 that has decimals so one
point two three point five four point
seven zero point three point one node on
the four point one actually it's the
highest number it will give me is three
point nine nine nine nine
nein nein nein nein nein nein nein nein
nein nein nein nein I could go on right
so I lost my truth about that so he's
never actually given me four but I can
do something to this which is I can put
this function floor around it and what
the floor function does there are a
bunch of functions that I can use
where's my marker up here this in p5 -
to take a floating-point number like
three point four and convert it to an
integer if I use the floor function it
will make that number three if I use the
ceiling function C EIL it will make that
number four if I use the round function
it will make that number three so floor
even if it's even to three point nine
nine nine nine nine nine nine consist
lops off the decimal place and makes it
three if is feeling no matter what it is
whether it's three point nine or three
point one or three point two goes up to
the nearest integer so Florida goes down
to the earth it shirt field goes up to
the nearest integer and then round round
it so three point four becomes three
three point six becomes four so it goes
up or down depending on which is closer
it rounds the number okay so floor is
going to be useful for me here and now
here's the thing you only make sense for
me to use in this video that I hear a
lot of people on YouTube asking me to
use it saying what's wrong with you how
come you never use a switch statement
I'll tell you the reason I kind of looks
like thing in my brain I can't ever
remember the syntax for it so what I
want to do right now which is more
comfortable for me is just say if R
equals zero do do something otherwise if
R equals one and by the way I also want
to talk about someday I want to talk
really Quilly equals that's not really
part of this video so to remind let's
come back to that
somewhere else but let's try to add a
switch statement let's do it in this
video it's enough the kind of
conditional statement like an if
statement where you could say hey there
is there's a some cases here I've got
this value and if this value is equal to
this
this it is equal to but it's a quirk
identity syntax so I'm gonna have to
look up the syntax because you know I
can freely admit that I can never
remember this case statement JavaScript
let's see where we get
let's go to switch here so you can see
here this is the statement this is the
syntax switch expression expression
meaning a particular in this case a
particular variable the case of when
this variable has this value do this
stuff otherwise do this stuff and then I
need a break statement so that I get out
of it once it's found a particular value
so I don't I can only do one so I should
be able to do let me copy this in let's
copy this and I can do switch our case 0
case 1 look at me I'm all grown up okay
two very stressful it's going to work
case three break and how'd I do
so now the thing is what do I want to do
well if we look back to here I have to
say case 0 move to the right case 1 2 to
the left case to move up case 3 was down
again the order doesn't actually matter
so it's a long way to walk for there
here's this huge space ok so I'm going
to say X equal x equals x plus 1 here
I'm going to say x equals X minus 1 here
to move to the left to move down as y
equals y plus 1 and to move up is y
equals y minus 1 ok so we now have this
switch statement where I'm thinking one
of these four options and here we go
let's go back to our code run it and
look at that there's our random walk now
interestingly enough this doesn't look
like some of the images I showed you the
intro video that I haven't actually
picked yet because that's good
and after what I want to do is I want to
see the path of this random Walker just
in terms of the sort classic way to
visualize the random walk in a 2d space
and the easiest way I can do that is
just take I take the background function
and move that into setup so I'm drawing
the background just once at the
beginning and then I'm drawing the
background just once at the beginning so
that when the dot moves I don't I'm not
erasing the previous stop and now if I
do this again
we can see look at this there's our
random Walker so I now proposed to you
at the end I'm going to do a couple more
videos with some variations on this
theme but this is a really simple
concept but you would be amazed if you
google you know random walk art random
walk 2d random walks 3d yes and you do
an image search you're going to find a
lot of beautiful examples of people
trying different styles what if this
random walk
for example color played a role in it
what if you had multiple random walks
and when they intersected each other
they combined colors or gave birth to a
new random walk what if you thought
about different ways to do probability
so that the way that it moves has some
sort of pattern or logic to it and I
will make some videos with some kind of
known techniques there's a there's a
technique called the Levy flight which
is a different kind of walk where the
step size varies right now I'm only ever
moving by one other things you might try
our thing and think about is what if the
random walk never was allowed to go
where it had previously been this is
known as a self avoiding walk this is a
pretty tricky problem but you might
think about trying to solve that I think
I said 3d already so there's a lot of
big oh and here's the thing that's even
more important this is just a pure
visual example of the random walk but
what if you don't think about the
outcome of the random walk being just a
dot moving in a 2d space what if it's a
random walk that's actually changing
notes in a melody what if a mutual
composition or a dance performance what
are some other ways you can take this
random walk idea and make it into a
project that has some kind of creative
expression associated with it or also
even in the land of computer graphics
what if the random walk are actually
vertices of a polygon and each one of
those vertices are doing a random walk
or after rain walk go through a while it
sets bird
how could you control a design what if
you random walk through color space
there are so many possible ways you
could think about what the random walk
is besides this sort of traditional view
of it so as if you know if you're
following along this nature of code
course that I'm sort of teaching online
through this YouTube channel and you
make an example please tweet it to me at
Schiffman you can share it in the slack
channel if you're part of the patreon
group or you can certainly a link to
your work that you made in the comments
and I'll try to come back on future
future videos and show some random walk
examples that people from the community
have made okay thanks for watching this
tutorial and believe if you stick around
and watch them the other videos will be
more random block examples to come</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
