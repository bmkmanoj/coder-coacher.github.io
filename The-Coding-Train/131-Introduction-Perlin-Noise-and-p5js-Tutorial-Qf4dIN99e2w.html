Perlin noise and creating a 2d Perlin
noise field which you can visualize in a
variety of ways eventually well maybe
we'll make a nice rainbow coloured one
so ultimately at the end of this video
series which is going to be two or three
short videos I want to have show you how
to make this particular project but
before I can get there I just want to
answer the question in this video what
is Perlin noise and do a quick p5.js
JavaScript sketch that shows you the
basics of it so let me come over here
and make a little diagram so there are
two functions in the p5.js library this
is also in processing as well there are
more than two functions but there's two
functions that I'm thinking of right now
that are relevant to this discussion one
function is called random another
function is called noise now this is a
little bit confusing because in truth
the word noise really just means random
if you think about audio noise that
sound right it's kind of like random
audio gibberish but the noise function
in both processing and P 5gs River
refers to a particular kind of noise
called Perlin noise now Perlin noise is
named for a computer scientist named Ken
Perlin who was developing algorithms and
has been developing outcomes for many
years but in particular in the 1980s for
a film called Tron now I'm not referring
to whatever that recent one was called I
don't know most recent anymore Tron
Legacy I think the original Tron from
sometime the 1980s and one of the things
that you might have noticed in computer
generated things that you experienced is
you know maybe there is a in the scene
there's like to show my horrific
artistic palette there is like a Vaz
sitting on a table and at one point in
computer graphics there's this there
okay so this is I add there's this idea
of a texture I should rerecord this one
to keep going there's this idea of a
texture right which is kind of this
stuff that is painted on to that three
dimensional form now at one point
computer animators had to hand make
these textures if you wanted to Vaz to
appear like look like wood or marble and
why you'd want wood Vaz but whatever the
point is pearly noise was originally
developed for procedural textures of
object meaning it how do I create you
know I could as an artist I could render
a some sort of like would like texture
just with my like pencil and paper and
scan it or use some fancy Photoshop
Illustrator like program or I could have
an algorithm that generates all the pics
pixels to make that kind of texture so
that's what Perla noise was originally
developed for procedural textures for
three to three dimensional objects in
computer graphics now Kent Guerlain
actually won an Academy Award for that I
don't know why that's like my terrible
drawing of an Oscar that looks nothing
like an Oscar for technical achievement
so that's kind of a little bit about
back story now circling back I mentioned
there is a noise function and a random
function the noise function gives you
Perlin noise values so hold off on the
idea of procedural textures I have an
eraser here I'm going to come back to
that in part two when I look at
two-dimensional Perlin noise but in this
particular video I am just going to talk
about one-dimensional Perlin noise so
what do I mean by one-dimensional let's
think about numbers over in a single
dimension let's just pretend for a
moment that that dimension is time it's
a useful way of thinking about it so
this is the axis of time getting very
deep into philosophy here this is the
x-axis of time let's think about the
random function so let's say every 2f 60
frames per second write like an
animation like a p5 GS or processing
sketch I'm calling the random function
I'm going to get a random value over
time random random random random random
random random random random okay I can't
pick random numbers because I'm a human
being but you can imagine I might be
getting random numbers between 0 &amp;amp; 1
over time
so that's right and this will look like
if I were to graph it like some kind of
big mess
now Perlin noise in one dimension is has
the same sort of idea let's say I want
to get random numbers this pen is
terrible I don't even know if you can
read this you type out back with a new
marker well this isn't so great let's
see how this says so I'm going to draw
now the x-axis of time in blue I wish I
had a pink one or a purple one those are
my favorite colors in case you were
wondering but I don't and I want now
instead of random values I want Perlin
noise values over time so I'm going to
draw you sort of a visual approximation
of what it might look like something
like this
you know so the idea here and the idea
here is that ultimately at its core
Perlin noise gives you smooth random
numbers what do I mean by smooth I mean
that the random number that you might
pick at any point in time is related to
the random number you might pick later
a moment later or the random number you
picked a moment before where as in so
this is random this is noise Perley
noise that is in the core random
algorithm the actual random algorithm
itself those numbers aren't related at
all you pick like I'm picking random
numbers between zero and ten nine two
seven six one nine four eight nine two
one three I pick nine a lot apparently
but with pearly noise I might pick
numbers like this two three four three
four five six five four five six seven
five six seven five six seven eight nine
eight seven six well this is like Perlin
noise performance part I won't do it
again but that's what that was like I'm
gonna do a whole separate video which is
me reading aloud pearly noise of happy
is I'm certain people want to watch that
Lavelle you can sing them anyway so you
get the idea that's the core difference
now that's how it works now there's two
more pieces I really want to get to here
what is okay I get it I get the
difference conceptually how are these
values generated well actually they're
generated just ultimately
noise is just a lot of math on top of
the actual random function itself so
let's look at this and I'm going to grab
a paper towel here I'm going to explain
to you I put my best effort how the
actual Perlin noise algorithm works
underneath the hood now now Ken Perlin
has revised the algorithm several times
over the years on several one or two
times three times your nose and you can
kind of I'll try to post some links to
different versions or update you know up
but I'm going to give you kind of the
basic gist of it so let's say let's go
back to random let's say I'm going to
pick random values over time to start
with and what I'm going to do is
actually say I'm going to pick them
every 10 units of time 10 20 30 40 so
I'm going to pick and I'm going to pick
those random now values with some
amplitude between something like 0 and
100 these are all sort of made-up values
so I pick a random number here then I
pick a random number here then I pick a
random number here and then I pick a
random number here now the next thing I
want to do is do an interpolation
function what is an interpolation
function well here are some numbers
here's me interpolating between them
that's like linear interpolation I think
I just draw a line between the values
but maybe I want to do something a
little nicer and one possibility of one
kind of interpolation is called cosine
interpolation or sine interpolation
probably which means let me draw a nice
curve between these values so here is
the start of my Perlin noise function
and let's just pretend I also had to
pick a value at 0 which let's say I
picked this one so now I'm going to do
that again this time however I'm going
to pick those random values every 5
units of time 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 - I'm
ready for T and instead of picking
between 0 and 100 I'm just going to pick
between 0 and 50 so let me pick random
values
and now just using like a random
function now I'm going to do this now
let me do that one more time
and I'm going to pick them every two and
a half units of time and I'm just going
to go between 0 and 25 and now I'm going
to just it's gonna be something like
this now what if I were to do this
possibly 8 times 16 times 25 times
however many times I want and each time
I'm take I'm having essentially the the
amount of time that passes before I pick
a new Ram number and I'm also having
that amplitude having is that a way I'm
having it I'm having it for lunch but
I'm having it having it I'm dividing it
by half whatever um what then if I take
all of these and add them together now
I'm kind of going to lose my mind here
really trying to do this visually
accurately but let me just let's just
say for right now I'm going to take this
graph and add it with this graph I'm
going to get something that looks like
this it has the essential on adding I'm
adding these values together with these
values it has the same basic quality
right it looks kind of like that
original shape but there's lots of
little variations based on these little
tiny variations and this is essentially
how Perlin noise is calculated and these
by the way are known as octaves so
Perlin noise is calculated over a number
of octaves and essentially it's a bunch
of random wave forms and those wave
forms their their period and their
amplitude change over those octaves and
get added together and in that sense it
has a fractal like quality you might
have to go back a bunch of my videos
about fractals if that concept does it
make sense to you but fractal is this
idea of self similar shape meaning at
any zoom level it's the same thing and
because we're getting sort of finer and
finer detail as we go through these
different octaves if we were to zoom in
here we and blow that up we might see
something that looks something like this
almost like that original so curling
noise this is really how it's calculated
okay I'm almost done with this video
because in the next video I'm just gonna
dive in and write code to sort of
visualize how it works but let's just
make
one more point here actually you know
what I'm done with this video this is
the end of this first video which is
just kind of explaining the history of
Perlin noise and how the algorithm works
the next video I need to look at okay
well this is how I'm getting the Perlin
noise values how does that tie in to the
noise function how do I call it how do I
get those values back and how I use them
in code okay
this concludes this particular video
which may or may not have a variety of
mistakes and confusing aspects to them
and you the internet will let me know
