this is a coding challenge the coding
challenge today right now is binary tree
oh okay
what's do it it's actually kind of an
interesting thing so first of all what
I've been reading this book recently I
just finished it called grokking
algorithms it's great by Adi I'll put a
link to it in the spice Odyssey ah ba ba
ba sorry I pronounced that wrong I'll
put a link to it in the this video's
description and I it's been refreshing
my brain about all these algorithms that
I make up once learned and then never
really bother to use again even though
they are vital and important and but
what I really want to ask in this series
because I'm gonna have a bunch more
related to this sort of similar topic is
what kind of creative outcomes can you
have with this so I'm going to come at
this from a very no no point-of-view
approach let's just look at the literal
binary tree algorithm let's make a
version of it I'm actually not going to
include any visuals I'm just going to
show you the results in the console and
I'm going to ask you the viewer to make
some type of visual out of it or to do
something more interesting with it so
maybe when I get to the end I'll have
some ideas for you because I don't have
them right now so look I have all these
pictures of binary trees behind me and
let's go over here to the whiteboard and
let's make a diver so why would you need
a binary tree first of all and actually
this is this is the example that's in
this book so I'm going to borrow it
pretend this was a phone book lot of fun
book but it's a big book it's a book of
random numbers that's another story for
another time
and let's say I wanted to find where I
am in this book why would you even know
what a phone book is such a super trend
is a phone book people of the future
aliens of the future a phone book is a
book I'm thinking to you up there that
you pull people off the future a phone
book is a book with people's names in it
and everybody's phone number oh my god a
phone number is a nut sequence of digits
that you use to call somebody on a phone
a phone let's just I don't know how far
into the future you are hopefully you
still know what a phone is anyway so
let's take this book with a list of
people dictionary maybe dictionary it's
a dictionary a dictionary it's a book
list of words and I want to look up the
word
rainbow or train pick your word
one way I could do is I could go to the
first page thank you sorry Apple and I
could look at every single word on the
first page it's not there and I could
look at every single word of the next
page it's not there they go get
everything aware of the next day she's
not there but I know
rainbows are which is going to be you
know somewhere around in 2/3 so I have a
sense of where it is but another way I
could look if I could just go straight
to the middle and I could say ah is is
the words that I'm seeing here now does
it come before or after rainbow in the
alphabet if it becomes before you can
but because before then I'm going to go
half way towards the end then I can go
half way back then I could go half again
like it keeps finding like dividing all
the words up in half did I play this
with my kids all the time let's guess a
number between 0 mm and I always guess
500 and they say well it's too small so
I'll guess 750 well that's too big so
I'll guess you know what everything
between those two 625 I don't know that
so 6 tango oh my god I can't do the math
so so that the point is a binary tree is
a data structure that allows you to move
through sorted data by dividing it in
half now there's a lot more to the
efficiency of the of house of the binary
tree beyond that but let's just start by
designing one and come back to some of
these questions later so first of all
what do I mean by data structure here's
a data structure bar x equals 10 a data
structure is a single number here's
another data structure far num equals to
10 10 11 12 this is an array it's a list
of information there are up I can have
an object in JavaScript which is a
mapping of keys and values um you know
favorite color whatever
purple so these are different kinds of
data structures that are familiar with
that's a structure where you store data
and we could get fancy about if there's
things like lit linked lists which each
objects each thing points the next day
so you can only get to it from the
beginning by going through all of them
and boy I should make some other videos
about all these things there's stacks
and queues and all this stuff a binary
tree is a data structure that works like
this there is a this idea of a node
this is a node and I'm going to call
this node the root of the tree and it
and it has maybe a child - children -
children nodes one the left one and one
the right one is a binary tree because
each node can only have two connections
to children other kinds of trees can
have all sorts of variable and house
here here it looks like this now this is
the way that data is organized but I
said the data is sorted what do you mean
spot that doesn't look very sorted I
mean I could imagine this being sorted
well strangely enough it's it's it's
sorted into quite a remarkable way and
the way that you build a tree is by
adding notes to it one at a time
so let's use let's use numbers somebody
shout out a number
there's nobody nobody around like to get
anybody to use number oh well obvious
one I there's a chat going on but I
can't see that far for me so let's say I
have the number 10 I'm going to add
these numbers 10 5 15 7 to 9 31 this is
a list of number so I just sort of
thought in my head bit of an ADD so I'm
going to add to the tree first 10 so 10
the tree is empty so the root node gets
the number 10 now I want to add 5 into
this tree and right now the root node
has 2 empty spots as soon as I make a
note it gets two empty spots now five is
coming in here and I believe if 5 is
less than it should go to the left and
if it's greater than it should go to the
right I hope I'm doing this correctly
there's you know I think it'd work
either way but there's a standard so 5
is less than 10 so it's going to go here
and now this has a left and right
with 915 13 is more than 10 it's going
to go over here and this has a left and
a right 7 7 is less than 10 so it goes
over here up 5 it's greater than 5 so it
goes over here and now this has a left
and right 2 2 is less than 10 2 is less
than 5 2 goes over here
I'm Finnick I can't keep track of the
way that I'm using dotted lines they're
not
so this okay because we got to get
through the whole thing 9 9 is less than
10 it's greater than 5 scream 7 9 goes
down here 31 31 is greater than 10 31 is
greater than 15 so 31 goes here so
actually I'm going to sort of erase
these these are all the empty spots so
this is the tree so how is this sorted
let me tell you something this is most
certainly sorted it's sorted because if
I go all the way to the left
watch this let's go to the left 5 let's
go to the left - lets go to left oh
nothing left let's point out 2 now let's
go back ok fine oh now let's try oh I'm
sorry go to the left go back now we try
to go to the right sorry go to the right
nope so let's come back go up here 5 now
if we go to the right yes 7 go to the
right 9 actually sorry 7 we should try
to go to the left but we weren't able to
go to the left so we came back 7 and now
we go to the old this is so hard
let me do this again I don't know if I
should edit this we come back but the
algorithm of how we traverse this tree
is we want to visit every node visit a
node and when we do that we want to go
to the left which means that means visit
the nodes of the left so we're going to
implement a worker
algorithm a recursive function a
function of references itself visit the
node go to visits up and so I should say
start with the root and then visit left
so we keep visiting less all the way as
far as we can eventually we can't visit
left anymore so then we might say you
know a print I'm just going to say print
the value so we come up and print the
value to what's the next thing we do is
we visit the right so now we go down
here up there's nothing there so we come
up here and then these are finishing
where are we here now we we finished
visiting five so now we print out the
value 5 and then we visit right seven
what do we do when we visit seven we
then go to the left nothing there so we
come back and print out seven then we
visit the right so we go to the left
nothing there print out nine go to the
right nothing there back back back here
then we print out 10 then we go to the
right and we try to go left nothing
there 15 then we go to the right nothing
there
nothing there 31 and we're done so this
tree magically the way that the things
are added to the tree end up into sorted
order because what we're doing is we're
basically saying I want to look here's
your ties back to that phone book
example oh my goodness can't believe I
miss it if I want to find the number
nine right let me find the number nine
somewhere I'm going to find this name in
the FOMA because the number nine might
be associated with some actual important
piece of information we need the nine
just being like a key I can say is nine
less than or greater than ten and if
this tree is balanced nicely meaning
there's the same numbers on the left and
the right I now have eliminated I don't
have to search through half of the data
whereas if I have an array and then need
to try to find look through the array to
find something
in unordered in an unordered array I
have to check every single option so
this is the structure how do we program
this this is the next step okay so back
over here we can see all of these nights
visualizations of trees maybe I'll try
to add a little visual something just so
you can get how do you get started with
visualizing it but but hopefully that
gives you an idea of what it could be
useful for talk about that okay so now
let's start to program this so what do I
need how how would I even get started
programming this well think about it
I think I definitely got to need a node
object so I'm going to write a
constructor function called node and
it's going to have a left and a right
I'm going to set those equal to null
just to sort of explicitly say when I
make a node and the node should have
some kind of value or label I guess I'll
just use numbers maybe I should use text
I don't know what's better but let's
call it a label so I'm going to make
it's like the sort of data at that node
I'll call it value right so when you
make a node it has a value and it has a
left and a right which have no nothing
connected so far let's make I think
let's make a tree object - I don't know
if the tree is really going to need
anything but a tree is going to have a
root node and then also so that when the
tree starts this dot root equals null so
the only thing one of the things that's
interesting about this data structure is
I only ever need a reference to the root
if I have a reference to the root by
moving throughout the tree I can find
any element okay so what happens if two
numbers are equal
well we'll get to that that's a great
question
okay so what I want to do I need a
function I'm going to use prototype to
attach functions so I want the tree
object to have a function called add a
node and it gets a node as the argument
and the first thing I'll do is just say
if this dot root is
is equal to null then this dot root
equals n great so then let's say node n
equals a new node well let's use numbers
for right now because I think that'll be
a little easier to see five and let's
let's make a global variable just tree
tree is your project called binary tree
but tree equals a new tree and I have
this node and tree add node and okay so
and then let me just say console dot log
tree so let's see so this should be so
by the way I'm using p5 here but there's
actually nothing about this that I've
use it there's nothing here that I using
p5 other than the setup function
I have no canvas in there so it doesn't
draw a canvas but I'm actually going
going to probably out and I have an
error or someone just pointed out if
this dot root equals no if I want to
test if it's not I need a double equals
and if I really really really want to
test but could use a triple equals some
guy just want to make a video only about
double equals which is triple equal such
a funny little concept maybe I should do
that Frehley today okay so there we go
so now let's just take let's run this
program where am I here oh I have an
error Matt error sketch dot yes line one
oh my goodness I'm in programming in too
much Java today this should be bar three
right I don't need to give it a type and
good this would be Bar n boy I
programming a job out earlier today you
can tell right okay whoops wrong thing
console dot log not capital tree trees
that particular object there we go so we
can see the tree has a root and has a
node the root is a node with a left and
right being null perfect okay here we go
so we're in pretty good shape now what
happens if I create another note and you
know what you're I don't really need
this variable here I can just do this I
don't need a separate barrel I can just
add a new node I could also if I really
wanted to what if I just just to make
things a little simpler under stay add a
value five and I'm going to have this
function create a node from it and so
this is really the same sort of thing
but this is just a little simpler now
because I can have that function take
care of that okay so what happens now
if I say add value three now first of
all when I write that things that are
less then go to the left let's go back
to the browser that binary tree
yeah looks like these examples oh whoa I
don't know what this is oh boy I don't
know what these what's going on with
these binary trees what yeah this looks
right so less than goes to the left some
of these images are doing so exploit Li
different source is doing not to not
rely on Google Image Search okay let's
go back to my code so let's say I want
to add node okay so I have another error
this needs to be add I change this to
add value you guys should just call it
add but whatever so now what do I do if
root is no it should be the root of that
node so what grew does not know hmm so
what I need to do is say this dot root
add values really what I should do this
is interesting this dot root add value
okay listen to this this is crazy
so I actually I'm losing my mind here
ah okay otherwise here's what I want to
do otherwise I got it this dot root add
add node sorry dot add node and
so okay what am I doing here so what I'm
doing is I want to say if the route is
empty tell to just set it equal but what
is this function this top root add note
this means I need a function as part of
this node that knows how to add
something to itself oh this is great
alright so I need a no function no dot
prototype dot add node equals function
no n so that's the node that's coming in
now what happens if I'm a node and this
comes in well I want to compare the
value of n if n value is less than my
value if n value is less than my value
then this dot Left equals that node
right it should be so if I'm adding it
to myself if it's less it should go
there otherwise this dot right equals
end but this isn't correct this is a
nice idea right and it will work for
just the root because when these two
things are empty it will get added here
but what if it goes to add to the left
but there's something already there what
needs to check against that one I mean
that one it should then go to the left
or entry check it get that one there may
be that it should go to the right so
here's where I need recursion what I
actually want to do is say this dot left
add node N or this dot right add node n
right because I want to just say keep
going but what if this not less is it is
no so if this there's probably more
elegant way to write this if this got
left is null then it should be that
value otherwise keep going same thing
here if uh-oh
if this stock I'm sure I see a lot of
chat messages telling me I'm doing
something wrong so I'm sure I'll
discover that in a second if this cut
right equals null this dot right this
dot right equals n elf and note line 17
o VAR n okay okay big deal that was all
it was that was all was because I keep
writing notes okay so I don't think I
have anything hope late on anything
majorly wrong I'm sure there is I'm sure
there's a way we could write this like a
restock sure this to be a little nicer
but it is saying exactly is doing right
if this value should go to the left if
the left is empty perfect put it there
otherwise recursively go and call that
function again otherwise if otherwise if
it's go to the right now here's the
thing if it's equal I kind of want to do
nothing right now so I think what I'm
going to do with equal if the note is
equal it just shouldn't go anywhere and
so in that case I can say if else if
this dot else if n value is is greater
than this value so actually in the case
of both two values being equal nothing
will happen
so an equal value will get added to the
tree okay so let's take a look at this
okay let's run this what am i let's run
this so the tree has a root which has a
value of five and to the left of it has
the value of three boy this is a really
awkward way to look at it so we're
definitely going to want to visualize
this in some way to see if what we're
doing makes sense but we can see that
this is correct now if I were to then
say add the value it's weird that I
console logged it later it was there add
the value 7 let's try that the tree has
a root and the root has by zoom into
this elected the roots value is 5 the
left value is 3 and the right value is 7
that's exactly right let's just try one
more thing let's just I don't know let's
add six that's a little bit tricky right
but it should be six should go to the
right of five to the left of 7 so let me
refresh this again the tree has a value
note the root of the value of five left
is whoops on the value of three sorry
right has a value of 7 and to the left
of that is the value of six so this is
no way to understand or see this is like
I'm kind of used to this weird
JavaScript console but the tree is there
right only thing I need to know is the
root so remember remember how I said
okay well what if I want to then look at
all of the values or what if I want to
search for a minutes building which is
like a binary search tree the ideas or
storing all this information in this
tree I could search for something in it
so how do I traverse the tree how do I
traverse the tree so let's just look at
how we would traverse the entire tree
and this is exactly it - I want to start
by visiting the root and when I visit
the root I visit the left then I print
out its value but and visit the right
but that's then recursively so visiting
the left means is if this left exists it
left until there's no left then come
back then print out the value then visit
the right center so this algorithm we
worked out very hard to hold this into
your head so recursion is new to you I
think I have a video where I go over it
look at like factorials like math I'll
make drawing some like recursive trees
and fractal patterns you might look for
some of those videos but this is a
tricky thing to get on so let's create a
function now that's part of the tree
prototype I'll call it traversed and it
is a function that says root dot root
visit wait that's right so what I want
to do is first visit the root node okay
and then and the note you know what I
need to do now I need to make some
separate separate files triana make a
file called trees
and I'm going to make a file called a
note no js' oh boy it's not a problem
no js' so if I go to sketch I just want
to be able to pull this code out and
look at it on its own so tree just has
v3 functions now the add value the
Traverse and the tree so the tree is
just really a wrapper for the root
that's all it kind of does the node is
where all the sort of guts of the
algorithm is is is so I want to take all
this node stuff and put it here in this
file and here we go so now all I have is
so far is the constructor to create the
node which has a value and is no left
and right and then this add node
function which recursively figures out
where that to keep going through more
and more notes that were to add it now
what I want to add is a function called
visit and what does it mean to visit
this left visit this dot right visit so
always want to go to the left first
because I want the lower values first so
that was definitely right and then I
want to visit to the right but in
between if I go all the way on the left
if I want to actually do something I
want to process the value or check what
it is here's where I would say console
dot log this dot values so here's the
problem is though I don't want to say
this dot left up this dot left I visit
if it's known so only if this dot left
is not equal to no and I know I could in
JavaScript I could just say as long as
this dot left
exists but just in case you couldn't
have the value of zero which is going to
cause me a problem so I'm going to I'm
going to stick with checking to make
sure it's null and if this stop right
does not equal to null this dot right
dot visit okay
look at it so simple beautiful elegant I
love this kind of stuff line seven I
have something wrong in line seven no no
dot prototype thank you I love having a
chat that debug this stuff okay so here
we go
I think I just sort of typed this from
scratch could this possibly really work
so let's now let's go here and see if in
the sketch I'm going to now say three
dot Traverse and I should just see all
the values in sorted order so okay tree
is not huh tree is not defined oh of
course I always do this I forgot to add
a reference to these two new files I
just invented a whole new JavaScript
library called node that's a yes not
really
tree is there's a whole big server-side
JavaScript programming pretty more
called node so I feel like maybe a
little bit weird that I called my file
knows that yes but will live ok root is
not defined this stuff
I forgot this duck clearly did I forget
it anywhere else I don't think so
let's run this again there we go look at
those values 3 5 6 7 ok let's try this
in a crazy fun time way because because
of this already been so much fun let's
say for VAR I equals 0 I is less than 10
i plus plus let's add a random number
between 0 and 100 and I'm going to floor
it just so it's integers even though I
don't really need to and I'm going to
console.log tree and say tree duck so
i'm stead of hard-coding the numbers I'm
going to pick random one and let's run
it please look sorted these looks sorted
these looks sorted it's great and lets
out a thousand yeah it happened pretty
quickly so I mean you would have to sit
out here's the thing let's let's go back
to just doing this with
and let's look at the actual tree the
root has a node to the left which is 68
no the the root is 89 to the left is 68
to the right is 93 again this is no way
to look at it so we're done with the
binary tree I didn't actually add a
function that is that involved searching
the tree which I probably should that
would kind of make sense but so we could
search so we got that let's add that
let's add a function that searches the
tree and it's going to be very similar
to traverse so we're going to say three
dot prototype dot
search equals function I'm going to
search for a value and we're actually
just going to do the exact same thing Oh
sort of we're going to say this dot root
dot search for Val so again the tree
object is just a wrapper for the root
and we're going to say search the root
so now this visit function is going to
be very useful because we're essentially
doing the same thing but what we're
first doing is we're first thing does
this dot value equal Val right my first
then I want to say console.log found
plus Val and then otherwise otherwise if
this value is less than note sorry if
val is less than this value then and and
this dot left is not equal to no then I
want to enough then I want to go and
search for that value here and then I'm
going to do the same exact thing
for the right and I'm going to search
for the value to the right so this is
how I could just say hey is the root the
value no but I'm less than it so just
let's look at everything to the left so
I don't need to this I'm not traversing
the whole tree I only don't need to go
the one direction that I need to go so
insert one direction music right now
okay so let's see if let's do this let's
see if this works
so this what's in the tree right now all
these numbers so if I say tree dot
search 53 this dot root search is not a
function what did I do wrong oh I called
it I sorry I called it visit again this
should be searched let's do this again
so I want to say tree dot search let's
look for 61 sounds 61 can you guys see
this refresh this again well you can't
see at the bottom there because it's cut
off so let's do this
ah sorry hold on so let's do a tree dot
search and let's look for something it's
not there so 9 is not there undefined so
that's pretty good I probably should
have something where I mean that's why I
might want to explicitly somewhere say
at the end return return undefined or
return not sound but I can basically say
here now in my wherever I oh you know I
should just return so that's what I
should do sorry run right when I found
it what that's what I should do to make
more sense right here I should say
return a a metalic return the node
return this so that's I found it at this
notes I'm going to return the note and
then at the end I believe if I just say
return you know no so if it never finds
it eventually it's going to recursively
percolate through all these functions to
get to the end and return
I think that's right - let's do this
again so now it's a tree dot search for
20 which I know is in there somewhere
and I got undefined oh you know what
this is not the right place for this
because right because it could be eco
cuz it's equal no hmm vertical both time
host wait wait let me take this out for
a second after think about that tree dot
search for undefined what's wrong here
what did I miss
return this console dot log sound Wow oh
whoa this should save our sound I don't
know why I didn't have a sit I didn't
add the part I'm really sorry everybody
on my brain must have just melted I bar
found equals this so if sound is not
equal to no console dot log you know
found and then I could I could put that
object out otherwise console dot log not
not found I don't know why I missed that
so we're searching okay okay
so now I should say tree search ten
found 10 not found so why does that
happen
why is that
oh oh oh no it can it sound it but said
mascot what am i oh oh oh oh oh I might
my returns is off my return is all
messed up
think about this boy this is hard
search sounds oh no I'm in the wrong
place
oh I mean I'm in the wrong place this is
where I need I just want haven't really
think thought about what I'm doing it
helps to think about what you're doing
what am i doing
I want the tree this is the function I'm
calling I want this function to return
something it's printing out the right
thing the whole point of this is not to
print something out but to return the
thing that's found return sound that's
all I need to do forget about all this I
want to return found because I want to
see it in the console so where else I
might call it so that's I just kind of
like got confused because I'm typing
everything into the console which is a
little bit confusing so let's run this
again and say tree search 19 and hold on
did I not save everything
ah okay of course the problem is I need
if I want to return a value you know one
of the nice things about this digit
thing is I was just going through
everything I loved it worrying about
returning a value so we just call the
next function but if I want to I need to
return the results of the recursive
calls so I need this return and I need
this return so this should really fix it
so I'm going to refresh this and I'm
going to say tree search twelve and now
I've got twelve like as I changed it to
but I want to return a reference to the
full object doesn't really matter but
tree dot search five and we can see I
got the node now the chance the value
fine we know this laptop is kind of
covering it so okay so that's how you
search the tree and it by the way I
search for something that's not in there
I'm going to get undefined however I can
put this back in just to be sure and I
can get null so if what I want to do is
you know now actually here I could say
you know tree dot search
you know 10 let's just see if this tree
has 10 in it and and I could say now if
result equals null console dot log not
found elf console dot log you know
result so now I'm going to run this and
ten is not in there ten is not in there
10 is on in there how likely is it's
going to put Ted and arrow it had one
tooth found 10 so you know about 1 out
of every 10 times I get Kim stop
skipping refresh stop find it find it
find it oh oh what's wrong with me okay
you guys get the point okay so this is a
binary tree whoa hopefully what you see
now just to summarize I think I'm going
to in a separate video and make a part
two where I add some visuals to it so
that that's what I want you to be
thinking about well why would you this
is an important data structure that you
can use to store information for binary
search for sorting for dictionary of
words or so many possibilities but the
key thing is what kind of creative
outcomes could you have here could you
create some type of game which involves
a binary tree and you have to add things
and find things with swirlix
there's the sort of lingo thing I made
before it make a binary tree rata
specifics to it just visualizing it is
there something beautiful in the way
that the binary tree you traverse the
binary tree recursively could you do
some kind of nice animation I think
there might be some unique possibilities
there so I'm not very good at this kind
of stuff any of it really but especially
the visual stuff but in the next video
I'm going to at least try to draw some
of the tree so we can see how it looks
if we if we draw for a basic element
okay I'll see you there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
