git and github and this video is about
resolving merge conflicts so I probably
should be doing this video in my poem
repository which I use for all of my
intro to get and github videos but I
happen to be here streaming live and
working on this neural network library
that I've been building in a bunch of
other video tutorials so if you just
watch those git and github videos all
about using a poem to sort of
demonstrate how git and github works
there'll be some aspects of this that
are confusing but hopefully this will be
helpful anyway and I can always double
back and make another video if this one
doesn't work but let's just try it so
what is a merge conflict first of all so
a bird conflict is when you have let's
say on git let's say this is a file in
this case it's my file called matrix Jas
so I have a file called matrix touch
pass and it has code in it now I had two
people two separate people of the
internet happened to be working on this
file so we'll call one person a and one
person B now any text file has lines in
it so even over a poem it would have
lines of the poem if it's a source code
file has lines of the source code so we
can think of the lines is like 1 2 3 4 5
6 now if person a makes a change and
submits a pull request meaning hey hey
you the library please pull my changes
right I want to push my changes to you
but I'm asking requesting that you pull
my changes if this person just made
changes to lines 5 &amp;amp; 6 and this person
just made chiton this person is doing
the same thing but made saintly changes
aligned 2 &amp;amp; 3 the get system is smart
enough to figure out how to pull both of
these things then with no conflicts
because there are no conflicts if I want
to accept changes of lines 2 &amp;amp; 3 I can
accept those at the same time one before
the other simultaneously can't really do
it simultaneous
as lines 5 &amp;amp; 6 however if right here
person B makes a change to line 4 in
person a also makes a change the line 4
then we have what's known as a conflict
and typically what will happen what just
happened to me right now is I merged
this one I merged this one wasn't and
thinking about it was done it's finished
and it worked fine it merged with no
problems but now when I went to merge
this one I got a message saying resolve
conflicts now there are a variety of
ways you can resolve conflicts and I
think that I have in some of my previous
tutorials looked at working with git
command line locally and I could have
the text file there but what I'm gonna
do is see if I could resolve the
conflict just through the github
interface itself so let's take a look at
how that works now once again this isn't
the best scenario and I might come back
and do a follow-up with it could be nice
to see kind of a trivial example that
just where I can really know what the
changes are but I'm just going to look
and see there's a whole discussion here
and we can see these are the files these
are the files that have conflicts in
them matrix Dutchess and matrix dot test
Dutch ass so hopefully you can continue
to watch this even if you don't
understand what the code in those files
is doing i I'm gonna look and see what
are the conflicts are oh this is
definitely good we gotta go down to go
down the tubes the internet tubes really
quickly so I'm gonna click this resolve
conflicts button and now it's look at
this ooh okay all right oh I mean matrix
Jas hmm okay I have to figure out what's
going on here so we can see I look this
is where the conflict is oh look I think
I know how to resolve this okay so this
is where the conflict is now what is it
telling me here math improvements master
equals equals Google equal equals
greater greater than greater than so
what this is showing me is this is
showing me through kind of like a visual
interface in the text file that there
are two proposed ways that this code
could run one of the files had it this
way and one of the files had it this way
in fact the current master has it this
way but the one that I'm trying to merge
has it this way and why does this one
have it this way
this is the thing that I changed I want
this so it's up to me now there's no
right or wrong answer here as the kind
of proprietor of this github repository
I've got to decide if both pull requests
worked on worked on if sorry if both
pull requests worked on the same line I
have to pick one which one do I want and
I want I'm gonna take this one at the
bottom so I'm going to delete delete
this and I'm gonna delete this whoops
what did I just do I'm gonna I'm gonna
delete this now eh I knew how to use a
computer I'm gonna delete this and now
are there any other conflicts
please be no other conflicts oh I'm so
lucky I'm gonna now say mark as resolved
now one thing you can do if you're the
proprietor of a github repository is you
could just write to the person spitting
the poet rest I'm so sorry but some
conflicts arose I love your pull
requests do you think you could refactor
it because you could leave this up to
the contributor certainly but I'm here
live on the internet I mean maybe I'm
not live anymore I've recorded and so
there we go
Oh No okay uh so now I have this other
file mm-hmm let's look at this I might
just quit while I'm ahead here
but let's see if I can look at this
other file so this this code might look
very strange to you this is something
called unit testing and actually we're
late into this video series I have a
video series that I will link to in this
video's description about how you can
run automated tests that make sure a
change in your code doesn't actually
break your code that's what this is
doing here so there's map improvements
that's the pull request and master you
know what I think this is a very trivial
change it looks to me like this was just
added at the end and there was like a
line break or something that caused a
merge kind of like so this looks like
something that I could actually just
completely delete here and then delete
here and this is just some new stuff
that got added to the end as part of
this pull request there was like an
extra line break or something so github
detected a conflict but it really was
not a conflict so now I can go and I can
click mark as resolved
and look at this huh commit merge so
here's the thing mmm-hmm where am i
right now
so I mmm I resolved all the conflicts do
I want to do this I think this button if
I'm right is not actually looking at the
chat to see if anybody's complaining
about what I've done is not actually
merging the pull request I think this is
the committing the resolution of the
conflicts to conflicts to the pull
request let's find out because I'm gonna
just it's a green button when I see a
green button it just makes me want to
click it quick so I think the pull
request is still going to be live
inactive but it's taking a while yes all
it did yeah all it did was fix the
conflicts where can I find that that was
done here yes that was this so this is
me now there's a little note that I
merged branch master into map
improvements that's basically saying
there were conflicts between master and
map improvements this pull request was
map improvements and there was me
merging them together and resolving the
conflicts and now I can actually go
ahead the conflicts are resolved and I
can merge the pull request
it's nothing exciting is an avenue it
really should it should like you Betty
should explode confirm and look but I
can make something happen yeah okay so
that was a video about resolving merge
conflicts through the github interface
there's sort of basic gist of it perhaps
I missed something important and I will
certainly make a follow-up video so let
me know what I missed what questions you
have in the comments and thanks for
watching this video about merging
resolving conflicts merging them with a
pull request something something get
github I don't know like search engine
optimized keywords throw them in there
okay bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
