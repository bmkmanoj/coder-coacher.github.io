create capture in p5.js and how the
create capture function allows you to
get a live image from your webcam so I
want to talk briefly just about what the
create capture function does technically
behind the scenes before I start typing
to the code and seeing the result so
let's come with me over here look I'm
over here now hello so um as you know a
p5 I don't know if you know this but
you've watched any other videos you do
p5 has these functions set up and draw
set up being the thing that runs at the
beginning of a p5 GS sketch and the
thing that you typically have in a p5 GS
sketch is a function called create
canvas this is not necessarily required
which gets a width and a height and what
does that function do it places a canvas
in the browser window itself so the goal
for this video by the end of this video
is to say you know your laptop which has
a like a webcam at the top I want to see
the image you know from that webcam I
want to see that in the canvas so the
way that you can connect to the default
camera of your computer and anybody's
computer happens to be loading your
sketch in their browser is with the
function create capture so the create
capture function and then you pass it
one argument video what the create
capture function does is it creates a
connection to like I think it's called
in web language like user get media
something like that but what what it
does behind the scenes is it actually
creates a separate Dom element Dom
referring to document object model this
being the document there being objects
in the document the one thing we created
is a canvas as you know in p5 you can
also create things like a paragraph with
create P you could create things like a
slider with create slider you could
create button with create button so you
can make all these elements that live on
the web page and create capture actually
what it does is creates a video Dom
element which contains the image from
that camera so on the one hand this
might be what you want you want to have
a canvas and a video element separate
from each other but in a sort of classic
creative coding sense whatever whatever
that means
you might just want to be doing some
kind of animation or abstract visual
arts thingamabob based on what's in that
video so you don't actually want to see
that Dom element you just want to paint
it to the canvas and mess with it on the
canvas so that's what I need to look at
how to do with code and and and and and
we'll see in a second but I think it's
important to point out that create
capture is actually part of the p5 Dom
library and actually creates a separate
element on the page and so let's go look
at that okay so here I am back over here
and I've got a sketch I'm working just
in sublime text today running a local
server and looking at the results in the
Chrome browser if you don't know how to
do that I made a separate video that I
will link to that shows how to get that
setup going but you can use any any web
editor thing of your choice to do all of
this so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to say create capture and pass in
the argument video so I'm adding that to
my code I'm going to go over to the
browser and I'm going to hit refresh and
you can see now there it is the canvas
is there and the capture is there now
what is the resolution of this capture
make it a little smaller you can see
that this capture looks bigger than the
canvas it actually made my canvas 320 by
240 the capture the video is 640 by 480
that only I guess happens to be whatever
default resolution the browser the
camera who knows making who's making
that decision but that's what you're
getting now if I wanted to change the
size of this element
it's a Dom element so I can use for
example the p5 function size ah but how
do I do that so what if I want to now
manipulate what if I want to manipulate
sorry I lost my train of thought for a
second what if I want to manipulate the
capture element itself I need to store a
reference to it in a variable so what
I'm going to do is add a variable to the
top I'll call it video I will say video
equals create capture I could have
called it anything cam
caPSURE whatever and i can now also say
video dot size 320 by 240 so now what
I've done is I've created that
connection it made that Dom element and
I've sized it down and you can see here
and you can see now I have on my web
page I have the canvas and the video
hooray so now we can start to do some
more things I said what if I want to
ultimately not see this separate image
but actually paint into the canvas so I
can do other stuff on top of it well one
of the nice things about working in p5
is p5 has already set up the landscape
of things for you so that this video Dom
element can act just like any other
image would act in p5 so for example in
draw if I just say I set up my settings
correctly if I just say image my sublime
settings will do that later video I like
to have two spaces for the indent you
know it's very important to me my life
feels very out of control my indentation
isn't working correctly the way that I
like it take a deep breath move on okay
so if I say image video 0 0 and I do
that and now I hit refresh we can see
there it is so I've got now I've got the
actual video Dom element and I have the
canvas where I'm drawing the video onto
the canvas but you can see I can do
things like now with the canvas I can
add other functions like tint you know I
could make it very let's see what
happens if I get kind of pinkish we can
see here oh you know what interesting ah
so a little bug happened I'm going to
fix this bug and it's actually it is
already a github issue file so by the
time you run this with your p5 in the
future this won't happen to you I'm
going to just fix it by by enforcing the
size here but what happened is when I
added tint the pixels got manipulated
and suddenly it went back to 640 by 480
even though it should that shouldn't
have happened so this video is going to
have a historical error in it which will
get fixed but I in my code I was able to
fix it by just enforcing the size that
I'm drawing the image so you
see that in the canvas I can do various
things to manipulate the image itself
and while I was altering the size I
might as well see I could do something
like let me make mouse X the width and
now you can see I have this video that I
can kind of like shrink and make myself
kind of like skinny or wider or a little
bit skinnier and you can see I'm not
drawing the background so I'm getting
these weird trails so anything that you
can do with images shapes I could add
translate I could add rotate I could
spin it I could shrink it I can flip it
all of those types of things I can do
with the video and if I it's nice to
have this Dom element as a reference of
what the original video looks like but
if I didn't want to have that one thing
I'll show you is I could add video dot
hide so the hide function hides a
particularly meet you can now see that
the only thing is the canvas and the
video so that concludes what I
originally set out as the goal which was
to be able to capture video from the
camera and draw in the canvas however I
must alert you to something that will
trip you up I probably should have led
with this and not finished with it
notice how it didn't ask me for
permission it didn't say like oh can I
have access to your camera is that okay
what you are doing if you took this
sketch and uploaded it to your website
potentially if somebody came to your
website it could automatically turn on
their camera you could take pictures of
them and save that to your server so
typically speaking what you're the user
is going to see is like oh can I have
access to the camera but some browsers
in particular the Chrome browser will
only actually let you do this if you are
serving your website from what's known
as HTTP the s being secure so if you
ever go to the address bar in your
browser it'll sometimes say HTTP and
will sometimes say HTTPS if you're like
on your bank's website it's I hope it
says HTTPS because you need a level of
encryption and security there so
depending on where you're uploading your
thing if you're just working locally on
your own computer
and making whatever and experimenting
it's always going to work but if you're
uploading it to your own website you
need to have HTTPS enabled some web
servers might have this as a feature for
you like Heroku I believe if you're
using that that's a web service thing
company others won't and so you need to
like purchase and get a certificate and
maybe I can make a video about that if I
even knew how to do that but one thing
I'll point out that someone pointed to
me recently is there is something called
let's encrypt let's encrypt is free
automated and open it's a new
certificate authority so that might be
something you could look into if you
need to resolve this issue in terms of
where you're uploading I do know for
example though that github pages I
believe if you're using github pages as
a way of hosting something that I
believe you can use HTTPS with anyway
but also you could just not use Chrome
and it might work in a different browser
yada-yada-yada this will all be
irrelevant and I'm gonna have to dub the
robots of the future will dub over me
and explain this correctly because this
is all going to become totally not
relevant anymore probably a week from
now two weeks from now two months from
now etc okay thanks for watching this
video in the next video you know so I
would say if you're looking for
something to do try to get this to work
mess around manipulate the video in the
next video I'm going to show you how to
save snapshots over time from a live
