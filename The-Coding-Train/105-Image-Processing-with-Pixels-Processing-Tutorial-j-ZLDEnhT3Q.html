now that we've kind of looked at the
pixel array and understand how the pixel
array mapped to the actual pixels in a
window the next thing I want to do is
think about this particular scenario so
here is our processing our processing
window now what if we have an image and
the image I have in the example that
I'll work with is a frog so what if I
have an image frog JPEG which looks like
a frog has a frog let's say I want to
look at every single pixel of that Frog
and copy that pixel into the window why
might I do that well for the one thing
we know the image function frog is a
function that takes an image and draws
it to a given X Y so in section what
we're doing here is learning how to
write the guts of this function how we
have an image we can look at every
single pixel take every single pixel
value and put those pixel values into
our processing window the reason why we
might do this without the image function
is we want something else to happen
right here in the moment of taking this
pixel and transfer into the screen maybe
we want to make that face a little
brighter or darker or turning to black
and white or insert you're much more
creative and interesting idea for image
processing right there so this is this
if we can understand this algorithm of
looking at the pixels putting them into
the window and doing something to
manipulate the colors of those pixels in
between then we can start building a
photoshop and you know from scratch I
don't know what I'm saying
you know okay so this is the idea let's
look at how we might do this up but
before we go up on inches so this is the
way that I'm going to build our first
example of looking at image processing
however I'm going to suggest that there
might be a slightly away that's it might
actually be a little bit better in the
end for a variety of reasons so let's
just say our processing window is here
this is our processing window and we
have our image of our throg what if I
had another image a blank image another
p image object and here i actually
process all the pixels from the Frog
into this image object through our
algorithm pixel by pixel by pixel and
then here I just use the image function
to draw this new blank image into the
window the reason why this is useful to
do is this is going to work really
nicely for demonstration purposes but as
soon as the window is a slightly
different size and our sourcing it so
this way if I am creating an empty p
image i am manipulating the pixels of
this frog putting it into this empty p
image and then putting that p image onto
the screen then my window is kind of
retains its purity it could be any size
I could be drawing stuff on it and they
don't have to worry so much about having
some type of conflict between setting
the pixels and drawing stuff so this is
a nice way of working as well in terms
of image processing I should mention
that we also could just to give a third
option here if this is my Frog and this
is my processing window I could just
like manipulate the pixels of the Frog
itself onto itself and then draw it to
the window the reason why this is not
the best strategy in all cases is once
I've manipulated the pixels of the Frog
image to draw out of the window I've
lost my original frog image so this
scenario saves this frog image it never
changes it if I'm manipulating the
pixels the new pixels are going to a
separate image and then separate image
to the window but again let's start with
this simpler case of just reading the
pixels of the Frog and putting those
fixes in the window and let's take a
look at how that might work like it so
I'm back over here and if I run this
particular sketch here's my frog that I
just grabbed from the internet and I'm
loading the image and drawing the image
and there it is in the screen now notice
here the size Y is my size of this
window 858 by 536 that's because this
image of the Frog I downloaded those are
the dimensions that in it and to make
this example work really nicely without
by accident running into a problem you
know with all this math of multiplying
by width the width of the image with the
window are different with our bath has
to be a little bit more sophisticated to
account for that which is an important
thing to learn in practice I would say
maybe try that as an exercise first get
this idea of image processing to work
with an image and window of the same
dimensions then see what happens when
you change the dimensions hello this
again is going to be a good scenario for
that doesn't matter what size the linker
is because things will always be safe
okay so let's come back over here and
think about how to do this now I have
from our previous example in the
previous video that code commented out
so if I come at this back out in and run
this I now have why I got weird dark
center white white edges results right
because I've said in every the pic every
pixel according to some arbitrary
algorithm that's coloring the pixels
according their distance from the center
I don't need that here I can get rid of
this line of code and what do I actually
want here
I want image dot pixels look look at
this single OASI image and sorry it's
frog look at this line of code what I'm
saying is go to that frog image give me
the pixel from that location take that
pixel and put it into the screen at the
same location for every single pixel go
and get the pixel for the Frog put it on
the screen now one thing I missed is you
see I'm loading the pixels for the
window
because I'm going to mess with those
pixels I probably should also alert
processing to the fact that I don't want
to look at the frogs pixels as well so
I'm going to say frog little pixels the
truth of the matter is I'm feeling if I
didn't have that engine still work
loading and updating pixels is sort of a
funny thing like CD 2 sometimes you
don't I would say why not just do it all
the time then you don't have to worry
about whether you didn't need it to or
not okay look at this
there's our frog I just just to prove
that this is really doing that I'm going
to comment out this line of code which
was drawing the entire frog in sugar
window there it is there's a front we
have now written the guts of that image
function we have now in the code that
says look at every pixel from an image
and put it all those pixels in the
window we have really done anything yet
interesting cuz we're just verbatim
taking that exact color and putting it
exactly in the window let's look at what
we might do to kind of mess with that so
one problem here is that you know I
could start to do something weird like
well what if I just said like / - that's
kind of a straight result right the
things about that's kind of cool
actually a sort of surprising result the
the reason why this is giving us such a
strange unintentional confusing
difficult to predict result is remember
the actual color is just this
conglomerate of the RGB values into one
big integer so the actual number is
somewhat irrelevant what we need to do
is actually look at the red green and
blue components individually so what I
think might be a good strategy here
would be to say give me the red part of
the pixel the green part the blue part
and then make a new color RGB okay so I
added one little bit here what did I do
I've got my frog again is exactly what
it was before but instead of saying that
exact pixel put it there I said
give you the bag give you the cream give
you the blue make a new color RGB and
put it there now at least understand
what's really going on I now have access
to the red creative blue components of
every single color what am i choosing to
do with that information
nothing I'm just gonna get verbatim on
the screen but I could it could be
really mischievious here and I could say
aha let me swap the green and the red
values and now I've kind of done
something strange too the color of this
frog so you can start to see that once
I've done this I now have the ability to
start doing anything I want to those
pixels I could say like you know the
blue value times 2 which is making it
much bluer so this is really now now
we're here in the world of image
processing we are looking at every
single pixel for every single pixel we
were grabbing the RGB components and we
are manipulating those values and
drawing a new image this is essentially
what an image filter does you know sell
your Instagram for 2 billion dollars or
whatever it yes so thank you in the
middle so this appetizer is in many ways
a good place to stop because here you
now could kind of recreate this
algorithm if your assignment your
exercise would be like come up with
something a little bit more interesting
to do but let's let's before we get
before before I leave you with that kind
of exercise let's think about some
creative possibilities that or that go
beyond just kind of changing the colors
around one thing is the pixels are
spatially oriented we know they're X Y
values so we can do something different
to each pixel right now we're doing the
same operation to every single pixel we
could say like for example what if I you
know if X is greater than 200 do this
otherwise if X otherwise do you know put
the pixels back to normal and we can see
you know I only have only doing this
weird algorithm to these pixels and not
to these pixels so you can start to do
whatever you can kind of imagine
here based on the X&amp;amp;Y nas another idea
that I might have for you is to go back
to that distance idea what if I said
okay give me the distance between the
boat sorry the center of the window and
the XY of that pixel and now whoops
pixels look of equals a color why don't
I say use that distance to and to add it
to each one of these colors now I can
start to see well everything just got
really really bright so one thing we can
notice here is that how do we affect the
brightness of a pixel the brightness of
a pixel is affected by the magnitude of
its color value so we're using distance
here but perhaps an easier demonstration
would be let me just add mouse X to
every single pixel color you can see
that over here I'm breading bright and
bright and brighten the image of course
once all those ideas get to 255 I have a
completely white image another way of
doing this would be to multiply each
color so what if I multiply each color
times you know one point one I'm making
each color 10% bright so you know if
you're not familiar with the map
function processing the map function
says giving a value of certain range and
map it to another range so what if I
have a factor and I map the distance the
distances tell somewhere between like
zero and 200 or something like that and
why don't I map that to between zero and
two and why don't I multiply each each
component of the color by that factor so
what I've done here now when I run this
oops sorry
the distance
has a range between 0 and 200 not that
range to range between 0 and 2 and if
you notice as I that pixels are now
darker in the center and brighter to the
towards the edge and really I think it
might be more interesting if they're
brighter towards the center and darker
towards the edge look I kind of
highlighted the center of this image and
why am i hard coding in the center when
I could actually just move the mouse
around now I have this kind of like
flashlight effect so I'm manipulating
the brightness of every single pixel
according to its distance from the mouse
again I kind of quickly just like mocked
up this demonstration the point is it
doesn't matter what you do here the
point what matters is I'm getting the
RGB and I'm making a new color so
where'd you come up with your own idea
of how you might be able a the image
look just just I should probably finish
this video but just to do one more
demonstration uninteresting I'm going to
comment this out so I have access to it
later if I'm saving these and putting
them somewhere something we might know
about an image is the brightness of a
pixel so let's say I just get the
brightness of the frogs pixel at a given
location a threshold filter something we
could do is we can say let's redraw this
image but I'm only going to only draw a
white or black it doesn't matter I'm not
going to draw any kind of interesting
color on how you draw a grayscale color
I'm only ever going to say
make every pixel black not never you
could make a pixel black or make a pixel
white now what if I make all the pixels
white if the brightness of the fraud
pixel is greater than 100 a black if
it's less than one let's run this and
you can see I sort of see the Frog in
there
pixels are white or black and you can
see what's the threshold the threshold
is 100 if a pixels is brighter than 100
it's white and you know maybe what I
should do here is kind of use the mouse
to control this threshold and we can
start to see like I can now kind of
recreate this frog image and my
threshold with the mouse over here seems
kind of like a nice one before I'm
seeing the Frog as white in the
background this black so the reason why
I point this out to you is this is
starting to kind of walk into this area
of computer vision that we're going to
look at later if I wanted to find the
Frog in this image applying a threshold
would allow me to sort of separate out
the image into only one your black
pixels and maybe I could then get the
average location of all the white pixels
and that's about where the Frog is so
you could see how like visually it's
kind of almost easier to recognize it's
actually not easy to recognize visually
for us because we're a human being and
all the colors are very meaningful to us
but to a computer algorithm now it's
very easy to recognize a white pixel
versus a black pixel so perhaps this
idea of different types of image
processing filters might be useful later
as we begin to try to recognize or
analyze or get gain some sort of aspect
of the of the knowledge about the image
according to its pixels so these are
some sample ideas of things you can do I
could just set her in pixel black or
white etc pixel according to the
distance I would say here is now an
opportunity for you to do a couple
things one try to invent your own image
processing algorithm or recreate one
that you know about another thing that
we might consider
I'm going to have time to put this in
the videos right now I'll come back and
do it later is if you could make your
own image by saying create image this is
the function you could look this up in
the processing reference that makes it
empty image see if you could redo this
example from drawing and I have this
I'll try to link to it below that from
instead of drawing your pixels from the
image to the window draw your pixels
from an image to a blanket and then draw
that blank image in the window and then
you could have a blank image rotate grow
shrink there's lots of possible way to
do from there but I'll try to fill in a
video that covers that at some point so
maybe by the time you're watching it'll
actually just be the next video okay
thanks very much and this one is
