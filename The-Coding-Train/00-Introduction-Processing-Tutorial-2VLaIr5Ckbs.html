awkward because it's very hard to begin
these things but we're just gonna go
right in and we're gonna begin hello my
name is Dan perhaps you've watched a
video that I've been hit before perhaps
you haven't I don't know how you got
here but you're here I'm here you're
here we're here together there's a wall
here I can write on it it's gonna be a
computer over there why are we here have
you ever wanted to learn programming
have you never even tried to learn
programming have you never written a
line of code before in your life you
have no idea what it means to program to
read code to create your own software do
you want to break free from the bonds of
the tools that other people have made
for you do you want to write your own
build your own software make your own
things from scratch on the computer if
so I this sounds like a sales pitch but
really there's nothing to sell here you
could just believe at any moment but if
so you're in the right place this is a
video series that is going to teach you
how to program your computer now how
what kinds of what programming language
you use what environment you use what it
is you want to make is a huge giant mess
of stuff we're going to do things in a
simple way I'm going to talk a lot more
about this we're going to use something
called processing I'm just going to talk
to you I'm going to draw diagrams I will
demonstrate for you code examples on
this computer over here it's all going
to be in video now you might have some
questions like oh I get it
I heard about these things this is kind
of like a boob I don't have pronounced
it MOOC is this a MOOC it's not a MOOC
it could be a MOOC you could make it
into a MOOC but I don't know MOOCs it's
a little bit scary this is just some
videos to help you learn hope you might
find you might do this on your own you
might use these in the comforts to
supplement a class you're taking you
might be a teacher of some other people
and want to use these videos in your
course I don't know but I would like
them to be helpful however you think
they might be helpful
so the other thing you might ask is this
seems a little weird just talking and
drying drawing diagrams you know I hear
about all these new fancy interactive
online learning tests quizzing and I can
watch you know that those things are
great and I would like to altom utley
incorporate some stuff where you could
easily look at the code while I'm
demonstrating it try things out the Khan
Academy is doing some fantastic stuff
John Resig and the CS course is there I
highly recommend them are doing lots of
similar stuff I'm just kind of doing
what I do which is I draw a whiteboard
on Husted but this computing machine to
type out examples they will all be
available for you to download there's
even a book that I will hesitate to show
you that you could use to follow along
I'm also going to do some live online
live events where I'm gonna take calls
and answer questions which is another
kind of digress here but that's going to
happen too so um that's really I made
some notes over here and I this is uh so
far but let me talk it for three minutes
is my intro video but so if you really
just want to get into the meat of the
stuff you can skip ahead I don't know
that I will link to it I don't know the
video number hex haven't made it but
there's a video you could just jump to
which is hey let's start let's write our
first line of code let's see how
everything works but I'm going to have a
few more videos just to kind of talk a
little bit more about Who I am what I
imagine you might use this for what is
programming it because it's kind of a
general question what are programming
languages that you might use that I'm
using why am i using this one versus
that one oh yeah everything gonna be
okay I think so so I'm just gonna have a
few more introductory videos I'll show
you I hopefully make one where I show
you a bunch of projects that are kind of
that you might think of as possible
outcomes or that relate to the types of
things we're going to be doing in this
video series so there's a bunch more
intro videos that I'm going to make
they'll be short five-minute videos that
you can watch but at any point you could
just stop completely and go out you know
chess is a fun game there's I don't know
I put basketball is nice music learning
to play the violin
I did that for a while it's very
enjoyable you go to something else or if
or you could jump ahead and this turned
off I have a camera turning off from or
you could jump ahead and kind of get to
the point where you think you're ready
to get to okay
hopefully it's going to be fine that's
