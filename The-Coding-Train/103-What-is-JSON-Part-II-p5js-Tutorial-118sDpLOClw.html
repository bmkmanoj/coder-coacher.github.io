discussion about working with JSON data
and in the previous video I looked at
this thing that's wonderful in the world
a sunflower beautiful flower and how you
might encapsulate the idea of a
sunflower as data in a JSON file it was
kind of a reasonable demonstration for
this first step of working with data but
if you look at it it's it's it's a it's
really simple it's like a single object
it's got four properties in it there's
not a lot of complexity you know flower
named flower dot R that's all you sort
of had to worry about but realistically
you're going to find a data set that's
going to have a lot more in it you might
want to have a data set that has you
know the high temperature in you know
Tokyo every day for the last year and
then lots of other information about the
weather that day and there's going to be
a list and a whole bunch of like nested
objects so what's the scenario like that
and how do you deal with it so um the
scenario that I'm going to use I think
and I'll pull it from this website that
I mentioned that has a whole lot of data
sources in it that you can grab let's
think about birds for a second another
personal favorite topic of mine so that
I'm not gonna be able to like pull names
of birds out of a hat but so first
things first if you go back to this
there's just a single thing in there I
really should just keep going with the
flowers thing but an example I have is
birds so what if your data isn't like a
single object but actually is a whole
bunch of objects like here are 10 images
from Google Image Search or here are 10
recent articles from the New York Times
what if your data is 10 birds that live
in Antarctica is that what I have I
can't remember that's that's the data
that I have so the data set again a
JavaScript object generally always
starts with a curly bracket and a close
curly bracket to indicate it's an object
but the data itself might have an array
in it and that array might be named
birds
and each one of those birds might be an
object with a name you know penguin and
a height like antiquated something I do
sighs hi klutz just go with height
I don't know how taller penguins are
small one meter right and then that's an
object and then the next thing in the
array is the name is an eagle and these
should be in quotes and the height of an
eagle home is three meters obviously I
don't know anything about birds clearly
we're finding out so you can see how
this now has a bit more complexity than
just the sunflower because what we have
here is an object that has a property in
it called Birds that property is an
array each element of the array is an
object so let's say for example we
loaded this into a variable called data
how would you get access to the height
of the Eagle for example data dot birds
would get me here now this is an array
this is element 0 this is element 1 so
we consider array I've got to say index
1 and so now I'm in this object and I
want to get the height dot height so you
can see I have to figure out the path
into this JSON file I need to know the
property name that I'm looking for and
if that property is an array I need to
know the index that I'm looking for and
if that thing in the array is an object
I need to know the property of that
object that I'm looking for so this is
just one scenario I could just I could
probably like let this camera record for
like the next 72 hours and just keep
making scenario like
like we would all become like insane in
our like world of like JSON scenarios
but so this is the kind of thing you
really need to unfortunately or
fortunately practice on your own as you
start to find different data sources but
let's do this one step further and I'm
going to go pull an actual data set
about birds and then we'll double back
and do this again with that data set and
there's also another missing piece here
what if you wanted to actually loop
through and do something there are a
hundred birds in this file how would I
make this index into the array some sort
of variable like I so I could say what's
the first bird in the second burden then
the third bird so that's another aspect
of this that's important okay so let's
go to the place where I'm going to find
data set it's a github repository and
I'm gonna skip talking about what github
or get is but you can find the URL I'll
definitely post it somewhere and see if
you want to pause the video and look at
it it's right up here just slash kippur
is all you need
oops I'm already there so I want to go
here and I'm going to click under data
and I'm going to look for animals and
I'm really like which one was I doing
birds of North America oh no let's do
the Antarctica Birds of Antarctica so
you can see here is the JSON file now
let's make this actually so let me I'm
sorry let me do something to just copy
it into p5 so I'm going to make a new
JSON file called Birds JSON I'm going to
paste it in here I'm going to hit save
I'm going to make this a little bigger
and I'm going to come look at it here so
here we have this scenario now and we
have to do some detective work
so let's come back over to you I'm gonna
have to go back and forth a little bit
this is no longer our JSON file our JSON
file is actually you could look at it
for a second while I race it's that
thing take a look at it does it make
sense to you what's the first property
is the first property an array no it's
not an array is it an array I have to
come over here look the first property
is description description is just some
text the next property is source which
is also some text the next property is
birds which is an array each element of
the array is an object that is to prop
these one is family one is members and
members is also an array so you can see
how that nested this can become so let's
say what I want to do is and this is
like you would normally I think this is
sort of arbitrary you wouldn't
necessarily want to do this but just to
like make the sort of case here is I'm
really interested in I want to pull out
exactly the Imperial shag so how do I
get to actually that's let me not use
that as an example because um let's look
at the crow I don't have pronounced this
the crow zet shag I kinda want to do a
google image search to see what that
bird looks like Oh cormorants I love
Corey ants they're good day like flies
all over the water they're excellent so
so how do I get to this particular piece
of data okay so let's say I have an
object called data what's the first
thing that this is embedded in members
which is in this object which is in this
other array called birds so what I need
to do is say data dot birds that's the
first thing I need to do come back over
here now I'm in here amok birds this is
this whole object is object zero this
second object is object one so I want to
be an object one now what's the property
I want an object one not family I want
members so object 1 dot members object 1
dot members and now over here 0 1 2 so
that's also an array and I want to look
at the crows a or the closet or the
Creuset shag which is the third element
but index 2 in that array so now over
here index 2 so again searching through
looking into a JSON file to pull out
some aspect of the data is all about
knowing the path what's the root element
you can think of the root element what's
the object inside of that that you're
looking at is that object in an array if
it is what the what's the element in
that array if that's an object then you
want to get the property of that object
which happens to be array so again every
is going to be different but this is one
scenario that's a bit more complex than
just that single sunflower example so
now that's actually like display this in
our code to make sure and I'm going to
close the flower one and I'm going to
say birds I'm going to load that JSON
file into here and I'm just going to say
create P let's let's actually not even
use a canvas create P if you haven't
watched the videos about how to make Dom
elements how to make paragraphs and
links and other things on the page you
can look at that I'm going to say var
bird equals Birds
oh no data oh sorry I want to make this
call this data because the first thing
data are you looking at that data dot
Birds what did I say index 1 dot members
index 2 index 1 members index 2 and now
create P That Bird and if we run this
we're gonna see look at that there it is
that's the bird I'm seeing on the screen
now again this is like a trivial sort of
like this is like I'm proving that JSON
works there's data in there it has a
structure that structure can be accessed
but most likely what you'd want to be
doing is displaying everything in the
data set or out creating some tool where
the user could search into the data set
and you know ideally that data set might
have like thousands of birds in it
instead of just you know 10 or however
many are in there so let's let's go a
little bit deeper and that 10 bit that
you're sticking with me I'm thankful
again cuz I feel like I'm talking it's
weird to do these things by myself in
this room even though at least I have a
window and I can see there's people on
the street hello out there hey I'm
making a video about JSON do you care
there's I wonder if there's somebody
watching with their phone maybe I would
be sort of strange ok back to this thing
so what if I wanted to do let's look at
the data again I haven't done any
singing yet which I think I probably
should do to just make this video a
little more interesting what if what I
wanted to do was display I have an idea
I think I did this an example why would
I want to do is display the family of I
wouldn't display all the birds in this
file and I want to see the family as
like a header and then I want to see the
list of the bird
underneath it so like bigger text for
the family and smaller text for these so
let's just start with that
so the difference here is instead of
looking for a particular item what I
want to do and it might make sense for
me to say var birds equals data dot
Birds so I'm just going to pull out that
birds object in the file which is data
birds and stick it in a variable because
that's an array and now I can say loop
through birds dot length and let's just
start by saying create element an h1 I
can't spell element h1 what birds index
i dot family so I want birds and X 0 dot
family then index 1 dot family and then
you know presumably there's more birds
down here so birds index i dot family so
this now you can see whoops and I don't
need this anymore oh wait where did I oh
yeah sorry this is irrelevant this was
from my previous example you can see
here this is a way of now looping
through the data so you can see that
this particular loop is going through
and accessing every element of the array
birds and looking for the family so
these are just the family names but what
I want to do is actually look through
all the members of the family names so
inside that loop each and every bird I
need another loop to say each and every
member of each and every bird so how do
I do that - first let me make a variable
called members which is birds dot
members right members birds dot members
that's that array and then this array
and so now what I want to do is say for
and I'll use J because I need a
different variable than I members dot
length j j plus plus and i'll just say
create div members index j because so
first i want to get the family
five I have all these bird objects and I
want to just see the family name and
then I want to look at the members but
the members is an array so I need to
loop through that array and let's see if
that works
I cannot find okay so what did I get
wrong I must have got a birds dot
members VAR members let's look at this
again Birds ah aha it's not Birds dot
members its what birds index i dot
members classic mistake right I'm
looping through an array called birds
and I want to get the members of each
element of the array so I want to get
the members of element 0 than the
members of element 1 that's what I did
with family so I need to have index i
dot members and now we can see here look
there are the albatrosses there there
are the cormorants the diving pretzels
the duct geese and swans the gulls the
penguins ooh lots of good penguins this
is a great data set you can see now I
have all of this data appearing on the
page now again I haven't done anything
that I would say is interesting with
this data but I'm showing you just how
to navigate a JSON file you might look
for a particular piece of data you might
iterate over all the data certainly you
could think about how would you draw
something based on the data like maybe
you would draw circles tied to the
number of members of each family of
birds you could animate that could you
have flying birds on the screen each
with their names I don't know I could
think of all sorts of creative things
you could do besides just I'm just
showing you let me literally display
exactly the data on the webpage so this
I think kind of you know I could keep
going with this in the end like you're
going to have a different data set it's
going to look different that you're
gonna have your own sets of like how to
navigate it hopefully this will give you
a sense practice this so get a JSON file
make it yourself five minutes were
online load it like put it in your p5
sketch load it into a variable see if
you can pull out a single piece of data
see if you can pull out all the data can
you get that to work I encourage you to
use this corpora repository which is has
a lot of kind of goofy and random sets
of data in it and hopefully that'll get
you started what I want to do in the
next video is look at how you might pull
this data from a
URL so what if you had a w w something
calm something JSON that you could pull
rather than just this local file that's
typed in your project the reason why
that could be useful is somebody else
might prepare a JSON file for you that's
dynamic that's changing and you could
query it which is like one step closer
to this idea of an API of using us
somebody else's sort of system that
you're querying to get a certain amount
of JSON data back so I feel like God
most of all it's a lot of that must not
have made any sense or you probably
turned this off long ago but if you're
still watching I don't know say
something to me that that you're
watching dad never mind don't say that
it does that part out I don't know what
up that's I think very very needy today
maybe I am okay I think I think this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
