video here about transformations just to
like cover a few bases that I didn't get
to and some of this is unnecessary
information you could probably skip this
one but if you want to dive a little bit
deeper into this there's there's there's
a few things about this the first thing
I want to say that's actually quite
crucial about push and pop is that
pushing pop doesn't just save and
restore transformation information and
this is actually not true if you're
using processing the Java based platform
that I use in some of my videos this is
only true if using p5.js because it's
the way that the html5 canvas works
you're using all these terms that I know
that I don't want to use but I'm using
them so it actually saves and restores
lots of style information as well which
can be useful to you so for example if I
go back to this code and at the at the
end here if I just want to draw another
ellipse like the other ellipse is gonna
be at 300 is gonna be at 300 300 60 60
and I hit refresh now look at this this
ellipse is not grey with a white stroke
with a white outline it should be
because I said stroke 255 fill 100 drew
the rectangle but actually push and pop
also save and restore stroke weight
stroke fill all sorts of styling things
now I could try to give you a list of
every single function that's everything
goes setting that's saved and restored
by pushing pop and I wouldn't know I
would be able to begin but but in
addition to the transformation stuff you
can also use this for styling
information which I generally don't but
you might find this useful in another
context so that's it that's number one
now the other thing that I want to
mention is that you could imagine a more
complex scene where you know this thing
is rotating around this thing and this
other thing is rotating around this
thing but this other thing is rotating
this thing but not this thing and you
start needing to say push draw some
stuff push draw some stuff push draw
some stuff pop draw some stuff pop pop
or something like that right so one
thing you should realize is you could
only have as many pops as you have push
you could only restore the amount of
things you've saved but there the
question arises which is
when I save a bunch of times and I
restore which thing that I save do I
restore and a way that you can determine
the answer of this question is is the
way that I'm saving the sequence in
something called a stack or a queue or
perhaps some other algorithm so there's
something called a stack and there's
something called a queue now if I
spelled that wrong a queue what are
these things so push and pop are terms
that apply to saving and restoring
information in a stack it's called a
stack because you can think of it like a
stack of paper so if this is like a bin
your inbox so to speak and I put paper a
in there then paper B then paper C than
paper D they're stacking up a b c d so
push is pushing the things onto the
stack adding to the top of the stack
when I say pop I take the last thing out
so first one in last one out the last
one in first one out that's what it is
the stack the last thing I put at the
top of the pile of paper is the first
one I'm gonna take off this is different
than a queue which you could think of
like you know some kind of like ticket
window right where people line up in a
queue the first person in line for the
queue is the first person to get a
ticket so these are data structures that
are that are common to a lot of programs
and a lot of scenarios that if you watch
all of my videos when I come up with
lots of other places you don't really
need to worry about this too much in the
case of transformations but it is
important to realize that push and pop
are terms that relate to the data
structure a stack they were sort of
pushing things onto the stack popping
things off of the stack and if you push
multiple times save multiple times
you're restoring in reverse order so I
should cook up some kind of example I
can't think of one right now oh come
back and do that another time but that's
one thing I want to say now the other
thing I want to say with a p5 reference
here I'm gonna go to transform and I'm
gonna look at all these functions so
there's a couple things there there's
some things that are important here
number one is oh my goodness in addition
to rotate
there's rotate X and rotate Y rotate Z
now those functions rotate XY and Z
actually no idea which she wrecks in
here why do we we should look at look at
the reference to read that those
functions are for the WebGL renderer the
WebGL render is a 3d render for p5 you
know at the recording of this video it's
still in the very early stages there was
a lot of work that was done over this
past summer through a program called
Google Summer of Code so it's the WebGL
library is in much better shape and
hopefully will continue to improve it's
a way of doing 3d and p5 I should come
back and make it on the video about that
look at transformations in 3d so but you
know in case you're wondering if you're
you know rotate is the same as rotate Z
the z axis is the axis that comes out of
the screen and so things rotate around
the z axis if I come back to this right
this over here I think I'm like
desperate to do this like exact
demonstration that I want to do this is
done that's the z axis this is pathetic
that's the z axis I'm pointing at you so
that's something rotating around the z
axis if it was rotating around the y
axis it would come out of the screen
like this it was rotating around the
x-axis would come out of the screen like
this but not actually coming out of the
screen cuz it's 2d and I'm off and
never-never-land talking about 3d but
it's really 2d it's just the illusion
explore that on your own time where I
will come back to in a future video but
the other thing I wanted to mention here
is you'll see like o apply matrix reset
matrix why is the word matrix there what
are we talking about well it turns out
that the way the orientation the
transformation states what is a
transformation state is 0 0 in the top
left is there any rotation is there any
scaling is stored in a matrix of numbers
and that matrix and numbers might look
something like this 1 0 0 0 1 0 so this
is a 2 by 3 matrix 2 rows 3 columns and
this is describing the sort of default
matrix with no rotation no translation
no scaling you could imagine it by scale
by 2
matrix might turn into two - if I
translate some of these numbers might
change if I rotate some of these numbers
might change so I would love to do some
kind of tutorials pretend that I know
all about this and you can do something
like tutorial series about you know
programming your own transformation
engine 3d rendering thing and like how
you calculate all these matrices but
this is what's more important about it
is that as you do this it's um it's all
stored in a matrix so some things you
can do is you can just actually call the
reset matrix function and reset is like
just wipe everything so push push push
pop pop pop is like save save save
restore restore but if you just want to
reset back to the default state you can
just call recent matrix apply matrix
I've never actually used this and I
don't know how far along if this
actually works in b5 but in theory if it
does what it's supposed to do is I could
cook up my own set of numbers put that
into some kind of array or something and
then apply that to the matrix hi this
video better go far away buried deep
somewhere in the playlist because this
really isn't part of the first few weeks
of learning to program but I'll figure
that out later
voice so that's really the last pieces
that I want to explain what is push and
pop and what is YY do we talk about a
matrix when we talk about
transformations okay thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
