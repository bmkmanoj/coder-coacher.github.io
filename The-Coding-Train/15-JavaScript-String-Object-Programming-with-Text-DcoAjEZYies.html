from A to Z video tutorial in this video
tutorial I want to talk about the
JavaScript string object so what is the
JavaScript string object wealth you've
ever written code like this bar s equals
hello now I have a variable and it has a
string of characters a sequence of
characters in it h-e-l-l-o this is a
string object so on the one hand I can
use this string object to put text in a
Dom element I can use it to paint text
onto a canvas I could use it to print
text to the console but what I'm going
to be doing in future videos is
manipulate string objects so if I load
all the text from a file and I have this
big string object with all paragraphs
and paragraphs about rainbows and I want
to like chop it up and mix it up or
analyze it or make poetry out of it I
need to learn how to manipulate string
objects in JavaScript so this is what I
want to look at the basics of and then
next week or in the next videos that you
might see in the future that might
already be there I'm gonna look at
something called regular expressions
which is really going to just like
explode the possible things you could do
with text and JavaScript but for right
now we're gonna live with just the
string object itself and so if you want
to learn about all the possible things
you can do with string objects what the
place that you I would say that you can
go to is the mozilla document the
mozilla document javascript
documentation look under reference
global objects string I'll include a
link to this page in this video tutorial
and you can see yeah there's like a nice
little tutorial here that kind of runs
through a lot of stuff you can see all
of these functions that you could call
on strings like index of and normalize
and repeat and slice and strike and blah
blah blah so I'm not going to go over
all of this with you I'm gonna give you
a little bit of a kind of like wade into
the waters of manipulating string
objects you can also find my notes on
this on this particular webpage the A to
Z programming website which I'll also
link to this page in this video tutorial
so I made a list over here on the white
board
of things that I want to look at in
video so I'm going to look at really
just three pieces of functionality that
have to do with strings a long list of
the Mozilla documentation there's a lot
of other ones that I encourage you to
investigate and play with but three that
I find useful to some things that I
might do one is index of another is
substring the length property of strings
is something that you need quite often
and then I want to also look at
splitting and joining which are
operations that I'm going to be doing
continuously throughout many tutorials
and examples in this video series
there's a little bit of funny business
about this that I have to get to and
talk about at some point but I'm not
going to right now okay
so this is my list let's start let's
just start like this go in reverse order
or some sort of strange other order
let's talk about length so I have a
example set up already right here that
you can see first of all I could just
say s dot length right here I should
just be doing all this in the console
really if I say s dot length you can see
I get a length of 5 because hello has
five characters h-e-l-l-o let's just
look at how we would do this in code
right I have a simple sketch which all
it does right now is it has a text input
box when I hit submit I create a
paragraph element with that text input
box I can go to my code and one thing I
can do is I can say I'm just gonna say
VAR s equals text field value so this is
pulling what's in that text field and
placing it into a string object and now
I'm gonna say create P s length so now
when I run this code again you can see
that text has 42 characters so if you
want to build a check to see if your
text could fit into a tweet application
you can see how if it's greater than 140
characters
you know spit out this is too long to
tweet or whatever so you can see that's
one property we can use yeah
here's another property here's another
function that's really useful index up
so let's say I say VAR s equals hello
whoops
and I say s index of rainbow what am I
going to get negative 1 index of is a
function
that searches for some text like rainbow
in some other text s I'm looking for
rainbow in the text hello
well rainbow doesn't exist in the text
hello so what do I get negative one
negative one means I can't find that
substring in that larger string so this
can be quite useful to you if a user
types in some text and you want to
figure out did they type in this word or
search for a word in that piece of text
now what else what does it work how does
it work if that text is actually there
so let's look at that
so let's actually add this so I'm going
to say VAR index equals s dot index of
rainbow and then I'm going to say create
P index so I'm gonna run this again and
now I'm gonna submit and I got 33 why
did I get 33 well I'm gonna say rainbow
rainbow rainbow rainbow rainbow rainbow
rainbow rainbow rainbow rainbow rainbow
rainbow rainbow rainbow Robredo okay and
now I'm gonna hit submit and you can see
I got zero so what is it doing I'm gonna
say zero zero one two three four rainbow
I got five so what index up is doing is
it's saying hey this is the index of the
substring you're searching for zero one
two three four a rainbow starts at index
number index five so this can be really
this is seem sort of like trivial and
silly right now but you might load a
massive amount of text in and you might
want to find where something and this
can be good for scraping and parsing ah
I want to find stuff that's in between
this so I have to find this or where's
that and then I want to find something
else and then I'm gonna use another
function I'm gonna show you substrate
and plot something in between so you can
see this is what index of does so let's
look at actually that's fine right now
I'm gonna leave it at that
Oh one thing I should mention though is
what about the case where I said rainbow
rainbow boy do I love rainbows right in
this case I always get zero
how can but if there's only one instance
of its always giving me the first
rainbow but look what I can do
what if here I say index of
and hold on let's put this one thing I
want to do is sorry I'm gonna put this
as the default text in the text box and
then here I'm in index up I'm gonna do
something weird where I'm just to say
comma 10 and I'm gonna hit submit and
look I got 30 why did I get 30 let me
take out that comma 10
I got 0 so here's here's something that
index of allows you to do it allows you
to say search for the first instance of
rainbow after a certain index so by
default it'll start searching from 0 but
here I'm saying just start searching
from the 10th character so here's a
difficult at programming exercise for
you write an algorithm that searches
using index of for every instance of
rainbow so find the first one then
search for the next one after the first
one then search for the next one after
that one and keep doing that until you
get a negative one maybe I'll try to
post a solution to that or make that as
a coding challenge but that's something
that you could try to do okay that's it
next up one more function that I want to
show you in this particular video that I
think would be useful to you is
substring so what I'm going to do now is
I'm going to say VAR new text equals F
dot substring five comma seven and I'm
gonna run this if it's submit o index is
not to find create P sorry new text run
this again you can see I get owy because
0 1 2 3 4 5 5 is the o I want to
substring starting at 5 and where do I
want it to end
6 whoops oh w 6 7 what's anything on a
space bad coincidence there so let me
change this and change this to actually
I'll just change the text so I'm gonna
take out the spaces am I gonna get
OWR or am I gonna get just Oh W think to
yourself what's it going to be
I still get Oh W so this is a little
goofy thing with substring but
so I have the text h-e-l-l-o 0 1 2 3 4
if I say substring between 1 &amp;amp; 4 I'm
including 1 but I'm excluding 4 so I'm
just getting an Allah there so this is
how substring works you might ask
yourself well that's annoying that's
weird why is it done that way there's
actually a pretty good reason which is
number 1 what's the length of this
string 3 sub string 3 what's 4 minus 1 3
and often something you want to do is
get a substring from some point of the
text to the end of the text and in that
case all I need to do is say give me a
substring and here's something I could
do I could say substring from s dot
length divided by 2 all the way until
the end s dot length so this is now my
code right give me a substring between
the middle of the string and the end of
the string you can see do I love rainbow
do I love rainbows there is an answer to
this question I don't have a sound
effect or anything but yes sir
I think if you know it's yes okay so do
I love rainbows yes so you can see no
matter what I this is the first half
this is the second half and I hit submit
look at that it's amazing I got this
somehow those worked out to be the exact
number of characters and I'll see how
that's possible but it did this is the
second half you can see how that works
and getting a substring of the second
half so you can think of a lot of here's
an exercise for you what if you have
something like this the temperature
outside is 72 degrees Fahrenheit write
an algorithm that pulls out the number
72 without knowing that it's going to be
the number 72 so no matter what I type
here every time I hit submit I get 72
2150 how do you search for and by the
way also I could change this to a
temperature or well the temperature
outside is so it's not a fixed length
how do you search for where is : space
is so that you know where the number
starts and
you search for where space degrees is so
you know where the number ends and by
the way it should still also work if I
type in 101 so that's a programming
exercise for you create a generic phrase
of any length that you need to pull out
a subset of text of any of any length
out out out of that phrase this is just
one scenario this has to and by the way
next week when I do a video to talk
about regular expressions you're gonna
see a totally other magical powerful way
of doing it okay so this is the end of
this video tutorial about strings
there's all sorts of other things that
I've missed this is just a small taste
of it try some of those exercises try
looking at the documentation page you
know pick a random function I like slice
or search and see what it's a lot of
these might require regular expressions
and see what you get I forgot something
on my list over here I want to briefly
talk about briefly before I leave you in
this video I want to talk about
splitting and joining so let's just look
at this this is an incredibly common
operation that I need in so many videos
and I could make another video about it
but I'm gonna leave it in this one so
let's look at this because and I'm gonna
get to more about this next week with
regular expressions so this is just a
little bit of a so I'm gonna use so I'm
gonna use right now there are two
functions that are part of the piece I'm
gonna show you two functions that are
three functions really that are part of
the p5.js library one is split want to
split tokens and one is join now next
week I'm going to show you how to use
the native JavaScript split function to
use regular expressions so I'm gonna
kind of really do this but in this video
I'm going to look at the p5.js function
split and we show you why this is so
useful all almost all of the text
analysis algorithms that I'm going to
demonstrate later are based on word
counting and one of the things you need
to do with word counting is split a
paragraph of text and multiple
paragraphs of text into sentence chunks
into word chunks that sort of thing so
I'm gonna do that right I'm going to
show you how to do that with split and
it's actually quite an easy operation
basically I'm gonna and I'm just going
to go to the sketch right here whoops
there's a something whoops just missing
here so I'm gonna leave this this this
this gives you half the text but I'm
just gonna do something over here in the
console which is VAR s equals text field
value so now I have in the variable s
rainbow rainbow boy do I love rainbows
and I'm gonna say split s just see what
I get so look at that
I say split s on its own I don't really
split it but I get an array and I get an
array with the entire sentence in there
the whole point of splitting text is to
take one chunk of text and split it into
an array so what if I say s and s comma
space in quotes you can see now look
what I have I have an array with each
word as a separate element so I'm gonna
do a few things here I'm actually going
to do that right now in my code I'm
gonna say var words equals split s by
space and then I can loop through all of
the words and do something with them
individually I can say create P words
index I so now you can see I get a
different paragraph element for every
word in there now let me add a comma in
here and I'm going to hit I'm gonna hit
refresh
and add a comma in here notice how the
first word has a comma hmm so what might
I do in this case I might go to my code
and I might say wait split by space
comma or comma space now look what
happens I'm gonna add the comma in there
I'm gonna hit submit now I just got two
things rainbow and rainbow boy do I love
rainbows because they split by comma
space and the only time a comma space
appears is rainbow come a space what I
want to do is not say split by comma
space split by comma or space and again
a regular expression is going to be
my solution to that but for right now
without it there's a p5.js function
called split tokens and if instead of
using split you split tokens it'll
actually do that for you so I'm gonna do
this I'm gonna put the comma in there I
mean it's submit and you can see now it
worked there's ways of retaining the
delimiters not retaining the deliverers
I'm going to show you more stuff about
that in a future video but these are the
basic idea split and split tokens and
join by the way does the absolute
inverse so one thing I can do is I could
say I could now say words dot sort I
think it'll sort it in an array I think
it'll sort it by the default sorting and
then I could say F equals join words and
I think I probably need might make a new
array so I'm just saying words equals
words dot source sort and then I can say
create p.s and I'm going to comment this
out so what I'm doing now is I'm taking
this turning it into an array sorting in
an alphabetical order putting it back
together and then displaying it and you
can see boy do I love rainbow rainbow
rainbows and we can see this should be
in alphabetical order alphabetical be in
order should this so you can see here's
a quick algorithm I've done something
here to take a sentence split it up sort
it by alphabetical order and display it
back to the user I'm sure you could
think of something much more creative to
do with this paradigm of text input and
text output and in the next video I'm
going to show you do a coding challenge
about how to implement Jacksonville
closed eye astok which I'll explain in
the next video as well as text input
text output okay
thanks very much and yes I apologize for
not using Celsius in this video ok
thanks for watching and I'll see you
soon in the next one
