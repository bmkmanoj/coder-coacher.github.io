before we get into the actual stuff that
really is the exciting part where you're
going to look at examples start writing
your own code start making stuff coming
up with your own ideas trying things out
before you start making things I just
want to give you an overview as to what
my plan is for all these videos so um
the there's a key there's a key thing
here to get some energy back here run in
place run in place okay there's a key
thing here
I want these videos to cover the
fundamentals of computation the
fundamental building blocks of computer
programming and really there is a short
list of things that you need to know and
understand there are these core elements
that will go across any type of software
development creative coding pewter
science whatever you want to call it
writing writing code on your computer
and and really actually three categories
so any computer program that runs needs
to have data associated with it right it
needs to store information about itself
colors view again um you know I
sometimes I wish I didn't do this but
just to think about game programming for
a second um if you were creating the
game space invaders you might need to
keep track of the spaceships position on
the screen like which level is the game
on which what's the current players
score there are elements of data that a
computer program needs to keep in mind
as it's running and this is actually one
of the first things we will learn about
which is this concept of a variable this
thing that stores data in a dish um I'm
gonna go out of order here in addition
to this idea of a variable which is an
individual piece of data okay no way
everything's okay there's a floor and I
just dropped the caps in addition to the
variable which is an individual piece of
data we're also going to learn about
something called an array which we could
also think of as a list so what about a
list of data instead of like a spaceship
has an individual location what if there
are 10 enemies on the screen could we
have a list of enemy locations so any
computer program needs to store data
we're going to learn about very
and arrays the other thing that we need
to really learn about is this idea of
control how do we control the flow of a
computer program how do we control the
path by which it takes right if the
spaceship I wish I could think of
something less violent of shoots its
laser and hits the enemy its score goes
up right how do we control that that how
do we how do we how do we control that
process I don't know if the player drops
a seed and a flower blooms that's a
nicer way of thinking about it so and we
want to look at this idea of
conditionals conditional logic if
statements if this condition is met then
the program executes this instruction
all right that's something we're going
to look at another control structure
we're going to look at is a loop right
this idea of repeating something if we
have 100 enemy spaceships do we want to
have a hundred lines of code draw a
spaceship one draw a spaceship to draw a
spaceship three no we want to have this
loop draw every spaceship for every
spaceship draw it on the screen so this
is this idea really simple these are
these fundamental so we're going to have
a set of videos about each one of these
how do we deal with a variable how do we
deal with a conditional how do we deal
with a loop how do we deal with an array
but another thing that's going to be
very primary to this video series is
thinking about organizing on say
organization thinking about how you
organize your code so when we first
start we're going to be writing very
simple instructions line fill which is
set a color rectangle ellipse just for
drawing stuff on the screen but as we
write larger and larger programs we need
to encapsulate I ideas into kind of
their own mini programs in a way so that
we're going to to kind of key principles
of organization that we're going to look
at is how to write a function what if we
figure out a nice way of drawing a
flower pattern on the screen right I
can't draw we this is a flower right if
we figure out how to draw a flower and
then we
have ten flowers on the screen are we
going to rewrite all the code for
drawing the flower ten times maybe that
was a hundred lines of code just to get
this pattern could we just take this
entire idea of a flower and put it in
its own function so that anytime we want
a flower on the screen we have a new
command so to speak we can just say
flower and even more than this idea of
function - a key principle we want to
look at is objects object-oriented
programming this to me is one of the
ways that I really started to feel
comfortable writing software is once I
got to the point of learning
object-oriented programming and
understanding something and the screen
treating it in this way that we look at
the world this is an object this object
has data associated with it it's it it's
color is black it is a dry erase marker
that maybe it's a piece of data rather
than a permanent marker and it has
functionality this thing I could say
draw I could take its cap on and off
right remove cap at cap so this idea of
taking something like a flower and
turning it into an object there's data
about this flower how big is it how
small is it what color is it and it
might have functionality it could grow
the petals could fall so this idea of
something happening in a computer
graphics application being packaged up
into this object now this sounds very
theoretical and grand and or perhaps
confusing right now but we're going to
get into the details of how to take a
program which has variables and
conditionals and loops and all this
logic and all this data and how to
organize it into a way that we could
just say hey there are seed objects and
there are flower objects and there is
grass objects in there for if we're
creating some kind of garden simulation
for example so these are all the things
we want to learn and in and some but
programming courses something like
object-oriented programming might be
something that comes very very late in
the game almost at the very end or
perhaps in like a second semester even
as an advanced topic but we're going to
get two objects pretty quickly because I
want that to be a fundamental way that
we look at creating examples and
creating projects in processing so this
is kind of this is the list of
fundamentals right these are kind of
computer science fundamentals
I used the word computer science I don't
like demerit I love David go list as
I've never mentioned the term computer
science in any of these videos because
anyway I go off on that rant or tangent
not rant on delinquent that's but anyway
edit this out please somebody okay so
these are kind of the fundamentals the
things that you that will transfer to
any programming language and environment
these are the sort of core elements and
we want to understand these in great
detail without any fear or sadness we
just want to feel happy and comfortable
all these things and start to practice
writing programs but once we get through
this I also want to take a look at some
applications so what are some types of
things that one might do for example I
really want to look at images how do we
load images and draw images to the
screen how do we read the pixels of an
image and manipulate and do image
processing how do we do the kinds of
things that might happen a piece of
software like Photoshop how do we write
that stuff from scratch with code what
happens if we use a moving image like a
camera or a video can we do things like
computer vision could we do how do we
how do we write software that can find
somebody's face how do we write software
that can track the skeleton the human
body with the Kinect so I want to have
sort of a set of videos about images and
pixels I also want to look at a data as
a topic so what does it mean to load
data into a program what is it what are
the kinds of ways of loading data
there's plain text and XML and JSON and
there are all sorts of data data classes
in processing that allow you to load
data parse data and draw stuff based on
that data so what does it mean to
connect to a you know data that's local
versus data that's on a server I want to
look at a whole set of examples what
does it mean to work with text strings
what does it mean to read a novel and
count all the words in that novel to do
a concordance so I want to have a set of
videos that deal with data and I don't
you know I just haven't made these
videos yet so I totally don't know
exactly what I'm gonna do we could think
about what about 3d graphics so I guess
what I meant is
topics so this video series is going to
start with the fundamentals all the
fundamental tools of computation and in
there we're also going to have to learn
about pixels and drawing in color and
shape some basic computer graphic stuff
but really we're going to focus on these
fundamental core concepts of computation
and from there once we have all this bag
of tricks we're going to reinforce those
ideas do them over and over again
practice with them through a set of
topics images pixels of data 3d graphics
and I I could come up with some others
but this is a pretty good starting point
right now integration with the web
perhaps what is this landscape of could
we do stuff with processing on the web
and is there's this thing called
processing Jes which is JavaScript we
might I might try to look at that at
some point in a video series so just to
give I think I'm kind of done with
talking about this but um just to kind
of like walk through the order this is
going to help be you can stop down but
help I'm just going to organize my own
thoughts that I'm gonna keep for cortex
my tot right dad this might be a bad
idea okay so but so we're in the intro
videos right now so we're kind of going
to be done with the intro videos and
actually we're gonna I guess there's
something right before that which is
sort of the basics of drawing and
processing which we're going to start
with I'll call this like one this will
be two once we get through the basics of
drawing we're going to look at variables
that'll be the sort of videos called
number three then this would be like if
this were a course if you were taking a
class just for anything other than just
the B in this weird room rambling - oh
then this would be like week one week
two week three and in fact these videos
are intended to go along with this
course that I am teaching here which is
divided into weeks so week and this
would really actually be week one intro
and drawing so this is really so I'll
keep that so this would be variables
then we're going to look at conditionals
and loops after that we will get to
arrays I think I got this right and then
after that we will look at functions
after that we will look at objects so
it's kind of like half a semester sick
weeks and this is grossly accelerated in
many ways you need a lifetime to really
master all this stuff I had any time
myself so but this will be a kind of six
week or six bits or video sections
through all these topics and again after
that seven would be images eight would
be data they build to that in a
different order nine would be 3d
graphics so we will kind of get through
get to all this stuff
okay so ah this hopefully gives you a
nice overview I'm kind of wrapped up
this introductory stuff I feel like
these were challenging videos to make in
the sense that they're very kind of it's
it's less kind of how-to and looking at
stuff step by step and more just kind of
rambling through general concepts I feel
like I missed so many things that I
meant to say so someday I may go back
and add things in or add things write
some write some stuff in the
descriptions but if something is missing
or something is confusing you please or
at this point I guess your way to
interact is use the Vimeo comments write
a comment ask a question there and I
will we could start with a dialogue that
way although the videos may end up also
somewhere else embedded into some sort
of site that it has them as well okay so
so that's that so I will see you another
time I thank you I bid you adieu
I guess I'm for apparently I'm getting
into some French stuff in these videos
okay or if waar</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
