want to do something weird with Dom
manipulation I'm kind of going to just
make up on the fly although I did make
an example like this a couple weeks ago
but looked at it since then so hopefully
this is going to work out and what I
want to show you how to do is to take
interface elements that normally you
would ask the user to manipulate like
move a slider or type some text into a
text input box and I want to show you
how to just control those control those
things programmatically as if they're
like there's a zombie controlling your
computer so first of all I have a p5
sketch here I have the p5 editor so this
is sort of like a bit of a standalone
video so some of you might be coming to
it from not having seen p5 before go to
p5.js org download the editor look at
the reference you can use that for this
quick little project so let's give it a
tip this button we can see there's
absolutely nothing appearing in the
browser because I haven't added anything
now let's create a variable called
slider and I'm going to say slider
equals create slider and remember when
you create a slider you need a minimum
and a maximum and a starting range
I don't really it doesn't really matter
so much so I'm in this case so I'm going
to create a slider with minimum goes
from zero maximum goes to 100 and it
starts at 50 it's very loud outside so
I'm going to close the window and I'm
back you can see the slider is there and
now I can do what anyone would normally
do with a slider I can slide it back and
forth I could use the slider to control
myself what nobody cares that I'm doing
this but it amused me for a second ok so
uh that's normally what you do and you
would tie the slider to an alpha value
or some parameter in a flocking system
whatever kind of creative coding thing
you're doing today but what if you
wanted to actually set the value of that
slider so one thing you can actually do
is by okay so if you want to get sorry
if you want to get the value of the
slider you say slider dot value and so
let me make it between 0 and 255 and I
could see now I have no canvas let me
create the canvas just so it's there and
you can see now that the canvas is there
and as I move the slider it's changing
the background color
again what you might normally do now
another way I could change the value of
the slider is actually to just call the
value function but give it an argument
so the argument I'm going to give it is
the number right now 151 so you can see
that now the slider even though it
started at 50 as soon as draw executed I
set its value to 151 well draw is
animating looping over and over again
what if I made that some variable like
for example VAR x equals 151 and slider
dot value X and x equals x plus some
random amount between like negative five
and five now let me run that and you can
see look the slider is moving on its own
I have my first zombie slider it is just
moving around I don't ever have to
operate the computer again it's just
going to do it for me
great so uh but let's go a little bit
further with this first of all let's use
something called a sine wave I would
I'll link below to some other video
where I talk about sine waves I'm
staying over the link below I better do
it
bring the conference if I didn't do it
and I'll add it but let's use a sine
wave so let's say instead that X equals
the value VAR x equals the value of this
of a sine of something
sine of some angle so now I need a
variable called angle and I need it
equal to zero
now I might as well take just a brief
moment but to come over here to this
whiteboard which I said I wasn't going
to need and talk about what you get out
of the sine function I still link to
another video but I feel obligated just
offer a quick explanation you've ever
seen a drawing of the sine function it's
not going well at camera showing off
I've ever seen a drawing of the sine
function it looks something like this
the range the range goes from between
one to negative one I should start over
but I'm not going to the range goes
between 1 and negative 1 the x-axis
being this angle that's moving through
I'm in a way that you can think so
depending on what the value of the angle
is I'm going to get between 1 and
negative 1 so here that was that was
like the worst explanation ever just go
to the thing but that explains the sine
function you haven't looked at it before
so what I want to do is get this the
sine of some angle and if I do that it's
stuck there at the bottom right the
result of the sine function is always a
value between negative 1 and 1 now there
happens to be another function in p5
called the Matt function and I
definitely have a video that's only
about the map function also link to that
below but what I can do with the map
function is I could say hey the sine
function goes between negative 1 and 1
that's the range of the sine function
but the range of my slider is between 0
and 255 or 0 and 100 whatever it was
between 0 and 255 so map the result of
the sine function which is somewhere
between negative 1 and 1 to the between
0 and 255 so now I'm going to do that Oh
unexpected number line 12 I don't I
don't
oh because I forgot a comma here there
we go you can see ah so sine of 0
happens to be the value 0 which then
happens to be halfway between negative 1
and 1 which is halfway which gets mapped
to 127 about and you can see it's now in
the middle now what if I took that angle
and incremented it over time I could
maybe get the slider to oscillate nicely
angle plus equals 0.01 now the angle the
unit of measurement is in radians and in
that other set of videos that I'm
looking to it'll be an explanation of
that and you can see look at that this
nice little that slider is moving nicely
slowly it's coming to the end and it
eases off and you know we could maybe
make that move a little bit faster by
incrementing the angle a bit more each
frame and now I've got this slider
that's like oscillating automatics kind
of like dancing I'm trying to do it with
it but I can't so this was fun and all
well and good but let's do something
more with this first of all forget about
this silly canvas thing that was nice to
be able to see that the slider is still
actively controlling the canvas
but forget about that forget about
background what if instead I make an
array of sliders and I were to say for
VAR I equals zero I is less than ten I
plus plus and I'm going to make all
those sliders in an array so make all
those sliders in an array and then let's
do exactly the same thing down here
let's set all of their values to the
value of this sine function and here we
go and I run it look at that all of the
sliders are now oscillating back and
forth lovely and then I don't know ten
didn't seem like very many let's make 50
of them oh oh and I hard-coded that I
should really say sliders dot length
let's make 50 of them you can see all
that movie I don't know I'm just going
crazy I think a hundred of them I want
to fill the page or slide if you can see
now I've got a hundred sliders dancing
back and forth now interestingly enough
if I'm working with a sine wave and I
have one thing oscillating back and
forth and I have another thing
oscillating back and forth and I have
another thing oscillating back and forth
what if each one of those was just a
little bit behind the other one right so
when this one is over here this one is
over here and then this one's over here
and then this one gets the end and comes
back and then this one gets the end
there's just a little bit of offset so
they're kind of like dancing with each
other in a way we could could play some
music and dance the slide dance the
night away with the sliders that's what
I did by the way I have no social life
so I go home and I danced the night away
with sliders think about that for a
minute why don't you then donate there's
no donate button but I don't know what
you would donate due to the cause of sad
dancing slider people but the point is
what if I could get each one slightly
offset from the other one maybe I could
have another variable I could say offset
equals zero angle plus offset and then
offset
plus equals zero point zero two three
four or five making that number up
doesn't really matter the Pugh five the
point is I want each one of those to
oscillate based on that angle but one of
them should be point zero two five ahead
and the other one should be point zero
five ahead and the other one should be
point zero seven five ahead I think I'm
doing the math right let's just see if
that works there we go dancing right
away or this side so you can see here
I'm just samba controlling these sliders
they're all slightly offset from each
other I could play around like what if I
really make them offset from each other
whoa now I've got this crazy pattern
here we're all the sliders I could
arrange them in a different way I could
have them like make a little picture I
could all use them to control things I
could style them so there's lots of
possibilities or the point that I'm
making this video is to say I don't know
anything about the web or design or how
to make anything look right or do
anything practical but so I'm sometimes
trying weird things out and things
happen but the boy who I'm saying that's
not the point I'm saying the point of
what I'm saying is the browser could be
an experimental canvas for you what
kinds of things exist as elements in the
browser that we use everyday in these
standard ways and what might happen if
you subvert those standard ways and do
all sort and do different things with
them that might not be expected this is
a very simplistic almost look like first
approach to that but it's something
that's worth looking into and playing
around with I don't think you're doing
stuff to it but I've liked stopping
myself the other thing that you might
think about doing is having a you know
text input box and how you can use the
value function to set what's in the TEC
how might you make it appear that
someone's typing into that text input
box without there being a person there
and suddenly hitting a submit button
that that you know so how might you make
a page feel as if it's interacting with
itself and you know you could also do
something when you move one slider oh we
should try this okay so let's stop this
okay what do we you stop the video now
go do so go outside and play frisbee or
whatever good socialize with your
friends or have a nice cup of chamomile
tea to relax and edit ate all these
things are much more important than what
next but if you're still here I'm gonna
do one more thing with this what if I
have them all move when I move one of
them slightly offset from the one I'm
moving I don't even know if that would
work I shouldn't try to do this right
now this was going so well well I'll
just add this one so for example let's
say what I want to do is handle just the
first slider the input event
first adjust sliders so if you remember
the input event is an event that gets
fired anytime there is a change to the
value of a Dom element such as the
slider so I'm I don't need this draw
function anymore I'm going to rename
this to adjust sliders and I'm going to
say start from slider one sliders I
value sliders index zero dot by making
this simple so here what I've done now
is I said anytime you change sliders
zero the first element in the array call
this function of just sliders loop
through all the other ones starting with
one and change their value to the value
of the first one so here we go and I
could say anytime I move this they all
move but so I will leave that at that
you could take this what if when you
move they all kind of like move
sporadically but kind of like with that
one what if when you moved it causes
them to sort of ripple first one moves
then the next one moves then the next
one moves and get this kind of like
dancing this is dancing with sliders so
how could you if you actually interact
with one and it makes the other ones do
something anyway I'm kind of off the
beaten path here think of your own right
you're in the comments to wherever
you're seeing this video right some
other ideas of things that might be more
interesting to what I'm thinking of I
would love to make some more examples in
this direction or maybe share things
that you've made in that way so um this
concludes many many many videos that
I've made about Dom manipulation HTML
and CSS with the p5 GS library I'm sure
I missed a lot of things there are a
bunch of these videos where things
didn't work or I was like kind of
you send me your feedback write your
letters of complaint to Brian Williams I
mean me here at ITP the address is
Broadway I think that's okay to mention
it's on the Internet
you could set something in the mail I
like things in the mail and I will on
the next section of videos that I'm
hoping to make possibly tomorrow but
definitely next week if not tomorrow is
about working with data so how do you
work with a data file that you might
load that as information in it how do
you connect to an API like a weather API
or the New York Times API or this
wonderful API called the word Nick API
this one of my favorite api's so that's
what I would look at in the next set of
videos that I get to next so thanks for
tuning in which sounds ridiculous and I
don't know how it stopped now Thanks
