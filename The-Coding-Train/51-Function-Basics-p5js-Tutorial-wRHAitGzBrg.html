going to take the time to go a bit
deeper into what is this thing that's a
function that we've seen functions and
called functions we kind of define
functions or set up function the draw
function what is all this stuff and what
does it mean to define your own
functions and call your own functions
and why might you want to do that now
functions as a whole in JavaScript is a
huge topic and they're kind of the
fundamental foundational building block
of JavaScript in many ways so hopefully
all of the you know there's gonna be
lots more to discuss in future videos
and topics as as many different gaps are
filled in in terms of what functions can
do and how they're used in JavaScript
but here right now I just want to start
with the very basics and calling a
function of defining calling a function
and defining function now now this is
not a new topic you I all of us who have
done anything in p5 in JavaScript before
I've been doing this a lot so for
example this line of code here ellipse
100 100 you know 50 comma 50 this is
calling a function calling executing a
function draw an ellipse in the window
in the canvas this when I say function
set up and then presumably put some code
in here this is defining a function I'm
defining a function named set up and
this is the code that goes inside that
function now if you're looking at these
two things these are things that that
we've done in so many different examples
but there's a strange little fact here
we've called the I've cut within the
examples I've called the ellipse
function many many times but I never
personally define the ellipse function
this set up function we have the inverse
thing that's going on here I've defined
the set up function many many times did
many examples but I've never actually
called the set up function this is
because both of these functions here are
special functions special to p5 one of
the things we say I said that p5 is p5
is a library to library of functions
ellipse rect
line fill stroke background so the
definition for the ellipse function does
it live within us although maybe in some
ways it lives with him to us but it
lives in within p5 it's part of the p5
library you and I we don't have to
define it it's defined in p5 the setup
function is also a special p5 function
it's up to the user the programmer me
it's up to you to define it but p5 knows
when to execute it it executes sit
automatically when the page loads so
both of these they're a little bit
strange that you know that hopefully was
intuitive to you to use these buts a
little bit of a strange thing going on
define set up p5 execute sit at the
beginning of the program call functions
like ellipse those live with inside the
p5 library so what does it mean to both
define and call your own function so
there are two reasons why you might want
to do this and I'm sure there's many
more but two fundamental reasons sort of
key principles of functions one is
modularity right down here and the other
if I can dare spell this right is
reusability so functions are a way that
you could organize your program
you've got like hundreds of lines of
code and draw some of it's doing this
some of it's doing that some of it's
doing that we want to break that up into
modular pieces you can put those into
separate functions and it helps keep
your code rather well organized
reusability
I'm sure you've encountered this
scenario you draw this very elaborate
pattern it has lots of different shapes
in it you figured out how to draw it and
then you want to draw it again in the
window well if you had a function that
takes care of all of that stuff you
could then call that function twice
reuse that function giving it different
parameters so these are the pieces that
I need told that I would like to look at
in these videos and you know it I think
what I'm going to do in this video is
just start with the modularity piece so
I'm going to look at an example and make
that example modular and then in the
next video I'll look more specifically
at the reusability piece because this is
where this question of arguments and
parameters
we'll come up so let me see if I can
just get through this idea of defining a
function calling it making a program
modular and then move into the next
video
we'll look into this reusability
question and then there would be some
other things there's another so I have a
list over here there's a couple of
things that I want to do so probably
three or four of these okay
so let's come over here for a second I
have a simple sketch if I can see it
here I'm going to run it it's just a
bouncing ball sketch it's a variation on
some one of the sketches that I made
earlier in a video about conditionals a
couple things that I'll point out are
different one is I turn the variables
into an object so a lot of the examples
might just say var X bar Y bar speed
here I'm doing this for a reason because
later there's another aspect I'm going
to fill in here but remember in
JavaScript you can make a variable
that's essentially a container for other
variables these are actually referred to
as key value or name value pairs
the name is y speed the value is
negative 3 the name is X speed the value
is 4 so ball has all of these variables
and you can see down here if I want to
draw an ellipse at ball X or ball Y then
I just use the dot syntax ball X ball
dot Y so that's what I have here I have
a bouncing ball sketch hooray
now if I look inside draw here you can
see there are a few different kind of
sections of code I'm going to even add a
line break here you could say like okay
well this is all the code that draws the
circle the ellipse on the screen this is
the code that handles what happens if it
hits any of the edges it inverts the
speed and this is the code that moves it
it changes its X by its X be two changes
its Y by its Y speed so there's really
three things
there's draw there's display there's
bounce and there's move so what I would
like to do is turn this program into a
modular program that has three parts a
drawing part a bouncing part and a dis
moving part okay so we need to write
three functions now I need to close my
pen you come back over here and I want
to just quickly review or actually lay
out for the first time what the syntax
for defining a function is and actually
we
that syntax already this is the syntax
all we need to do is declare the keyword
function I am going to declare I'm going
to define a function that's what that
says then the function needs a name here
the name was set up but I might make the
name like move or display or balance
depending on the functions I intend to
write then you need parentheses now
right now you notice the setup function
the draw function just has an open and
closed parentheses and that's what for
this particular example that I'm making
we don't need to put anything in between
the parentheses that's where we have to
set up arguments and parameters
parameters started they were not
actually looking for as parameters here
for the function and then some code is
going to go inside the function and that
code is in between an open and curly
bracket so the parentheses stuff I'll
get to more in the next video so this is
that syntax so now I could come over
here and I can scroll down let me scroll
let me move this over a little bit so I
think you can see it I can scroll down
and we're so first where do I want to
define the function now this is a very
tricky question yes you can define
functions kind of all over the place in
all sorts of crazy ways in JavaScript
but right now I'm going to do something
kind of simple and just say below draw
you know kind of like where I might have
put mouse pressed or key pressed or
other functions I'm going to make up
some of my own functions I'm going to
say make a function called move and I'm
going to make a function called bounce
and I'm gonna make a function called
display so now you can see I define
three oh boy what are all these extra
curly brackets I don't know where those
came from but you can see I have now
defined three functions function move
function bounce function display these
are not even though the words sound very
like oh those must be important move the
balance those are those are not words
that are part of the p5 library there
are new words that I am making up only
for the purpose of this sketch right I
could have called it
Zippity flu or whatever it doesn't
really matter that I mean it matters
because you want to pick function names
that make sense and you don't want to
pick function names that are already
used or something else but for the most
part you can pick whatever names that
you want just like picking a variable
name same rules apply so if we look this
was the code
for moving the ellipse around the screen
changing its X by its speed so I'm
actually just cut this and paste it in
here this is the code for the bounce and
I'm going to put that in there and this
was all the code and I'm going to leave
background and draw because I
conceptually I feel like drawing the
background is not really associated is
not part of drawing that bouncing ball
itself it's separate so what I really
just want to do is is keep the code
that's for displaying the ball itself so
we can see now draw has like nothing in
it anymore there's just a move function
a bounce function and if I scroll down a
display function and now let me stop and
run this sketch again nothing in the
window why canvas that is nothing in the
canvas why is there nothing into canvas
all the functions are there so all we
did was define the functions right all
we did was define the functions the flow
of the program setup runs once draw runs
over and over again the only thing
that's happening is background now set
up and draw we ever had to call those
functions because there's special p5
functions that p5 executes in order to
control the flow of the program set up
once draw over and over again but any
other functions that I define I've got
to tell the program when to make those
things happen
so I could put them all in setup but I
don't want to move the ball and set up I
don't want to display the ball and set
up what I want is to have those things
happen every time through draw so I want
to move books bounce and display now
this by the way is the syntax for
calling a function and notice it's no
different than the syntax for calling
background background we're executing it
you can see it's colored red because
it's part of the p5 library move bounce
and display are functions that aren't
part of the p5 library but I've defined
them below so now this should be exactly
the same program we had before I do want
to know however that background write
requires an argument a color and move
balance and display don't require any
arguments and this is an essential topic
that I would like to look at in the next
video okay so let's run this and see if
this works
hey it's the same
exact program that we had before the
only difference now is that it's modular
there's a move part a bounced part a
display part and this is useful for a
couple of different reasons number one
you know if I just want to like sort of
test how things are working could
comment out this move function and run
it and you can see the ball is no longer
moving so if I have these functions if I
have the code kind of organized into
these pieces I can kind of control which
pieces I turn on and turn off I can also
say things to myself like oh I just want
to change the way the ball looks oh I
know where I need to look and then a
small program that seems sort of silly
but in a much larger piece of software
you might be hard to find like the right
part of the code but if you have that
part of the code in a function I could
say ah you know I wanted it to have you
know some color some fill so I can
change only I know all I need to do is
change the display function and now I
added a fill to that circle okay so this
is the essential basics of defining a
function and calling a function and
looking at how you can take parts of a
program and put them in separate
functions to make a program modular and
the next video what I want to do is
looks like I want to look at what
happens if you want to call a function
multiple times if you want to take an
idea package it up into a function and
reuse that idea in different ways with
different parameters and that's kind of
a key piece as well okay there we go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
