regular expressions okay so in this
video what I want to do is talk about a
whole bunch of specific meta characters
that you can use in a regular expression
now I should note that there are what's
commonly referred to as different
flavors of regular expressions so
depending on the context that you're
using the right of expression like the
atom editor or I'm using a red
expression in my JavaScript program or
in my Python program there will be
subtle differences in how the Medicare
in that what the meta characters are so
I'm I'm kind of using I'm using for lack
of a better I'm using the meta
characters that work in JavaScript I'm
using the JavaScript flavor I think it
might taste like blueberries in for
these regular expression videos so what
I want to do is just sort of talk
through more in order in sequence what
some meta characters are so just to
remind you we have this idea of literal
characters like I want to match
literally the character a and we have
this idea of meta characters I want to
match a any character of this kind so to
speak so I'm gonna in this particular
video there's more than just this and
I'm not obviously not going to get to
everything completely I want to look at
on single character meta characters
something called a quantifier and
something called two position I just
realized I can't remember which is which
so I'm gonna say what some of these are
then I'm gonna quickly check the chat
that's going on because it's being
recorded live you know you might not be
watching a live you know see if I got it
right but I might get these wrong I get
a lot of stuff wrong but anyway and I
obviously won't list every single
metacharacter but I will provide you in
the in the video's description with
links to where you can find more stuff
out of it so we saw by the way that
slash D is a meta character that
indicates any digit any value any
character 0 through 9 okay slash
backslash D and so one thing you'll
notice is some meta characters are
indicated because just D is a literal
character so just D is a little
character backslash is indicating that I
want the meta character d four-digit
these are not one that
really useful backslash W lowercase W
that's very important is any character
capital A through Z lowercase a through
Z and 0 through 9 the W stands for word
so in essence this is any character that
you might find as part of a word any
letter or number
backslash s any white space what could
this match this could match a space a
tab a space or a tab with probably some
other things through anything that's
white space I'm not including line break
here even though it can match a line
break but whether or not a regular
expression will match across different
lines is a bit of a strange thing so
yeah and involves a flag a setting that
you have to set and how you use a
regular session I'll get to that later
when I talk about flags what are some
other ones
another metacharacter that's very key is
and I talked about this in the previous
video is dot this matches any character
whatsoever any character whatsoever I
don't know if that is in the technical
description of regular expressions to
word whatsoever but I I just want to
emphasize it so this is kind of a
strange one to use and you've got to be
very careful because it's there's this
concept that'll get you later of this
greedy regular expression that's just
the kid so whoa hey I just got three
plus three pointer of their landed in
this little box it just can't stop
eating and matching and matching dot dot
dot match everything so okay alright now
an interesting thing about these
particular characters / d / w / s is
these are lowercase and if you are and I
guess I'm going to kind of like take up
if you if you use / capital W or /
capital S this means anything that's not
a word character anything that's not one
of these characters or anything that's
not whitespace and this can be very
useful I want to match any non
whitespace character so that's one thing
I think I'll mention
I would assume actually I don't know
that this is hook - check this if you do
backslash capital D is that anything
that's not a digit I would think so
so that's so these are um these are I
think some key single characters for you
to look at let's let's actually go and
come over here and like type some of
these in and see what happens okay so
I'm going to type in /w and you can see
that matches everything what if I just
look for a three any sequence of three
characters in a row and you can see the
sort of strange thing that's going on
here because it matched the th e it
doesn't match the H es because H E is
already part of this match if you want
to match both of those you kind of have
to do some other kind of acrobatics to
do that but you'll notice how how that
sort of works it matches the som but not
the ome but I could add a fourth one and
we could see hey here are all here are
any sequence of four word characters in
a row here is a digit followed by a word
character followed by a digit followed
by a word character and by the way that
matches these but it would also match if
I put this in here or if I put this in
here you can see how we can use these
single character meta characters to make
generic matches now there isn't a ton
that we can do just by knowing these but
I would like to just see how the
whitespace works very briefly here is me
matching all whitespace you can see I've
matched all white space or this is
matching only two whitespace in a row
and you can see uh-oh I know I I think I
put two spaces after my period I can't
do it myself
sound effect horrible hell you're there
okay I'm gonna so now by the way I found
anywhere in my this is this is how you
by the way can get rid of all of your
two spaces after a period which I
believe I really should be putting one
space after a period according to
something I saw on the internet at one
time anyway okay so let's come back over
here and you can see that on something
that I've been doing a lot is I've been
saying I want to match three word
characters in a row
or three-digit characters in the row so
this by the way is where quantifiers
come in so quantifiers are of meta
characters that modify the previous
character in the regular expression and
say how many of those things you want to
match in a row we saw that asterisk or
star is zero or more plus is one or more
so at least one question mark is zero or
one so is like optional and then you can
also use curly brackets with minimum
comma maximum or just a single number n
so these are at least in my head I might
be missing one these are the basic
quantifiers so we can match single
characters and we can quantify those
single characters how many in row two
match so let's go back over here and
come back to this and I can say for
example I want to find all five letter
words see this regular expression I want
to find all five letter words in my text
and you can see there we go now this
didn't really work why because it
matched this because it's just matching
five word characters in a row so how
could I say five letter words well one
way I could do it is all five letter
words all sequences of five characters
followed by a white space now you can
see ah I got this because it's followed
by white space which is at the end
that's no good
so I could also say it has to be white
space followed by five letters followed
by white space oh but these doesn't have
white space in the beginning so then I'm
leading to something that I'm going to
show you there's there's some there's
there's a really nice way you can look
for words of certain lengths or words
that match certain properties but I can
see here how I can this is a way of
matching whoops at one or more word
characters in a row we can see how I
could say a word character followed by
one or more digits which again you can
see what that matches so these are ways
that you can quantify it and let's let's
um let me show you let's let's
let's say I want to match the word color
so the colors of the rainbow have many
colors and the rainbow does not have a
single color so uh so look this is now I
want to match any time the word color
spelled Co ello you are or colors or any
time the word color or colors appears
color singular or plural as felt Oh are
spelled oh you let's look at how I would
do that so if my regular expression is
just color you can see what I match so I
could say color with an optional you
write like that and with an optional s
so look at this this regular expression
is match see literally see followed by
zero followed by L followed by not zero
ah I couldn't Matt could have it be also
or zero C followed by Oh
followed by L followed by O followed by
you optionally followed by are followed
by s optionally okay so you can see here
how these quantifiers can be quite
useful okay let me come back over here
so these are where's my flourish my
whiteboard marker here it is so these
are quantifiers these are ways of
indicated how many of the single
character you want to use now position
is another kind of meta character which
matches the position of a character in
the string itself so for example there
is a caret which means the beginning of
a line I think and dollar sign which
means the end and also I'm going to put
these in position meta characters /b
which is known as a word boundary so
these are position meta characters which
can also be incredibly useful let's look
at some scenarios where these can be
useful
okay rang the bell okay so let me come
back over here and I'm going to type
some text for you
this is a sequence of words color um
hello goodbye go so what I want to match
right
so what I want to do is match all the
words that are at the beginning of a
line so for example if I do slash W plus
you can see how I'm matching all the
words here this is something is about a
blah sequence of words hello and goodbye
what if however I say hat now you can
see I'm saying that hat is a position
let me let me show you that again hat
carrot something like that that is a
position a meta character meaning the
beginning of a line followed by one or
more word characters so look what I've
been able to match now now what I could
do is also put end of a line now I
didn't get anything what if I take out
the carrot you can see I'm getting all
the words that are at the end of the
line notice how I don't get rainbow
because of the punctuation mark so I'd
have to do something about that if I
want to match that but what if I wanted
to match only single words lines that
have one word so now I could say match
carrot followed by any sequence of word
characters followed by end end of line
so you can see now that regular
expression matches only words and single
because if there are the only lines that
started end with a sequence of word
characters so you can see how those
position meta characters could be
particularly useful depending on what
you're doing now another is word
boundary and remember this problem I was
having where okay well this matches all
of the but what if I want to match sorry
what if I wanted to match only all
four-letter words so you can see this
isn't exactly working because I'm
getting nu MB numbers is actually a
seven letter word but these are forward
characters in a row so something I can
do is I can say slash be a word boundary
followed by for word characters followed
by slash B and so now you can see this
is now look what it's getting some is a
four-letter word calls a four-letter
word
now look at these
a period is also even between out now
I'm saying this is a position
metacharacter because it's not matching
the thing after it it's matching this
weird space the space in between the
woohoo the space ha the space in between
the T in the period it's a position the
boundary between a word and so this is
something that different implementations
will do slightly differently depending
on what environment or context you're in
but it really means you know arguably
the space in between a word and it where
it and so you can see if I change this
to let's see anything between 4 comma 6
now I've matched all words between the
between 4 and 6 characters so hopefully
this runs you through this runs you
through the basics of what kinds of
single character meta characters can
match a digit any letter or number I can
match any white space I can match any
character you might be asking yourself
well what if I want to match only
letters so we need something called a
character class for that which I'm going
to show you in a different video
quantifiers which which modify how many
of these in a row and position like the
beginning of a line the end of the line
or the space between a character and
another character at the beginning or
end of a word and so if I'm continuing
with this thread let's see now if we can
match phone numbers I want to match
slash D three digits followed by a dash
followed by three digits followed by a
dash followed by four digits whoops so
I'm starting now this is now my ranked
expression on the way to matching all
phone numbers and you can see what only
matched that one why did it only match
that one because I'm saying it has to be
a - how would I say a dash or a period
and we need another concept called
character classes for that you also just
mentioned which I'll cover in the next
video okay thanks for tuning in and
hopefully this is helping you get a
sense of regular expressions and I'll
see you maybe in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
