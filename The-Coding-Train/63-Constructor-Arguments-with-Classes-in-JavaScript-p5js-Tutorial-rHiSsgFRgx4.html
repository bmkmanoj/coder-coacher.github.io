by now you kind of have a sense of the
principle of a capsulation and the idea
of making a template to create objects
item number one item number two is maybe
you have a sense of what the syntax for
writing a classes that template
constructor
initializing some variables that are
attached to that object writing some
functions that are the functionality of
that object the reason why you might
want to do this is because one reason
why is just to kind of organize your
code of ultimately I don't I could make
this exact sketch without all this class
and constructor and all that I just
could make some variables but one of the
nice things about this is I have two
things on the screen I don't have two
x's and two y's I just have two bubble
objects because imagine if these things
have a speed and an X feed and Y speed
and the color and radius you know I
don't want to have 15 sets of variables
for everything I have to make I want one
set of 15 to apply to a bunch of things
but one of the things that I've done
here that's not really scalable or
sustainable in it in a way that's gonna
be as useful is you know what if I want
these but right now they do move
independently of each other which is
nice but they always start at the same
spot now I could change their starting
location to be random but what if I want
to specify where they should start or
specify a size so look one of the ways
to do that is I want to say I often want
to say ah what I would like to do is not
just make a bubble but I would make like
to make a purple bubble or a blue bubble
or I would like to make a fast bubble or
a large bubble or a small bubble I want
to be able to modify the way that I
create an object and the way that I do
that is by adding stuff inside here I
add arguments to the constructor new
bubble with a radius of 50 and an XY of
70 comma so let me do it the other way
let's imagine that what I want I want
one bubble to be at 200 comma 200 and I
wanted to have a radius of 40 and I want
the other bubble to be at 400 comma 200
and I wanted to have a radius of 20 now
what are the weird things about Java
Script is again it just wants
work so I could add I'll add that and I
could run this code and I don't know
what it still works it doesn't that say
the same thing so those numbers go
nowhere but the idea is just like if you
watch my video about passing arguments
to a function I can pass arguments to a
constructor and if I do that what I want
is for the constructor to receive those
arguments so if I'm giving it three
arguments 200 240 I need to define the
constructor with three parameters I
think I'm getting this right these are
the arguments the values the things that
are passed in these are the parameters
the variables that go inside the actual
definition of the function in this case
the constructor so I'm going to add an X
a Y and an R so I'm gonna say this dot X
equals x this dot y equals y and you
know what I'm gonna create a new
variable called R this dot R equals R
and then in draw I'm going to actually
say I almost just typed R times to
almost just type r times two I need to
say this dot and actually in p5 with the
ellipse function if you want the with
the diameter along the width and the
height to be the same I don't only need
one value so now what I should do right
if I run this we can see I should be
making two bubbles with different
starting locations and a different radii
radius so look those started at the
right location now the size looks the
same what did I get wrong here uh hmm
missing semicolon 40 20 list dot r times
2 and he really should be different
right oh yeah I don't know I just
probably forgot to save so you might be
looking at this and thinking oh god this
is like the most awful thing I've ever
seen you mean those variables X the same
as the Vista X and and and actually if
you look at some of my examples in
previous programming environments that
I've used I often will do something call
this temp X temp Y this is one of the
most confused
aspects of programming with classes and
creating objects and then this would
have to be temp X right that would have
to beat my in temp our is that these
variables inside the constructor they're
temporary local variables just for the
sole purpose of receiving the value and
quickly passing it to the variable that
counts so this dot X is the variable
that counts it's actually the thing that
I'm going to use to keep track of where
the object is and draw it and move it
but I I can't access it directly from up
here
I mean the ways that I could but there
would be weird and they wouldn't
necessarily be make any more sense so I
want this 200 to go into this dot X I
need something to temporarily receive it
like temp X and then quickly pass it to
X so but I maybe I have a bad habit but
I like I actually just like to name
these the same name because I know that
which ones which by whether there's a
Vista or not but you will see that
conventions like this or name them with
an underscore or an underscore after or
with a temporary you know you can come
up with your own style but it's
important rods that these are all just
things I've made up like unicorn fluffy
rainbow and this code which you know in
many ways has its advantages unicorn I'm
gonna just play this whole thing out
fluffy rainbow just to prove the point
here this works as well the same exact
result the question is what kind of
variable naming convention makes sense
to your brain and being consistent kind
of helps in there are you can follow
other people's conventions and styles
but I would say there are no real rules
here and if you want to name your
variables unicorn fluffy rainbow pink
fluffy unicorns jump whatever it is I
got it wrong but twelve unicorns not
fluffy rainbows but you should make a
fluffy or somebody make a fluffy rainbow
p5.js sketch it's gonna be awesome to
share with me okay
so I got a little off track there but
the point of it is whatever I do
whatever I put in here I say bubble 200
it gets sent all the way to the
constructor definition
some variable it's like saying let x
equal it's like I'm initializing X with
this value 200 it goes in here and this
just if I have this here exists solely
to set this value so that I can use it
later so that's the real purpose of
these temp constructor parameters to
receive arguments and pass them to
variables of course you can use them in
all sorts of other ways you don't have
to follow this exact design pattern but
it is kind of a typical standard one so
if you're watching this video what I
would suggest to you is see see what
else you can add to this can you add a
color what's the difference between
making the color random for every bubble
versus initializing each bubble with a
color what other properties can you add
to this play around can you add another
function like can you add a function
called like edges that do something when
the bubble reaches the edges is this
even really a bubble what does it mean
to be a bubble if we answer that
question I don't think so
so try to add your own constructor
arguments at additional constructor
arguments and see what questions you
have and let me know thanks very much
for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
