series about Perla noise in which I
eventually I'm going to build a
simulation like this which kind of looks
like a hair lots a hair or a river or
something eventually will be rainbow
colored but I am talking about Perlin
noise ultimately how to deal with
multi-dimensional Perlin noise and how
to make some interesting pretty graphics
from that so where I last left off
previously previously on Perlin noise
explained I was making a mess of this
diagram trying to explain how Perlin
noise has calculated over multiple
octaves so what I next need to look at
is how do I actually call the noise
function in p5.js or processing and get
values out of it and make use of those
values so one thing that is true is if
you call the random function random you
can give it a minimum and a maximum
argument meaning I want a random value
between 0 and 50 if you give it just one
argument
it'll give it'll always assume the
minimum is 0 and anyway there's a
variety of ways we could think about
that but this is probably something if
you're watching this video that's
familiar to you
you might think that's the same thing to
do with Perlin noise right ok so I could
get my crazy random values or I could
get my nice smooth random values and
what I want the crazy random values I
want to give a minimum maximum with the
smooth values I want to get the minimum
maximum but there's a problem here
because of the nature of how Perlin
noise is calculated you can't you can't
simply you need to give it a different
arguments and that argument is in my
previous discussion I talked about sort
of thinking about purlins or the space
of one dimensional noise almost there's
a graph along an x-axis and you can
think of the x-axis as time but we can
also now take a moment to just think of
this as X the x axis and you'll see this
a variables named a lot of Perlin noise
examples as X off because what you want
to tell p5 are processing are that
you're but what you want to tell those
environments is I want the particular
Perlin noise value
at this position along the x-axis so
let's actually go and do that so I'm
gonna go look at this I'm gonna go over
here and I'm actually going to just go
over to the JavaScript console there's
one that and I'm gonna call first one
I'm gonna call the random function just
so we can see that so if I call the
random function with no arguments I get
some random value between zero and one
if I call it with one argument I'm gonna
get the value of between I'm gonna get a
random value between 0 and 121 lucky 21
now incidentally by the way never mind I
was going to show you that if you give
it a let's do this if you give it an
array and I say random a I will get a
random value from that array nice to see
right so let's refresh here now let's
call the noise function now I got not a
number
so noise cannot be called without an
argument so given my previous discussion
we might say okay well what if I want a
noise value between 0 and 100 you might
thing to do that okay I got 0.577 let me
call that again hey I got 0.577 again
uh-huh let me call at point 100 point
zero one that got a very similar number
but it's a little bit different see how
this number that I'm passing into noise
is really like time it's it's where am i
along this x-axis what's my offset along
this kind of pre-calculated in truth
it's not it's not like there's this big
array that's already calculated it's
there's a formula for doing it behind
the scenes but um but it's sort of this
pre-existing set of values so if I say I
want the noise value at 100 I'm always
going to get the very very same value
now you'll also notice here that the
number I got was 0.577 let's try saying
let me get noise at zero
how about noise at 200 notice that value
is always a floating-point value and it
doesn't seem to be greater than 1 it
also seems to be clustering around 0.5
so noise values actually don't have a
uniform distribution between by the way
the range is between 0 &amp;amp; 1 they also
don't have a uniform distribution right
if you if I were to say to
you let's look at let's let's say I want
to pick random values between zero and
one over time and over hours and hours
and days and days and days
how often do I pick point five versus I
pick point seven five versus I pick
point O five right I should get a
uniform distribution for pure randomness
that's the nature of randomness with
Perley noise you'll actually see that
the values cluster around the mean or
the center point five so the
distribution looks more like this which
is like a bell curve or a normal
distribution that's another topic for
another day but sort of interesting to
note that or point that out okay so
there I am this is what I'm doing I'm
getting those values so let's now
actually make the sketch do something
I'm gonna create a variable I'm going to
call it X and I'm gonna set it equal to
zero and actually don't know why I'm
doing that first thing I'm gonna do is
just draw a circle I'm gonna use the
ellipse function and I'm gonna just
change the size of this to a foreigner
by 400 I'm gonna draw the circle and the
center of the window and make it like 24
pixel diameter and let's just see that I
have a circle there there we go see this
circle here let's whoops let's make that
a little bit bigger okay and now I don't
know what's there's some extra nonsense
here by accident and get rid of that
okay there you go see that circle there
it is now let's make a variable called X
and set that equal to 200 there we go
now let's do something different
and let's set that X equal to a random
with value now you can see every moment
in time I'm getting a random value okay
now I want to instead have noise so let
me look at let me comment this out and
say var x equals noise and then I'm
gonna say noise at time 100 something
random well notice it's over here no
matter what you do the noise function
will always return values between zero
and one so one thing that I want to do
is take that the result of that faction
that function which goes between 0 and 1
and map it to bring 0 and width in
I could just multiply by width because
multiplying number between zero and one
multiplies it by with gives me a value
between zero and width so now if i
refresh this alright I not hit save I
didn't hit save there you go you can see
every time now every time i refresh the
page
this sketch creates a new set of Perlin
noise values so even though the values
are fixed for that moment if I say noise
100 I'm always going to get the same
value over and over and over again if i
refresh the page I'm gonna get a
different same value over and over and
over again because the Perlin noise
space is seated and and p5.js is gonna
recede it every time you refresh the
sketch and you can use the noisy
function to fix the seed but that's
that's a little bit of an aside here
okay so we're getting something but the
number isn't changing why because that
number is the same all the time so what
I want to do is make this instead of a
fixed value of 100 I want to call this
something like X offset I want a
variable what I want to do is that when
I don't have my graph here anymore but
if this is my graph of Perlin noise I
want to move throughout the space I
could move forward or backward I can
move quickly I could move slowly I want
to get new values every time through
draw so here all I can do now is say X I
can say X offset here and I can say X
offset plus equals 0.01 so let me do
that and refresh this and you can see
now you can see how it's random but it's
smooth right this is now the difference
between this now you're looking at
Perlin noise values over time
represented as an exposition with
compared to random values over time
represented as an exposition so see the
difference I'm not looking at that graph
anymore I'm just looking at a single
value but I'm looking at it each moment
in time so hopefully this gives you the
idea of Perlin noise of how Perlin noise
works in the core level I think what I'm
gonna do is I'm going to end this
particular video and the next video I'm
actually just gonna show you how to draw
a graph
of those values which might be somewhat
useful don't go don't go don't go stay
with me please
this is an addendum to this particular
video which is that I kind of forgot to
mention something important which is I
picked this number 0.01 somewhat out of
a hat and it really this number really
means something it was really a vital
crucial number and how the values will
behave so let's look at this sketch
again and look at how its behaving let's
think about this graph up here that
finds a lot of glare that you can't
barely see but think about how it might
be to jump ahead really quickly or to
move really slowly and you can always
think about that as the speed of this
thing right how quickly are you getting
those new values so for example if I
were to change this to point
0:01 and refresh the page you can see
it's like moving very very slowly
because it's taking a lot of time to
slowly walk through that Perlin noise
graph but if I were to change it to
point 1 and hit refresh you can see it's
moving much more quickly if I were to
make that number very large like really
large if I were to say it's like 100
this is essentially just like randomness
now because it's moving so far ahead in
that Perlin noise space that that idea
of the values being tied to the previous
one or the next one is almost lost
because you're jumping so far ahead
however it does look different than
random right if I go back to this too
random because you'll notice the wind
values are getting further along to the
edges that has to do with that certain
uniform distribution and values as
opposed to Perlin noise values which
tend to cluster around the center ok so
I'm going to do a little bit more with
you in the next video just about
one-dimensional Perlin noise before we
move on to two-dimensional perla noise
and looking at how you might make
procedural textures the purlins</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
