video we kind of talked in general about
we could define a function we could call
a function I want to put that into
practical use in the simplest possible
way right now the simplest possible way
we can do that is to just look at a
program we've written in processing I'm
going to take this program right here
which I'm about to run what does it do
it's our data
bouncing ball program which we've looked
at five zillion times which you're
hopefully not too tired of I know okay
so the balls bouncing around well this
is very hard to do yeah I can't do those
good follow the ball it's backwards I'm
like okay I just can't really do it okay
sorry anyway your balls bounce grab so
what we want to do first looking at this
program is think to ourselves what's
going on here well I would say there are
three things going on here number one
every frame of animation we have to draw
that ball but to draw that circle on
screen every frame of animation we have
to advance the circles position we have
to move it and every frame of animation
we have to check to see if it's hit the
edge of a program and if it's hit the
edge of a program we have to make it
turn around so we could save ourselves
this is our goal we want our draw
function to look like this
we want our draw function to say
something like display ball maybe we
want our draw function to also say move
ball and perhaps I'm going to say check
edges could have called that balance I
could call it anything we want so this
is what we want our draw function to
look like look it's lovely it's three
lines of code there's so many advantages
to this the fact that we can say our
program is modular it's in three parts
it's readable we kind of understand it
we don't have this gobbledygook all
throughout draw we can you can start to
organize our thoughts together nicely
and I'm going to show you the moment how
we can turn these kind of sections on
and off very easily to allow ourselves
to debug to find problems in our program
more easily so how do we do this well
these functions don't exist in
processing we need to define we need to
define display ball move ball and check
entrance so let's go over and do that
in our program here so looking at this
code what do we got
well let's scroll down below draw and
say okay we want to add a function call
it display ball
remember our syntax return type function
name parenthesis for arguments open
curly bracket close for the record the
same syntax we use to define the
function draw a source a special case in
processing that we happen to find too to
say what code should happen in that loop
we're doing here display ball move ball
check edges now we've now written these
three functions well what do we want to
do with these three functions we want to
say okay here is the code this is the
code right here that is all the code for
displaying that circle for drawing that
circle I can cut that out and put that
all in here here this is I would say is
the code which moves the circle whatever
x and y increment by their speed it
moves so we're going to take that code
and put it down here in move ball now
here is the code that where we check as
it hit an edge is it greater than width
is it less than zero so we reverse its
direction this is the code that deals
with checking the edges
so now you can see we've made our
program nice and modular there are three
functions display ball move ball and
check edges and this allows us to easily
let's say we work on we've worked on
this we spent days and days creating
this beautiful program just about
bouncing this ball around the screen
it's our finest work and we're thrilled
but then we go on vacation or we are
busy with other projects or something
else happens when we come back to this a
month later this is the same thing as
writing comments in your code functions
allows you to quickly settle you know
what I wanted to have a rectangle forget
that circle going to have a rectangle
bouncing around the screen you can
easily find it by saying ah it's the
display function that's the code I need
to edit now this seems of course all
very silly with such a simple kind of
trivial example so ball bouncing around
the screen but as you get further on
with larger more complex programs once
we start having objects you'll see how
this can move be of help okay so let's
run this again if you're thinking
something's going to go wrong something
is what happened to my bouncing ball
it's I wrote this perfect program set up
draw display ball move ball check edges
what's going on nothing is happening
well you could define a function if you
define a function but don't call it
explicitly somewhere within the flow of
the program it's not going to be
executed none of this code is happening
it's just all floating in there it's a
function defined in a forest where
there's nobody to hear the clapping
sound or something anyways if you define
a function but don't call it does it
exist it exists but it's not happening
so yes we define set up and draw but set
up and draw our functions that
processing actually executes for us set
up the winning draw or whatever we need
to call these functions somewhere in one
of those and we know specifically what
we need to do we need to call them and
draw that's what we define it set up
okay so if now I add display ball we can
run this program and see we've got the
ball ping display but it's not moving or
it's not bouncing off the edges so I can
now write move ball
and check edges and run this and we see
okay that was something fell
everything's okay was just a small
little tiny thing nobody has to worry oh
it was my clock six minutes so far we're
doing great okay that was my goodness we
could see the balls bouncing around no
one was hurt
no animals were hurt during the filming
of this how to make your functions video
noise okay so you can see this is
working so this has a lot of it this is
a very very simple first step but this
has a lot of advantages for example
let's say something was going wrong in
this program I'm going to make something
go wrong in this program let's run this
again hmm I don't see my bouncing ball
what is happening what's going wrong in
this program well let me just check I
just want to turn off moving it and
checking the edges to make sure that's
not causing the problem oh I still don't
see it so there is a problem the only
thing that's happening is ellipse the
problem has to be in the display ball
function oh so maybe what which I do let
me print out the value of x so I can see
what it is
oh the value of x is ten hundred
thousand ten thousand you can't see that
but it's at the bottom of the screen and
the console something really is going
wrong here so what I'm kind of
emphasizing here in it in a somewhat
silly way is that I'm going to fix it
put X back to zero is that in addition
to making your program more modular so
it's readable on what word what we've
done here is we've allowed to easily
sort of define the various pieces of
functionality sort of conceptual pieces
of our program turn them on and off
easily by commenting out whether we're
calling a function or not it just has so
many advantages that could go on and on
and on so this is step one we've made
our program reusable I mean I said
exactly the wrong thing we haven't made
our anything reusable in our program
we've made our program modular which is
divided into three modular pieces the
next thing we want to do what if we
wanted to display another ball you need
some way of making our code
usable and that the way we're going to
make something reusable is through the
use of arguments to a function so that's
what's going to come up in the next
video we're going to look at arguments
to a function the video after that what
does it mean to have a return type
that's not void what does it mean when
we define a function to not have a void
return type so if you're looking for an
exercise to do right now at the end of
this video before you get to the next
one and this is what I said the last
video but now you could really do it if
you got stuck is take something you've
written in processing has a lot of code
and set up a lot of code and draw just
say what are the conceptual pieces of
what's happening in this program divided
up into those sections write a function
for each one of those sections and call
those functions instead of a draw so you
can just reorganize your thoughts
reorganize your program refactor your
program so to speak in a way that's a
little bit easier to follow okay so that
is the end of this video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
