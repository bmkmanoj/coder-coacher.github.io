I want to look just talked about and
look at the scenario where you have an
array of images you know we've been
looking at these little experiments
where hey I load a some animal and I
displayed on the screen alright load a
flower and I just played on the screen
what if I want to have a hundred
different flower images or what if I
want have a hundred different animal
images I'm certainly having a hundred
different image variables isn't going to
be that sustainable an array of course
is the perfect scenario here and just as
we have a you know in the same way that
we have an integer called
X we could have an array of integers you
know called nums we can have the same
exact thing with a p image so I can make
a p image array here we have ten p image
object just in this array by just
declaring the variable name the type
using the square brackets and then
specifying the size of the array and we
could use an array list and other things
that we may or may not have seen videos
that's what okay so why would we want to
do this so there's there's several
scenarios one scenario is that we simply
want by way I made myself old smaller
here I don't know if this is better but
one is that we might just want to do a
slideshow so if we have a whole lot of
images and we either want to show them
in sequence automatically or we every
time the user clicks the mouse we go to
the next image that might be something
we want to do and this this example is
in learning processing and there will be
a link to it below somewhere another
thing we might actually want to do is
draw an animation now looking at this
you might think okay the point of doing
animation and processing is that we have
an algorithm and I'm using variables in
the sine-wave been doing this thing and
all this kind of stuff to make shapes
change color and grow and shrink and
move and all that sort of stuff on the
screen but you know something that might
happen to us for example if we look here
these are just a whole lot of stick
figure pngs and each one of these is a
frame of an animation sequence maybe you
have you've done this in another
environment and what you want to do is
display that
sequence back in processing so a way
that you could do that is load an array
of images and show them one at a time
now this is kind of a sophisticated
example which I will link to this one
below and which involves a lot like
there's image sequence there's a whole
bunch of them on the screen there also
they're the actual sequence it's moving
at X Y position some of them are moving
faster than others so there's a lot of
steps to creating this particular
sequence I do have some simpler ones
which I will also point you but the
scenario that I want to look at right
now together just to get get kind of
used to the basics of using an array is
this one so sorry I don't think I'll get
back to our bubbles and remember we have
these nice bubbles on the screen and
what are they doing they're floating to
the top this is what we had before only
now instead of two bubble objects we now
have an array of five bubble objects and
I loaded an image of a flower so
certainly I could do what we just did a
moment ago and change from the ellipse
to the flower and now I have these five
flowers moving up but if I look at the
data folder here what I'll actually see
is I have three flower images and what
if I want to randomly each object should
display a different flower image how
would I do that
so let's come back over here again we
know we have this image array so what we
could do is say alright there's ten
images I can refer to any individual
image by its index so one thing that I
might do in setup first is simply load
each individual image into a slot in
that array so right I have image 0 it
should be flower 1 I have image 1 it
should be flower - I have image 2 it
should be flower 3 certainly I think
there's a flaw in the way I numbered
those images and in fact even though
that might be your instinct to say oh I
have a bunch of images let me let me let
me let me name them one two and three I
think it would make a lot more sense and
I'm just going to change this here to be
flower zero flower 1 and flower 2 just
to emphasize that the way we
with an array is by starting from zero
okay so now I have my image my P image
flower I'm going to make this flowers
and I'm going to have three of them
obviously you could do it with a lot
more now
flowers zero I want to load image zero
flowers one I want to load image one and
flowers too I want to load flower two
now looking at this you might say to
yourself down here we made all the
bubbles we used a loop I goes from 0 to
the length of the bubbles let's make all
the bubbles here something very similar
is going on but I load in each image
individually you know the way the reason
why I did that is I have a whole bunch
of file names and I need to like
manually type in those file names but
these file names also have a
relationship flower zero flower one
flower two so actually there isn't any
reason why I couldn't just say for int I
equals zero eyes less than three I plus
plus and really when I said three I
really mean the length of the array and
then I could say flowers index I and
this is kind of what I want to write
right I want to say for every flower
flower zero flowers one flowers to load
flower 0 flower 1 but this string is
actually flower I jpg I don't have an
image called flower I we're going to get
into strings of data in some videos that
are going to come later after I do these
images one but a trick that we can do
with strings is I can actually say
flower plus I plus JPEG so what this is
doing is it's saying start with the
string flower FL o WR then take whatever
the value of I is and tack it in with
that zero one or two and then tack jpg
on to it so when I run this okay
flower I need to call this flowers I've
loaded all the flowers but we have an
error what did I say here I said flower
flower now I have an array so if I want
to draw flowers 0 now I have those
flowers if I want to draw it with
flowers 1 now I have those red flowers
and now flowers too now I have those
yellow flowers and you can see my aspect
ratios are off so this is something I
would encourage you to figure out how to
correct with this particular example but
what I want is some very some flat some
bubbles to draw a flower zero sum of all
those subdue our flower one some bubbles
to draw a flower to how are we going to
do that we need each object to store a
reference to its own image now in truth
you might be thinking actually the
object doesn't have to store a reference
to its own image it just needs to store
a reference to the index into the array
right the flower if I'm a bubble object
I just need to store a zero one or two
and that will tell me which image to
grab but I think a more scalable and
more flexible a solution that I want to
demonstrate here is what if the object
itself somehow gets its own image in the
constructor so when the object is made
it stores a reference to that image and
then we don't have to dig go to any
global variable down here we just need
to display that particular image the
question is how do we get the image here
well how did we get the X how do we get
the Y how do we get the diameter we
receive those as arguments to the
constructor we pass those in we have
made up so you know I passed them 100
time plus I times 100 and 300 and then a
random size these are the pieces of data
that I'm passing in to make each bubble
now what I want to do is say pass in
flowers index 0 right so I want to just
pass it one more piece of data in
addition to the XY and the size I want
to give it an image so if I pass that
image here and I say P image tent tent
image now I can assign that image to
this particular bubble and we're done so
the bubble in addition to storing
variables that keep track of where it is
on the screen also stores a variable
about what image it's going to display
and then it receives that image in the
constructor and then uses that image to
draw itself and now if we run this I
have all the paint flowers I'm going to
change this value to 1
have all the red flowers and to change
this value to two and I have all the
yellow flowers let's do one more step
here right now sometimes I want to pass
in a zero sometimes I wanna pass into
one sometimes I want to pass into two
how could I make that decision I could
use I I could use random let's use
random int index equals random between
zero and three and really instead of
three I want to zero between zero and
the length of the array so this is
giving me a random value between zero on
the length of the array converting into
an integer if the length of that array
is three I'm going to have a zero or a
one or a two
let's use that index here and now we can
see when we run it each of our bubbles
has a different file we didn't get a red
flower that's so sad let's run this
again now we got a red flower only one
but two yellow to pink and one red so we
can see this is the power of using an
array and you can start to imagine hmm
there's more to this year even though
we're using an array the object itself
has a reference to its own image so
let's say we're pulling images from
Google Image Search some web service
some API somewhere we could have some
other mechanism that grabs those images
and passes them into objects to use for
its own internal display so this is a
very powerful way of thinking through
this problem of keeping of having kind
of an engine that loads the images and
the objects themselves then receiving
those images as inputs so you know
there's various things you could try
here you could think about what if you
baby each one of these an image sequence
that's kind of a difficult problem you
might just simply figure like try try
the same idea with your own images I'm
trying to think of other things you
could add it's the example which I can't
think of I don't know I'll write it
somewhere somewhere brilliant someday
sometime if I can okay so this is it now
in the sense that this is not it at all
this is it for sort of like walking
through the beginning the basic first
ideas of using images what we really
want to get to which is what I'm going
to start doing the next set of videos is
what if we don't just use images as
things we draw out of the screen what if
we invent our own image
through an algorithm if we could set the
pixels of every we could individually
set the pixel every pixel of our
processing window you know the world is
our oyster what could we not possibly
draw anything if we have access to every
single pixel on the screen so that's
what I want to start looking at next
