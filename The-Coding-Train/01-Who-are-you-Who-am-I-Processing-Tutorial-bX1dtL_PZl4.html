second and let me introduce myself I was
home before properly
my name is this is absurd that I'm
writing my name over here on the board
but my name is daniel la schiff mon
coeur house Shipman but you're gonna but
I don't know I go say she's mine if you
want
um and I work at a place called ITP
which you can find out more about ITP
NYU dot edu it's a two-year graduate
program and I teach a lot of programming
courses here one of which in particular
is a course called introduction to
computational media in which the
students learn most of them for the very
first time how to program the computer
and we use for that course something
else that I participate in developing
called processing and you can find out
more about processing at processing org
so this is who I am in the kind of
context at least of what I'm doing I
imagine I'm making these videos just to
try them to learn more about teaching
tomorrow to learn more about teaching in
this strange new context as well as to
supplement the course that I'm teaching
here but it's my hope that all of these
things will kind of feed into each other
in a nice way and that there will be
some population however smaller it's
three people three hundred three
thousand three million that are
interested in this content and that this
stuff that I'm going to talk about and
demonstrate over many many many many
many videos will be interesting and help
you - oh I'm really trying too hard to
justify this but I'm just doing it you
can turn it off at any time you like
okay now who are you I don't know I
would be interested in hearing from you
but let me say a few things this video
series is for the complete and total
beginner you don't need to know anything
that's not entirely true you do need to
have access to a computer you probably
already do if you're watching this video
you need to know some basic stuff how to
download a piece of software how to
install it
yeah type that kind of stuff but really
that's it I will assume no knowledge
whatsoever about anything that has to do
with
gramming we're going to really really
slowly in great detail build up stuff
from the beginning so if you already
know some stuff about programming a nice
thing about this video series is I'm
trying to keep the videos to between 2
and 28 minutes really I want them to be
like 5 to 10 minute videos but you can
just skip some you can jump ahead if all
you're interested in is how to like
parse a JSON feed and get into your
processing sketch and that's probably
going to be video like number 50 or 30
or 22 somewhere further ahead you can
just it's not made yet by the way it
does it exists but you can jump ahead
and do that the other thing I should
mention is I made some videos last year
so is as you're watching them if you
simply think that I look much younger or
have a strangely different length of
beard it's because some of the videos
from last year are going to be kind of
spliced in here although I may end up
remaking them if if they're out of date
or need some extra touch-up or that sort
of thing so that is the so that's who I
am that's who you are or maybe you are
you can let me know if you're somebody
different</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
