hair okay
edit that part out welcome to another
video in the nature of code video series
and today I don't have anything in my my
pen here it is f2 Holden I feel more
come from this way today we are making a
huge leap forward so if you actually
watched every single video or at least
most of them up until now you would have
found that all of the simulations
there's a circle on the screen a square
on the screen some shape on the screen
it's really an inanimate object it has
no decision-making ability it has no
life it has no hopes and dreams and
fears it's just sitting there and forces
in the environment push or pull it
around what we want to do in this very
moment in this very spot together today
is say we want to begin to build
simulations where the objects make a
decision I think earlier probably the
first video I think I might have talked
about a ball sitting on the table it
falls off the table versus a little
creature sitting at the end of the table
that chooses to jump off that table
today we want to be that creature that
jumps off the table that that is able to
perceive its environment and make a
decision as to where it should go now
we have we want to do this just for its
own sake because this is going to be
interesting and allow us to build
different types of motion behaviors that
we haven't been able to do so far but we
also have another goal in mind so I want
to come over here for a second and look
so this is um without the mouse in the
center oh I don't cannot control that
mouse this is this mouse anyway that's
irrelevant what we have here is an
example that you'll find in processing
it's a flocking simulation we're going
to get to this example probably at the
end of this set of chapter 6 videos but
the reason why I want to look at it is
this is an example of a complex system
what is a complex system complex system
is often thought of a system that's more
than the sum of its parts
well what is the part here the part is
this little triangle that's moving
around the screen that operates with
these really three simple rules don't
run into my neighbor stay with the group
try to go in the direction of the group
we're going to look at those rules later
more formally but but that's simple
those simple rules we can understand
each one of these individual triangles
very easily but globally that we get
this kind of unpredictable highly
intelligent ordered yet chaotic behavior
it's
really quite amazing and you know
there's tons of examples of this in
hatred ant colonies termites lightning
earthquakes the weather think about the
stock market there we could go on and on
and on and come up with tons of examples
of systems of these simple agents that
when you put them all together you get
this global intelligence I mean an ant
can't be that sophisticated but how does
an ant colony build an elaborate set of
tunnels and collect lots of food and
protect the Queen just favorite I have
no idea what ants actually do but you
know it's something like that I watched
I don't know bug's life or b-movie or
eight and there's a bunch of them anyway
so this is where we want to go if we but
before we get to stuff like this we're
going to look at these simple agents now
so I'm going to get to all the details
of this I guess this video is kind of
like a little bit of an introductory
landscape of this topic and I wanted to
just point out to you a couple things
that I think are useful for you to think
about so ok let's take a moment to
define what we mean by autonomous agent
so what are the what are the sort of
principles that we're going to think
about as we start to build these
simulations that involve entities that
can that can are more alive okay so one
principle is that an autonomous agent
has an ability and there's a sort of key
word here a limited ability to perceive
its environment now this may seem like a
trivial detail to you but this will
become quite an important factor in in
what we end up programming right is are
the things on the screen able to see
anything within 25 pixels of itself or
perhaps is this object on the screen
only able to see things that are in
front of it at a certain distance right
so what is that limited ability what can
it actually see on the screen or smell
or sense right we want to build start
building entities these objects that
have sensors on them you know virtual
software sensors so okay the other thing
that we want to do is once it's
perceiving its environment
it's going to kind of process that
environment so let's process the
environment and calculate an action so
the key thing here is calculate that
action so I'm an entity and I'm I got to
get a better word than entity but I'm a
thing and I see that there's a bunch of
things in front of me and those things
look scary so I'm going to calculate my
action which is to run away in the
opposite direction right what is that
calculation going to result in it's
going to result in a force so what's
really um what's really important about
what we're doing here is we're not we're
not really doing anything new we're just
thinking about things differently and
coming up with some interesting formulas
and logic and rules by which we send
forces into our objects so even though
we're thinking wildly different
conceptually this thing is alive this
thing is not alive wind is something
that just affects it you know external
force like wind versus an internal force
like fear in the end they're all just
going to be forces and the last thing I
want to put on this list here is that is
that there is no global plan or leader
now this isn't some hard and fast rule
you know from everything you ever build
down processing you better not have a
leader in that program you know we're
not saying I don't say that by any
stretch of the imagination but one thing
that's important to realize is we as a
kind of exercise here are building
entities that just respond to whatever
they can perceive around themselves and
and and make a decision in a and and
calculate an action based on that there
isn't some global leader telling them
what to do now you may want to build
simulations with global plans and
leaders in them and that's fine but a
true autonomous agent wouldn't have that
it really is making its decisions only
based on its own perception of the
environment so these are the kind of key
principles that we're going to see in
the programs were going to build now
what are these examples were going to
make and where do they come from so
there's a lot of places with a lot of
things we could come up with and think
of ultimately we're going to build our
examples off of the work of Craig
Reynolds and his us
all based on this paper he wrote called
steering behaviors for autonomous
characters which I'm going to get to in
a second but before we do that let's
just look at some kind of nice examples
of this so I have this video on a loop
here which I'm going to try - no idea
where it's going to be in the video but
um so this is from Casey Reese's process
compendium which I will link to below
and you can see here there's an element
with a bunch of rules if you I highly
suggested goats pause this video go
watch his video you can see here all
these elements that are operating with
these very simple rules they perceive
their environment what are they near if
they hit something if they're if they
intersect something turn if they don't
intersecting something goes straight and
all of his work these beautiful artworks
are created out of these incredibly
simple rules and I can kind of scan
through this and you can see I'm going
to go back to the beginning and we can
see it as maybe this this diet this this
this simulation is perhaps a slightly
better representation of that so one of
the reasons why I wanted to just quickly
reference Casey Reese's work is because
a lot of his information comes from am I
still here yes comes from this book I
have a prop now it's a book it is paper
it's like a Fanning me okay this book
called vehicles by Valentino Brayton
burg
so Valentin Brayton burgers a
neuroscientist and I think if I go here
and this is just the page of the book on
Google books and you can see what's nice
about this book is this is kind of
exercise in science fiction in a way and
creating these ideas with these little
robots with sensors that see light and
this one is afraid of the light and this
one is attracted to the light and um and
Brandenberg really thinks of these
vehicles as almost like no pets or
little creatures and they respond to
fear or love or aggression or foresight
and and so I think this is an important
place to really think about a put a
really nice set of inspiration for how
you might want to think about and build
autonomous characters so I will also
link to some material on Brayton Berg's
vehicles below which you can look at as
a kind of source of inspiration for you
but the reason why I bring this up is
brain Berg's vehicles we're a main
source of inspiration for Craig Reynolds
steering behaviors so what we're going
to look at and
two set of processing examples which are
just pure implementations of Reynolds
steering behaviors for autonomous
characters so this is a paper that was
written in 99 I encourage you to take a
look at it I'm going to kind of go
through a lot of it in less four-pole
less depth processing speak and so you
might want the kind of true guts of this
by taking a look through this paper
yourself but what Reynolds has done is
has said okay we don't really care
exactly about how things really truly
work in the real world but we want to
create is the appearance we want to
create lifelike and improvisational
characters that move about the screen
and one of my favorite examples there's
a whole set of behaviors wandering and
seeking pursuing a target following a
path one of the ones that I think is a
great illustration of this is queuing at
a doorway and we can see here in this
simulation we have a lot of elements
that are all trying to get through this
doorway but as they come together they
have to slow down and stop
so how what is its perception in this
environment how does it know where the
door is how is it trying to get there
how does it see the things around it why
does it choose to slow down when it gets
near something these are all the types
of things that we want to step through
so we're going to look at the this idea
of a steering force how do we calculate
a steering force and what are a lot of
scenarios whereby we need these steering
forces what kind of steering force do we
want when an object wants to catch some
you know catch its prey on versus escape
from a crowded room because it feels
very claustrophobic in that room strange
scenario there's a great I should link
to it below there's a great paper and
some online simulation that came out
recently of simulating a mosh pit so
what is what is a ma sure in a mosh pit
desire to do and what types of decisions
does it make based on how other Mosher's
are moshing around them right you could
ask yourself that question you could
come up with a set of rules and then you
could simulate that and I encourage you
to take a look at that simulation which
I will link to below I don't have it
prepared here because I don't prepare
for it just blabbing on and on
I will get better at this I swear okay
so um let's talk so we work this is just
a lot of flowery language and kind of
walking through a bunch of things here
which one which I'm almost done with but
what I want to do is kind of talk
through how Reynolds thinks of on what
his vehicles do so Reynolds thinks of
his vehicles as operating with three
steps action selection steering and
locomotion so our objects that we're
going to build in processing are going
to follow these three steps action
selection is looking at the environment
and choosing an action oh I've got to
get that food oh I've got to run away
for that predator oh I really want to
get through that doorway or oh that path
looks lovely it's the yellow brick road
let me follow it right so we have to
choose a desire and here this word
desire is really really key all of our
objects that we're going to build are
going to have a desired velocity the
velocity the direction and speed at
which they really want to go at the
moment once they have that desired
velocity we're going to calculate a
steering force based on it that steering
force is water right the word is a force
it's just a vector so just the way we
calculate an attraction force we
calculated a friction force we are now
calculating steering forces we're going
to have a very specific formula for it
which is so simple and elegant and
powerful and that's really the
innovation that Reynolds came up with
with this framework so we're going to
look at how we calculate steering forces
and the good news here once we have that
steering force we need to apply it to
the object's locomotion it needs to move
what are some options for locomotion
well we could have Euler integration
location velocity and acceleration we
could use box2d
we could use toxic libs right the third
step is the physics simulation so all
we're doing here is we're saying we have
an existing physics simulation and now
we're going to layer on
top of it this methodology for choosing
behaviors and applying forces to those
objects so the this so everything that
we've done all videos Long's is all
building up to this point where we now
have this physics engine we could use
any one of these we're going to use our
own we're just getting as P vector and
our own location velocity acceleration
and now starting to apply steering
forces to it so I'm going to stop this
video here that's kind of an
introduction to the landscape of all of
this stuff I think I have this list of
things that I covered and in the next
video we're going to all we're going to
really look at is this very simple
calculation for how we calculate a
steering force and the first behavior
that we're going to look at is seeking a
target so like ah over there something I
want to get there I'm going to how do I
steer in that direction which is very
similar to gravitational attraction but
I want to look also I'd like how this
model differs from that and how it's in
many ways more powerful or at least a
better model for entities that might be
alive are kind of providing their own
set of moving themselves about a space
as opposed to just experiencing a force
okay thank you and I just say goodnight
but it's the afternoon I am over here
now okay goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
