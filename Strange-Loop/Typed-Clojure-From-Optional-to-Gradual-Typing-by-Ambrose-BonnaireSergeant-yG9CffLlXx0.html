am here to report on my progress from
last time i was here at strange loop
where i presented an optional type
system for clergy are called type
closure and this is really a preliminary
look at the journey from creative from
turning this from an optional type
system to a gradual type system and if
none of those words make sense then
you're in the right place because i'm
going to explain everything so yeah here
we were at strange loop 2014 we had an
optional type system and this is the
lofty goal of a gradual type system and
i don't know how many dots are in this
dotted line yet but we're getting there
but this is the kind of the context of
the talk i'm going to be explaining or
some of the the dotted dotted line parts
that I've currently implemented what's
left and why it's important so first off
what is gradual what is optional typing
sorry well I like to think of optional
typing as combining these two worlds of
untyped and typed lands so you can you
can you can understand an untyped
compilation as kind of following this
this compilation pipeline so enclosure
we have a reader and then an analyzer
and then an e-meter but basically the
point to get from this is that there is
no type checker here but in type code
for example in type closure we have a
deviation into the type system so what
is an optional type system well optional
types allow us to swap back and forth at
will between these two worlds and kind
of as soon as we buy into this we we
have a few intrinsic restrictions one is
that the runtime cannot depend on the
output of type checking because if it
did then we we wouldn't be able to swap
if we swapped and then our program
wouldn't run anymore then that isn't
really my definition of an optional type
system and really in practice this is
like a linter if you've ever used
core.typed it's kind of like you write
some some untyped code you annotate it
and then you use this
specific function check NS to check it
like a linter and you can use this this
function in your unit tests or
continuous integration so type closure
is really the sum of closure the
language and an optional type system so
here's some examples of of type closure
so these two lines the first one isn't
as a Vienna tation and this is mitch you
can think of this as machine check
documentation in the same way you can
think of any type system as giving you
machine Jack documentation so there's an
expectation that the square function is
an intent we write some normal closure
code the second line is compiled
normally via the the closure compiler
and yet we verify its an intent so
closure programmers like to use
heterogeneous maps which is basically
like an immutable map which is which has
keyword values keyword keys map to known
values so here we have a function day
that kind of takes this this map that
has a day key and we take out the day
and just return it and type closure can
kind of follow this another interesting
thing about type closure is that it in
the same way that closure interacts
nicely with Java type closure also
interacts nicely with Java and in a
sense kind of enhances the the types
that Java gives you so we have non
nullable types for example you can see
here we have a union of Newland string
as the return type of this particular
function so that basically means that i
should clarify that nil is exactly
java's null there's nothing more to it
it's just another Nathan of but since we
have a null type that basically means
everything else is not nullable so what
this get parent function really means is
that it's passing in an instance of
java.io.file as in a non nullable
instance and returning a possible
possibly null instance of string and you
can see type closure actually is proving
that this particular code doesn't throw
a null pointer exception so
for example if you get parent on nil
it'll blow up spectacularly but type
pleasure prevents this sort of error and
if the input was not able it would
complain and also notice that we can't
claim that the return type of this is
not nullable because Java just the Java
type signature just doesn't allow for
that kind of fine-grained type so
closure program is like to use
conditional control flow to direct their
programs in particular directions and
usually it's type based so there's a lot
of information that a type system can
learn just by analyzing an if statement
for example here we have the safe
increment function which really just
takes a nullable integer and test if
it's a number if it is a number then we
increment it otherwise we do something
else and if this if statement wasn't
here type closure would complain and say
something like expected in got nil
basically saying that ink cannot take
and the null pointer and then I'll
reference sorry so let's combine some of
the things we've learned so far we have
unions and H maps well there's nothing
stopping us from combining these we have
this handy type alias mechanism here we
define a recursively defined type alias
that is basically a very small abstract
syntax tree representation we have a
conversa composite node which is a do
know that has several expressions inside
of it and that's the first line of the
Union and a leaf node value and you can
see you can distinguish between these
two things by the aapki so if you look
up the OP keen it's a do that it must
have an exposé if you look up the up
key and it's eval it must have a vowel
entry so the way the closure program is
usually dispatch on H maps of this kind
of type or just maps in general is with
a multi-method so rather than
elaborately explaining well no this will
be elaborate I let the elaboration begin
so we're going to pass it some abstract
syntax tree that I've created and you
the first thing you should think of when
you're writing a multi-method is what
you want to dispatch on and I said the
way to distinguish between the two
abstract syntax tree nodes is with the
aapki so the second radar is basically
where you write that information so we
dispatch on the aapki well what if it's
a do well we go to this def method and
what I'm actually tracing is the way
that typed closure reasons about this
control flow so type closure is actually
following this as well so it's a do node
so therefore the xmas key if we get it
out there must be a vector of
expressions therefore if we sum the
recursive calls of this of these
expressions then we can call map of f
over this vector of expressions and it
will all be well typed and we get 42
because it's 30 plus 12 okay so that was
kind of a recap of everything that I
presented last year but optional typing
is really all the rage right now the
last five or six years they've been
popping up all over the place for
example Facebook's hack is a optional
type system for PHP it allows you to mix
and match types and untyped PHP in the
same file or as in any way you please
javascript has many stories for optional
typing one is dart which kind of is an
optional type system for Java JavaScript
sorry but it's also really a language in
itself but flowing tide scripts really
do have the same syntax as JavaScript
except it adds annotations right and
typescripts its recently moving into
some pretty cool directions it's adding
Union types and intersection types and
this sort of flow control that I
demonstrated before with conditional
statements and finally my play is an
optional type system for Python which is
contributed back to Python bite by
inspiring it to add
particular syntax for optional type
optional type annotations so for example
the three JavaScript optional type
systems have different ways of
annotating things but if another
optional type system was made for Python
it would use the same syntax so type
closure in practice I presented a use
case last year Serpas the I so they in
2013 they started using type pleasure
and two years later they gave me access
to their to the type code and I gather
these metrics and they're very
interesting actually over a two-year
trial we there were 87 type namespaces
and the next three dub points kind of
justify all the features that i that i
just presented to you so there were 105
java interactions around 300 h maps or
heterogeneous maps and 11 multi methods
words 89 def methods in other words if i
type closure didn't support these things
but none of these things would type
check but kind of it's not that big of a
victory because if you look at this last
line only twenty percent of those 87
namespaces were were checked in other
words there were so many idioms that
weren't supported by type closure that
for one reason or another the circle see
I dad's decided to not type check
particular functions because it was just
taking too much effort excuse me so I'll
take questions the end thank you so yeah
about a month ago they very politely
emailed me and told me hey where're
we're thinking of not using type
pleasure anymore and I encourage them to
release a blog post post mortem and
luckily here it is it's a few days old I
recommend reading it it's very very
informative at the current state of type
closure I've actually worked on the
Circle C I codebase myself and I vouch
for everything that's that's written
here but in the interest of time I'm
going to distill the three main points
in the postmortem one is that oh my god
type checking is so slow and yeah I
apologize for the actually I don't want
to think about the hundreds of program
at Howard's I've wasted I'm very I'm
very sorry but I made a decision in 2012
that it's kind of annoying having a
rapel be in an inconsistent state at if
it's dealing with runtime values imagine
if your rap was in an inconsistent state
at the runtime but also at the compiled
at the static type system level right so
I was like okay let's let's completely
rule out that case by every time you
type check a namespace wipe the entire
slate clean transitively and check
everything two things one thing I have
had very very few complaints that typed
that core tight gets in inconsistent
states the other thing is that if you
have 86 namespaces they will all be
checked again so there's some middle
ground to be to be looked over all right
so I kind of alluded to this the second
problem this in complete support for
closure idioms and kind of attribute it
to the the fact that eighty percent of
that code was not type checked which is
which is bad and there's this third
point which I brought up last year i
have seen third-party annotations
floating around more than I had last
year so I kind of made a an appeal to
the good strange loopers in the audience
if they could release their type
annotations and some of them did but
unfortunately in circles the highest
case every single third-party annotation
they had was written by themselves so in
other words they had to reverse engineer
all of their dependencies and that sucks
but for this talk I'm just going to
concentrate on the second point this
this problem that we have eighty percent
of code that's unchecked and i'm
assuming us because the ink play support
for closure idioms so here's the pitch
there's this concept called gradual
typing and without much without many
changes to the
y to the way that you would type check
code right now you could check the
eighty percent that's left not at
compile time but at runtime then gradual
typing also incorporates kind of these
three ideas that you can check things at
compile time you can check things at
runtime and you can also sanely mediate
the the interaction between these two
worlds or types and untyped worlds so
what is gradual typing exactly well in a
sentence gradual typing forces all code
to respect static invariants and i will
show you an example right now so here's
a static statically typed square
function that we saw at the at the top
of the show there was it's an intent
function and if you notice on the on the
right there's a type sorry left I
practiced that no that was I did say
left in my practice so we have two
invitations and lo and behold they
return the same answer and this is this
is great if these return different
answers would be in trouble so it gets
interesting when we violate the static
assumptions so in in type code on the
left there's a static type error and it
actually tells you the the point where
it went wrong that's exactly right here
what happens on the untyped side well we
get this null pointer exception now if I
memory serves me correctly I've gone to
many conferences around the world and
fled like this and said type closure
prevents null pointer exceptions in type
code what is happening here well there's
a stack trace that's the null pointer
exception that ends in n type code so
this kind of reveals the way that we
speak about soundness results in an
optional typing we forget the rest of
the world exists we basically yeah so
gradual typing doesn't do that it it
embraces the world it allows you to
to talk to type code without this kind
of threat of null pointer exceptions and
bad things so the only difference for
this example this is gradual typing and
on the on the right here we have a an
untyped namespace that is managed by the
gradual type system hypothetical gradual
type system for them the type closure
provides and look it gives you a nice
error this is a runtime error and what's
actually happening is that the this kind
of gold ring around the untyped code
kind of signifiers this language
mediator that I was alluding to which I
will clarify but basically it in this
case we're hijacking the compilation of
the untyped code and this square nool
here and we are compiling it to
something that will guarantee that it
cannot violate the assumptions of the
typed code so here we were casting the
the in the argument to be an integer but
this is where it's going to fail so
before it yeah it's going to point
exactly to that nil and that that cast
was the the reason why so there's
another interesting feature of gradual
typing and it kind of answered this this
weird question that optional typing
provides is how much type code will have
to write before I can prevent null
pointer exceptions for example that does
it all need to be typed can it be some
of it on types well here's a scenario so
that the top namespace number one
depends on two and three which depends
on for so let's say we converted the top
12 type code so can this interact with
untyped code sure it's dependent on to
untyped things so we saw before that you
know this is a problem null pointer
exceptions will happen so okay well
let's let's let's make it typed okay can
this what happens here okay well we're
in the same situation and
god we've typed the world this this
isn't very sustainable but somewhat
vacuously typed invariance cannot be
violated because there are no there's no
untyped code to violate the typed
assumptions gradual typing has this
pretty cool feature where if we have the
same situation we have a language we can
kind of pick a point where we want to to
assert everything at run time instead of
arbitrarily picking how much untrusted
or trusted code that we have we instead
use the language boundary for the
namespaces two and three we actually
check at that point the interactions
between typed and untyped and the
interesting thing is here we're done
typed invariants cannot be violated
because there's no direct path from type
to untap that doesn't go through a
language boundary that's managed by the
the language mediator okay so I've been
saying this language mediator a lot
let's explain what that is so this is
cool a gradual type system for racket
called tight racket and here's kind of a
pictorial way of how it works so we have
we have racket on the right and type
racket on the left with this I think it
is green I'm sorry I'm so ever created
this racket logo I'm sorry I destroyed
it but a type racket needs a logo so
there were three parties here actually
this type racket racket and there's this
line actually the line is very important
it's it's yellow it's the the language
boundary that I've been talking about so
you take racket code for example there
you can if you are type record you could
say give me some untyped code so what's
going to happen the language boundary is
going to wrap it in runtime checks such
that the static invariants are upheld
so for example be the opposite direction
if type racket wanted to export code
well that also adds runtime checks
actually this direction isn't as
intuitive why do we need haven't we
already checked this green blob alright
isn't it type checks well once we go in
this direction it's more that we don't
want bad things getting in like we don't
want things that violate the invariants
getting in and the opposite we don't we
don't trust the thing that's in size we
want bad things getting out or unsound
things so infotype racket they've they
have some justifications for why they
use regular typing one of the main ones
is that they had this suite of unsafe
operations which segfault if you get it
wrong so if you if you rewrite your
programming you're not quite sure if if
a particular invariant will be violated
well you probably shouldn't use this
unsafe operation but it turns out if you
use this language mediator the Holy line
then all of these optimizations are safe
because once you once you go over this
way once you cross the type land you can
you can trust untyped code and once you
cross to untie planned you can you're
guaranteed that nothing bad can get in
and cause a segfault and this is other
notion of blame which is basically a way
to track error messages and you can
imagine it well if we can cross the
language battery once why don't or twice
why not do it three times and at some
point let's assume something something
bad happens and it blows up who's to
blame well there are these mechanisms
that come with the language mediator
that allow us to track exactly what the
source of the error instead of the
symptom as we saw before the source of
passing Mills Square was passing null to
square it wasn't passing notes and
multiplication so what if I done so what
have we done I actually use excuse me
what have we done in type closure so far
in in in the direction of gradual typing
well again here we were in 2014 we had
an optional type system and I've been we
have been working slowly towards gradual
typing in that we are integrating more
into the compiler and here are two
features that have been requested since
2012 and they're here so one
optimization that's kind of obvious is
that well we have this static type
checker why don't we use it to interact
with the other type system in closure
tie pins unfortunately previously you've
had to write both tie pins and static
types even though it's so obvious which
tie pins need to be a lot seems obvious
to someone who's not a type checker that
that that these particular type hints
are relevant in particular places but
also remember it was an optional type
system so the runtime cannot depend on
the the type checker so it's kind of
didn't really fit but now we're moving
towards gradual typing which is very
much more integrated in the compilation
process it actually makes sense and
there's also a types r apple which looks
like this basically what you do is you
add a little bit of metadata to your
type namespace this quarter typed
keyword and then you just use the ripple
and its type checks and you can see
you've got a you know an inferred type
for this type and if you keep a seal to
ink for example you get a static type
error and the the form is then not
evaluated so basically a normal types
rapel that should have been there a long
time ago but I think the reason why this
wasn't here is because n R apple won't
blame when I enter apple i'll say i
didn't know that n R apple existed but
if you want to use this download and
ripple or Lana gin and put in this
middleware and you can have this type r
apple as well so as part of this type r
apple not everyone uses the wrapper all
the time clearly we put code in files so
it would be nice if we actually just
require
to file and it would just type check it
so for example here we have a type name
space where we again being a dead horse
here don't pass nil to ink but if we
require this namespace we get a
nullpointerexception and that's
basically because we're not passing it
to the type checker but if we put in
that lonegan middleware and have a bit
of metadata the caught up typed it will
any any call to require will basically
feed every every form into the type
triple so i was talking before about
transitively read checking everything
well it turns out the way that this is
implemented fixes this automatically
because the way it's implanted is
basically at monkey patches closure dot
cord / load and basically programmers
use require to to load code and that
that subsequently calls load but it only
calls load if it's if it hasn't been
cashed before so since type checking has
been monkey passion to load then
whenever you if you have your editor
open and you press run it will only
check the transitive dependencies if it
hasn't been compiled yet so in other
words what you are expecting in the
first place but you know we'll see how
terrible having two levels of
inconsistent rappels are but I really do
like the the current the current way
that type closure uses it redefines
everything and i will definitely i think
this is a good default not having to
minute waits for one character changes
yeah and i'll live in the other one as
an option and we have this idea of type
hints as i said before we're actually
using static types to to inform the
closure compiler how to resolve type
hints and I'm just kind of showing off a
bit here you can see where
all right we're getting the parent of a
file but really it's it's a type any but
then type closure figures out that it's
an instance of file right so then it you
know it knows it's a it's a method
pretty trivial but I thought it was
Chronicle anyway so what's next we've
seen the type r apple automatic tight
pants it's kind of what the last six
months is has given us here are some
immediate problems with implementing
gradual typing so we have this idea of
proxying which i'll explain and how to
implement this holy yellow line in the
middle and both directions being just as
effective as one another so again we saw
the way that type racket uses the
language mediator is that wraps code in
something and that something is often a
proxy and a proxy allows you to
basically intercept if you were going to
proxy some sort of objects you might
want to intercept a method call for
example you might want it to only return
integers so the problem with writing
proxies enclosure is that almost
everything that we care about is
declared final so good luck subclassing
it cannot inherit from final class so
this was this is this is a problem and I
if you have any ideas please please let
me know i'd love to hear you from here
from you but here's a good reason why
you might want to use a proxy in a real
in real situation say we have this
protocol which is like an interface that
has a get x and get y and it's a it
describes the methods of a point then we
have a concrete implementation of a
point that implements this get get x and
get y methods and then we wanted to
create a proxy that intercepted the
these two methods right and you can
imagine this point class is coming from
untyped to type so we want to actually
verify that it's returning the correct
thing yeah and again it's the same error
I cannot inherit from final class how
did racket fix this well it turns out
people who write type racket also work
on the racket virtual machine so they
they change the record virtual machine
and added chaperones and impersonators
which are different variations on
proxies unfortunately this is what we're
stuck with two two big locks I may I
have a better chance of getting
unlocking closure but I have no
aspirations to really try JVM forget
about it and is this yellow line again
the language mediator this is kind of
the one of the next things we're going
to do is figure out the details of how
to implement this so for example we have
a typed namespace on the left and we're
importing some untyped code so you can
see the untyped code by its name you
might think it's an increment function
but really it just returns a string so
so who wrote this function it's terrible
but the naive types programmer says okay
it's an increment incrementing function
it must be an intent so we use it on the
next line we increment 41 okay well it
crosses language boundary now the we
have a contract or probably a proxy
around this this particular function
that checks there's an intent and
something bad is going to happen we're
going to blame something we could either
blame the the poor types programmer for
assuming that this ink function actually
does what what it seems to to advertise
or we could blame the untyped the
untyped code for having a bad
implementation okay so just to wrap up
this is where we were a year ago at
strange loop 2014 we had an optional
type system everything kind of worked
like a linter and from there over the
last six six or 12 months we've input
we've implanted a type r apple and
integrated this idea of using static
types to resolve type hints and
excuse me and the next few things we're
going to tackle are implementing the
language mediator the big yellow line
and how things go back and forth and in
this story with proxies again if you've
got good ideas of how to change a method
call to a final class please find me I
think that's impossible but the last
time I said that about the JVM someone
shouted out challenge accepted anyway so
this is the final goal gradual typing
for closure it'll probably have its own
set of trade-offs which are interesting
for a gradual type of gradual typing
people kind of the goals are that it's
intuitive to use for closure programmers
really so I just like to conclude by
thanking everyone who's here and also
thanking everyone who supported me over
the years with the crowdfunding I've
been doing its really I had a summer
over in Australia and it's one of the
reasons why I'm back here is the all
your support and it's great to be in the
States and thanks for listening</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
