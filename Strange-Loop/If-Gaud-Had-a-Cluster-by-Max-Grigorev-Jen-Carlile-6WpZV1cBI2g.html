came here today for our talk
if Gaudi had a cluster we feel honored
that the fantastic organizers of Strange
Loop
invited us to speak here today alongside
all these other great creative thinkers
in fact I'm kind of surprised there is
anyone in this room was there so all
this talks happening in the other ones I
would want to be there not here but like
that's me yeah thanks for coming and
last year but after we attended Strange
Loop
I couldn't stop talking about it for a
month it's a really special conference
and it's full of really amazing people
and I want to thank both the organizers
and everyone who is visiting this
conference it's great to talk to all of
you guys cool so we're here today to
talk architecture both software
architecture and building architecture
plus clusters and programming languages
and hopefully have a little fun in the
process so the premise of this talk is
what if Antony Gaudi the Spanish
architect whose work pretty much defines
the Barcelona cityscape what if he lived
a hundred years later than he did what
if he had access to you know the massive
amounts of computing power that we kind
of take for granted today so how would
his architectural practice which is you
know arguably some of the creative in
human history you know how would it have
changed but first you might be wondering
who those people and why do they care so
much about architecture my name is max
red Gaurav I am distribute systems
engineer and I used to build large
systems for Yahoo Google are being be
and then I joined flux to build the
tools we're gonna be discussing two here
today yeah so my name is Jenny Karl and
I'm a co-founder and engineering lead at
flux and flux as a start-up in San
Francisco and we're building an open
platform for the architecture
engineering and construction industry so
you know we're a mixture of software
engineers and designers and architects
and structural engineers and more and we
think that technology and the smart use
of data can really dramatically improve
how we design and build buildings and so
as part of the flux platform we've built
a graphical web based programming
language aimed at architects and
engineers and you know with this
based programming language it basically
offloads the heavy computation from a
user's machine and up into the cloud
where we can you know spin up resources
on demand so later we're gonna talk
about our approach to designing and
building this programming language you
know and what we learn from it kind of
the good the bad and the ugly and
everything in between but first we're
going to talk about a little bit about
gaudi the man and then we're gonna cover
a brief history of modeling in
architecture then we have a few demos to
kind of spark your imagination around
the question like what if gaudi had a
cluster and then we're going to switch
gears and talk about the language we
developed the system architecture our
approach kind of frameworks we chose and
why and what we learned in the process
so this is Antoni gaudí he was born in
1852 in a family of cop with nests in a
small town just 70 miles outside
Barcelona he he spent much of his early
years in the families comics workshop
and if as a coppersmith you constantly
have to think specially is the surface
of this Bank assistant throughout what
is the volume of the spot examining
things like that help him develop great
ability to think specially and
competitively other architects who were
mostly using 2d representations like
drawings his thinking was firmly rooted
in 3d space
yeah and for any of you who are curious
this is called an Alembic and this is
for distilling liquids and it's just one
example of you know something that gaudi
might have built in his family's
workshop right so go do I arrived in
Barcelona when he was just 17 four years
later he became an architecture student
graduating after six years of studying
he plays himself and gained a strong
reputation in Barcelona context a scene
in the early 80s he became an assistant
to an architect
Francis de paola Villar who was
commissioned to build la Sagrada família
well luck with the project in 80 83
after this agreement was a group
commissioning the church and
slowly but surely Gaudi took over the
project first he stayed true to their
regional plans but then he little by
little adding a little bit elements here
and here in there
he changed the project to be in his own
unique organic style yeah so Gaudi
worked on la Sagrada família for 43
years from 1883 until his death in 1926
so like just imagine that like you start
working on a project when you're 31 and
then for the next 43 years you devote
like your entire being to that project
you know every waking thought your
creativity your energy it's really
pretty remarkable towards the end of his
life Gaudi decided to decline all other
professional projects and he devoted
himself to creating plaster models and
sketches and drawings of Sagrada família
so that work could continue after his
death so he actually predicted that the
project would take about 200 years to
complete which I couldn't I think about
that my mind kind of explodes like we
train ourselves to think about like what
am I going to get done this week or this
month or this quarter
you know imagining a project that goes
on for 200 years is pretty mind-blowing
just for fun here's a picture of the
sagrada familia building site in
barcelona complete with goats I hear
goats are the new cats so this is
probably like circa early 1900s so
pretty different than the barcelona that
we know today um but before we move on I
want to sprinkle in a brief mathematical
interlude and talk to you about a
fascinating thing called catenary curves
so catenary curves are all around us
kind of like the dip of a power line
between towers like a necklace a
spider's thread or clothesline if I pick
up this chain this is actually I'm now
holding a catenary curve in my hand you
know and being in st. Louis we can't
forget about the Gateway Arch this is a
really beautiful example of an inverted
catenary arch so a catenary curve is you
can think of it as the average of pure
exponential growth and pure exponential
decay and can be represented with this
formula
here when the scalar a equals one you
get this you know nice very beautiful
kind of curve here in black the cool
thing about the catenary curves came to
demonstrate it was this chain when it
hangs the links settle in a position
where all the tension forces act
alongside the line of a this disart
right
when inverted the forces of tension
become the forces of compression and
those forces also act all inside the
line this makes it the perfect shape for
a free-standing arch because the forces
are so strong supporting it that you
don't need any outside support like
bracing your buttresses if you build a
cantinori arch out of the bricks the
forces are so great that you don't need
any mortar to hold it it's just gonna
hold itself under its own weight that's
pretty cool construction I think and we
bring it sub because Gaudi use Ken
generic curves all over all over his
projects specifically in Sagrada família
all the towers at canary can't continue
in shape before a Gaudi catenary arches
were used in like bridges but no one try
to use them in normal architecture so
and there is one other interesting if
kind of less common use of catenary
curves in the built environment so if
you actually build a set of catenary
humps you can write a square wheel
bicycle over here this is a
mathematician is named Stan waggon this
is the late 90s and so as long as the
side of the square is the same length as
the arc of the of the catenary hump you
can take this kind of ridiculous device
and you know propel yourself down the
road which is pretty fun so I want to
switch gears a little bit and talk a bit
about the use of models in architecture
both physical and digital so when you
think of building design you probably
think of you know like blueprints and
drawings and to other two-dimensional
representations but you know many
architects want something more something
more physical or spatial where you don't
have to use your imagination as much to
kind of get us
support a building will look like or
feel like when it's complete so and this
is when they turn to models physical
models physical models have been used
for hundreds of years and for you know
all sorts of different reasons and
architecture so a model might be used to
explain a complicated design or to you
know show the interaction of two volumes
it might be used to like get buy-in from
a client or just like explain a
complicated design idea so with models
and I'm sorry with architecture you know
you can think of it architecture is
really about creating spaces and when
you only have to tear Epperson tations
you really have to like use your
imagination to think of what that space
is going to feel like but if you use 3d
models it's a lot easier to get
everybody kind of on the same page and
imagining the same space right and the
past couple of decades the architecture
profession is turning more and more to
virtual models and of course they're
fast iterate easy to visualize and lower
ever have been physical ones some brief
people are even turning to virtual
reality to communicate their designs
now we're gonna share some particularly
interesting models with you guys so this
first one this is Eero Saarinen and this
is a model of the TWA terminal at JFK
Airport so it was commissioned by
Transworld airlines in 1955 and then
opened its doors in 1962 and it's
actually part of JetBlue's JFK
operations so if we have any like New
Yorkers in the audience you might have
actually been to this terminal so um the
exterior of the building is this
concrete roof that's meant to like
emulate a gigantic bird in flight and
the inside is really beautiful you have
this kind of continuous ribbon where the
the ceiling kind of flows into the walls
and those walls flow into the floors and
Saarinen use models to answer all sorts
of questions he mostly built his models
out of things like cardboard and wire
and a little bit of wood but he used
them to answer questions like how should
the roof be shaped or how are people
going to circulate within this space or
just like what's it gonna feel like
inside
through this picture and just for fun
he's like really diving into his model
love it justify it fun side note if we
have any like furniture geeks in the
audience you might know Saarinen for his
mid-century modern furniture design so
he's known he's the creator of kind of
the ubiquitous tulip table and tulip
chairs and one of my favorites here the
Blum chair it's like great for hours of
napping rate typically physical models
are made of things like cardboard
plaster wood wire but sometimes more
ephemeral more transient materials I
used so this is an example of Frei Otto
a German architect he was active after
the Second World War and during that
time there was a lack of construction
materials around Europe and he used
properties of soap bubble to generate
the enclosures with the maximum volume
and minimum surface space so he he would
actually use the properties of a bubble
itself to kind of compute I guess the
shape of the building yeah
and shiftings is somebody more
contemporary I'm guessing most of you
have heard of Frank Gehry maybe raise
your hand if you've heard of him he's
pretty famous like starchitect yeah so
he has a really interesting practice
that marries the physical and the
digital so he actually iterates his
designs using physical models like this
one and then when he's satisfied he uses
this device called a Faro
arm which is basically a portable
measurement arm so with this you can
basically reverse-engineer a physical
model and create a digital
representation from it so once he's you
know they've created a digital
representation other folks in the
building trade will work off that so
like structural engineers and mechanical
engineers and he has a pretty unusual
practice like max mentioned before most
people start with digital because it's
like a lot easier to make changes and a
lot faster to iterate but you know we're
not going to tell Frank Gehry how to do
his job and of course we cannot forget
about Gaudi
his modeling process from more than a
hundred years ago we still
pretty awe-inspiring and amazing of
course he used the wood and the wire and
the plaster and all of those materials
but the most famous of his models is
actually the chain model of la Sagrada
família he would take the links of chain
hand him from the ceiling and then add a
little bags filled with like teeny LED
weights in them which would control the
shape of those catenary curves that we
know off that that's pretty
mind-boggling right I mean just think
about this process you're like hanging
chain after chain from the ceiling you
want to change it a little bit you have
to like remove a few links from the
chain or you take a few weights out of a
bag that you've tied there it's just
like very painstaking and time-consuming
and you know this this model here is
actually what kind of inspired us and
led us to the question like so what if
gaudi had a cluster so for fun a few of
us at flux built an app on the flux
platform to explore this question so the
first question we asked was like what if
gaudi could build a parameterised model
of sagrada família and explore you know
a hundred or a thousand design
iterations in the time it would take him
to do one using his manual processes so
we're gonna start a video here so what
you're gonna see is a parameterised
model of sagrada família as you can see
what we're starting with and we can
change things like the number of bell
towers change it from three to four and
then in just a couple of seconds we get
our new model we can change the
dimensions at the floor plate we can
kind of stretch it out a little bit and
there we go in another couple seconds we
can do things like change the height of
the main tower you zoom out to see the
results and then you know our old friend
the catenary we can change the a scalar
parameter to change the shape of the
curve no this is a lot easier than like
changing you know taking chain links out
you can also do things like change the
height so like you know every single one
of those iterations was like a couple of
seconds and you know you can just
imagine how much time that would have
in him back when he was building his
physical models so another area that
piqued our imaginations is biomimicry so
biomimicry is when we imitate nature to
solve kind of complex human problems
so Gaudi was a deep lover of nature
particularly naturally occurring
geometric forms and you know if you look
at his buildings they just like scream
organic at you and if you look closely
you can see how he applied kind of
naturally-occurring motifs to his design
so one example is on some of the columns
in the external facade the base of them
are what's called it's kind of a
mouthful I sometimes mess it up called
hyperbolic paraboloids
and it's actually the same shape that
you find at the base of this is a cap
octree here so also just kind of fun
fact if you take the webbing between
your thumb and your forefinger this is
also a hyperbolic paraboloid so I think
this quote kind of sums up his attitude
pretty well you know Gaudi was a deeply
religious man and he found nature to be
very spiritual so besides studying trees
he studied things like crystals and like
falling seed pods and cereal grains like
wheat and native grasses when he was
designing Sagrada família so we wanted
to add this into our demo or demo as
well so in this application you do it
okay so in in this video we're looking
at the ornamentation on the top of the
bell towers and we start with a crystal
form but you can very easily change out
to a different motif so now it's stalks
of wheat at the top and then you can
change it and now it's Nautilus shells
as ornamentation and now we can change
it in to a tuft of grass and besides
changing motif so you can actually
change the parameters so we can make it
less compact so it kind of bows out or
we can make it much larger you know or
we can make it more dense so we're going
to add more blades of grass I think you
know I can kind of look at the results
and pretty fun and then finally we asked
ourselves you know with his deep
interest in kind of organic form and
nature would Gaudi have been fascinated
with the idea of genetic algorithms so
what if you let you know a thousand
generations of Sagrada família is kind
of grow and mutate and swamp DNA like
what if you let them evolve so we built
that in this interface you can launch a
genetic algorithm and it launches a
thousand generations each generation has
50 candidates in it so we're generating
50,000 different churches basically and
then we run each each model through a
fitness function and then whatever model
has the highest score of that fitness
function we deem it the winner
so you can check out what we're starting
with and then we can launch the
algorithm and it's all running in the
browser and we get our our best
candidate out of the 50,000 we can load
it and check it out what it looks like
it doesn't look too different let's run
it again this time we've got one with
just four bell towers and load it see
how it looks
yeah cool
so we had a lot of fun building these
demos I hope they kind of spark your
imagination around the question you know
what if dowdy had a cluster yeah
so imagine Gaudi now has his cluster and
now he has to tell it what to do so he
needs a programming language but what
kind of language would do you want ask
oh of course maybe you go like Perl all
right
let's be serious here for a second we
are not gonna tell you we'll give you a
huge lecture and how to design a
programming language that a lot of
people are doing that Harry a lot of
people can do that here and we don't
even have enough facial hair and math to
us to to do that what we can do instead
is pandered to our imaginary client mr.
gowdey yeah so first of all Gaudi was a
very you know visual thinker so we think
he'd prefer visual tools over something
text-based you know architectures full
of sketches and models you know formulas
and text too but you know we think that
something visual is preferable to
something symbolic second we think that
the language and environment must have
you know means for easy reuse like the
same way a software engineer doesn't
want to like write basic data structures
and sorting algorithms every time she
like writes code now she doesn't want to
start from scratch every time he begins
a new project and you know if you had a
good over idea over here you might want
to reuse it over here or if he was
inspired by the work of you know some of
his contemporaries maybe he'd want to
take that idea kind of remix it and then
use it in one of his projects so you
know we think the language would need to
have some element of reusable components
and of course there is performance
imagine the smooth running of High
Definition high frame rate video and
watching it you'll be taking out of your
chair into the middle of the action you
would get into that famous tail flow and
then imagine the video start stirring
the framerate drops you'd be yanked out
of the state right away right so
architects when they're working they
really want to stay in that flow state
all the time
right mr. gowdy does not want to take a
break and go for a walk whenever he
changes a parameter on his model now
that walks are not great they're really
good for you should all take them but
anyway they're architects and mr. Cody
specifically want their moles to be
really responsive CPUs are amazingly
fast these days and GPUs are enormously
powerful right but it turns out that
even by today's standards the
architectural problems are still pretty
hefty as an example a normal skyscraper
project might have 10,000 or even more
facade panels just just for the facade
right like a facade and then each one of
them is an individual entity that you
have model ru model independently right
so has the language has to be in handli
parallelizable what we mean by that is
that the user who's using the language
does not have to think about concurrency
and all that stuff while he's making his
program work right mr. Gogi is not a
distributed systems programmer and he
doesn't want to thank and spend his
weekend thinking about the Byzantine
fault tolerance or version of
civilization protocols and another thing
not really a programming language
specific but more of a development
environment requirement architects to
repeat ourselves are very visual people
and they want an output of the program
not also not to be a text but to be some
graphics from some kind of geometry
hopefully in 3d and not just the output
of a program but
the debugger put your printer's if you
will should be that so it should be
really really just like it's easy to
print something out of your script it
should be as easy in our environment to
generate the output in 3d yeah so you
know what fits the bill what's a
language paradigm that's visual
component eyes the bowl reusable
parallelizable you know we thought long
and hard about this when we started
designing this language and we actually
came to the conclusion that flow based
programming is actually a pretty good
choice
so flow based programming for those of
you who are not familiar with it in flow
based programming an application is
designed as they or it's represented as
a directed graph so each node in the
graph is a unit of computation you can
think of it as like a little black box
it's actually a literal black box here
and then the edges in the graph
represent data flowing between those
units of logic a block can be really
simple it can be a primitive that just
you know adds two numbers or it can be
something complex like a complete
graphic on all here's one example of a
really simple flow that takes two
numbers and sums them and then takes a
third number and multiplies the result
of the sum by that to get nine in this
example and then here's a more complex
example where we take a solid volume and
then we just slice it at regular
intervals another thing that's kind of
cool about SLO based programming is it's
really easy to kind of inspect your
application logic and kind of get a big
picture view of what's going on so
people tend to cluster related logic
together so there's like a cluster here
in red a cluster here in green you know
in a cluster here in blue so you can get
an easy sense of what's going on and
then also something that's really
important is parallelization is
basically inherent with this model so
you can think of each block as a remote
process and then you can think of each
edge as an RPC call and so this
obviously isn't like the standard way to
program can
but it actually has a pretty long
history and a pretty loyal following so
people started experimenting with flow
based programming in the mid-60s and
architecture particularly generative
building design is kind of part of that
loyal following if you go into an
architecture firm it's much more typical
to find people who are proficient with
graphical programming than like writing
like Python or C sharp or anything like
that now we're going to talk a little
bit about our approach to designing flex
yeah so when we started out we
identified four principles that guided
our development so the first principle
was we wanted the language to be
visually clean so there's nothing in the
way just the necessary blocks and
connections all the blocks have the same
kind of equal visual weight and we found
that this kind of reduces noise and
mental overhead and allows you to kind
of understand what's going on more
easily also you notice there's no like
proliferation of buttons and toolbars in
architectural software like AutoCAD and
Revit this is a really bad problem like
you get these toolbars that it's like
button bonanza they have like 60 buttons
on them and it's just not the nicest
rate and second of all we wanted the
environment to be modern and seamlessly
collaborative there may be hundreds of
people collaborating on a large
buildings at nowadays and believe me or
not but the current state of art is
FedExing each other flat drives so we
decided to improve on that a little bit
the other point is we wanted to spare
our users hours of fogging with the IT
guys so instead we run the entire front
end in a browser without any
installation needed and the back end is
running on our clusters of powerful
servers our third principle was this
idea of smart abstractions so we didn't
want to build a language that was too
low-level you know smart abstractions
kind of allow users to get started
solving their problems very quickly and
easily so with flux we built a standard
library that people can use and it you
know has operations related to you know
mathematical operations and flow control
and graphics and you know it's a very
carefully curated set that we you know
were curating for kind of completeness
and orthogonality and it's extensible
when this standard library doesn't cut
it
users can implement new blocks or modify
old blocks using JavaScript and so once
we had our guiding principles we started
actually building the language in the
authoring environment so this is a
picture of the authoring environment our
flow based authoring environment if you
kind of squint it looks like a cross
between a spreadsheet and an infinite
canvas the horizontal rows are called
streams and they're meant to help a user
kind of organize their logic at a macro
level so in graphical programming like
the rat's nest is a really common
problem I can imagine this is your
program note I'm talking about spaghetti
code yeah like literally looks like
spaghetti you like kind of hungry you're
looking at it so that's why we
introduced this idea of streams to help
people organize their their logic and so
just a quick example if you had a
project you could have a stream that was
had one stream about structural design
and one about building your building
facade and one about energy analysis so
you know a lot nicer than that big old
rat's nest that we just saw okay so now
we're going to talk a little bit about
the technology or the architecture that
is behind this so I'm going to talk a
little bit about the front end and then
I'll turn it over to max and he's going
to talk about the back end so as you can
see this is a pretty complicated front
end and so when we started building it
back in 2014 we evaluated angular and
react and polymer and ultimately ended
up going with polymer which is Google's
web component polyfill library we were
really drawn to the idea of web
components because you know they're
modular and reusable and composable and
the idea of shadow Dom like really
piqued my interest like the fact that
you can have encapsulated CSS and
JavaScript and HTML and it doesn't leak
all over your document
was really intriguing you know in
retrospect one takeaway I have is I wish
we would have looked or thought a little
bit more carefully about one of Palmer's
mantras the mantra is everything is an
element and like I mean everything so
even our non visual components like data
models or the element that we use to
track you know user actions and you know
get metrics from it these are all
elements and so this led to just like
massive Dom bloat for small flows this
wasn't a problem but for anything kind
of substantial we would have liked over
20,000 30,000 Dom nodes and it just led
to pretty bad performance problems so as
an example just this one component this
one block that takes into numbers and
adds them just had on the order of like
40 Dom nodes and a flow like this that's
fairly complicated this would take like
an embarrassingly long time to load like
over a minute and this when we realized
Dom bloat was such a performance problem
we it caused us to kind of back off on
our use of polymer and move towards just
like more vanilla JavaScript so the main
thing we did was take everything that
was non visual and then we converted
them into pure JavaScript components and
then we did this kind of ugly but this
hack where we have to require Jas to
work with HTML imports and these are
like apples and oranges so it wasn't
pretty but it did work thankfully and it
helped with some of our performance
problems my other big takeaway was you
know sometimes it's not a bad idea to
like choose boring technology like I
love this article by Dan McKinley if you
guys haven't read it like I highly
recommend it
you know my natural tendency is to like
use the bleeding edge thing or like the
most shiny thing and that often is not a
good idea if you're trying to ship a
product so I'm gonna turn it over to max
now and he's going to talk about that
great so the backend of flux is a
distributed system written and go in C++
you can think of it kind of like a
compiler and a distributed virtual
machine at the same time the most
important components are
the flow is a cushioned engine over here
the big blue one then the value store
and decide the coast or under it and the
block worker pull over here so what
happens when the program comes into the
system is its analyzed by the flow execu
ssin engine
it basically compiles it and of like you
know internal representation then it
figures out which blocks have stale
State and schedules they concrete block
execution on the concrete block workers
out of the pool the pool is kind of
large we run it and a bunch of servers
and there is a block worker like work
worker pull on each server and those are
pretty simple servers themselves they're
written in go and internally they
contain the v8 the JavaScript virtual
engine virtual machine built by Google
for the Chrome browser and later open
sourced so the blocks are on the block
workers again and they read the inputs
from the valley store and they write the
outputs to the value store to the coast
or contains the VIN type program code
and the individual block code an
interesting abstraction we implemented
while working on this is something we
call the remote pointers
those are act kind of like the C++ or C
pointers you know and like but was a
twist that the values themselves can be
on a remote machine not even memory but
also on disk whenever you do reference
the pointer like that it might invoke a
network fetch operation the reason we
did this was to our scale flow execution
engine to we larger programs and to we
larger number of programs than it can
run concurrently the entire system is
very concurrent and the benefit of it
was always that also that we could get
some of the performance back because
some of the outputs of the blocks can be
very large and being smart about where
we keep them instead of fetching them
all over the system brought a lot of
improvement
we also had our fair share of learnings
while being the system one of them the
big one was that when you're building it
tightly connected distributed system
utilization and RPC overhead starts to
matter a lot so we got a lot of benefit
from switching from Jason over HTTP to a
more modern and more performant stack of
civilization and RPC libraries right so
you might be wondering like why did we
build all of this well to bring guca
texture models into Minecraft obviously
yeah but thrilled though there is
actually a very like real-world scale
problem here you know the urban
population is growing cities are
becoming more dense the land in cities
is becoming more scarce and more
expensive you know I was reading this
article from the UN Population division
and it was saying that the it predicted
that the urban population is going to
grow by an additional 3.3 billion people
by 2050 which is roughly double what our
current urban population is today not
the world population but the urban
population so if you do the math on this
if we want to house 3.3 billion people
we can compute how many buildings we
need to build so if we assume that we
can house 250 people per building it
means that in the next 34 years we need
to build 13.2 million buildings which is
like that's a lot of buildings and if
you take it one step further we can
compute how many buildings we need to
build each day every day for the next
thirty four years and we get this kind
of mind-blowing number of 1063 so every
day we need to be building a thousand
buildings and our current building
process processes and practices are just
too slow and too you know resource
intensive for us to keep up right and it
is staggering scale like that think
about the improvements that are even a
minor optimization in the use of
Jules can bring like how much more or
brakes can you save with that right or
even after a building has been built a
minor adjustment in a direction it faces
can result in the sense of a percent of
like energy savings for that building
imagine that doing it happening at scale
right now those optimizations are only
possible for the largest projects we
want to scale them to everyone so I mean
these are like massive problems it's
kind of a lot of gloom and doom but you
know at our core like we are optimists
and we think that even though these
problems are hard they can be solved you
know computers and technology is already
helping people you know helping humanity
do things like your cancer and mine
asteroids and so we think it's time for
you know building design to kind of lend
itself to the optimizations that are
there to be had and then you know beyond
that we basically want to empower the
modern gaudi's kind of the architects of
today to kind of explore the deepest
reaches of their imagination so that's
it thank you so much for coming to our
talk I think we have a few minutes for
questions thank you
in the back yeah yeah so this one this
is just
I'd call it a prototype right now so we
built part of our platform we have an
SDK so I built we built this using our
SDK and built the genetic algorithm kind
of on top of that but actually genetic
algorithms they seem to really capture
the imagination of the architecture
industry and of all sorts of kind of
generative algorithms you know genetic
algorithms seem to be like one of the
favorites so I expect us to build it in
at some point oh yeah Fitness function
is pretty pretty it's all based on the
golden ratio so it's a pretty simple
fitness function it takes the floor
plate wings so like the the X and the y
and it tries to optimize for the golden
ratio and then it takes the height of
the bell towers and the main tower and
tries to get to the golden ratio if I
were to extend it and make it better I
would also add in kind of a kind of
material cost so if like you know it's
if you want to build super tall towers
it's going to affect the fitness
function in a negative way as opposed to
shorter towers and actually we consulted
an engineer who works with little worth
on projects like that before and golden
ratio was the first thing that came out
of his mouth that's actually how
architects do this
um you know to be honest we built this
during a hackathon no we have not
thought about it but yeah overall
absolutely if you can formalize an
actual function like you know if it's
like smooth over over the surface of the
optimization whatnot you can absolutely
do analytic optimization on it or like
numerical optimization me back in the
purple
so the question was the question was
whether director grab some particular
shapes and we find patterns and how
people build those programs yeah not too
much I mean the thing that you tend to
see is people really do like cluster
their logic that have to do with a
certain topic so you just you'll see
clusters but like the shape of those
clusters haven't seen a ton of
commonality between them I feel like
it's very user dependent like think
about coders when they write the code
they have their own it just increases
about how they structure the code same
here people have an idea how it should
look like and they follow that idea
usually
I couldn't catch so your question is
could we provide like a set of tools to
help people like organize that
oh no I hadn't thought about that that's
a cool idea yeah yes question is whether
we do have a Minecraft interface
funnily enough yes it was built during
the same hackathon I don't think it's
published yet but there is an engineer
who's really really excited about it and
he doesn't want to let it go it's being
evidence it's kind of a cool thought you
could like take a real building model
that you have in like AutoCAD or Revit
or one of these like real design tools
and like boom we've got it in Minecraft
yeah do you know yeah I was thinking of
the Legoland yeah
any other questions last night the
question is whether we have an ability
to produce other models so side effect
of texture so I guess what yeah it's
kind of a complicated question and so
part of our platform we have a set of
basically you can think of fluxes like
this central hub and then we have a
bunch of plugins for other pieces of
software that translate your model
that's expressed in flux - you know
however a model needs to be expressed
and say like AutoCAD or grasshopper so
these are all built we have two SDKs and
all of our plugins are built with that
and they're open-source so somebody if
they wanted to take a model that was in
flux and then express it in some other
program they could build their own
basically build their own translator I'm
not sure that
right we're tall to finish up here so
we'll just hang around outside for you
guys if we only had anyone has any other
questions thank you guys for coming
thanks for the questions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
