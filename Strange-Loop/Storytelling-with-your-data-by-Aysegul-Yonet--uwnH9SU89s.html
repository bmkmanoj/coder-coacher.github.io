is my first time in strange loop it's
very exciting and um so I work at
Autodesk 360 cloud platform and as a
senior software engineer and I am a
google developer expert in angular and
i'm here today to talk to you about a
little bit of data visualization a
little bit of the tools that we are
using um before I start talking talking
about the tools I wanted to tell you a
little bit about the other organizations
that I work with because Alex Miller
strongly encouraged me to do that and
that doesn't happen very often so thank
you for the night I've been I hosted
women who code meet up in San Francisco
for JavaScript for 22 years and I've
been teaching for girl develop it and
preparing curriculum and it's open
source free out there and anyone can
take it and use it anywhere that you
like it's teaching material or teach
with black girls code they have amazing
hackathons and also the last mile which
is the program in prison in San Quentin
prison in California we've been teaching
there more than a year now and I'm just
one of the mentors and i have with the
curriculum as well and it's a very very
interesting program if you are
interested there's a 10 minute
documentary about it too and it's been
an amazing experience to do that because
it's the totally different thing to be
able to code in a place that there's no
internet and lastly I've been the city
of any cannons for the lot for more than
a year last year and so any cannons we
teach you in trafficking survivors hafta
code I was inspired by the last mile and
our success there and it's been great we
had a lot of challenges but we have
great students
so that's about the organizations that I
work with but if you have any questions
later on find me I'd love to talk about
it so why do I want to talk to you about
storytelling with your data because
that's the problem that I've been trying
to solve at work recently I mean lately
so at Autodesk if you're familiar we do
a lot of treaty programs and the one of
the product that I'm working on is the
treaty beaver it's such an amazing tool
I was so you know inspiring our side you
can move around 3d things you can pull
them apart and you have a walking
ability you can just walk in it this is
such an awesome tall and really
encourages people to work together being
able to you know work from a distance
especially like the architects and
manufacturing designers but soon enough
we realize that just being able to have
access to the data is not the whole
thing we are able to just display any
kind of model and most of the models are
so much more complex than golden gate
bridge and when you see it most the time
people are very confused they don't know
what to do you build all these amazing
tools but then it's really hard to use
so we have to be were basically not open
source but it's an open API so anyone
can take it and put it on their own
website and people did and they did
really cool stuff with it so this is one
of them they just um took it it's a
building and they just gave so much more
information than the data right it has
to load so what does
is doing is that the green things that
you see there is are the sensors so they
are able to measure all the
inefficiencies of the heat and or maybe
gasps I know what they're measuring
exactly and they can monitor it at all
time and another really cool one that I
found totally nuts our product and
someone in the open source that is
actually made an animation with it so
we've in there right will be read the
documentation for idea everyone did that
and then it's really confusing you don't
know and the pictures never look like
what it is but this is a great use of
the treaty environment I think and its
really telling us where to look for I
mean if you just send you this model I
would never know where to find those
little stuff yeah I think I can assemble
that so these are the things that we've
been working on and struggling with a
lot and I think this is a problem with
everybody we have a lot of data we don't
know what to do there's just like
overexposure to some data but it's
really hard to understand and just
giving access to someone to the data is
not the whole picture so these are the
examples on the slides and if you want
to take a look and also the forge
orascom is the platform you can go and
check out the api's yourself and photo
tools at editors at least we use a tree
chests obviously angular JS d tree and
our xjs and
many more actually has anyone used
angular two point oh yes hey you're
teaching you Dinah so if you don't know
it came out it's out of beta now it came
out wednesday and i'm super excited to
be the first one to talk about hopefully
so you can check out the new version and
the new websites here and it's a really
amazing tool it's been two years and
thousands of commits on me this is just
the angular website I mean angular repo
there's so much more and everything is
organized into smaller modules now and
it's so much easier to wrap your head
around the different parts of your
application I think and the speed and
performance are improved vastly now you
don't have to ship the compiler to your
clients anymore you can just do the
compiling and do the things that angular
needs to do in the back end and then
send compiled version of its which is
the sixty percent of the angular code
and there's a lot of really cool
toolings that helps us to use it angular
CLI is one of them it's kind of magical
our xjs is I think it was built by
Microsoft first but now some people
Netflix are working on it and said these
are all open source obviously it's an
amazing tool I was so sad when I first
heard about it I why didn't I know about
this anyone used it before yeah very few
it's really really cool but it's also a
little mind blowing at first so what it
is is that instead of our promises it
allows us to work with observables in a
very efficient way and we have the colon
Wiser's and tight script and many more
tools and material design is an alpha
but it's looking really good so far
the other two and that recently changes
d3 so it went to a huge change as well
if you how many people use tea tree whew
yeah it's an amazing library truly
amazing it's a stands for data-driven
documents it allows you to work with
your data and make Dom manipulations
very easily but it's also a very
flexible tool which means that it's
complicated to work with sometimes so it
has a new version as well version four
after a whole year Mike Bostock said
it's ready now it's also organized into
smaller modules so people can just take
parts of it and don't have to have all
of the library if you are not using
everything so which makes it even better
to mix and match different libraries
because you don't have to worry that
you're using this or that it has a lot
of cool functionality than a very very
long changelog I strongly recommended
reading it up and it has an amazing open
source community on the website you can
see all of the examples and take it and
people constantly post it and there was
a conference that there's a conference
coming up for d3d tree uncomf and they
don't allow you to apply for the
conference if you don't submit a code
there so they encourage sharing so all
of these things are changing very
rapidly so how do we migrate from one to
another and there's just too many things
to migrate from and we wish it was this
easy you just change the scripts and
then everything works but obviously it's
not the case but the good news is that
there are lots of helpers t3 is the
changes are not that difficult to handle
let's say you need to change the some of
the functionality but the way
write your code is basically the same
that is not the case for angular it is
very different but what they have been
trying to do is trying to change the
style of it a little bit to make it
easier for people to make the switch and
they're also building the enna and
upgrade tool so those of you haven't
seen it for d3 so it allows us to make
some selections they are on the DOM and
attached some data to it it's just like
jQuery but with the data added to be
dancing and you can now you can do a lot
of things like whatever you want with
that data points at the Dom using that
data so in this case you're selecting
some paragraphs and appending some array
and we are using that arrays elements to
create our HTML for those of you who
work with it and I actually haven't met
anyone who really worked with tea tree
and hasn't had a moment of saying like
what just happened and it usually is
about our selections and there's a lot
of emphasis on it because there's this
really a kind of confusing function call
enter and append and then exit and
remove and every time you enter in
depends you are changing your selection
and you're working on a totally
different selection it was that was the
case but now you are actually getting a
copy of it I do
so as I mentioned the way we work hasn't
changed that much so we still have to
any time we have new data points we have
to make a selection appended data to it
and then append all of our Dom elements
with those data points to our stage and
when we need to remove it we have to do
exit and remove but there's an addition
to it so which is the merge function
which we did not have before which
allows us to merge the one that has to
leave and the ones that are coming in
which is really useful I mean if you're
doing real-time data or any kind of data
that is important that you show the
difference it's a really cool thing to
do have so I don't know if you could see
it but so I have the basic you know the
HTML added with my data but I have two
different data points theta 1 and a 2 2
arrays so I'm rendering the first one
and then rendering the second one I
don't know if you could see it but now
the ones that are leaving has a
different color than the ones that has
to stay which has new new data points
attached to it and we are merging them
together to be able to see it at the
same time jeje comes with really cool
transitions and it's even easier now to
work with them basically it's defined
for us and we have a nice function and
then there's a lot of ways of doing
different easy which is really nice
if you are you want to use few things
from d tree but you don't want to get to
get into all of the svgs and deep dive
into data visualization one thing that
you can definitely use these skills that
you can not really find in any other leg
in other library what skills does is
that a takes your data point and then
scale is it to the environment that you
are trying to display basically to your
screen so usually your screen is not
this big but it is taking everything as
a range all of your data well this is
not you later I'm sorry the range is the
your display size and then you also have
to give it the domain which is the range
of your data points and then it gives
you back a function that calculates any
time you give a data that calculates the
matching point on your screen
okay this is not super useful for
printing but it's very useful for acids
and other stuff and axes was a little
bit more complicated before now it's so
much easy easier with a d3 version 4 so
we can just divide our process into
building our SVG populating our data and
then drove in our axes over and over so
we do this inside the render function
most the time because most of time you
will need to change your data points and
then redo the rendering also you can
take advantage of the animation request
fine so here's an example you can change
the data and the arm skills are changing
and axes are being rerender each time we
click
so why are we using angular and III
together has anyone use angular ng two
together we should be friends um I
really like it I think there are few
talks here to about react and III it is
a really great idea to put d three
functions into a component because III
is not really easy to do you have to
basically define everything from your
skills where everything has to look so
it's not like a premade library I mean
plug-and-play thing so you have to
create the same things over and over so
it's a really great idea to be able to
put them inside different components
with angular or react or anything else
and so that you can reuse them you can
just pass them some data it could be a
bar chart could be a scattered water and
you don't have to write it over and over
so that's why I do like using angular 2
while angular 1 was actually doing
exactly the same thing with the
directives but it was a little bit more
confusing I realize we also have ng
modules which allows us to put together
our components and services in all of
the functionality that goes with it into
single modules this is her i was really
excited by it there was some you know
people were not very happy when they
said we will have modules for some
reason there was a huge discussion right
but I think it really makes it easy to
you know move code share code and
basically make your own libraries and
typescript has been very useful because
d3m is very picky maybe I mean when
you're drawing a line with a lot of data
points all of your data points has to be
number you know whatever you need it to
be but if any data point is missing if
you have one issue
just one data point your whole graph
won't render and typescript is really
cool because you have a chance to check
if the if what you're giving to your
graph is the right thing so to get
started with angular tube and you Leslie
ally is a really great tool I mean there
are lots of other options out there
there's a starter project but this is
really really awesome so you just have
to implement stole it globally and then
you can just say ingenue my app create a
new app and then you can run a server it
will npm install everything for you and
build it and so this is the basic
structure off the app and out of the
angular CLI i have few additions here by
so we have a distribution function a
folder that's a CLI created some dev
assets for us and you can build for
production as well everything is ready
for you and we have everything loaded
for us and angular CLI has its own json
file that you could make some
adjustments and make it your own
basically once you do that on your app
you have this one main module this is
where your application starts so it's a
very tree structure thing you have only
one component that is your route
components and once you initiate that it
knows what else to render it knows its
child components and then the child
components know its child components so
I think it's a really cool system it
also allows you to do a lot of lazy
loading very easily so you can define a
totally different routes totally
different part of your apt as separately
and then included and it will make it
easy to work on
so here is our appt module whenever I
create a new components or service
automatically CLI is adding it to my app
component this might not be the behavior
that you want sometimes but it's very
useful for now so we have the six
imports modules these are the main
angular modules at the beginning and
then I have some material and I have my
own components so if we look at the
module structure we have some
declarations these are the components
that we are going to be using we have
some imports all of the modules that
this app will need and we have some
providers which are the services which
will be the common functionality
throughout our app so any kind of
service that you insert on the root
level will be available to you any in
any part of your application
and then our main component is the app
components and I do have things going on
in here so one thing that I want to show
you what the animations animation is a
very new tool in angular and they have
been making it very of working on making
it very flexible it looks like a lot of
code this is my animation on the right
side that's being defined so I have a
trigger so I predefined it so i can take
this trigger into any kind of component
and reuse it that's why i put it inside
a separate folder and you define the
basic transitions let's say I actually
wanted to make always want to make it
slides animation like the revealed yes
so i think i'm going to do that with
this we have a state that we are
defining so when anytime the in-state
happens for that components these stars
will happen we have some transitions and
then we have some keyframe animation
capabilities as well
so if I mean you all you are going to do
is a bar chart I think d3 is a overkill
except the scales if it's a horizontal
bar chart that makes it a little easy
but if you have this capability in your
application already some animations and
then you can basically use dibs to
create the same or SVG as well so let's
take a look what this does so inside my
app component um I have some data
service that is getting the affection to
data for me and it's using the arc
straizo observables for HTTP so we
defined observables and where we are
going to make the call inside my service
but before I subscribe it it's not being
cold anywhere so there's something to
keep in mind and the cool thing about
observables is also that that if I I'm
not in this component anymore it's not
in my view and if there is some calls
that I'm still waiting for to happen it
they will all die down the unsubscribe
so I'm getting this data and then I am
giving that data to my child component
so basically app component is one of my
main components so I'm trying to keep
all of my data inside kind of like the
smart components like the top level
components so the child components don't
have to know anything about the
structure of my app and they can take
any kind of data from any kind of any
kind of backhands and they can be reused
so this is this was a huge problem that
we face in our previous product there
was a lot of people working on it and
then we were trying to be used some
parts of it and it was a true math
because we were constantly changing the
data to match the structure of the
components and that's definitely not the
way to do it instead I'm keeping the
data in only one place which is kind of
the parent and then I'm passing the data
in as an attribute so these square
brackets are the attributes binding and
I have the app animations component that
I newly created and it all it needs is
the data that I'm giving it to it and
then it will know how to render it
if you look at the animation component
there's not much going on but also
there's no data related stuff to it
really doesn't know which application in
basically so the animation one is
defining these animations basis the
touch animations activation and anytime
I add a new one it adds the new one not
a previous animation that it works the
way I defined it is that I put all of my
animation definitions inside another
animations function so i can share
between a lot of components and if you
look at our component definition i'm
importing doubt those animations and the
line that starts online add component is
the component annotation which defines
the function the class that comes right
after it as a component and the selector
is the app animation so anytime I want
to use this I use that HTML tag we can
have template URLs style URLs or just
put them in there as well and the other
thing that we can put is the animations
that we will be using so i'm going to
use fly in and out and a datum state
animations
this looks a little bit confusing but
also because I try to put multiple
animations in it and that's also why so
I'm defining a fly-in start and fly out
done events so every time we see a
parenthesis that means any events being
emitted so we have a way of knowing
animation is done and before it starts
so I'm just console.log not do not doing
anything about it but the fly in and out
animation is being defined as an
attribute so anytime we have the square
brackets that's an attribute and when we
click we were just are going
oh please
so here is a simple bar graph component
that I prepared basically I have the
functions that I promise to you this
setup build the SVG and populate with
the data so I keep running these
functions over and over whenever a
change happens angular also gives us
these change detections anytime anything
changes on your components which we are
expecting the data to change the changes
will be reflected and we will rerender
it here we are defining basic scaling of
the X and scaling of the y and we have
the axis we are defining but if you
notice this setup function is not
knowing anything about the data as well
so it doesn't have the data yet the
scales that we are defining is just
telling me how to render inside the Dom
but it doesn't know the data so far when
we are built our SVG we define just the
SVG which is going to hold all of our
visualization and then we can append all
of the axes and everything and the
populate function is the one that is
letting know how to actually render with
the data so with we are appending the
data selecting all of the bar elements
and then depending the data to it and
entry and append is adding all of our
data rectangles and we are transitioning
into it and the that's why we have to
also define the domains which is the
input values of our scales inside our
populate function
i'm also using some color scale so this
is this is a data for the Syrian
refugees by division by the country so I
really wanted to show this data because
we keep talking about we keep hearing
about what we don't really realize
what's going on and where these people
are going and it was really surprising
to see the most of them are in my home
home country basically and it's a small
country it's not that they get smaller
than California so I decided to look at
the data in um maybe different way
come on
okay so I added these categorizations I
got this data from Wikipedia and it has
by the country the refugee count GDP
area population I mean when we hear what
people are going to another country it
doesn't really you know make sense to us
but this is the same scaling compared
with the GDP of those countries so as
you can see these countries over here
who has the most refugees are not the
richest ones in the world and this is
the area that they have it they're not
big countries either and relative
population and GDP per capita so I
thought it was interesting to see and
one of the things that I wanted to
demonstrate although it's really hard to
see you have to scroll to see it one of
the questions that I get all the time is
that how to display complex data this is
not very complex data but people always
try to do a very you know beautiful
complex visualization and put everything
in one place and I really don't think
it's a good idea and perception is very
important and it's really important to
see the differences and to have a
different way of looking at the same
thing
so I skip some of my slice so this is
going through the generators that we
have with the angular CLI and how we can
get started and really cool thing is it
kind of open yet it so when you do
energy bills or try to deploy it tells
you all the things that you've done
wrong and all the things that you don't
need it just strips it out it's really
cool and um am i doing the time oh okay
all right I'm gonna just skip through it
but there's a lot of resources on my
slides if you like to you know save it
somewhere so these are great angular
reach out well let's start with the DG
ones they are really fun this is one of
the fun ones that i recently saw um this
is my absolute favorites visualization
so far and the person who did it is that
working on the second one for a long
time now so it's really really cool soda
tree is super flexible there is no other
library that you could do things like
that I think there are a lot of
libraries they're much easier to use
though I mean if you don't need
something very complex you should not
spend your time doing it and for angular
resources there is a chrome debugger
tools it just released last week but we
already have a lot of tools we have the
CLI reality chrome debugger and we have
a lot of great courses and I think there
was one of them in this conference also
and angular 2 has some open source
charts as well they're really really
cool if you are doing something simple
again definitely use somebody else
besides the great learning opportunity I
think that's it for our talk thank you
for your attention thank you for
listening
and if you have any questions or want to
just talk please come say hi and I have
some t-shirts I heard 3d and order asked
if anyone wants thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
