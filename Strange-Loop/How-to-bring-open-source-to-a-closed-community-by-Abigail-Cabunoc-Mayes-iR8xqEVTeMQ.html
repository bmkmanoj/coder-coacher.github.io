doughnuts did you I can finish mine it
was like a weird Chi Edna anyways it was
very rich um yes hello and i just want
to say thank you to all of you and i'll
still organizers i really love this
conference it's amazing conference I
can't believe that the first time I
cameras two years ago on a diversity
scholarship so it's been really amazing
just coming back and like all the
relationships and friendships in the
community here um yeah thank you all
thank you organizers you're all amazing
so far slow and Abby case you don't
recognize me okay so I work for the
Mozilla Foundation as lead developer of
open source engagement which means i am
working with open source community in
the different programs part of mozilla
so that includes open science Internet
of Things women in tech advocacy
learning also i'm canadian that's very
important yeah you canada it's a little
bit of history um i came to the to the
mozilla foundation through the science
lab before that i was working in
research labs and we're dealing with
lots of data analysis and it was so easy
to see how the web could really make
science just better so that's why I came
to Mozilla to help them do that so
Mozilla our mission is ensured the
Internet is a global public resource
open and accessible to all and at the
science lab and most the work I'm
talking about today will be from when I
was at the science lab specifically
we're applying mozillas grand mission to
very interesting community practice so
this is my story I will disclaimer these
are not instructions i know it's titled
how to bring open source to close
community but i hope the story from the
past like seven or eight years of my
life will help you and you'll learn some
lessons to this um also i'm really i'm
willing to hear your feedback on our
plans because we're starting to bring
this to different communities past just
open science so i'd love to hear what
you guys think i mean you all think ok
so my story starts with open source i
actually wrote open source code for
years and years before I actually
stood what it was and what it meant and
like what this whole movement was about
so we're going to look at the origin of
the term open source just to help give
some cultural context of the time
because the free software movement
predates this term by quite a few years
like a decade or so and i know i talked
about open source a lot so i'm gonna do
it again for a little bit because it's
very important so i think it starts with
this essay that eric raymond wrote
called the Cathedral in the design in
1997 and in this he compared the state
of free software at the time at least
two types of free software he saw and
the first was the cathedral where it's
technically public anyone can come in
and take part in a service but the very
few people were in charge of what was
happening there even the way it's built
like an architect and people were
involved with this and you compare that
to a bizarre which is this a public
space and people set up tables and you
can sell whatever you like and you can
barter things and it's really the people
who make this happen so he saw this
happening in Linux with the bazaar he
was like a giant group of people of
differing agendas sort of came together
and built something that was better
because of all their diversity I'm not
sure I think something's on fire in the
bazaar not really sure but I think
that's a great metaphor for open source
maybe something's on fire who knows but
things get fixed because there's so many
people there so this essay actually
inspired the Netscape corporation to
release Netscape Browser sweet as free
software the following year and that
became the basis of the Mozilla project
and it inspired the term open source
there's actually a meeting of like the
free software movement strategy people
they were like oh mozilla did something
that's what call it open source so this
is really part of like what Mozilla is
and what we're trying to do today in
open science and these other groups so I
know if you remember I like the early
2000s but there were no browser Wars it
was just internet explorer and the fact
that this community could come together
and build something that topple the
giant was really amazing and it really
pointed to this idea that we're all
better together yeah diverse group
people to get working on a problem but
like how do we get this diverse group
together and the way muscle approaches
that is through this idea
working open that things are both public
and participatory so we need to
restructure our efforts that Outsiders
can meaningfully participate and become
insiders as appropriate I think that's a
little key that made me understand how
like what open source is and how this
movement sort of works and engages
people so shortly after they made up the
term open source the open source
initiative started and I think this is
really is why open source is still here
today they outlined like ten steps and
how you are a real open source project
so thanks to all the people there so
back to my story I learned about open
source but then also science I was
working in bioinformatics and like a
Cancer Research Institute and I won't go
too deep into this but sometimes trying
to participate in science can feel like
this this is a few great illustrations
from john mctiernan on a wide open
research but especially after I left
academia there was I couldn't get to
research anymore but even when I was
within academia it was only the
specialists that could really
participate in something and help make
discoveries and when you are in this
community you're always scared of
getting scooped you're worried that
someone else will publish before you and
you won't get the credit for it and I
think it's just a lack of education on
yeah how open licenses can protect you
and help you so one of the first things
we tried to do to help bring open source
into science when i joined the science
lab was this collaborate which is a
collection of open source projects for
science and it's still there it looks so
different now and it's still great you
have a bunch of open source projects but
something I realized was that in general
we weren't that great at open source
researchers people would come to the
projects but they wouldn't know how to
get involved or things weren't laid out
while people weren't responsive so I
realized there was a culture change that
needed to happen so that research could
be more open and could participate more
open source so I brings us to the third
point in my story fueling the movement
and this is actually the last point in
my story and most of my talk will be
this one if you're taking notes I don't
know I like like making lists of three
you're going to see list of three many
more times so
I actually couldn't find a good
definition of a movement that I liked so
I'm defining it here as mobilizing a
community around a shared purpose I
don't know if that's there's probably a
better definition but I like this one
because you need a community for culture
change you need to mobilize people so
they're actually doing something so I a
like this diagram or yeah so this is a
dancing guy this is from a TED talk by
derek sivers i don't know if i'm saying
that right babes talking about movements
and how one guy dancing can inspire
someone else to come in join you and it
starts mobilizing people and eventually
you see some cool stuff happening over
there maybe someone else is going to
join maybe someone else is gonna join
this is really funny to watch I you can
see the whole thing online but slowly
like more people get involved and it's
not just one guy dancing anymore it's a
group of them and that mobilizes other
people oh yay so in game and this is
just really funny to what I like the
shaky cam 2 and then more and more
people oh man okay only death will just
watch this for a second it's a lot of
fun yeah there's a group so now it's a
group dancing it's no longer just one
person doing his own thing but now this
is something people are taking notice of
and then even by standards if your
bystanders yeah if you're on the edge
and you don't know what to do suddenly
it makes more sense free to join than to
just sit around so I really like this
yeah I like this as like a description
of a movement visually okay moving on so
this is a figure from Marshall Ganz's sa
public narrative collective action in
power which I would recommend if you're
interested in cultural change but he
talks about how to get people to take
action so now if we're actually trying
to mobilize these people he talks about
how you need two things both strategy
and narrative so you need to have like
the head knowledge of what you need to
do but also the narrative of why this is
important so talking to researchers I
think they all understood why it was
important they know that sharing data is
better but they didn't have a good
strategy on how to do that without like
killing their career or
not knowing what to do so I made a plan
to feel the movement another list of
three things first was resources to help
with that strategy to give people that
then talking to leaders and mobilizing
them so that they can mobilize other
people through mentorship and keep the
movement going like the dancing guide ok
so first on resources we're actually do
a little exercise that I did with the
science team on trying to brainstorm
like what kind of steps people need to
do this so how do outsiders become
insiders today this is what working open
is so everyone think of a place you felt
welcomed the first time you visited so
give you free few seconds think you want
place here you thinking of you can yell
it out Oh strangely yes I heard brain
flu at first which made no sense ok
strangely yeah I definitely felt
welcomed fit strangelet Canada yes I
don't remember when I first came to
Canada but I'm sure I felt welcome any
other places college that's that can be
true for some people and not true for
others that's great yeah any others
where was that Niagara Falls oh it's
beautiful the Canada side it's just
checking cool so now for all those
places what made it welcoming it's a
strange loop back there you what made
strangely welcoming for you the people
where they like the people were
welcoming they just said hi to you in
the hallways and stuff
yeah that's great in case you didn't
hear that yeah everyone wants to find
out who you are and what you're doing
and it's been courage you to keep doing
that for me actually um since I was on
that diversity scholarship they had a
special dinner for I think it was
actually for like lambda ladies but they
invited all the scholarship people there
and that was great it was like a smaller
place for me to get welcomed and it was
people who are similar to me which was
nice um what else made strangely
welcoming for the rest of you anything
else just the people doughnuts yeah they
keep us well fed they tend to our other
needs like when we're hungry we have
places to sit yes yeah the slack so
that's another way for you to
communicate and get involved to know
what's going on yeah those are all great
ways and what about what were the other
ones Canada what made Canada welcoming
politeness they keep your bed yes all
the maple syrup you want it's not true
it's quite pricey though pooty-poo teens
pretty great too you should all have
routine I didn't mean for this talk to
be so Canadian I'm sorry I sing sorry
okay maybe I'll wish them the other ones
I can't remember them anymore Oh college
what make college welcoming for you
the organization that feel like
onboarding
yeah yeah orientation they usually have
like a whole week for that and it's all
about meeting people and your fun things
going on yeah College is really great at
that so some things that we're welcoming
like being welcomed by people having
good onboarding so you know what to do
how you're supposed to act being polite
tending to your needs so feeding you
Adam yeah I'm trying to apply that but
doesn't make sense anyways what does
this look like in software so how can we
be welcoming and polite and tend to
their needs and software
yes not being a jerk is the key point
there yeah answering people's questions
that being a jerk it's a very Canadian
of you anything else mmhmm yeah showing
people where to get started yeah yes
yeah so making everything beginner and
friendly not assuming people have been
doing this all for 10 years um having
contributor guidelines I think that's
also great yeah spending time with
newcomers I think that's really great
where would you do that yeah yeah
oh yeah that's really nice yeah yeah so
chatting them with him on guitar slack
even skype I think even before people
reach out having something like in your
read me so people can passively see
where to go it's good so at the signs
like we thought about this we did the
same exercise maybe a little bit longer
but we came up with this checklist of
things for open source and we wrote
little exercises for each once those are
all links so we have public repository
we didn't really talk about that but
like being somewhere where people can
find you if this is all on your computer
and no one can come and contribute we
were covering all our bases having an
open license so you're actually meet the
open source definition would be good
having a readme where you're welcoming
people a road map something we didn't
really talk about but having your issues
broken down or just have so that people
can know where they can come into your
project and what they can work on having
code of conduct we didn't mention
actually but especially here at strange
loop like we have a code of conduct
which i think is great and there's ways
to level up your concerns so I think
having them on an open source project I
know it's not super common yet but I
think it should be contributing
guidelines we talked about so people
know how they can contribute and then
this last one is kind of vague I just
say mentorship but this isn't worried
about the attitude that you need to be
welcoming people into your project and
then helping them learn as they go
through bugs and helping them learn to
yeah even be a better coder so feeling
the movement those were the resources we
put together so now part two is finding
leaders so we ran this workshop the
working open workshop in Berlin back in
February where we picked a bunch of
people from our community who are
running really cool open source projects
some of them were on that collaborate
list i showed you earlier they they're
already running open source projects
they know that this is what they want to
do and maybe just a little bit of
strategy would help activate them so we
brought them all to Berlin and part of
helping activate them was working with
them after the workshop yeah so here's
the okay we're gonna start this giant
diagram up at the top that's a beaner
Elia I'm Abby irelia is the
muley lead with the muzzle of science
lab she's also um yeah great open source
developer and like a map geek she's a
lot of fun so those are the two of us
and then we had all these people at the
working open workshop that showed up
there's 22 of them and all but two of
them wanted to be part of our open
leadership cohort we named a bunch of
things I'm sorry if it gets confusing
but these are people who agreed to meet
with us for the next three months for
one-on-one mentorship to apply the
lessons they have learned at the working
open workshop to their projects and at
the end of that we were going to have
the global sprint which is like a
two-day hackathon so they're just
getting their projects ready for a giant
hackathon basically so we met with them
for 30 minutes every two weeks and
mostly we just work with them to set
goals it's like Oh what do you want your
project to look like in three months for
the hackathon and they'll say things
like oh like be ready for contributors
so that we can actually get good
contributions happening at the hackathon
and we'd hold them accountable by
checking in with them every couple weeks
so soon after that we actually added
quite a few people to our open
leadership cohort because they had
co-leads on their projects so they also
met with them and then at the global
sprint these are the people that made
significant contributions to their
projects so they wanted to check them
out and give them a little things so
this is a little screenshot of what
happened at the global sprint so it's 40
sites around the world a two-day
hackathon and basically it starts in New
Zealand and then it like goes around the
world to Australia Asia Europe and then
just sort of goes around the world twice
Evans working nine to five and their
time zone it's really fun and it's just
two days of working on science thing so
it was a good goal to work towards as
people have these projects that they're
trying to make open source yeah I
explained that so the global sprint we
had all these new people yay so yeah for
that third part feeling the movement
mentorship so we had them sort of
mentoring those people that came and got
involved at the global sprint but we
wanted them to start practicing to
mentor new people and we wanted to sort
of branch out of just open science to
other parts of Mozilla so we selected
mentors for
round two these are people that we
thought would be good mentors and then
we gave them mentees part of our
mentorship program and they started
mentoring these people so these bottom
dots sorry this isn't the best diagram I
made it pretty quickly but they're all
nominated from different parts of
Mozilla so some of these are Internet of
Things hackers some of them are part of
the women and web literacy group some of
them are from our open advocacy stuff
for the open web advocates yeah that's
what they're called so now I'm going to
tell you some stories and lessons from
going through this whole program and
what happened oh and also I had to
mention at the global sprint this year
because we had done this mentorship the
amount of contributor ship just like
skyrocketed because we had measured the
github activity the previous two years
at our global sprint and then this year
I probably should have made a graph
maybe you can imagine it with my arms it
goes like this very scientific I know
but there is so much more interaction i
think especially because we focused on
using github for collaboration so
there's a lot of like issues and
discussions which scientists were much
more likely to get involved win because
they like mailing lists so open source
checklist so we're going to go through
this whole checklist and i'll tell you a
little story about one of the people in
our program and also tell you a bit
about what we taught them in each of our
pieces so first person is a chintia so
that's as a chintia this is this github
profile picture Oh for all of these
people I didn't tell them I was talking
about them so I hope they don't mind
hello recording okay agenda is a science
communicator at stern and he's a PhD
students in science community PhD
student and science communication at Uwe
Bristol so his project was open cosmics
yeah it does fill cause my great physics
for everyone so for a little physics
primer cosmic rays are high-energy
particles that bombard the Earth's
atmosphere and then they produce the
shower of particles that we can measure
here on earth so there's actually I'm
crayfish you can install it on your
phone it's an app that will like measure
cosmic ray particles which is kind of
cool and you can also build your own
cosmic ray like measuring
things out of like plastic bottles I'm
not sure how it works but it's also cool
but the problem was there's all these
different ways to measure cosmic rays
from like the real detectors to your own
homemade bottle but the data was very
varied and there was no standards so H
in t.o is like hey I'm going to bring
all these people together and we're
going to make a standard that way people
can share this data across each other
with each other yeah so he's a little
special because if you see those three
green dots that he brought on those are
all these people that were running these
projects from like the the one on your
phone to the other homemade one and
there's also cosmic pie which from what
I understand is a raspberry pi for
cosmic ray physics it's kind of cool and
he needed to get people to collaborate
around something and discuss with each
other so by giving him a github
repository it gave him a place to
collaborate and just sort of coordinate
with these people and afterwards he said
the biggest thing he learned from going
through this whole system was had a
project managed on github which isn't
really what we were trying to teach him
but it's cool that by putting something
online it's your more organized so make
sure your code is available all those
are acceptable and then we have this
curriculum called github for
collaboration which really walks you
through how you like make a pull request
and how you collaborate with each other
and discuss things and issues which a
lot of scientists are varying you too so
that helped at into quite a lot the next
thing was having an open license and
we're going to talk about Rob this is
rob oh I have another picture of Rob
he's the fuzzy went over there yeah so
this is at our working open workshop
we're doing the open web stretch you're
leaning left to avoid the NSA yeah but
he's working on a project um I think it
might be cut off no it's okay it's
called p.m. see ref so pubmed central is
um this repository for life science and
biomedical research articles so what he
wanted to do was you give it an article
and then he will give back all the
articles that you can read for free on
PubMed Central so it's a little simple
thing but very useful for someone in the
biological sciences I'm highlighting him
under license because I noticed he made
licensed like four days after our
workshop so I think everyone else like
ignored before a while or already had
licenses so that's why Rob gets to shout
out here thanks Rob MIT license very
permissive way to go so if we remember
Rob's that one they are little red dot
and he was that this is his first open
source project that he was running and
he was actually able to get someone to
contribute quite a lot the yellow dot
attached to his red bag at the sprint
and that was actually her first open
source contribution so yeah it was made
possible and it was legal because he had
an open license and now he's mentoring
someone in our next round of this guy
named min he was going to be at the
Mozilla festival which is what this
around ends at where it's this art
display with facial recognition so when
you walk by it will recognize your face
if you walked by before and tell things
about you so it's supposed to like
highlight security and privacy on the
web anyways it should be cool also a
little creepy but um those are the cool
projects that are in this network so yes
open license and the science lab
recommends MIT our bsd also we just
point people to choose license com which
is an excellent resource if you're
looking for an open license next my
checklist is kirstie on read me so
here's Kirsty she's actually one of our
2016 Mozilla fellows for science so we
also have a fellowship program where
early career researchers will basically
do open science for a year while we pay
them to stay in their universities and
just bring open science fair so Christie
is one of them she's a great job and she
was part of a yachtie community all last
year so she is a postdoc researcher at
the brain mapping unit and at the
University of Cambridge but the project
she worked on when she was part of this
mentorship with stem role models where
she wanted to inspire future generations
by providing the most exciting and
diverse from diverse speakers for your
conference so she actually really took
to heart this you need to be welcoming
in your project and she made her all her
documentation was super welcoming he's
like welcome first and foremost welcome
emoji welcome in another emoji yeah
Avenue
Mogi Mogi it was very exciting so here
she is and yeah she was able to get a
couple people to help her because her
tech skills aren't a strong since you
got some people to help build this
database of role models which is really
cool and now she's mentoring a few other
people including um two people from the
Detroit Community tech project and they
are making this cool music box thing
which is addressing gentrification in
Detroit and like Mabel using open source
technology to help storytelling in that
area which is really cool so another
project yeah they're the red ones but
for project communication so we have a
handout called open project
communication here and one of my
favorite things in this is actually the
open canvas that we made many of you
heard of lean canvas yeah someone so
it's really popular in like the business
startup world an entrepreneur will like
fill out the lean canvas that's like a
one-page a business plan so it goes to
like problem solution like what you're
trying to do so we remixed it and we
took out the parts that were very like
business specific and added things for
open source like contributors and user
profiles and I think this is really
important because it makes you think
about what you're building the product
then also the community you're trying to
build with it yep so you have users and
contributors and I like this green
square for project execution because I
find a lot of people don't think about
the kind of contributors they need in
relation to what they're trying to build
so if you have if you know what your MVP
is your minimum viable product and what
you need for that if you need designers
and a developer you make sure you put
that in your contributors that you need
designers and developers and then think
about how you will on board designers if
you don't know any so that's really
useful I found and it helps you write a
better read me if you actually know like
your problem and solution so that was I
can go back I'm sorry okay see cool so
next one's a road map with Bastian did
you do thurs Bastian he's off on the
side so I was really excited when I
paired Bastian with his mentee for this
round because his men teen
be back and was like I can't believe my
mentor is the mark zuckerberg of open
source genetics and he licked me to this
article it's like I had no idea but
Bastion is pretty cool he runs open
snipped org at snip is for a single
nucleotide polymorphism which is kind of
mutation you get in your genome but
basically it's um if you've ever done
23andme or any of those things that
genotypes you you can upload the results
to open snipped org and it's public and
people can use it for research and you
can also match it to phenotypes so you
can see ya what the phenotypes would
look like in use like it will predict oh
you're Eastern European or something
like that so oh fun story when Bastian
uploaded his genotype before open so he
made open snip he put it on github and
some random researcher came along and
like analyzes genome and then emailed
him and was like hey you have like a
higher likelihood for prostate cancer
Bastian was like oh dear but he he was
pretty young but he told his dad and his
dad went and got checked and they caught
the cancer early enough that he was um
yeah he's alive and well now so it's
cool I you should share your genome okay
but we help them through roadmapping oh
that's what it was roadmapping okay um
even just helping them sort through what
features they wanted over the next few
months and break that down helps them
actually get things done over the next
few months yeah otherwise they hadn't
been doing a lot for the year before
that so roadmapping can help sort of get
your community a kick start and help new
people come in so I know what you're
doing working on next and where they can
help so we have a little like
introduction to roadmapping see helps
you break down milestones and break
things down into issues yeah and next on
the open-source checklist is a code of
conduct where we have Richard this is
Richard he has a moss beard here's
another picture of him with no beard so
Richard yeah he's on the left there this
is at ma's fest you should all come to
ma's best
but basically oh I didn't make another
slide for him yeah he worked in a lot of
projects this year because he was
actually fellow this past year so when
the projects he worked on with slide
wonder where he wanted to make
presentations better so you can like
remix your HTML presentations easier
like you can with keynote and stuff
anyways it's cool it's called slide
winder he wrote a cool code of conduct
for that he was also working on science
fair which was for like sharing papers
and reading papers which is more useful
for scientists but he always has a code
of conduct and he's always very aware
that it is difficult for people to come
into these projects so I like to point
out his code of conduct oh yeah
sidewinder code of conduct and here a
couple of resources I'm how to write a
code of conduct and links to some good
stuff oh and the muslin slab has a code
of conduct which is CC 0 so you can just
take it for yourself if you like you
don't even have to credit us next is
contributing got md contributor
guidelines and tim so there's Tim so he
worked on everywhere I don't know why
their slogans sharing is caring I guess
yeah sharing your research is good but
he cares a lot about reproducible
research and this basically um yeah it
lets you run other people's github code
in a wait yeah on ipython notebook in
github it'll launch it in a docker
instance so you can see it I mean he can
edit it anyways it's cool i first met
tim at a hackathon at CERN and he gotten
into an argument with one of the judges
about whether or not science was
reproducible at CERN he was saying we
can be more reproducible which is why we
need this and she was like we're already
reproducible anyways reproducible
science is very important but he wrote a
great contributing guidelines and was
able to bring in quite a few people on
his project um I think I yeah so all the
yellow parts they came on before the
global sprint and now he's mentoring oh
yeah some other people doing
reproducible science work cool so for
those of you yeah a little intro and
contributing guidelines there in your
root directory we use Adam here as an
example they did pretty good job
and it's good to have some cheer welcome
people have a nice introduction give
instructions and like how to contribute
or how to run your things and then yes
style guidelines is down there but
what's cool about contributing
guidelines is that github has made them
pretty popular because it's pretty
integrated with github now so if you
open a new issue like here it actually
has this little message at the top
saying like please review our
contributing guidelines so it helps if
you have them so people can read them
before they make issues on your projects
hey so the last one here is mentorship
our big broad one and I put Madeline
there she's pretty cool Madeline she's a
PhD student at the University of Toronto
here's another picture of her she's here
on the left she actually spoke at our
working open workshop because she
actually runs a weekly meeting at U of T
I'm like open science and doing open
science so she helped talk about that
but she has a pretty cool product called
phage parser which is around the crisper
system so if you crispers like really
cool nowadays and quite a buzz word
because of all the genome editing stuff
you can do so it stands for clustered
regularly interspaced short palindromic
repeats that's a lot but it's basically
um all of the the black squares oh yeah
I can walk I forgot my mics like not
okay so all these are repeats these are
all the same part of the gene and then
these extra parts over here they're from
viruses that have attacked the crisper
system so crisp it can actually remember
what the virus is like it keeps the hold
of this and then what it does is it can
identify the virus later and then like
cut it which is why it's so great at
genome editing because it helps us like
cut genomes exactly where we want them
to be but what Madeline noticed and her
PhD advisor notice is that a lot of
people were there publishing bacterial
and archaeal genomes that have
Christopher systems and we could analyze
all that and find out about all this
virus DNA in between like what can we
learn about crispers because it's a low
there's a little bit of unknowns in
there so that's a cool project
and she was able to engage like a lot of
people on there so like all those 4mm
this a long stage yeah like all those
four people we're like new contributors
at the global sprint also I think it
helps that she runs the open science
meet up so she can just like get people
from both and she's mentoring people now
including faith who runs the missoula
community in the Philippines and she's
like making curriculum and how to yeah I
think it's like how to run campus
campaigns and the Philippines I don't I
remember exactly a shiverin notes
anyways so curriculum stuff that we have
under mentorship that gives good frist
bugs is labeling some of your issues as
good force bugs is a good entry point
for people who come into your project
and then we also have a personas and
pathways exercise which is used a lot in
the design world I think we can use it
for open source too since we're trying
to figure out pathways for our open
source contributors it's good if you
think of a persona at like have a
made-up contributor and make a pathway
for them to walk through so that's a
resource you can use to make up some
personas so to summarize is our open
source checklist many things and oh yes
and we filled the movement by making
these resources mobilizing leaders and
then having them mentor others so we'll
see how well that works having
scientists mentor people from all other
places but I think it'll be great so you
can come to Moss fest which is October
28 to 30 a--the your ravensbourne london
and oh yeah the tagline is the world's
leading event for and by the open
Internet movement join us to build
debate and explore the future of our
lives online cut off of it but i really
like moss best because like we have an
open science space every year but
there's also a whole floor for open use
and a whole floor for like advocacy and
it's really cool just to see all these
places interact so Moss is designed to
be like the web a place where you can
make things that matter so these are all
the people that helped or they're in the
mentorship program where their mentors
you guys have been awesome any questions
yeah clear a lot of the just I seen deal
with people's fear or paranoia about be
more open so if not it's not really
based on the information of getting
involved in finding out more
yeah and I think um there's a lot of
good resources like why open research
com that addresses a lot of those fears
um yeah I don't I didn't have too much
in this presentation about that I think
that's a really good point I would yeah
i would take them to why open research
com there's probably other places yeah
happy to chat more anything else cool
enjoy your last keynote thanks oh oh and
the slides are there if you want to
click on all my links thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
