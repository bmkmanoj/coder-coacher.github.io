name is Attila Sega d and for the past
two years two and a half years I've been
working at Oracle's Java line tools and
I've well during that time mostly
working on the knots phone which is our
new JavaScript runtime and well there
was a bunch of things to discover and
learn in in the Indus journey so far and
we have a lot of additional things in
ahead of us but were the things that we
with the things that we achieved so far
I think we did hit on some some very
interesting experiences and some very
interesting results and this is what I
will be sharing with you today here I
hope you like bytecode so uh oh yeah
this is our I work for oracle slide
don't believe anything I say don't
purchase anything based on what I told
you I might be lying I most of all I
will almost certainly am so so what's
nice phone we we started out with
creating a new JavaScript runtime one on
top of the JVM Oracle's JD came before
that Sanjay the case in java 6 has been
shipping with a JavaScript runtime that
was a version of Mozilla Rhino but it
had its issue so there was a decision to
create a new one nice thing about Nass
horn is that it is completely open
source all of the development that we do
is in the OpenJDK repository there's no
there's no closed parts there's no
walled off secret cells whatever it does
 a standard part of the Oracle's
Java since since Java 8 so it's in there
you can just use it I will not talk to
you about how to use it you can find
this this is not the top this is not in
scope of this talk you can access it
from common line you can use the
JavaScript Java x dot script api's or
you cannot also directly use the JD Kane
for an API scripting package what's
interesting about it is that currently
we do have no interpreters in currently
because it's not out of the question
that we might want to have one in future
for mostly for faster startup reasons
but we don't have it currently so nasan
starts out with compiling the source
code to java bytecode and then running
that it is fully akma script 5.1
compliant as a matter of fact they have
a tweet that I couldn't find now and put
it on a slide we're about two years ago
in a bar in Stockholm I was running the
ACMA script 262 test suite that consists
some 11.5 thousand tests and I have the
privilege of having the having been the
first person that had all of those tests
hundred percent pass on his laptop of
course this also meant that I had two
tests that were not passing for a month
and I was working on that damn to test
for a month before they passed but
editors the way there's nice one is also
security-minded although we won't be
talking about that another reason to
replace Rhino was that protein hails
back from java 1.1 days and well it is
not exactly it does have no idea about
the java security model with nasa phone
we we did make sure that all the code
generation the the typical issues with
the with the privileged code execution
and so on and so on that you have in
java we are we spend an amazing amount
of time actually getting this right it's
also a proving ground for invoke dynamic
mass horn uses the invoke dynamic under
the covers for its to basically have
dynamic execution on a fairly static
runtime and we are the probably the
biggest user of the invoke dynamic right
now and we also serve
as the as the well grain of the sand in
the hot spot teams oyster to try to prod
them into producing a pearl they still
not completely there but they're getting
there so far we released it in Java 8
and then a 220 we did some security
fixes and a 240 which is a current Death
March is the big performance release and
I will mostly talk to you about this and
then Java 9 will get everything that
Java 8 has and plus some why do we have
this performance focus and this talk
will mostly be about how to make a fast
fast dynamic language runtime on the JVM
because well let's face it writing a
slow language runtime is fairly easy
getting a faster one is is somewhat more
complicated with a throwback to the
kolmogorov complexity and the fortunate
fact that that function is actually not
computable we that's also called the
compiler writers job security theorem
which basically says you can spend a
lifetime writing optimizations in the sa
run time we can spend a lifetime writing
optimizations in your for you for your
system because you can never prove that
there are no optimizations left but
which means I might actually retire one
day and say that all my life I was
optimizing master node that might not be
the exact same story that I would like
to tell to my grandkids olc so how are
we doing the blue line that you almost
cannot see is rhino and the line that's
like normalized was JDK 8 Nass horn and
currently the green offshoots is the
nice one a9 the JDK 9 performance the
same thing that actually goes into the
into a 240v are back porting its analog
step well things got faster they always
ask me so how fast is it and that's
that's a question can only answer with
that awful lot of qualification right
next question is inevitably how about we
ate well this is the state of the art
versus v88 is faster it will probably
always be faster we don't want to really
we don't we don't claim to compete with
v8 as I said we want to have a modern
runtime on the JVM we want to have many
things but we're shooting for fastest
one time fastest JavaScript runtime
there are some things that we cannot do
that v8 can do v8 can do things like
change the object layout while it's
garbage collecting because you have this
fun thing where it's an actual life code
from nodejs where they allocate an
object literal using curly braces and
this then then they start using it as an
array which is a completely legal thing
in JavaScript or you would probably
better communicate your intent if you
use the square brackets instead of curly
braces but a good thing about v8 is that
it can realize when it's doing garbage
collection it needs to inspect the
objects anyway so it will look at it and
say hey this thing looks a lot like an
array why don't I just change the
internal representation to be an array
getting us having to map things to
objects on the JVM v obvious a candle
that there are some other things but the
good news is that number crunching
performance wise we are really catching
up but that's like actually something I
wouldn't have said a year ago but we we
are getting there so what optimizations
what's the what's the thing that thinks
that you do in your dynamic language
today if you really wanted to go fast so
things that we realize we need to do
Buddha pyramid parameter type
specialized compilation which means that
if you have a function and you invoke it
with Inter parameters and double
parameters we will actually compile two
versions of the code yes there is a
danger of combinatorial explosion no in
practice it doesn't really happen and we
are also very narrow with our well to
say this way our numeric sour is very
small Tower we only do in long double
and that object
what a crazy thing that we did was we
actually implemented the scheme for on
stack code replacement with that that we
needed for gradual the optimization
again what is this about well in
JavaScript when you retrieve a property
from an object or do you retrieve an
element from an array you have no clue
statically what it's type will be it can
be anything right can be an object can
be an end you cannot tell until you
retrieved it so what optimistic typing
says is let's be optimistic let's just
presume everything will be an end just
and then proceed happily with that
assumption of course when it does not
work out you need to somehow bail out of
that particular code because if you
retrieve that element from an array and
you told it's an int and you try to and
the rest of your code in bytecode read
says i add you try to do an integer add
on him right you cannot have anything
that's not an int on the stack the Java
verifier will not like you in the first
place so you need to then take that that
version of your code you need to bail
out of it somehow ree compile a new
version that says well I know that that
array is known to return doubles so i
will now treat whatever comes back as
double and instead of ayodhya use the
add and then you need to keep running
with that we'll get to it we have static
code analysis which is funny because
it's a dynamic language and there is a
slew of ordinary compile ordinary Girl
compiler optimizations those that you
can read about in books on writing AC
compiler you also take advantage
fronting context during compilation
which is one of the more inspired things
that I think they did in a in a in a
past was quite quite quite funny when I
figured out we can do this and it was it
even more funny when it worked so in
parameter type specialized compilation
as I said if you have a function in
JavaScript say we are squaring the
number and you invoke it with an int and
you invoke it with a double then what
happens is that we will actually compile
two versions of the code
oh and by the way we do isn't lazy
compilation this function square it gets
parsed it doesn't get compiled it's only
on the first invocation with particular
parameters if we don't have that type of
specialization that's when we will
actually go to the trouble and and
actually compile that version of the
code I can actually demonstrate this
pretty easily I will be switching
between live coding a lot here so here's
the exact same code oops yep and let
just do let's just put some markers here
that we will show you how things go so
if you just run this code and put it
down manner then obviously you get this
result now if you add some logging for
recompilation is this front lodge and if
I can make things larger do see the okay
cool Roger okay
yeah maybe we need to balance between
size and actually seeing something okay
it's this better okay so as you can see
the program starts running and Oh
actually crazily enough even the program
is lazy it shouldn't be but it's just we
didn't want a special case it so it
prints this first line and then it
actually says hey I need a type
specialization of the square function
that will taken intend return an int how
do you how does it know it will be
returning an end well it doesn't that's
the fun part is that that's also
something that basically your input
parameters you might have an optimistic
guests at what the return type might be
and that can actually also evolve over
time it just initial guess it knows that
we'll be receiving an end but that it
will be returning an intellectually a
guess so as you can see it compiled the
inter version here printed its result
and then it compiled the double version
here and as you can see it actually says
okay I'm compiling a double I want to
get back an end but then a real thing
will happen here you see this rewrite
exception that's actually telling it I
am trying to return an int from this
function but what I got back instead is
a double so at this point it needs to
regenerate the code so that it returns a
double and then return that if you dig
deeper nice thing about masam if you
want to play with this you can just do
what i write it pc is shorthand for
print code kidding you can see what it
does
so we have the intrusion which you know
loads the argument does a multiplication
which is not an ordinary multiplication
mind you it's a dynamic link something
and returns the result and then you also
have the double version which as you can
see will be returning a double so and of
course if I did a version that took an
object as its argument then the compiled
version would be this naive JavaScript
it just takes its argument does the
JavaScript conversion to a number and
does it twice and multiplies and returns
the result the reason it has to do it
twice sorry I'm just going through and
sliding it the reason has to do it twice
is because JavaScript objects can have
can customize their number
representation and it can be stateful so
you cannot just retrieve it once and
used twice that's another benefit of
being able to use primitives that you
know that they cannot have any of this
fancy business going under the covers
right and int will always have the same
value no matter what and objects being
mutable oh well what's funny is that and
let's Jack chua Lee new a new slide that
I insert based on the conversation
yesterday is that this thing works with
higher order functions to as Jays
function under the hood is actually a
whole drawer full of its type
specializations and we propagate the
types from the top so if you take the
the simplest possible higher-order
function that basically says apply this
to an argument apply this function to an
argument and you invoke it then what
this will do is it will generate two
specializations of apply one that takes
an object and an int and other that
takes an object and a double and I need
to really reverse the order of the
arguments there on the slide and it will
be invoking F and one version will be
walking F with an int and the other will
be invoking F with a double so they will
actually end up invoking square with an
intense square with a double so it just
works out really nicely it's a as i said
i need to actually in my example code i
have this right i have it here this is
the exact same code so if we compile
this thing we will see that we have a
version of apply that that takes takes
an int returns an int and takes an
object that's that lets the function
right and it will just load its object
argument into a dynamic call on it and
it will say I will pass it an int and
expect an ends to be returned and when
this execute that's when we will first
compile the square version with an int
and then we also have a version with
that takes a double and hopes that it
can return an int it does not know
what's the type of the it doesn't know
what will the square function return if
you pass it a double it hopes back for
an end but it can fail and it will
actually fail so you will see that we
will have and yet another version of
apply compiled after a while that at
this point it says if I pass a double to
this function it will be returning a
double so I just gradually discovers the
types as it goes alright so we also do
the optimization on arithmetic overflow
because in JavaScript we are not allowed
to overflow JavaScript specification
wise it has no idea about about it has
no idea whatsoever about ins it's
completely defined in terms of doubles
so using ins is an optimization that we
do so if you take a square function and
you actually pass it something that when
multiplied we
overflow the end then the square
function itself will have two will have
to be optimized and yeah
do I have this yes I do
so first we have take some ins returns
on in and then after it failed with this
input it will become more conservative
it was say well you know the square
function if invoked with the name might
actually return a long so it will load
its arguments widen them 22 Long's and
then perform a long multiplication and
return that all right so the invoke
dynamic that will link to for the
multiplication actually something that
invokes Java line math multiply exact
these are new methods in java.lang mat
that throw arithmetic exception and
overflows and that point we catch those
we we perform the multiplication as
Long's in the Indy in the newly
constructed exception as you can see we
do a long x times long lie there and we
throw back a new exception which also
contains an identifier of the location
in the code where this thing happened we
must perform the operation return the
result because well all of this must be
transparent with regard to the execution
of the program right that we are
internally throwing exceptions
regenerating code from the point of the
external user who runs the code this
must not be observable we have similar
the optimizing compilation for property
types if sorry yeah four types of
properties if you're retrieving a
property foo from a for instance here
will again have an assumption that it's
an intimate generate and dynamic invoker
which invokes the function invokes the
property and the return value it tries
to treat it doesn't even if it's not it
will throw an exception to regenerate
the code so sometimes if it gets really
widened then if this a foo is actually a
double then we will end up we will end
up generating a really nice version of
the code that says okay if it's a little
then I will just use double
multiplication here and the this is this
is a an example for
of static type analysis working hand in
hand with optimistic typing to make sure
that the code is as nice as as nice as
possible because double double
multiplication cannot overflow with in
the JavaScript semantics right it can
become infinite though all right so how
do we do this how do we do optimized
running code because normally the usual
usual way to do this is you need to
recompile a new version of the on the
fly but what's more complicated is that
you need to replace your running code on
top of the stack now run times that do
this are obviously solving this problem
our issue was that we try to solve it in
a way where you don't we don't do any
magic tricks we want to do it in
completely Java specification compliant
way not using any vm tricks so we did
achieve this with a pure bytecode
solution so it runs on any JVM not just
Oracle's JVM as I said mass one is in
openjdk so any OpenJDK licensee can take
it and use it on their system it does
not have to be it does not have to be
Oracle's hotspot so what we did you so
it saw it that we throw an exception
with type assumptions are too narrow and
whenever function that can be the
optimized is linked we use the invoke
dynamics try-catch Combinator to call
catch this exception the caller it must
be in the color because we need to jump
out of the function that needs to be the
optimized you need to remove it from the
stack so we need to jump back to the
caller the color catches the exception
derails into the compiler it generates
two versions of the code the new version
of the code with the wider type at that
point it installs it whatever it needs
to be installed for later discovery if
some other site also invokes the same
function but we also need to compile a
separate one shot continuation version
of that code as well and then we need to
invoke that guy to resume execution as
if nothing happened this looks like this
this is a typical example of a rest of
method in my tin in the previous example
for a few times 2 is we take a demand in
order to not make a life difficult we
just generate the same code that's for
the normal version of the function we
don't do anything fancy we just
basically feed azum with the same
instruction visitor sequence except at
the very top we put a go-to to a very
late label and that very late label on
the bottom is something that takes this
rewrite exception which contains the
full encapsulation of the state that we
captured at the point of the of the of
the failure we need to recompile it
restores the local variables and then it
restores the state of the stack from
those local variables applies any type
conversions that might need which might
be tricky because maybe you had maybe
you were initializing an array of ins
and one of your expressions became a
double and you actually need to have an
array of doubles right now at which
point we act you might have a value on
the stack that we just transparently and
nonchalantly just replace from an array
of ins to an array of doubles now and
after all that was said and done like a
cherry on the top you put the return
value which is now a double and then you
jump back to whatever is the rest of
your execution so that's how the rest of
method works
posture show you an example hey okay
alright and computer is behaving
okay I can't believe this looked like
the presentation God's not with us and
this otherwise trust to make pro just
decided to look up maybe just missed a
problem let me see
well it's still
okay I can still go to my slides so
maybe that's really sufficient so
extremely simple terms what what it does
is that we have this try-catch
combinatory say okay let's invoke the
function and if we get the rewrite
exception this is all put in a in a
dynamic indico site in the caller then
if you get the exception then you do the
thing which to do the thing is we
compile the function store the new
version in a in a store it with the
immutable function data for later
invocations you need to invalidate all
all the already linked call sites that
were linking to the oil potentially old
version of the code including this call
site and they need to generate a
continuation version and you need to
jump into it however there is some
tricky stuff like you want to recompile
and press what if you need to recompile
a recursive function a mutually
recursive function that can have another
copy of it an arbitrary number of stack
frames further down we don't want to
exhaust the stack on cascading recompile
because if UD optimized something a
running the rest of method itself can
hit another point where it to itself
will be optimized and so on for that we
actually what we do is that instead of
invoking the continuation we return the
metal handle that's the continuation and
we fold it into a metal handle exacting
volker I don't expect that you'd
necessarily understand all of that and
just trying to illustrate the the amount
of first stuff that needed to take care
of and and then we go and bother the vm
hotspot the vm team and the team that
works on metal handles will come to them
it's like hey guys there's a sketch
Combinator it performs really poorly and
they're like yeah whoever uses that oh
well we use it everywhere oh you do yes
and we needed to be fast well it has a
fast path up to eight arguments that's
not good enough we have some benchmarks
and this is JavaScript where people
routinely pass I know 15 16 arguments in
the functions yeah it's ugly but you can
prevent them right so we need the fast
fast pass for the catch Combinator to be
fast no matter how many arguments and
what their types are and then they go
away and grumble and come back few
months later and say
of course getting right all of this it
really scrapes at your sanity at the
time this is my tweet from a few weeks
ago when I was working on nostrils
parsers so that it can skip we do a lot
of recompilation so you it's nice to
skip already in the parser things that
you don't need like nested functions and
I have this great board game ktulu gloom
that I like to play with my wife and
kids and the I I said I can start to
straighten my work with the with with
cards from it where you like inflict the
cut game is about inflicting the misery
on them or on members of a family that
are put in your care and this is one of
those like Delft to the minus 20 points
in the right hand side we have also this
like little icon for for special
insanity modifiers and this is my
colleague Marcus the in deep thinking
about some JavaScript object shape
problems so come work for us Nelson has
an extremely simple type hierarchy in
long double an object and we just we any
of those can be widened then it's
monotonic so we can never end up with a
with a circular thing while the
optimizing the optimization will think
about is really just a stepping and
alert lattice of type tuples because
every point in your function that can be
optimized has a current type right so if
you like four points you'll start with
like int int int everything isn't it I'm
so happy I'm so optimistic everything
will be an int everything will be great
and then you'd be optimized and say well
maybe the first argument was a J's for
long was along but everything else will
still be an end and then maybe something
does the optimizer what happens is you
have any input to your function and you
try to run it and sometimes you have the
your data flow pipeline which is at
first is int wide and then whenever
something gets stuck in it you widen it
a little bit and carry on and eventually
you hit a point in the lattice that
works for all the data that you have
thrown so far on your
to a function well maybe some million
iterations later something will come
again that will widen it but hey the
machinery is still there you will do it
then but usually things stabilize and
then you have the super pessimistic
bottom of the lattice on the right which
is everything is an object sorry
sometimes I don't need to be optimistic
like if you are doing a multiplication
of two numbers but you know that you
feed it into something that trunk it's
the value to sign 32-bit int then we
don't bother again a nice place a nice
reason for using static static type
analysis is that if you know if you have
this pattern it's using Azam's AS to
force the arguments to be and we just do
one on I'm all here and don't carry it
and don't worry about the over falls
because they chopped it off by the or
zero anyway oh and then there's this
thing where okay so are we and compile
time if you re compiling code but are we
in compile time well we not JavaScript
does not define compile time in the
runtime and just says here's the source
code executes it right anything that's
in between specification doesn't care
and what we can do here is that one of
the realizations was that way it's a
dynamic language you jump into a
compiler but you're actually running you
have the values of all the variables and
objects in the lexical scope we can use
them yay so what we do is that we can
actually skip several of these steps in
the compile in the type lattice for
instance if I invoke a function that
takes an object and I retrieve two
properties from it o dot X and know that
why at first I will start with the
assumption that X is in Y is in and
their multiplication will be an end so I
have the my type lattice has these three
ends at starting point and then I invoke
it with this object literal over both x
and y are doubles so when I retrieve odo
dot X I will fail to retrieve it as an
int I need to recompile the function so
I derail the execution into the compiler
but what I do now is that naively I
would just say well ok
autotext is a double now but although I
might still be an end I will be
optimistic about it and then I start
running the new version and the dodo
twat also fails being an int and then I
need to recompile again okay oh damn it
ok although twice also double let's
recompile again with this in mind and
carry on so that's two recompilation but
we cut that down to one because when we
compile all of X we actually tell the
compiler to try to evaluate side-effect
free expressions so if always just an
ordinary local variable and the y is a
property with no get there so it doesn't
have any side effects you know it's just
the field getter it will actually peek
into it and if it says well that's a
double as well I would just omit the
code to be a double so we we curb the
enthusiasm so to speak of the compiler
if you know and it really pays off and
you have things like this this is
actually the octane box2d benchmark that
does things like this now imagine if
these are all doubles and we would
always just presume that one of these is
a double and the rest can still be in
and you would recompile the function
evaluate the next expression oh damn it
I need to recompile again and go back
and just it would it would crunch
through it but it would be slow it would
be horrible for warmup time and with
this basically whenever it hits
recompilation it will try to peek at the
values of other available variables and
just try to evaluate them and and and
preemptively the optimized basically so
static type inference a dynamic language
runtime is also a sort of an oxymoron
right except it isn't because at the end
of the day we are targeting a static
language runtime about static virtual
machine sorry jvm is statically typed it
does it has separate operands for
arithmetic on enzymatic alongs when
identical doubles and so on so what we
do is we do actually calculate types of
expressions and local variables and we
do a bunch of propagated
do the propagation as you could imagine
its standard compiler stuff it's not
terribly exciting except for the fact
that we did it and be so extremely we
saw extreme benefits after I spent
forward three months from january to
march this year writing the static type
influencer for in traffic it works
within a single function for mass horn
and the number crunching performance and
number crunching numbers they went
through the roof really crypto benchmark
are the benchmarks the three that are
heavy on calculations like box2d as well
they just got amazingly faster and
what's a super frustrating is that have
a bunch of example code that i was going
to live demo to you right now but i
cannot comment the tub out of my
presentation so i guess we're stuck with
me speaking and you believe in what I
say although I had slide saying that I'm
online so so there's a we need to handle
a bunch of freaky control flow situation
that you don't really think about a lot
like control flow into cash box right
okay so it's like okay how boring is
this but it has to be done it's the
problem problem with Java the the
blessing really with the java bytecode
is that it needs to be statically
verifiable so it means that you need to
be able to have a definite type for a
local variable at any time so what we do
is that if you can enter the catch block
or just fall out from a try-catch in
such a manner that the value of a might
be a double then you must ensure that no
matter how the execution reaches the
catch block it has to be a double now we
started with an int we define it as an
int but when you enter the try block
will just insert like a synthetic
widening into a double but on the other
hand is so wasteful because if it
doesn't go into the catch block now i
treat it as a double whereas i could
treat it as an int so what we do here is
that we keep to live values for the
variable so the way our storage for
local variables is is constructed is
that the variable I
we'll actually have assigned to bytecode
slots what one for its interval you and
one for its double value while it's
executing in a try block and whenever
it's whenever it has a live in valley it
will be used so if you print the a there
it will actually in a first line it will
actually use the interval you and you
assign it another int value what happens
here is that we store the int value into
the in slot we store the widened double
value into the double slot and I still
both of them alive and then when the a
equals two point one comes around we say
well it's now defined as double and the
int value is now dead and then when you
but this all ensures that when you enter
the catch block the int value is dead
there anyway but you will always have a
live double value even if you somehow
went to the catch block because one of
the prints through an exception which it
won't do ever but just for illustrating
purposes so these are things that we
need to be solved because of Java static
verification of types and because we
didn't want to just stupidly widen the
value into int for the sake of the catch
block if it's not necessarily true it
works for other things as well not just
catch blocks right you can have an if
block where if through something and
then you have a long gif block that's
manipulating variables but they are
never used outside or you use
differently outside so we try to try to
keep the value as narrow as possible so
here here's another example in the if
block if you assign i equals 1 then the
Y will actually use the interval you
into it then we exit the X block then
you need to widen it and this is real
classical control flow join points a
type type coordination but again it's
not specifically interesting because of
the fact that we do it it says it's not
specifically interesting because it is
what it is it's it's all the type theory
stuff it's interesting to see that we
did this in our JT and base dynamic
language and we did read quite big
performance benefits from doing it which
again might not be there were surprising
but at least now we know that it works
we do a bunch of dead code elimination
as well we did have to use something
that's called type liveness oh I spent
maybe a week like in a shower during the
runs trying to figure out a liveness
analysis algorithm on a SD turns out you
can or maybe you can but it's it would
be horrible that's because alignments
analysis always goes backwards in the
control flow nasd is not really well
cared for that so it's not a luxury
really because javascript has this brain
that thing where if you declare a
variable within a block it's live
outside of the block as well so in this
case it's fine X can remain being an int
because it's not used outside but if you
do but if you do this you actually use
it outside it actually needs to cope
with the fact that okay so let's imagine
that we didn't say I less than 10 but I
less than something that I don't know
what it is maybe we we didn't even enter
the loop body so X needs to be widened
to object but when do you widen it again
the static type proving for the Java
verifier makes it really hard to
eliminate like widening of x2 object on
every back edge of the loop which would
be horrible if you had to do it but we
don't have to so that's why it's not a
luxury to do I don't have time to talk
about a lot of things as a matter of
fact I think I'm completely out of time
but if you want to stick for another 3
minutes I can just tell you real quick
what is it that we want to go towards
with this right now this is a national
compiler pipeline the cogenitor right is
like more bold arrow and it is it is
where the heavy lifting right now
happens cult for optimistic operations
continuation handling self assignment
stores whatever we do all of that there
but they're not happy about it what I
want to do is I want to move it in a
previous phase of the compiler pipeline
doesn't exist yet that they call the
dynamic coach and that would be creating
something like a dynamic
byte code which would look something
like this so if you have a function
square you could emit something like
load X load while multiple return and it
would be the our library that would
convert that into what you have on the
right side figure out whether there is
any optimism that needs to be done and
omit the final byte code so the benefits
of this reuse right v8 has almost a
million lines of code nastran has
270,000 right now and the reason for
that is if you use a lot of everything
in the JDM I imagine if we can extract a
lot of things we have in ass horn and
give it to you as a reducible library
for the building dynamic languages
that's what I want to do my elevator
pitch for what I want to do in the
future with this project is like llvm
only for dynamic languages on the on the
JVM basically give you this almost
bytecode except you can use symbolic
identifiers and don't really care about
types and it will run your static type
inference proved as much types as it can
and deal with the optimistic
recompilation for all the types that
cannot prove statically that's my
ultimate goal for this and these are the
various examples a lexical scope Gators
right almost every dynamic language has
lexical lexical scoping JVM doesn't have
it that's also something that we can
just just fix for you so in your in your
thing you can just be getting you can
just say like load X and you don't have
to worry where the X is defined in your
lexical scope we can just make sure that
if it's outside of your current local
scope then instead of a local load from
bytecode slot we can we can do an
optimist together from your scope Guinea
and so on and so on so that's that's the
thing summary is in some things are
really hard to do here static analysis
the whole thing with the Thai
specialized on stack replacement I
didn't even talk to you about our array
representation optimization of built-in
like Ray push pops drink
heart and things like that this whole
optimistic on stock replacement solution
and we have solved a bunch of these
problems with NASA on and we like to
offer them eventually as a reusable
library and what we also need for that
is a suitable code representation as it
turns out asd is too high level jvm
bytecode is to statically typed we need
something in between that hits the sweet
spot which would be which would be this
in my imagination something that is very
similar to bytecode except that you
don't have to worry about this bunch of
bunch things I just explained to you all
right that's all I had apologies for
shooting and thanks for listening</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
