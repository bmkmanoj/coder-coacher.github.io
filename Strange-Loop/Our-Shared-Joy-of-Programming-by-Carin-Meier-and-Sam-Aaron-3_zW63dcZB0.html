thrilled to be talking about joy and
even more I'm thrilled to be
collaborating with Sam Erin ELC and talk
with shortly and MedX and it should be a
lot of fun so the way this is gonna work
is I'm gonna talk for like a small
amount of time and then Sam is gonna
come in and he's gonna talk for a small
amount of time and then if everything's
willing we're gonna have live coded
music and dancing robots but so much
stuff could go wrong there's like so
many failure points but it'll be fun
we're all in this together right so so
let's get started so when I meet someone
new and they ask me what I do and I say
I'm a software developer and if they're
not you know in our community they kind
of look at me and the question comes
their tongues and they say do you like
that may be followed by isn't that
boring and I look them straight in the
eyes and I say I love it which kind of
confuses them a little bit more and they
usually follow up and say like why
so I usually follow this up with a
question that I asked them I ask them
have you ever had flying dreams you know
like when you're little and like you
float up in your dream and all of a
sudden you're like oh my gosh
I'm flying this is so frigging cool well
that's how I feel like I'm when I'm in
the zone coding and I still look a
little bit confused
so I'll ask them another question have
you ever had one of those dreams where
like you finally understand it all
Larry's hands then but have these dreams
and then you forget it like right when
you wake up
has anybody ever like remembered it when
they woke up because that would be
really cool Wow excellent excellent
nice well that's how I feel when I
finally solve a programming problem it's
awesome and if they're still confused
and they're still listening to me they
haven't run away I tell them about when
I was little and I like on a summer
morning I was eight that eight years old
and I bicycles as fast as I could to my
favorite playground because in this
playground Miren
there was this grove of trees that was
like magical to me it was it was just
like a magical place full of wonder and
at that moment I would look around in
the trees and I was utterly convinced
that any moment I would see a unicorn
and that's the same Wonder in all I feel
when I'm exploring a new technology so
all these things are why I love
programming so much and together
they're sort of the personal joy of
programming and yeah I love it but it's
fragile right you need to take care of
it because it can be diminished it can
you know seem like it might disappear
but luckily there's some things that you
can do they're common sense that we all
know but it's always good to go over
them again to take care of your personal
joy so one of them is course is take
care of yourself get enough sleep I know
especially after this conference I want
to like stay up to 2 or 3 a.m. and you
know look at all the interesting papers
and languages that have been presented
but after a few days of that the rest of
my joy gets pretty diminished likewise
you know take care of yourself eat good
food exercise
and of course keep interested and keep
learning keep that flame alive and all
of you are certainly doing this by
attending this wonderful conference for
me my passion is closure
I love closure and I remember when I was
first playing with closure and also
these parrot ar.drone quadcopters which
are fabulous and I was late night one
night after the kids are in bed and I
had the closure repple open and I was
trying to get the quadcopter and send it
the UDP commands actually take off and I
had it right next to me and I pushed the
wrap-up command and it took off and I
totally wasn't expecting it and I
screamed I was like oh my gosh it worked
and at that moment I was flying with the
drone it was great so we've talked about
things that can keep your joy strong
that you have under your control
but sometimes stuff happens that's
totally out of your control right a life
happens sickness happens illness happens
loved ones pass away and in fact I lost
a dear friend and colleague and mentor
of mine this spring and quite frankly I
was devastated joy just totally left the
world it was grey for me even the
closure code and the programming that I
loved just wasn't there and I knew that
this was part of the normal grieving
process but it was still really really
hard and I remember one night I was
sitting at the kitchen table again
trying to get interested in something
and I had the closure repple open and I
was trying out this pop program called a
library called overtone which enables
you to make music with code enclosure
and I don't know music at all I can't
read music
I've never played an instrument in my
life but somehow with code I was able to
make sounds and even music and that
point it was like a ray of light like
the joy
'we had finally filtered back into my
life again and I thought this was really
fitting because it wasn't the joy my joy
that reached me it was a shared joy of
the community that came to me in that
dark time because overtone is an
open-source open-source project created
by Jeff rose and Sam Aaron and they took
though joy and they shared it with the
community which was then shared with me
and in fact the song that I finally
managed to play even though I have no
musical talent at all was a song from
Daft Punk and that made me smile and cry
but that was okay and it was good and I
thought it was fitting also that the joy
that I felt was from the community
because a person that I was grieving for
during that time was Jim Wyrick who
passed away this spring and a lot of you
may have known him he is create a rake
he loved music he was a wonderful
speaker and teacher and he spoke here at
strange lip in 2012 so we missed you Jim
he was always filled with joy he was
filled with personal joy full of wonder
and excitement for new things whether it
was Y Combinator's or robots and he took
this joy and he shared his joy with the
community through open source through
teaching through speaking all over the
world and just inspiring other people
and he was a true caretaker of this
shared joy in our community he always
always treated others with kindness and
respect there were no stupid questions
with him he enjoyed talking with
beginners as well as experts and it
didn't even matter to him if he were a
programmer I would remember to office
I'd come back from lunch and he was
showing the maintenance worker his drone
that he was working on and explaining
the whole Rock library it just truly
didn't matter he was sharing his joy
with everyone so our shared joy is so
important not only does it increase our
personal joy because sharing joy
increases it but it also binds us
together as a community this is why we
are all here and it lifts us up in times
where we need help or we're you know
just in a dark place but most
importantly it makes us more than
ourselves so I would like to say thank
you I'd like to say thank you for being
part of the community that I love so
much and I urge you all to keep it
strong with joy love respect and
kindness and of course music robots and
unicorns so I'm going to turn it over to
Sam now and I might be hooking up some
robots while he's talking
hello hello what a beautiful talk I
don't know how to move on from there I'm
gonna stand over here maybe I'm some
errand here's my slides are we no it's
not even okay I need to stay over here
the range is there so you might know me
as one of the guys who created overtone
they don't here used overtone that's
amazing thank you very much thank you
it's beautiful and when we talk about
sharing our joy of programming a lot of
my joyful programming comes exactly from
hearing people using my software and
it's a really beautiful thing and it
inspires me to carry on and one of the
ways I'm trying to encourage people to
use the kinds of things I'm doing the
main joy for me is as promoting and
communicating the the creativity that
you can have when you can code the new
things that we can do not just coding us
for apps and websites which is something
we hear all the time and as
professionals that's probably where we
get most of us of employment from but as
we know coding is so much more than apps
and websites right and so what could it
be it could be a fall of what a new form
of interacting with music so this is me
and Jonathan we are meta X we were
performing here at Strange Loop that's a
photo of us performing just a couple of
nights ago and you can see we've got the
code behind us protected we've got these
crazy devices which are data structures
or the physical data structures they're
actually there's persistent data
structures backing there every time we
press a button creates new events that
event receives in a mutable list of all
the other button presses you've had an
entire session and you can in the
function you can actually say well
what's happened before and I'm gonna do
something new based on that some pretty
cool stuff and what we're trying to do
though is communicate that what the
newness of the exciting things you can
do with coding that no one really
understands and and that's not just to
you guys I mean it is clearly to you
guys but it's to everybody else right
because it's I find it so frustrating
when I try and talk to people about
programming and as Karen was saying no
one really understands so here we are we
actually perform in musical venues and
festivals and we're actually starting to
people
go I never realized coding could make
music I never realized that you could
actually do interesting things with code
I thought it was really boring right and
it's a problem but the other problem is
like it's really complicated and this is
like the kind of setup we use and I'm
happy with this I mean this is this
crazy Emacs life thing which I wrote
with like GSL shaders in the background
it's really hard to read the text with
the distinct mood around but it looks
awesome so that's why I'm doing it good
it's about that's the whole deal right
and so but if we try to share the joy of
coding with more people this is a way
for them to be inspired potentially by
what you could do but it's not what they
can do now and that's a problem if we
want to get more people doing things we
need to make the path to get to
somewhere like this if that's where they
want to go as easy as possible and so
this is where the Raspberry Pi
foundation came in they came along and
said we'd really like what you're doing
something that's crazy music stuff is
there any chance you could make
something like this for the Raspberry Pi
thinking crikey it's gonna be tough so i
ported overtone and it took seven
minutes to boot so it's like that's not
going to fly so out of rewrite of
rethink and rewrite something so and
that's all so basically that was useful
in a classroom so how do we provide an
environment that can can do something
like this in this kind of environment
and that's tough right it's not just
about isn't easy to use it's also can I
get buy-in from teachers no do teachers
think this is actually valuable to teach
well no and but they'll get there I'm
sorry I've got a Trojan horse I'll show
you in a second it's really awesome
which i'll which are getting to
understand it and so also they have
establish all these political issues
about programming languages and what's
the appropriate one and what's good for
apps and websites and all sort of
nonsense so you've got to deal with all
this kind of issues yes this raspberry
pie is a very small cheap computer it's
like 35 dollars it's a complete Linux
box you just plug in your television and
some USB keyboard or Mouse and you've
got a full computer and so that's
amazing but it's really really low
powered so that what you can do in it is
very limited so it keeps you honest as a
programmer and so I built this thing
called sonic PI which I'll demonstrate
now
oh no I won't do this right now at that
moment and I've also created a scheme of
work so in the UK it's really awesome
you have this new computing curriculum
in schools which is a going to start now
so we're going to teach the whole way
across from from small children but just
before University computer science and
so that's causing a huge problem with
the teachers because a lot of teachers
IT teachers who are skilled in teaching
office skills which is kind of useful
but it's clearly not really what what we
wanted to teach them is not programming
it's not understanding how the computer
works it's not understanding that they
can make the computer do what they want
with it it's just using it as a tool for
emails and spreadsheets and logo design
and yeah so I have a schema works this
is a lesson plan for teaching computer
science introductory computer science
using this sonic PI system and I'll get
to what sonic PI's in a moment but once
I build that once I've used it and it
was fun and people with teachers are
using it it was it was enjoyable the
problem was as a system for live coding
music it was absolutely terrible it just
made these beeps and bleeps and you
could like you could make the beep
separate with time but the timing was
broken you know so and you could use
threads
I taught threads to get things like the
bassline and melody at the same time but
again when you use threads although you
could hear them concurrently they were
totally out of sync and on the raspberry
pi was just utterly diabolical but the
kids didn't mind it right they were
enjoying these beeps and sleeps but I
was thinking about how do I it's the
thing which is fun for teachers to use
and kids to play with but it's not
something that I'd want to use in a
performance I wouldn't go and use this
thing so I started embarking on thinking
about how we can expand somewhat PI's so
one of the things we did is we got some
money from the Arts Council so the UK
has this thing called the Arts Council
which it has a massive pot of money and
gives it out for artistic pursuits so
you apply for it so we applied for it
and we we've got these artists of
national artists to engage to learn how
to program so they they haven't
programmed they're all like really top
professional artists in the UK doing
really amazing installations so we
convinced them to come learn how to
program and then they were taking some
PI and I was coding essentially our
thoughts at five ways and then explored
five different experts
approaches for him to do their art
pieces a couple of the examples Rob
Smith he he did a very nice project
where he used the camera in the
Raspberry Pi to take a photo converted
the photo into pixels and their pixels
into audio and then played the audio out
of the speakers and then wrote a little
program to then turn it back into a
picture so you can see here on the right
but a very pixelated grayscale image of
trees now for us that's not super
exciting maybe but for everybody else in
the world it's really amazing it's like
magic
how do you turn a picture into sounds
and then that sounds back into a picture
my first is about information and
abstraction and data structures and
representations and it's all clearly
obvious to us but these are the things
we missed when we try and communicate to
other people the importance of this and
the value and the benefits of be able to
see information as as as the conduits
and a new ways to communicate new kinds
of information another beautiful thing
is Kate she she she was really
struggling for a long time and she was
she the most autistic thinks she was
doing with this Raspberry Pi because she
was so frustrated with it well she
realized it got really hot and so she
thought what can I do this I can melt
chocolates
then she put her on a bar chocolate and
she melted the chocolate and that was
that this is the sofa it's like a sign
of frustration but and the last minute
she came round and she did this which is
a live-in cohesiveness picture but it's
a live code of performance so she was
writing event handlers which were
responding to her key presses which then
played sounds of key presses so she was
banging on this keyboard really hard and
the sounds coming back with more
keyboard presses based on the events and
as she was coding she was changing the
sounds into new sounds and this
performance evolved into this really
beautiful thing and she'd never coded
before and here she was doing a live
coded performance in front of a whole
bunch of people as her artistic outcome
and and that said I thought that was a
really beautiful thing and then we
applied for a whole ton of money like
130 thousand pounds and we got it and
the deal was to take sonic PI this beats
the seats which I haven't shown you yet
because it was very embarrassing
which is also installed on all the
raspberry PI's which is pretty cool
we thought well how do we take this and
to make something that I'm happy with
performing with that's actually going to
be interesting for musical perspective
and can we not just use it to teach
computer science in schools can we use
computing to teach music can programming
languages be a bonafide a musical
instruments in schools and so I created
a single sonic Pi which I'll very
quickly show you I also have a Mac
version that's different get out of this
thing here we are this is sonic PI it
looks absolutely identical on the
Raspberry Pi this is a very basic app
you can see I've got like a
documentation system with a tutorial
welcome friends welcome friends and yeah
you could now you can I do all sorts of
cool stuff like stretching samples and
parameterization and we've got envelopes
so like you can attack things with
decays and phasing in and like full adsr
envelope stuff and this explains what's
going on and the simplest program you
can write that's pretty cool but to get
rid of that it's like this if I can make
it sound we hear that no you get that I
can't hear it at all so I trust stuck in
here to the sound of the tool is that
possible right okay right so you can
press play 15 that's the first program
that's like the hello world of sonic PI
and you don't have to do any like
project creation or all that kind of
nonsense I'll create a new class or
instantiate something constructors and
no you just write the word play in a 50
and it can make it bigger if you want
and then you're done if you want to make
a melody throw you right seat for sort
of noir point five seconds and play
octave higher wicked Rin and then this
is what they do right so this is
actually this is enough to do most of
western notation these two commands like
time is when to play the notes and
pictures how high right and so with
these two things you can go absolutely
nuts you can and so they do actually
kids will just write play sleep play
stink for hours but then you could have
to say well once you've got play sit for
hours maybe you might want to use some
structures I can do some loops so I
should have looped this guy
I think you start to understand the
loops going round like a circle you can
actually hear that 62 is played at the
same time as 50 because it's Luke round
so if you want to make them separate it
put on the sleep in we go and then this
certain realized that the actually
changes since I won't do that now I'll
do it a second and they could also play
sample so this is a corn this is very
quiet I'm sorry I know I didn't make it
louder oh thank you very much louder
that's good we want louder right so they
can play that and then the girls have
changed a rate so this is we can explore
different genres of music right so
that's like drum and bass there we are
what about hip hop old school early hip
hop let straight out a coping style and
then learn to like gather or something
just do 1.5 well we're off and so think
they've got it what the hell the three
numbers and so you can talk about
importance of that and then because the
other thing is if you try and get kids
engaged a in games you say to them right
we're gonna make a game in Python by
game whatever and you say to them and
they go back that's amazing
we can do that we could make a game so
yes we could make a game I'm a
programmer I can show how to do this and
then you say to them so what kind of
game do you want and they say right I'm
on a horse and I'm on a hill I'm looking
down at a castle and I've got my army
behind me and we're gonna storm it yeah
and I'm going to plan the strategies of
the attack and I'm going to make sure
and you think well I can do you a circle
that's yours
anything like when I was a kid that was
amazing whoa
but today with the Xbox it's not gonna
happen so what's the equivalent of so if
we can do this guy like Luke sample our
man to sleep for the sample duration of
loop amen let's make it back a normal
rate oh sure it's me a second and you do
minus 1 but then the cool thing is even
put some like randomization here so all
right so let's go either minus 1 or 1 or
not 0.5 and let's choose one of those
guys we all know there's like there's
two things we're seeing the first one is
that all music needs reverb I guess the
first low lesson so to get reverb we
just need to say with underscore effects
reverb do so we wrap whatever code you
want with with this stuff I need to
write correctly so now it's got reverb
and of course we need some bass so let's
get this some sample base seven lines go
right
we haven't seen it yet so how long have
I got Karen to talk I mean the two more
minutes alright so in the house system
there's some examples so like you can do
blue Monday by new order here we go so
like Blue Monday is like the drums one
two three four five six what difficult I
say seven eight one two right and then a
snare and then some some notes
so the cool thing is playing
like it's not modifying this girl
seventy
ah nice but I like questions ready
next time you know crazy could I follow
him
once you make between the 2 notes twice
as fast
was the randomization here
while he's actually losing the laughter
anyway impose it once you use that value
constant that
moving around that
for that another one which is quite fun
is this driving pulse this is like the
closest I've got to sort of deaf punk
like stones
again I can sort of change
now the cool thing about this rate is
that what I'm showing you here it was
quite fun I've taught all the constructs
in here to twelve year old children in
six weeks so there's nothing here the
twelve year olds can take after six
lessons at work
we get some echo
that's nice do that I'm gonna keep go
for ages and that's the nicely I'm gonna
train right going to London and I just
do that for whole journey and you do we
like sounds of the ocean no seriously
right no honestly this is a beautiful
thing that's available to you now like
you can if you want to on the train just
chill out and make some music
it's a beautiful thing really it's
beautiful
sorry for stopping you from laughing
ocean sounds and then I'll just finish
on this
as some tron by example
by sixty lines of code
that's fun right listen you can download
this now I'll give you URL if you email
me I'll make it I made it I was gonna
make a website which I've made but I
haven't actually put online yet so
you'll be able to easily download it
very soon if you want to play with this
now just just to finish off we gave a
workshop I've never got count two
minutes one minute new time go slides
right workshop me in the junction which
is like a Cambridge environments we've
got 60 kids programming we're told them
had a program in a week that did live
coding battles so this is they're
actually jamming on stage battling and
battling and battling and battling and
groups them came to battle and they had
a lot of fun it was joyful right and
these the people never realize that
coding was a beautiful thing and they
could make music with it the whole bands
are formed right so you've got these
guys here
piping their guitars into the laptop
with this girl here it's modifying and
changing I'm real time alright they
hadn't done this before a week before
more chorus this was amazing as this
ladder is just fantastic and we've got
the live coding with site pioneers get
ready to hear some proper music boom
we're looping bushes and lots of stuff
it's also decided on all the raspberry
PI's next to the Wolfram language and
Mathematica which is pretty cool sonic
pipe and the final point before I stop
now is that we're not at all anywhere
near completing this journey because
when I gave that first lessons to the
schools on the girl while there the
whole class gave me this beautiful car
lots of thank-yous and one of them was
thank you for making dull life as
computers interesting and almost reality
I don't know why I don't know why you're
clapping right I don't actually I don't
know why you're clapping because this is
depressing why is it people think this
is the starting point right clearly for
us it's not dull and lifeless but for
other people even after our lessons of
music in schools which is like crazy
cool they still think it's dull and
lifeless so it's really this is our
mission your mission my mission is to
change people's perspective or what
computing is to not make it Dylan lifers
and to make it badass and so one of the
approach we're trying to do is we're
going to try and demonstrate how badass
programming is with this new thing we're
gonna do is that right are you ready
Oh crikey right okay well I'm going to
strip off change gears we're gonna get
Jonathan long stage is my mic on - okay
great - wait wait we have to unveil the
surprise I'm gonna try and get this the
surprise the thing okay so this this is
Craig Craig and Dara where is he yep
there wait wait for it it's gonna be
awesome no expenses spent look at that
awesome okay so medics they're an
awesome awesome live coding band and the
way if you haven't heard them they're
playing at the City Museum the other
night so they do code closure code and
they generate music from the code so the
way it works is they're both jacked into
the same repple process creating the
sounds and what they're gonna do is ship
me off messages we're networked they're
going to ship me off messages of beat
and amplitude and then I have semi
choreographed moves but I'm still live
like repple giving them the combinations
of the robots so so many points of
failure right so we have the Sphero this
is one of the robots communicates via
bluetooth and if we're connected to it
we can get it to change color which is
totally cool I have my helper Devin here
is going to catch robots if they roll
off the stage
thank you so much this is a community
effort this really is so we also have a
rumba right okay let's see I was
connected before but once I move him
he's also connected by bluetooth it's
actually a rude tooth I sent my mother
getting messages I am getting messages
what are you getting what are you
getting
beep for what do they be 1525 b25 trust
us good yes we're good so let me see if
I can control the Roomba to the Roomba
if he's controlled well play a note you
couldn't hear he can like make music too
but we not as good as them and then we
also have this hexapod that is like
ultra cool so if he is he can go like so
yeah he's way cool
and we also have a drone and usually I
apply it like without a leash but in
this space it's going to be a leash and
it's anchored to a water bottle most of
the time it holds it if it but we'll see
so you try some spread some magic powder
on it yeah well we'll keep them over
here and we'll bring them over closer to
