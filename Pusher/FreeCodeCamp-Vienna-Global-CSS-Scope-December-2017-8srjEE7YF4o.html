scope today and here you can see the
topics touch and now it's a bit much
because especially when it goes into
using javascript and shadow Dom but I'll
try to keep it short
hopefully it's open 30 minutes yes so
what's this you always use a scope
what's this all about if ever an HTML
document and you apply CSS into it the
CSS applies to the whole document this
has been so for ever since the beginning
of CSS this means if you have a selector
this selector will match all elements in
the whole document it could match with
its if it's hard built so this is what
I'm talking about and there could be
many problems arising from that if a
match elements that I didn't intend to
match and has choice are just from some
examples where this is going to happen
so this is an example for a base
selector
I guess most most of your projects will
have some some kind of base selectors in
this case it's an h1 selector this
applies to every h1 element in your HTML
in our case we've got I don't see the
pointer is visible but I hope is it's
okay and just in this case you have got
to know each one element in as a heading
that's like an h1 element it's intended
to be but you always I have one in the
this button just to have a big button
because the normal text styles and the
path will be smaller otherwise so what
will happen like this that somebody says
okay no this font size of 24 pixels of
our headings is too less we got to
increase that so what will happen is
that you're about Miller of course
increase in size and this breaks the
design and difficult many elements that
are depending on such basic selectors in
your CSS this will be even more and
anakata
big project will have much many widgets
in there and then many pages you can't
keep up if checking every side effect
you're introducing by changing classic
physics lecturer so this is problematic
so what what could I do one solution
would be that you increase the
specificity of the selector for this
side button or the text size in the
pattern itself
this means you introduced this button
but an element selector this means this
style it get more specific but of course
you also have the problem that you've
got to find this these occurrences so
that you can fix them so this that's not
really a really good solution the next
problem is that of course everybody's
will introduce his own selectors for
that and they've got tons of selectors
for for the same things and nobody dares
to touch any basic selectors anymore
because it could have too much side
effects or too much impact the next
problem that could happen is that you
have a imagine on child element and
notice but the contrast is not very good
okay okay
for example you've got a task list here
with an S the task list of UL unordered
list items list items we've got tasks
and also we've we've got action buttons
and what we define with our rule here is
that the selector actions this these
buttons here in the list items the list
every part in this is its own this item
they should have a green text color this
works out well but what if we like to
have red tasks with items we introduce a
new selector called tasks task items
list item and this defines that the list
item color will get red but what happens
here is that we always don't match the
child elements we also merged action
buttons because there are also a list
items in the task items so this is
unintentional and it could very well
happen if occur at the third party which
in there in your see a button that you
override some styles that they didn't
want to override with first electric
defined for a task items a bad solution
would be if you said okay I want this
these buttons to be green so I'll define
the modifier important on the on the CSS
rule this is a bad idea because if
everyone starts to use important to
enforce matching rules as he says rules
then you won't have any idea what
happens if you introduce new elements
how does the rules will be get applied
it gets complicated that nobody could
read this code anymore and in a big
project is a horror I personally would
recommend never to use important but
sometimes you have to because when you
have got the third party widget which
says is a very high specificity can't
get around it but in your code please
don't use it a better solution would be
to increase the specificity of the of
the task item color rule by adding this
design here this defines that only
direct child atoms direct child list
items of the task items are being
matched this means this is these are
only the task items itself but the next
problem if that is that you've got a
memoir increasing specifically on your
CSS rules and she says specifically
isn't really simple issue because when
you introduce attribute selectors or a
child selectors or whatever this the
complexity of the CSS grows and nobody
understands what's going on this is not
another good good thing so a short round
above the issues one issue is the the
veneer intro when you integrate for the
part widgets that their own Styles
applied to the third-party widgets which
I didn't attend to another problem is
that nobody knows what the styles do
there's a ton of obsolete Styles the
nobility has to remove because
what could be the side effects where
else and that you use ever more specific
selectors to have your rules applied so
every other programming language aims
for some kind of modular approach or
tries to mimic it by using some
workarounds and how to do this with with
CSS
there are ways and we dive into that now
the first thing I'd like to talk about
this BAM which is block element modifier
it's in generates a semantic model which
includes HTML Styles code and user
experience but for this talk not focused
just on the naming convention thing
there's a naming convention used with
them they'll show you how that works but
BAM aims for in general is to have a
better readable CSS code and to promote
the use of of blocks and improve the
maintainability of CSS code so the first
part of them is blog and I'm showing you
a selector that could be used as a block
element element no I shouldn't say
shouldn't a element before a block what
is a block in BAM in in payment block is
some kind of component that is reusable
that could exist when its own for in our
case it could be a title widget the name
of the block always describes its
purpose not its style or its state just
its purpose a plugin BAM could include
other elements acting as their parent
because I'm saying always element that's
the the child off of a block for example
could be a sub line or the author tag of
a title widget this is an element now it
can't include other elements
it doesn't shouldn't nest other elements
in the beam structure it should always
it always depends on
Blagh can't exist on its own an element
always depend a long stood lock and
can't be somewhere on its own so notice
that the last part of them are the
modifiers the modifier belongs to a
block or an element and describes a
certain state or a specific style of a
block or an element this specific state
or style is a deviation of the default
style or state just for information the
syntax you see this separation of
element and blog and this this dashes
here between the element and the
modifier this style is called double
dash style their orders there are others
as well but I found this to be the most
readable so because I just showed you
these selectors the selector names now
but I guess that in your head already
have an idea how that HTML would look
like this is one of the benefits of them
that you always have have an idea how
the selectors and the HTML belong
together and you see now that we have
got here the the block elements of
studying this block element has a
modifier that is x-large
in this block we have the element sub
line and author and what I am to us it's
it improves the communication between
the ones I was writing CSS code around
to about new markup because of because
of these simple names and a clear
structure is structure of the selectors
you always know what is used where the
order could find this likely you have to
modify if Akata to make a modification
on the author class for example this is
very easy to locate in your code each a
search name you don't have to you don't
have to see how this is a somewhere up
in the Dom structure and selector for
T's and in combination with this parent
selected as a child
no you don't have to look for this just
search for this selector and adapt it
and that's it this is one of the
benefits what you can do in BAM is you
can change how you structure your HTML
you can moved for example you can I move
this author element you could move it
into this append element it's it's it's
what the problem doesn't it doesn't
break this lecture itself because the
selector is on the element you want to
style when you move the element around
in the structure it doesn't break the
selector this the rules in the finders
likely will still apply no problem what
you could also do is include other
blocks into your existing blocks for
example in this slide here I'm showing
that I've added an avatar block into the
title into the author element and this
this block brings its own styles its own
selectors with it so what you shouldn't
do is I said it before
you shouldn't nest these elements like
this here for example sup line and date
because what you're doing is you're your
coupling your HTML with your CSS code
you couple the structure of HTML the CSS
code it's it's more appropriate when
you're doing such a thing
most likely what you would like to
introduce in your block for example in
our case a date block which could you
use were somewhere else it's much a
better idea
some thing when nesting is okay is when
it's when it otherwise would be very
inefficient for example in our case we
have got a grid our grid is in the state
editing we are just editing some data in
a grid and we have grid cells as
elements of this grid blog if we
wouldn't let this lecture here we would
have to apply some kind of modifier to
every single grid cell which is very
inefficient for this case it's okay to
have some nesting here
but that's about as that the only
exception for when you should nest of em
selector this when you have to do it for
efficiency so what are the BAM benefits
when you get this
we got a BAM and setup in your team
everyone knows how to write selectors
everyone knows what blocks lameta
selectively look like everyone knows
what the elements negative look like
this simplifies communication everyone
knows what how to we will do generate
class names this is s is not directly
captive to HTML structure you have more
confidence when you change or an
existing style because you know that you
shouldn't any shouldn't be any side
effects to it yeah that's about it
the downside to Pam is that you will
generate a lot of class names a lot of
long class names not everyone likes that
I personally love it because I know what
this was about
what's this lake is about but there are
people who don't liked it very much and
of course everyone has to adhere to the
defined structure that's also something
that sometimes doesn't work but one of
the great things he said they can
include them in your even in your
project it's just you know there's no
tour or forum because they have to use
is you can use it for the smallest
project ok next up is USS modules what
is this or CSS modules about its roughly
speaking it's it's modifying your
sources as files in the source HTML code
so that CSS selector names are locally
by default this is an inspector or
something or a browser implementation
it's a step in a build process so for
example any use webpack or browserify or
something like that you know in your
build for your application
you bundle your sources when you
translate your assess to CSS when you
translate your typescript to JavaScript
you will know boots how to use a bundler
or a build tool and this CSS mode your
transformation is just as just an
additional step in your in your new
build of your project so how does it
look like for example when we got oh
PowerPoint has just crashed oh no works
again okay when you got this initial
code when you get an h1 element and this
selector here big title to have it work
with CSS models you need to rewrite it
you have to make this about it you have
to include as we have to rewrite your
HTML to be an es6 template string this
is just a simple example where use not
the original selector name in the class
as a class name but you import it from a
CSS file for those of you who are
already familiar with es6 imports will
think this is a bit strange how could I
import a module from a CSS file can't be
this is the trick that a CSS modules
does its includes its own CSS loader and
in web pack and what it does is it
parses this input CSS file and it gives
you a map this is this object here a map
object in the archives its name Styles
where every selector of the original CSS
file is a property of this map and you
may think of I show that you why should
I do that this is a JavaScript why would
I have to whether the want to do that
will see it just in a few seconds what
we do here we use the value that is
behind this property in our case we used
the name of the original slack topic
title
to inject it into our HTML and what this
look will look like I show in the next
slide you see that our original selector
name has been translated into something
else something very unique we have the
we can see of but it's a thing of
configuration about to include in your
in your final selection aims you can see
the source file name you can see the
original selector name and we see a hash
and unique hash here and when you use
this in our build process what we could
ensure is that we could use the very
generic class names like big turtle
because it's quite quite a generic class
name or it could just use big no problem
it will be replaced by something unique
in the output this ensures that you
don't have to worry about your selector
names because they will be in the final
reset they will be unique anyway this
seems a bit strange here to rewrite
under the ESX template string when you
have a look at how to use this and in
conjunction with react it's it makes
much more sense it's much more elegant
because when you use JSX templates what
you have right you're the culture of
writing almost looks like the original
HTML itself it's quite the same
principle of importing this this map
object but it looks much more elegant to
use it like so when I'm talking about
direct I also have to talk about angular
you could use CSS modus me if angular as
well if your user support loader like
like pekus but you also have to fall
back to this basic use except a string
syntax which isn't very so cool but I
will talk about something angular
provides since version 2.x later which
is much better than this
okay just round up what are the benefits
of CSS modules you can define your CSS
selector names like keyboard it's no
problem you can use the most generic
things which are semantically correct
for your use case it's much clearer to
read and you don't have to worry so much
about getting conflicts in your CSS like
the name says because everything is
locally depending on the area where you
built this dependency between the style
and the HTML if you do it for every
component you are generating then there
isn't any any problem at all you can
write planes users you don't have to
write something like CSS and JavaScript
I'll show that later it's it's like you
the CSS you used to write it's it's not
it doesn't look any different in the
source and other planes he says goes to
browser of course this only makes sense
if you got a bigger project it doesn't
really make much sense if you've got a
little little project starting because
it's a bit overkill to have it all set
up and configured because you need to
also to set up your web pack or
browserify to include CSS modules
loaders and and so on it's a bit
overkill for little projects I got to
say and it also just makes sense if you
got some kind of templating going on if
you just writing HTML and applying CSS
you don't have some kind of templating
framework then it doesn't make sense to
to go for this so now we're coming into
CSS and JavaScript but first when I read
this I thought oh thank god goodbye CSS
but no not really it wasn't for the
what's behind that what is this
CSS in JavaScript there are many
different frameworks with if those you
can do a CSS and JavaScript in general
they're just using two different
approaches on how to achieve that the
first approach is to emit a CSS again
into a style tag in your head of your
of your document and the other approach
is to apply inline styles to every
element you want your you want to have
styled the second approach is a bit more
tricky because inline styles don't
support things like pseudo states like
harbour or a media queries or keyframe
animations so there are these frameworks
that are going this approach also always
some kind of tricks in there to support
is most of the time this will be
JavaScript event listeners so that you
can achieve a Harvick effect with Indian
styles PowerPoint doesn't do it doesn't
do anything okay let's go again so the
most the most known frameworks for doing
this for the first approach is style
components for the emission of CSS if
together with react and react native and
for a second approach this is something
like radium for react or so and but I
will show something else I will show you
Aphrodite because generally it's it's
more like framework independent you can
use it with plain HTML change plain
JavaScript or something other the one
that generates your styles as styles in
the style tag of your document and
inject styles as needed it also has of
course because it's generating real
success it supports or pseudo queries
and some things like hover and media
queries on keyframe animations
out-of-the-box there's no problem to it
so I'm not showing you and Aphrodite she
s GS example the first thing on the left
side this is our style sheet definition
this is our selector pick title from the
previous example now but I added some
some additional properties here and you
can see that we are writing our CSS
selector as JavaScript object and we
always include here something special we
always include support for a harbor
state of this for this lecture and this
destoyed should create here this is
part of the effort ideas API and how to
use it we see on the right side I'm
fetching an element here where I inject
my HTML and then I use this this style
speak title when I use this selector
property at this moment I'm accessing it
aphrodite injects the Styles for
immediate document era at this very
moment this also means that if it got
some definitions here that they aren't
using on your current page or something
like that they also want code injected
in the style tag this is cool and if I
have a look at what these Styles big
title property is holding we see
something similar like at the CSS
modules like at the CSS modules thing we
see the original select rename' and you
also see a unique hash following so if
you have a look at the output first of
course
when I'm hovering over the elements this
how I style it get apply it just works
nicely so I'm just showing you the
output this is the CSS that will get
injected into the document we see the
original selector name and we also see
the hash trailing it which makes it
unique what we all see is very much as a
many important modifiers I have read in
Dhaka in the documentation that is this
is intended to make integration with
existing frameworks easier yeah you can
turn it off if you want this is just a
configuration thing so yeah just a
roundup about the different approaches
to CSS in JavaScript most of of these
frameworks use some kind of injection of
CSS into the document means you define
your selectors and your styles and all
of this will get injected into the
document header because it's much more
efficient to have real serious as the
project could work much better if you
easily could apply to the elements this
is this is the reason
and what always was always an
interesting since most of these
frameworks are built around react most
of them also supports our site rendering
is quite cool in my opinion
so a bit what's what's unusual is that
you now have not a plain CSS anymore you
have to register as in JavaScript this
is a bit awkward at the beginning
because you have some different very
different kind of offering you also
don't use the sass or less anymore
because you're doing your styled in
JavaScript this isn't necessarily just a
downside it could also be upside because
you're unlimited
through what some players are doing for
you read your own transformations and do
what you want in a real programming age
JavaScript so next thing I am going to
show you is what you can do with shadow
Dom if you already worked with web
components you've probably heard of it
it's what it does what what does shadow
Dom do it's quite a it does encapsulate
parts of your HTML structure so that
this is the HTML and the CSS living in
that encapsulation is not interact also
is not it's decoupled from the rest of
your HTML page and it could encapsulate
CSS and HTML without any further tools
it's just it's just a process doing it
for you it's a quite a new spec it's
it's just it's not finished yet it's in
active development and if I have a look
for example at the Chrome browser when
you use html5 video tag the video tag
itself the contours in it these are real
HTML elements the video player in chrome
is just a web component this means that
for example the slider and and the
volume button are real HTML elements so
it doesn't look like I've got a simple
example here I have a regular h1 element
I have an
mint will hold my shadow Dom I need a
host for it in the document and I have
this CSS declaration in the outside HTML
I'm declaring it with important on
purpose here to show that it hasn't
applied to the shadow Dom element it's
still red and with this JavaScript code
I am generating the shadow Dom and
fetching my host for it and with my
element that had shadow if this this API
I'm generating strata Dom element inside
my host and inside this host
I'm injection I'm injecting this style
and this element another h1 element with
the style h1 declares a color of red so
if if this HTML snippet if this style
would exist in the outside document it
would get overwritten by this important
declaration here this means that both of
these h1 elements would be blue but but
because of shadow Dom it is encapsulated
so it does the outside style doesn't
touch the inner element so but if you
are using like like shadow Dom widgets
for your application how do you even
style is something in there then because
this your corporate design you're using
the face design may not match what's
what's being provided by the fat pad
widget library so there is a way to do
that and this is for example like
polymer GS what they are using is you
declare each CSS custom properties or
CSS variables as you could name it and
these custom properties will pierce the
shadow Dom boundary so when we have a
look here I've adapted the style in the
shadow Dom to use this bar to have to
take the value of this CSS
of this CSS variable but also to provide
a default value in this case it's red
but because I'm declaring a nice GSS
variable outside to have the cons of
green it will get applied instead of red
so this is a way to style third-party
widgets which are basic based on shadow
Dom the good thing is that whatever you
are whatever you're using needs to
support it
you can't overrule any style into the
into the shadow Dom body by accident
whatever library you're using whatever
part of it you're using must expose this
must must have used for this CSS
variable so you can't destroy anything
in the indiv individual yeah one bad
thing at the moment is that its support
for shadow Dom isn't very very great
unfortunately browsers like Chrome
Safari Opera supporting it unfortunately
one of the biggest alternative browsers
Firefox isn't supporting it at the
moment this is still in development and
Internet's Pro and edge are considering
implementing shadow Dom considering when
you want to use shadow Dom today you
have to use polyfills
there are polyfills of course but the
problem with those is that they are
emulating shadow Dom if javascript is
lisslow that's a very big downside you
can use it as a progressive enhancement
for example when you have got to look at
Twitter app Twitter timeline in browsers
like Chrome every every element or every
tweet in your timeline will be a shadow
Dom element and for other process it's
for Specter an iframe this the
individual tweets will be embedded as
iframes
so unfortunately support isn't very
great at the moment so
quite a time ago I mentioned that
angular had Christophe in this regard
and it's since the version 2 it supports
something called view encapsulation
we've got two approaches how to handle
your CSS the first thing is the default
it's the the emulated mode you don't
have to define this inclination emulated
on your component it's its default but
it's just included here for
demonstration what it does is so what
you have to do is you you just define
your style as a style us is to study
wealth property and you just write a
selector plain and simple h1 color red
that's it and you can see this is the
restart the rendered we start with two
h1 components and you see that the
second one isn't affected by that so how
does it work
when you have a look at the output and
you could see that in our component
markup every every single element in the
component markup gets a new attribute
this energy content c1 and every
component you're using in your output
will increase this number here will have
its own attribute applied to all
elements in it and when you have a look
at what will what will get in check the
styling in the output you also see it is
attribute selector here this makes sure
that the Styles you are using in your
component style should only apply to to
that component which is quite cool
because they don't have to configure or
do anything else just use it and the
second way to do is angler has a second
way you could also say my view
encapsulation should be native what does
this do now
this uses shadow Dom this generates
shadow Dom fare components and what's
the cool thing is you don't have to do
it yourself the framework does it for
you and when you have a look at it in
the chrome developer tools you see
that's really a fair atom component and
also of course when you have really CD
style here
this doesn't bleed out of a document
this is style definition here so I've
could only touch every topic briefly of
course because of quite a many of them
every method has its upsides and
downsides of course ours depends on your
project and if the framework you're
using if you could use or should use or
can't use some some of these approaches
I showed you and in the end you have to
probably mix different approaches so
that it suits your needs so I'm finished
now thanks for listening you know only
