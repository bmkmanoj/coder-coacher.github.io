thing about my startups is it always
starts with starts with these two
questions what F and my first startup
was back in 2010 I had this question
what if we do art exhibitions along
staircases because staircases are dull
depressing what if we do art exhibitions
along them will more people take them
will it be greener will people meet
along staircases and in 2011 I realized
it's not making me money
the next what-if question is what if I
don't have money in my bank account for
a few more months so I I went back to
something that made me money
so going forward in 2017 my new what-if
question is what if we take a chessboard
and we make it into half of its size so
how many of the people here know how to
play chess and how many find it very
exciting and how many find it like sort
of boring and have not played it for a
couple of years so okay guys so so if
somebody really wants to play chess you
can play half just with them so so like
this started back in 2000 like came back
in 2015 there's this NGO near my home
and they teach football to slum kids so
I had been seeing those kids for a while
and I saw that there's a there's a gap
in their confidence levels compared to
the kids who live in societies next door
you know so when they started learning
football they got really good at it and
they shared the same field so they
started playing together and it really
helped those kids in the slum areas and
I'm sure it also helped the kids in in
the societies because they got a wider
perspective of society they were I'm
sure they've felt happier that they had
more so that was great I was really
impressed with seeing these changes over
over an ear of these kids getting good
with football and they got really good
at it so so then I asked one of those
kids because I thought they had really
improved their personality outside of
the school I wanted to know how they
were doing in their schools
and well what do you think how would how
were they doing in the schools
after learning football and like being
exposed to so like okay how many think
they were doing better and how many
things they were doing same okay so
interesting like all of us thought they
were doing better but actually it was
not the case they were still struggling
at school like they were like it was
still as bad for them like they were
just looking for the school to get over
and them to get on the football ground
so so I thought okay if football can do
so much for them outside of their school
means if they need to get more
confidence on their mental skills then
it has to be chess and I was in love
which is already like it helped me get
through times when I had no money in my
bank account and so so there are some
other interesting stories about chess in
India there's a there's a there's a
village in Kerala where they had alcohol
problems and somebody learned how to
play chess and soon the whole village
was playing chess and what happens in
villages is that after it gets dark
there's not much to do and that's when
you feel like drinking so when I go to
villages I feel like drinking after six
o'clock so so when they when they got
when they started playing chess it gave
them something to do and and and it
became the chest village of India I mean
not not many people in India also know
about it but but it was really
interesting so chess has this impact on
community it has this impact on
education so coming back to chess like I
wanted to teach these kids chess but a
lot of these kids found chess boring so
I thought okay I could apply the
principles of gamification to chest
let's make it simple and as they get
better at it and as they get hooked to
it we can increase the size of chess
board so this is a half chess board and
that's some other experiment I did in
half chest like I made a piece crap
which moves zigzag and and I started
giving like I started like recently I
started going to these small places and
Just Giving like to three hours of chess
lessons and one of the things I do with
kids there is that I ask them to come up
with their own chess piece like somebody
came up with a mongoose which would go
to step forward attack and then come
back and somebody came up with an eagle
which could jump over other pieces in a
diagonal way bla bla so you could come
with a lot of other pieces if you just
put start thinking about it and yep and
then coming back to tech so this is the
stack I use so one of my constraints was
I was a single developer and using
javascript allowed me to build it build
the backend build the front-end and
support the web and also Android and iOS
so I used Cordova for that and so the
trade-off was by bad user experience
like it's a really simple app if you go
to half just comment download the app
it's a very simplistic app but what I
was okay with that trade-off because in
the like initially you want to just
figure out if your idea has some
potential or not then other things that
helped me move forward with firebase
it's a real-time database and to make
two player games it's a challenge you
would need sockets otherwise but because
there was fire base even though there
was latency I could do it and now I'm
going to move to react native and then
this is the interesting part like
there's a p4w and chess engine like
there were a lot of different chess
engines that I could use but I chose p4w
and because the lines of code were less
than 15 like they like it's like 1500
lines of code and it works so so if you
look at my chess board it's it's a
smaller chess board which means that
it's an exponentially simpler problem to
solve right the real chess board has
more possibilities than the atoms of
universe so p4mm would do just fine for
me and and like so how many of us know
how does the chess engine work
quick quick short anyone wants to take
like no not somebody who knows so okay
it it's it's not that complicated okay
the first step for all games are alt and
also for the chess engine all board
games is you generate a list of all
possible moves which is all possible
next possible States right so once you
have all those possible States the next
thing we want to do is we want to know
which is the better one
so you score all the possible moves for
example if I am getting a checkmate in
the next move its - nein nein nein nein
but if I am I'm winning a piece it is
plus 1 or plus 2 or plus 8 and if I do
it over a couple of iterations then I
have the best move so this is like this
is like you go over a tree and you see
which is the best move but this is like
the but like the simplest way of
building a chess engine and the more
complicated chess engines have more
things on top of on top of this layer
which are hard to code in this so there
you would have strategies like you would
not be allowed to move King for a first
like it's it's it's back to move your
king in the first couple of moves
because then you would not be able to
castle but before people are going just
work fine for me
so what we are going to do is that like
quickly I'm going to show you P for W N
and this is this is like a so I cloned P
for W N and this is this is a P for to
blue in chess engine right so I'm going
to do a very simple experiment here I'm
going to I am going to remove all pawns
from one side and let the whole points
from the other side be anything else you
want to add okay so this is what we'll
do so so now we don't have eight points
on the black site so this guy's going to
lose right so you could do a lot of
other things like somebody may want to
move the horse three and a half steps or
you could come up with a new new strong
piece on the board and p4w n is great
for that because it's just fifteen
hundred lines of code
then we'll just move ahead with the talk
so sorry this was a really short demo
but next so there's some other
experiments that I'm really interested
in and the some of like half just sadly
is not open source but before the blue
end is open source and so is some other
things that I'm doing so I am building
like based on half just I am building a
chess game for blind people so so like I
took some designs from Internet and then
I added some of my own things and then I
built this AutoCAD design and if you
take a look at this this is this is open
source so so yeah so this is a chess
board
the pieces are blocks so and then this
is black and white because you could see
it like you could sense it now just see
it and each of these pieces has the
directions in which they will move so
that is one of the confusions people
have initially which piece how does it
move so this is a bishop it moves a
bishop it moves diagonally and and then
there are some other pieces Queen it
moves in all directions
the rook it moves in straight lines the
pawn it moves forward so I mean so I
don't think this is just a game for
blind people but I also think this is a
game for those chess enthusiasts who
want to learn how to play blind chess
because smaller board makes it much
easier so so the other experiment that I
have been doing is chess volunteering so
usually it takes a long like if we go
and teach us to some people like
someplace it's going to take a week but
if I just break down and teach some
interest some principles of chess I can
do it in an hour I can just make a
couple of games with pawns with pawns
and knights and like finish my workshop
in two three hours and then I can leave
it for them to like you know figure out
to figure out how to learn better so
this is some other experiment that like
so you could like so if like like
somebody is really into exercise and and
you want to get them into chess so there
are two ways
you get them into chessboxing or you get
them into square chests so so here you
have to like when you're making a move
you have to squat so and that's it like
that's it so if if anything is
interesting you can always get in touch
with me and I would love to answer your
questions stay in touch thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
