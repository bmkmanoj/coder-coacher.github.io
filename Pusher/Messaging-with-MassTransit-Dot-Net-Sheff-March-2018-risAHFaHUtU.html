website is mass transit with a free
open-source lightweight messaging bus
crater distributive crate food crate and
distributed tribe just routed
applications in net so is yeah it
doesn't really say much but I like to
think about it as the the Web API for
messenger which i think is a better fit
for it so with like web api we've got
web api client which is a HP client and
we have a post async pesto's async
methods with the generic parameters and
they have read async subs Jerry
parameters so we do actually really care
about what is happening under the hood
and then we have API controls on the
other side which also we just passing
letter C shot models into and we don't
really care what's between so yeah we
caught stealing response back and then
there's some magic in between we don't
really care what's there and all that
magic is HP listeners routing
serialization content negotiation model
binding validation and that's kind of
how Web API works so if we look at that
from like a mass transit perspective we
have our server and a client to the side
but I claim does a bus send of T and a
bust-up publish of T so we don't really
care about how how its communication of
the wire and then our server just has a
high consumer of T so he's kind of like
very similar you don't need to care
about the landline detail and there's
magic in between here and that magic for
this is actually to manage the
connections to actual the message
brokers deal with all the route
conventions of how it's going to route
all these messages around the actual
message broker and the serialization the
message they might be using be son Jason
or anything else in the hood and he
deals with a lot of login and Hera
handling so with any error messages what
they get processed they just get pushed
onto Erik use for you and this kind of
ease on pin by like rabbitmq but also as
your service bus and recently they've
starting to use writer ActiveMQ to
support the more the SAS offering on a
dress so this is kind of how our API
controllers look so we have a pair
controls with the they kind of just the
poker objects from done net and then
return back the same just objects we
don't really care about the JSON or
anything
for the civilization what happened here
and the same thing was led to the HP
client exactly the same thing so if you
look at the kind of mass transit way of
doing this is you have the interfaces
instead of actually actual classes so
easily do the interfaces so he can you
do multiple inheritance and then then we
have consumers so this texan i consume
Irv I already requested that passes it
down into this consume method and then
we could just deal with that message as
deserve as if it is this normal
interface and we don't really care how
is passing the state or across the wire
and then we can also publish check
another message called I order accepted
and that's how we publish our messages
and we can also post them directly so
we'd actually be in a consume context so
that's one of these things and then also
kind of just put do a push stop
publishing as long you got the bus
running as to say you can just keep
publishing messages onto the mass
transit while I push them onto a it's a
broker built underneath it so messaging
mass transit provides a lot of abstract
kind of stuff on top of the messaging
platforms so I was going to go through a
few of these so concurrency so this
allows us to deal with like multiple
things being read off the queue at the
same time and processing on these
consumers so we can either scale out
kind of in partitions or we can also
scale out just by putting and more load
actually running through this so this
would be like multiple threads
connection management so if we do get a
connection lost between our application
and broker their master and I'll deal
with that you reconnect in it and
continue in the process exception for
each fries and Poisson messages so if we
ever get any exceptions from kind of
computation and I kind of consumers
it'll put it onto a kind of Eric you
also you can tell it to actually retry
the message so you might want to retry
the message three times if there's like
a transient error maybe a database
connection error but also if it still
failed we can push that into an era
queue to deal with later circuit
breakers rate-limiting and partitioning
so
circuit breakers is where you with but
if there's a load of errors coming in
from like a certain service we can just
stop the traffic to that and then filter
them in slowly after that point rate
limit is where you kind of like
stand the Messier so you might have like
$1,000 once what we wanted to like
process them at a time we can rate limit
that and partition is where you start
splitting the messages up based on some
ID so we can then like process them
concurrently across a certain given
partition it also deals with
civilization so at the box we have XML
JSON and beasts on the default is
actually JSON but you can actually write
your own for this is for actually
publishing and subscribing to them and
message handler headers in correlation
so when you're debugging kind of a messy
basis know it's kind of hard to kind of
correlate like messages of having one
system to another system mass transit
just kind of deals well that for you by
putting correlation IDs on everything
for you so then you can trace the
messages along this actual they're
processing
consumer life cycle management so this
is kind of similar to how Web API works
so you if you've got an IOC container
and you call like action on the Web API
it'll actually create all your kind of
stuff for you what it needs to process
and then once it goes out of scope
you'll just destroy everything for you
and it's that very similar for the
actual consumer so everything you need
to be like inject into your consumer
you'll build up and afterwards you'll
call despairs and everything and then
clay everything cut for you
routing topology so this is kind of the
big winner here I think so when you fire
off these messages into the Bliss onto
mass transit yeah actually why is a
portable kind of routine inside of
either RabbitMQ or you over the what I
broke you using so this means you kind
of like really abstract away from kind
of how all these messages flowing around
the system they just kind of work just
magically saga so these are kind of long
running tasks kind of what are
coordinated by messages so like a state
machine so maybe you need things in
certain states to be processed so you
might be waiting on like three different
messages before processing and do a
different process down the line so this
could be like different hooks coming in
saying like you've had a order accepted
and that they've also just paid and now
we can send them an email so just long
we're in state machines
scheduler and comes out the box so this
is actually built on top of quartz net
so we can say every Monday at 9:00 p.m.
sending that send this given message and
what I'll do is actually put a message
on to a another queue which is actually
managed by quartz net and then it'll put
it emits quartz night schedule and then
fire that message back on to another
actual system attack to be processed
okay given time so that's all the info
on the slides I'm just gonna go quick
demo a bit so the demo is going to start
with like a couple of console
applications these roles window net car
so we've got a sharp payments and a
reporting so these are little bit a
little services just rinse Ida console
up the protein one's got like an
internal database to it so you can you
can query it for like how many orders
have been taken and also what has been
sold in the middle we've got a mass
transit and then which is actually on
RabbitMQ and then we're going to build
up some orders on our shop and then
we're gonna submit a order requested
message on to the actual mass transit
and then this mass transit is going to
like well the payment service and the
reporting sister service are actually
gonna be subscribing to these messages
the I requested message and they're
going to then process what they need to
process once the payments actually being
successful it's going to then have an
order accepted message come back onto
the bus and then this is going to then
fall back down through reporting service
so you can correlate how many orders
being processed to how many actually has
been submitted but also the payment
might fail so we've got a one in ten
chance in the code by random number so
when a request comes in it might fail
and then we also send back a fault
message this is handled by mass transit
and then we're also gonna handle the
actual the consumer which actually
listens to the fault inside the shop so
the actual get displayed what's not
being processed so I'm just going to
show you that
so can you ever see that so inside this
project we've got a messages library
which has the three messages so we've
got an eye order accepted and I already
quested and these just said to Scott
with a list of products on them so
nothing fancy and then the product just
looks like it is just a name and a price
and then we've got our payments project
which is just a console app it just has
an entry point in CS proj to start up
like the bus which is used around Batum
queue using some nice default passwords
of guest guests and then we're just
going to tell it to receive everything
kind of end point called payments and we
want to use this one consumer court
order requested consumer and for our
payments processing we're just going to
try to take the payment and if it fit
succeeds we're gonna send another
message onto the bus saying it's
accepted if not we're gonna throw an
exception and to say the payments failed
for our reporting service we've got to
consumers in here we got an order
accepted an order requested consumer so
they all accepted one is just going to
calculate some totals and put it into
our reports store so this is kind of
acting like a database exactly the same
for the other consumer so that's just
waiting for that message to come in of
IOT quested and then adding them totals
together this order report stories
actually just in memory database to say
and this deals with some concurrency
issues so you could be using any like
database for that doesn't make any
difference and then from my shop
perspective we've got one consumer and
this is this fault consumer so we've got
a fault of our message so this is the
actual message what mass transit raises
when that she gets an exception back
onto the consumer and then just says
yeah how many items was in process so if
we run that before I run that I just
want to
so duck wasn't working early so
hopefully it worked this time dude yep
works so if you look at rapid mq or not
and so this is a RabbitMQ is I've just
it's got no stowage behind it whatsoever
it's just in docker and I'll just slide
destroyed it and recreated it so it's
got no exchangers and no queues
whatsoever so if you boot up this all
three of the actual console apps we have
a weight dust-up so over here we've got
our shop and then we've got our payment
processing and the right and then we've
got some reporting down the left right
as well and then if we just flip to
RabbitMQ you'll see that we good we've
got our three queues we've got our
payments queue a report to you and our
shop queue so this is what our three
console apps are listen on and then
we've also got a load of exchanges being
built up from mass transit so we've got
a I order accepted and I already quested
and they're kind of bound to and more
exchanges which are then bound touch to
the queues so master on this deals with
all the routing topology for this system
without me kind of configuring anything
so if we flip back to these we should be
able to add some things so a lot of
three lots of bread
an old is submitted and you'll see that
payments been taken successfully and
then if we look around our reports app
we'll see that these three pounds 60
being spent on bread and the audit
request is actually correlated to the
orders let's take him but if we go back
over and I know order some milk and some
rice and stuff whatever one order is
they got some chocolate
are they chocolate next round we've got
the payment successful again and then a
report and service so it does continue
kind of adding these prices up and kind
of correlate them back so we can see
display them and then if we do there's a
cup of time so if you do you get some
chocolate
you know it's layers chocolate one
payment should fail it's got a one in
ten chance should do I intend chances
not six hey we got an hour and so we've
got our part screen out and then we
could see that they don't correlate
together because they're different
mounts because payments not being taken
so god I know requested that payment
being taken so we can see that nicely
and then over in our shop we'll also see
that their owner wasn't processed
successfully for the rice and the pasta
so that's all the magic and rest runs it
sue that Springs be on to you the last
site which is so alternatives is quite a
few alternatives but I've played around
with quite a few of these and I think
mass transit actually is one of the
better ones and so this person is quite
a common one but you have to pay for it
for this service at support this shuttle
ESB there's brighter which is fairly new
this fubar transportation rebus I've
done some work on rebirth at this open
source as well to do with mango and
celery so if you want to start looking
to this stuff there's quite a lot of
stuff in this space so just don't go out
there and try to well one thing I think
you should not consider is actually try
to build it yourself it's quite easy to
like just throw thin with something
together to actually communicate to rub
it and I just pull messages off for
yourself but then having to deal with
all the route and topology once you've
got like ten services and you've got
like a hundred things subscribing to
loads of different keys and exchanges
and trying to build them all yourself
it just gets a headache because
everybody's got a different way of doing
it and then you've got all this big mess
spaghetti mess of kind of messaging if
you trying to strict stick to one of the
actual abstractions it makes it a lot
easier with in the future but that's it
thanks for listening
