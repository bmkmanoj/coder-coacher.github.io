tips today the first one I'm just going
to show because I want to use it in the
next bit so I'm just going to show you
it it's not really no things more like a
dev tools thing document query selector
all yeah in chrome dev tools you can use
dollar dollar and then brackets and then
your selector so image get all the image
type can everyone see this yeah just
about geometer I'm going to pull it up a
little bit more still got the brand in
there so you know so dollar dollar is an
alias for document query selector rule
which is pretty cool
but that's sort of a side note and I
found out that you can do sort of an
extra thing with a raid up from so a
rate up from basically takes an iterable
as its first argument and creates an
array from it so you can give it like a
set which is really useful for getting
the unique values out of an array or for
example a node list which is what this
is I'm pointing at my screen view this
this is a node list
it is iterable but it's not an array
although it looks like it because it has
the squawk it's but you can do array dot
from getting a little teaser there image
tag ground this is this is an actual
rate but it's not a node list so you can
map over this and you can filter and
things like that you can't do those
things on a node list but something I
found out was that with a rate up from
you can actually give it a second
dogging which is a function and it's
essentially a map function so when it
creates the array it also uses that
function to not over the
the elements so for example if you
wanted to get all the if you wanted to
get all the links in the way oh I'm
doing live coding right there's four
hundred and fifty nine links on the FDA
homepage that's cool right
right so I've created an array and I
could do like dot map right
X I love X X dot H ref I think and it
would give me all the links or I could
instead of doing this I could just pass
it back to pass that as the second
argument to our rate up from did do
hatre this is an arrow function for
anyone that doesn't know sort of new new
ish couple years that does the same
thing
I see give a function as the second
argument to write up from and it will
map over as it creates the array which a
little bit more performant I believe
certainly feel dealing with really big
raise
that's really there's your two things
your dollar dollar document selectable
kind of nice and that positive function
second I've already set it up set it
again third time fourth time thought son
is that that's all I've got
I work at the FTE we're hiring if you
want to chat to me afterwards please do
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
