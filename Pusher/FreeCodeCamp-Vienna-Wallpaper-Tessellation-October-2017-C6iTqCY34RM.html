later you will stand here and tell
people it will be recorded and you will
have to talk okay sooner or later and I
wish this for you all okay okay okay I
prepared this is my second talk for
photo Couture no okay
for free code camp and my first talk was
about your setting up and developing a
full-stack application and so and this
is just a simple talk about wallpaper
tessellations so what of all Piper
tessellations actually that's what
you're gluing on the world stage to
Peyton may okay yeah and these are
repeating patterns found in nature and
you see them on the floor on the toilet
in the bathroom maybe on your shirt in
the Internet yeah and this is a sample
for tessellation like honeycomb Oh
next slide yeah there's some more
samples actually this this artist called
Asia okay I think he's dead now and yeah
actually hit it only periodic
tessellation see he went to Spain to see
the Alhambra and he get inspired okay I
want to do the same thing he said to
himself with animals okay and then he
drew animals and a lot of yeah
how it works okay you can do this at
home you take a paper you cut this out
put its there on with some tape there
and there for this desolation okay and
it's not hard yeah and actually I wrote
the program okay there's a screenshot
and you will see it soon life okay it's
just you okay I'll show you the okay
it's it's it's time to show you the
program yeah
now it's full screen okay
hello nice that you were here because it
was for inspiring myself okay
and I am showing how this program is
working though just mirror it then I can
I write the code Oh No
yeah and then I show this background
here and you can copy this code and yeah
you can copy this or this code and use
it at your home page mm-hmm
echoing back to the presentation okay
because it's time for the next no it's
time for the legs right okay this
created these are some forms F created
with this program okay
actually the forms getting crazy at the
the less you know how this program works
like crazy other forms okay every
testing yeah okay just you get this code
sample from the program copy the code in
and name it per say crazy total switch
Iowa and you have a nice peachy okay how
to use it with CSS yeah okay well your
SVG repeat and you have it in the
background okay it's quite simple make
use of it in JavaScript yeah that's what
you're right just copy the code or you
can get my slide it's online
multiple times it's on github it's on
slash slideshare.net that it's
everything okay yeah and you just copied
this I'll copy and paste it and it will
do it okay and that's how it looks like
if you take the page 64 okay and I
recommend to use it pays 64 coded
because they are those apples
and so on okay and it's not looking that
better you used it yeah even some
defense and I was like no I passed ROVs
confusion is it going to rate and change
during program execution cannot be
confused with existing code standard
base64 encode errs can be used okay so
you can even take some SVG code and
decode it to page 64 and then use it in
your program yeah that's important okay
because you can even contribute to this
and you can fork it link it make your
own make it better you can post your
make your comments on Twitter or there
and it's everything okay okay yeah I'm
finished
yeah thank you for it didn't suppose
this data that's how you make it picked
also I'll tell slides okay nice pictures
maybe some jokes and then you're done
yeah yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
