engineering yell or y'all calm you may
have seen we've dumped some piece of
paper on your doorstep recently do you
read them they're wonderful but I
imagined Ultraman girl calm and over the
last few years we've had a horrible such
kind of time with changing names and
identities and stuff but we're we're
getting better and one of the things
about getting better as we get a time to
come occasionally reinvent ourselves and
over the last year or so we've I think
we've managed to do that anyway this is
about HTTPS something that should be
incredibly easy but really really isn't
so I start the story at London web
standards that event that myself and
Dave in the front help to run and walk
people running this for years now but I
was talking to Dan Apple quest who's the
co hair of the tag their tech
architecture group of the w3c and he
just given a talk on web security
privileged features HTTPS and we were in
the pub and not saying what we'll put on
the other calm is a directory service we
literally we mail you all of this
information why do we actually need to
be on HTTPS and Dan basically told me
think about all the queries that your
users actually putting through this
website they're searching for legal
counsel family planning clinics as well
as regular plumbers hairdressers schools
anything all sorts of private and local
identifiable information if I was kind
of a hacker interested in intercepting
your traffic I could find out an awful
lot of stuff about and that's scary
that's really scary that that's what
absolutely got it got me here so I'm
thinking yeah you're right that all this
stuff is stuff that we shouldn't you
know it should be secure the whole web
should be secure and these said carried
on saying Google is really pushing on
this it's now a search engine ranking
factor and if I'm selling it to my boss
which I then the next morning go went
and did this is what your major on
because obviously so eighty-five percent
yells traffic comes from google
ridiculously high like that so if any
sort of google SEO ranking is really
really important to us so who's his
website is on https two hands that's not
that's not too bad actually how many are
they moving or in the process of a
transition half one half okay and how
many are just going to stay stolidly on
HTTP because it's good and everyone
still can use it says some people
missing I mean how hard can this be so
this is how I started thinking yeah
right I'm in engineering I'm going to
talk to my product people what's my part
of people they're very lovely people I'm
going to talk to security and I'm going
to talk to operations and you'll notice
at the bottom here there was a bar
starting January it goes on a long way
this is 2015 so okay so we had to start
so I so you start what you normally
think you do you take a we have a so
yellow comes an application is 20 years
old it is ever so slightly older than
The Guardian its first domain name was
iyp the internet yellow pages so I eyp
the end electronic killer pages which
switch to yell comp in the year 2000 so
yes it's older than The Guardian and
because i was talking about Raquel only
the public as well it was always very
nice to say that we got to https before
the Guardian even though he moved on so
we it's a very very very old website and
it's very that there are layers and
layers and layers of applications you
eyes your eyes servers load balancers
all sorts of things that you find on a
very large product and production
website so when you're moving to HTTPS
you start local you start at home you
take your development environment that's
sat on my laptop that very laptop there
and I go okay I'm going to make a
certificate so i start up open i started
over the cell and i started generate
myself as self
signed certificate okay that's not that
hard there's loads of guides on the
internet there's some very very useful
ones about getting the green padlock on
OSX about actually taking some
properties and putting it into a
pleasure cell and generating that and
installing it on apache and what the
best ones is the mozilla a cell
configuration data you quite literally
you put in patchy it's kind of old and I
want all these things and it literally
generates you all the different things
you will need in order to be on in order
to get that green padlock and then later
that day hooray it's working and when
HTTPS it took me a day not quite so yes
it's running locally on HTTPS and it's
secure wonderful does it work no of
course it doesn't so you then just kind
of go through and look at what breaks
you want HTTPS you look at what breaks
so the first things we looked at adobe
analytics which is some of the analytics
provider you may have heard a bomb
mature older version of that it's there
are alternatives google analytics this
is one of them all of our efforts they
broke no great loss though people did
complain our entire review section that
broke and finally a lot of URLs can
alter URLs and everything else so
basically you have a website that
doesn't work but it's on HTTPS you've
got to make sure it's my HTTPS it's not
really as easy as just kind of
shoehorning the s into the URLs there
strangely there she solved most of the
problems if you then I went through the
entirety of the the website and put an s
into most most of the URLs and they've
worked because it's all on the same
domain and there's no awkward subdomains
for a lot of things and he just worked
and that was great except for the
following exception our advertising
network so arrived network we use our
tech aol's ad tech service they can
easily serve their scripts over https
one of my eye
and talk to our advertising manager he
was in the building very nice guy and he
gave me access to the documentation
which of course is behind the username
password don't know why and that then I
dug through that found that ok you just
change this bit of the request script
and then it comes over HTTPS yeah great
so hey at Tech is being served over
HTTPS our example it's being served over
HTTPS no course they're not yeah so
there's this problem with the
advertising industry and the IAB notice
so apparently eighty percent of it
sports https so the major players
double-click Ad Tech and a lot of a lot
of the Earth's they do support it
however they they realize they mess up
when in iOS 9 when it introduced ad
blocking they they quickly issued a
statement which is basically guys you
don't like these adverts we get it they
are terrible for your web performance
and so we're going to do better we are
going to serve lean advert light
encrypted actually supported meaning
that they do follow they can follow you
around that you can tell them not to and
non-invasive so all these modular
popovers these things these will go away
and that's a really really big thing so
when we actually first launched https
occasionally you get a blank 300 by 250
block box because didn't work because
that particular that was not served over
https luckily for us yells yells revenue
is not from that take major publishers
guardian and such this is a much bigger
problem for them because that's where
the revenue comes from and they can't
just shut even twenty percent out so
lucky for us we could continue however I
have had to talk to all of these people
this is growing it is now middle of
februari so the next one I talked to
adobe analytics now Google Analytics
just works they've supports https for a
very long time so of adobe of course but
obviously we didn't have it configured
that way why would we we're on HTTP so
me we made it work with HTTP so we had
to contact Adobe and to do that I had to
find out who in the company was in Adobe
administrator it wasn't me or anyone in
my department when everyone in this
country actually at find who they were
and I had to get onto Adobe support and
then I had to send him an email they
sent me back a request and they enabled
first-party domains for us after we'd
sent them a certificate which was very
nice of them and we also at the same
time very very cautiously updated to the
latest version of their tracking script
and now people who have google analytics
this is not a problem for them but um
i'm sure adobe analytics at you host the
script and therefore ye are responsible
for updating it ours was 23 years out of
date and considering that this is where
all of the value actually is because
they yell does is we supply at the time
advert and we tell the small businesses
of this world how well that Abbott is
doing this is the the call so it
actually took me until just start of
April to get this through after very
cautiously as I said updating to the
latest version of vomit sure but also we
had a few other little benefits out of
that I shouldn't think I shaved about
100 milliseconds off each request that
was a lot of Rama nice but once again
time has eaten it has just gone I
started out over here and I'm still not
finished I've not even got through that
the majority of the problems yet and
it's now equal and time is just
disappeared and then of course well
there's this other system in 2010 we
bought a company called trusted places
anyone ever heard of trusted places
used to use it decl reviewthe there
there we go don't worry no one else does
the review system we have a Java stack
the review system was written in PHP we
don't have any PHP developers how does
that work um in 2010 we we replaced
sorry not in 2010 in December we
actually replace the entire system with
a fast one that means you reviews I
should got published in 30 minutes sorry
no in 30 seconds not 30 minutes so
there's a we replaced a lot of legacy I
had to do a lot of duplication there a
duplication of effort it's one of those
things every system is going to have one
of those things this one component that
is completely unloved and that you just
can't update or you don't know how to
update or that hasn't been deployed for
years no I don't have a deployment
script for it OnEarth happens so every
everyone has one of those you have to
live with it there's there's no easy way
I mean there is no easy way to do https
with such a large website it accepts
unless you keep going so I kept going
and then of course so I've only
currently got a local certificate which
is a self-signed certificate if you try
and visit that in a web browser you
basically get bad and that of course is
no good don't one's going to trust that
you get a big message in your screen
there are plenty of other types of
certificates so there is a what's called
a DB certificate or domain validated
they look like that which is on that's a
message the that's just the padlock or
its green padlock on other browsers
these are certificates we can get which
you can get relatively cheaply let's
encrypt they do free DD certificates
start ssl they also do free DV
certificates the let's encrypt ones on
much easier to get there you have to
renew them every four months the the
thing with the TV sets is
okay actually there's nothing wrong with
them there actually isn't anything wrong
with them but you can go a level higher
which is extended validation certificate
now if you have a fuse in chrome firefox
and you see a browser with one of these
in it you will see okay that isn't easy
certificate basically you've gone
through a whole nother level of
validation to actually just say yes this
is definitely me this is the kind of
market trust you'll notice this is our
old company name actually but it's the
name of the company that we used to
trade under so this one actually that
this but in order to get our eb
certificate we had to actually talk to I
had to talk to my security team again
who then talked to our legal team had to
talk to Companies House and adjust the
names about our DNS registrar so our
domain name registrar records to then
make sure that a yell.com one match
exactly what was in companies house
otherwise EV suits don't work thankfully
I didn't have to do this but that's of
what the kind of stiff Achatz look like
so you see what said what certificate is
there that's kind of what it looks like
it's just a whole bunch of stuff it's
just there it's so that's actually
myself sorry one which is why it's up on
this screen obviously but yeah it
doesn't it isn't hard it just takes time
the only reason why it's actually worth
it is on edge it's the only one that did
she makes a browser bar go green other
on edge it it's still it's not actually
a green yes on exactly how I say it is
so we spend any extra time doing it and
now I've talked to all these people and
it is the middle of May Tom obviously
keeps passing there are other third
parties which I'm going to briefly skim
over though I'll probably come back to
one of them we have an anti scraping
tool so yells about using its data we
have a 2.7 million businesses that
you're in the UK listed so we get
scraped all the time so we have an X
scraping tool
they sit in front of us and to actually
do to get an EV suit re be set for them
we had spent some money for a private IP
address it's worth it it's just one of
the things we had to do but also it
again more people to talk to we also had
a we have a CDN for hosting videos if
you've ever looked really closely yellow
chrome isn't actually host on our CDN or
in the cloud it's actually a lot of data
center imagine those you haven't got a
data center these days and the because
of because of that that data center
sorry the CDN is of course Swanson and a
global contract which we don't control
therefore we haven't actually been able
to update it it costs money so have to
rate to make change requests and we took
because it's actually run by the US we
still haven't got there if you look at
CD any other comp it does not want to
https we still have not got there nearly
what 16 months after I've started this
we're nearly there this one nearly but
not quite but also that particular house
doesn't support SNI so s nice technology
that is Staz the server name
identification means that on you don't
have to have a unique IP address for a
certificate in order to actually use
HTTPS if you use XP at windows XP he
uses windows XP awesome no at work okay
fine I'll let you off you would not be
able to see this website because it's on
HTTPS and windows XP does not do this
that was a surprise i do really didn't
think anyone would say yes but not
everyone supports it even though this
SNI is a technology which is almost a
decade or so i've talked to quite a few
people now and it's now gene but of
course to actually get the money for all
of this because on this last slide I've
now spent some money
my title is head of weather engineering
at this actually by title have had the
hello Erin had a web engineering changed
here nothing really happens until here
so I didn't I don't have any sort of
budget or anything like that so I have
to write a business case whom he says
has written the business case that's a
small number of people mostly that all
the people in the audience as well that
I mean it's not easy who knows how to
write a business case or even where to
start Google yeah they're shit honestly
there is no really good stuff about how
to write business case um well my
friends from a management consultancy I
used to work at literally had to he dug
around and find me some really old
government guidelines on how to write a
business case there's really not much
out there and certainly nothing for
software devs or for these kind of
projects this is quite hard a lot of
people say oh I've got to spend some
money or I'll have to ask my boss is it
important for your boss if it's not that
probably won't waste their time and
that's where you get stuck this took
months I won't just leave it at that it
took months had to get signed off you
had to go to the investors all things
madness absolute madness but we're now
with nearly life okay with nearly there
it is a middle of July and now people
have suddenly thought old on this is
actually going to happen see if not just
mad it's not just kind of on this little
crusade on his own he's actually going
to do this and so people said okay well
we have some concerns about performance
is TLS fast yet yeah course is it is
fast it is this entire website about it
going me that if you need any kind of
evidence about it we agreed to terminate
the connection as close to the edge of
the network as possible now I've already
described RIT scraping that's a man in
the middle if literally it sits in front
of us now I wasn't willing to say okay
we have data center we have men the
middle which is in a different data
center the traffic between those two
would have to go over a public network
that wasn't something I wanted to do so
we terminate the network connection
twice once at our antics great and then
it rien crypts it and then it comes back
to us and then we you decrypt it again
there's a performance penalty for that
and I'll show you exactly what that is
but there is a performance penalty
anyway and get to it but of course we
have our load balancer so we had to make
sure that was up to date this actually
happened in March we flip switch to put
that live in the early July because our
load balancer being you know 20 years
old it says Citrix and citrix netscaler
if you're really interested the we were
on to 19.5 we updates 10.5 I thought oh
look there's a button though that's a
speedy ticket everything fails on ticket
quite quickly so we made sure everything
was up to date and the modern stuff if
you are doing actually two Bs you've got
to be on monster openssl and its
performance for decrypting especially
they're stronger elliptical curve
ciphers you've really got to have a
modern version 101 or 102 in order to
actually get enough performance for it
to not actually be a problem for you but
of course people said well we'll have to
wait and see so okay we'll see we'll
exactly see we use associate samples
tool to martyr be of use of measurement
at real use of measurement timings and
we said okay one monitor it and we'll
see and we'll make performs two weeks
afterwards so before the button push
I've talked to all of these people and
it's July and we finally reach the big
day 31st of july 2015 you press the
button but on that big day we had to do
all the following things because they
don't work on HTTPS and HTTP we have to
update our site map 10 million links our
robots.txt file much smaller google
search console console or webmaster
tools are used to be better make sure
you register the property and that
you're tracking everything otherwise
Helmuth you know what's actually going
on
then actually set up our redirects so if
you have actually tpn https when we did
actually have them running side by side
for a couple of weeks unless you're
actually be directing people to https no
one's going to go there google has you
will have 18 million search results for
us and those are all HTTP so we had top
dataman somehow and Google will will get
there I'll show you a graph in a minute
so you have to redirect and you have to
do what's known as a HTTP 301 redirect
which is a permanent redirect literally
we have gone from HTTP to HTTPS and you
have to do this for every URL and every
single one of them if you do a three or
two which is a normal kind of redirect
if you're doing a PHP like service I'd
redirect or any of that that will
normally do a temporary redirect which
the 302 that isn't good enough you have
two or three or one which you have to
configure the netscaler so I had to
learn all the netscaler rules anyway I
press the button and no one died
thankfully no one died so after I'd so
it's that August now what do you think
was the actual benefits of doing this so
what did we actually gain any bets in
kind of search engine kind of average
placement ranking any bets no no one's
even wants to hazard a guess no no not
further down there's some decadent
naught point two places so worth it we
nor point two places over so there was
this crazy thing my google updates their
algorithm then we did a massive relaunch
literally 14 days later we only have
like two weeks at two maybe a week's
worth of data we can actually say this
is exactly what HTTPS did and so it was
only for only nor plenty places for the
URLs that got updated during that week
which are our most popular URL so that's
okay anyway so that trunk into less than
2% click through but deeper sense
actually quite good I mean that's the
thing right this HTTPS from ranking
google has made so much about this SEO
ranking that it's got blown out of all
proportion it's described as a tie break
a tie break so what this means is if all
else is equal age to be on HTTPS and the
other guy isn't we'll put you above it
that's it the correlation factor between
ranking and ranking and HTTPS is naught
point naught for friend if anyone who
does math that's like a that maybe maybe
it's not exactly a direct correlation
which is one nor it's about there ah
nothing absolutely nothing we did it
anyway so this is over time how google
indexed us as a percentage of the total
number of pages that is the seventh of
februari this year 2016 and that is when
we launched a first week of august it is
google is still indexing us after all
this time still going because there's so
much and honor to take a large site over
this journey it does take a very long
time so that not point to is literally
there aren't that many pages that was
the ranking booster
am i over yet no cool thanks so what
else went wrong I suppose is the
question as I said earlier our java is
our stack now we have a slightly older
version of Java than we'd like to have
and it occasionally just stopped sending
requests the next monday i got ins and
someone said Steve no one can make a
make this protocol premium listings
anymore it just doesn't work ok great
how's how's that my problem because
there's a request to http in Java Java
doesn't have Trustwave who is the is our
certificate provider it doesn't have
trust wait its root certificate in its
key store this these words mean nothing
to most of you but literally the request
just failed completely silently until
someone noticed because they couldn't do
stuff we java did include this in
version 7 ish but you upgrading java
wholesale will take us just as long as
this project if not more and we'll take
the entire engineering team to do it not
just me so it's basically simpler to
install the missing cas however a
massive pro tip always keep an on https
internal virtual IP always keep one
around because someone or something
we'll need it something will just say no
I don't do HTTPS and it will fail so
always keep one around and make sure you
can do something with it and now on to
performance so we could measure this
instantly right we can measure exactly
how long the TCP request and the SSL
handshake take then the navigation time
the API version 2 which is supported by
basically chrome and a few others now
since this actually gives you this at a
network level and reports it back to our
rom tool any guesses on how much time at
at the median
so for fifty percent of our traffic how
much time it added 200 any further
advance on 202 thank you no in fact it
was only a hundred milliseconds at
median but this is the graph this is the
50 median this is the ninety-five
percent so five percent of our users
that the spell slowest five percent are
there and that's on desktop browsers
because we are able to at least a
segment them what about smartphones I'm
not going to let you guess on this one
it's fucking awful two seconds two
seconds at the 95th percentile and a
good two hundred fifty seconds at the
fifty percent and I bet that's pretty
much everyone on Wi-Fi rather than on
mobile networks HTTPS is fast it is not
free it can add a lot to your initial
render time now I made the post
yesterday and Ilya Grigori who's who
wrote high-performance browser
networking which is what I then actually
went away it took the book off my shelf
and I sat down with the netscaler
documentation and I went through it and
I tried to update it and try to get
things right he then basically in 10
minutes posted a forensic examination of
yokum's tcp infrastructure and pointed
out all the different things we were
doing wrong I hope it's made the blog
post is incredible unfortunately our
problem here actually is the ant escape
because we're because we're behind them
we are beholden to what they are doing
we're working on this directly with them
I've got a call tomorrow talking with
them about this so we're trying to
improve it but things like a CSP
stapling which also once again means
nothing two people that allows with EV
certificates you to staple a couple of
requests together so there's only one
round trip to the server rather than two
and when that is that really matters
especially if you're doing too hot
there's a lot more detail in the blog
post someone going to any more than that
it is not free absolutely guaranteed not
free and this is not the biggest problem
I face so it's taking me an eternity to
get here end of august one of my sales
managers comes over to me it says Steve
our customers traffic has dropped off
the face of the earth at about the time
you did that flip to https anything
you'd like to tell me shit I'm gonna do
it's like literally so we have many
larger customers and obviously they use
google analytics to they don't use all
the data that we give them though I
spend ages getting on to work to make to
make sure we gave them they use google
analytics cuz we're not their only
supplier advertising obviously and so
yell is a referrer dropped off now
there's a very good reason why this
happened so never studied HGV virus so
where if you're from HTTP and you go to
another HTTP web site you pass a
referrer the where you basically came
from if you go to https you pass it
again but if you the source or https you
do not pass it to HTTP web sites because
you are secure and they are not yet not
only nine percent of our customers
websites are served over HTTP and all of
that one percent a quarter of facebook
pages i haven't actually gone back and
looked at what that stuff is now i don't
really want to know shit right how the
fuck did i do this so oh there are
options that w3c obviously has options
about how to solve this there is a
referral policy spec we're basically in
a meta tag on every page which would be
very easy for us to do you can add a
rello firmer and set content to unsafe
and it will pass the referrer to
wherever the hell you wanted to go the
browser support for this is that which
and this is a this is one of can I use
his great feature works which put it
down to our traffic is seventy percent
so we could send seventy percent of it
back doesn't know that's that's not it
so suddenly hey you've said that he will
do it imagine the sales call next year
hey about middle of June we dropped at
thirty percent traffic I'm not renewing
shit okay right so we can't do that what
else can we do so content security
policy level 2 also has this however
that browser support is approximately
forty percent this is at in fact how
Twitter Steidle CEO service passes
referrer information because that's on
HTTPS and obviously that's passionate
besides all the time so that sets a
condenser content security policy so
instead we went did things the
old-fashioned way now I made a video I
literally I went and I made a feature
which taught that which helped users use
Google Analytics campaign tags and
that's the best thing we came up with
and then we applied it to everyone
literally we send more campaign tags and
everything else to our website the video
is there if you want to cringe and
that's it that is how many people I
actually had to talk to in order to make
this happen and I finally stopped
talking to people about this about
December after I've written this article
this article has changed a lot and yeah
it's a massive amount of time four point
two places in SEO for security the
problem with HTTPS is not technology we
can overcome them the problem is the
incentives previously that said
perseverance but the problem is actually
incentives is there any incentive to
carry on and do this
maybe maybe we can make things easier
but there's no real incentive at the
moment if we can get rid of the cost of
DV stiff achatz let's encrypt is
fantastic I absolutely love it do use it
if you want to freeze tificate you do to
just have to have renew every four
months but otherwise it's fine cdns
software as a service providers they
need to be HTTPS by default they need to
encourage that this is the way that this
is the only way we need to provide more
incentive people as a spec call used to
be called powerful features it's now
called privileged contacts like which
means that features like serviceworker
geolocation camera usage that kind of
thing will only run on https domains
serviceworker already does already does
but geolocation that's happening soon so
it had been deprecated as of chrome 43
for you to your location on a HTTP web
site you'll get a warning in your
browser console i saw last a couple of
nights ago when i was looking into a bit
further the commits have been made to
completely remove it from insecure
domains things are happening here chrome
is being the aggressor great brilliant
well done Firefox is for it is not far
behind it it needs this kind of a
neatest push from just from not just
from develop up to developers to say
okay we need to do this now you can't do
this unless you have this now there are
actually some really good reasons why
service worker has to be HTTPS as a
massively long thread on get help about
it if you're really interested which I
linked to from the article you can't do
HTTP to without it we can't do HTTP to
because I'm man-in-the-middle doesn't so
I can support it nor does on it together
right now but it will do if we upgrade
it again since it has of course over
this period of time had a major relaunch
HTTP two is fantastic the performance
gains you glad that we're protecting
about of
thirty percent performance improvement
which will take us from a median of
about two seconds to 1.6 that kind of
improvement just from HTTP to is
fantastic and if that if you look at
performance that's the killer however it
does need more support cdns don't all
support it right now it's it's coming
but it's not quite there yet search
engines need to make it a stronger
signal business people don't some
business people get the performance
argument some piece of people get the
security argument but they don't really
what they get is hey you'll get more
business from it because Google will
send more people your way that needs to
be stronger point two places is bullshit
it needs to go up and browsers need to
warn against HTTP if you're at the
chrome dev summit last in the last year
emily stark stood up in front of
everyone in front of everyone and said
in 2016 we intend to basically put that
red cross through HTTP at some point
that is going to be amazing it's scary
ass yeah that's because firefox is going
to do it as well no one else has said
anything about it in browser
manufacturers but they say they're going
to do it this year it's going to take a
lot of sir of I'm going it's going to
take a lot of time everyone's going to
be warned but it is they want it to
happen it needs to be a massive
incentive because if you went to an
https website and you saw the red cross
through it that's going to send you
running a scheduling HTTP web site and
send your money and people need to be
educated about this google have just
launched a migrating to https guide the
Matt gaunt help to write and hopefully
through kind of talks like this everyone
call kind of more understand what a
gorg's have to go through in order to do
this and why the Lord the internet isn't
on it
smaller augs great puts it on your
server do lights and crepes done at the
blog the yellow block that we wrote in
order to do this I did a let's encrypt
cert it took five minutes that's how it
should be it isn't and that's the web
there is a tag documentation document on
moving to HTTPS as well so finally
what's next we're going to improve
deities people we're going to get a wage
too we will then take be able to take a
look at HTTP strict Transport Security
which is another way of doing the 30
ones basically the browser if it knows
about it will attempt to automatically
upgrade HTTP connection to https if if
it can and if it knows about the header
which is a really useful way of catching
the remainder we can't do it at the
moment because I see the end doesn't
work and then all videos on your comment
break and then we'll do content security
policy and you can also set cookies be
HTTPS only whereas at the moment of said
to be HTTP only so some of the cookies
don't quite work I only found out about
that yesterday still learn telling you
every day and we'll get our CDN done so
thank you I hope you've learnt I hope
you learned that HTTPS is hard it is and
the it is worth it in the end it is
absolutely it is absolutely worth it and
it certainly will be more worth it by
the end of the year if you wanna do
service work you've got to go for it
that there is a there are barriers they
can be overcome all of them and doing so
you will probably be in a much better
place for it thank you for listening
thank you i'm on twitter twitter the
slides are up and there is an epic blog
blog post there if you do want to
