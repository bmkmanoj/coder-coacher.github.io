and off with Chris 14 and then about a
week now and he's built a little hex pot
that term you can control from web page
so let's click through and see what it
does so we'll run the java applet then
increase the size of the pace we can see
this thing but and there's a little hex
pot that's cool ok so we'll try and move
it ok that was my forward command just
going through there that's pretty cool
moving right and we can see there that
the little red eye closed on this Chris
I think he's going to send us a message
that's giving from some space to the
displays message
you
that's very cool hey so Alan's been on
before so how cool is that so this
should be like a swarm of little hex
pots on some distant continent that
you're controlling doing some really
cool stuff or maybe you're controlling I
don't know arduino zor hex bolts in some
lenders contaminated where humans can't
go that's really cool okay let's move
them off I'll some obstacles appearing
okay we've run out of battery but that
is really cool so I'm in the UK
controlling a hex pot through pusher
using web sockets in I believe chris is
in the bronx or a good into twitter
anyway you know somewhere in the US
that's pretty amazing great job chris
definitely need some swag</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
