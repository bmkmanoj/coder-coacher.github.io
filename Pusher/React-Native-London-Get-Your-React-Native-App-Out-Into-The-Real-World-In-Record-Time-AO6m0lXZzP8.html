get your react native out out into the
real world in in record time so it's
something we do at Theo to a lot a
client comes along and says we want to
build this MVP very quickly so if we can
like make an app within a day or ideally
within an hour in that first meeting
with them then it's sort of wise that in
a little bit and it winds up some
credibility and also means we can um we
can make more apps sort of more exciting
and more quickly so yeah we all work at
Theo de as I said with pipe and react
and react native mainly before that I
was studying engineering in Oxford
so I Lynch Kodak Theo doe so that
started in PHP then Python and the last
six months in reacts and react native
the way we build apps and sort of
software at Theo days with a Lean
Startup approach so we try and build
MVPs so we need to release as quickly as
possible and kind of release new
iterations as quickly as possible as
well which is why releasing apps onto a
under real device it is important for us
because we need to get that feedback
very quickly otherwise our kind of our
business and development model falls
apart so we usually work an 8-week
projects to developers per team maybe
ten twelve features being released today
so that's ten or twelve kind of
deployments we need to do each day so
the alternatives to what I'm going to
suggest you could use the App Store's
you could use Play Store beats and
iTunes Connect and test flight but for
us we found that the feedback time which
is too slow so we spent too much time
waiting for it to be uploaded too much
time sometime for it to be verified and
it wasn't really quick enough for us for
a very old-school option you could send
around your apk files and get your your
client to install them manually but
we've never tried that because I'm not
sure that's a sustainable way to get
going so hockey up was what we used up
until recently
so it's very close to being what we need
it's built by Microsoft is kind of
all-in-one distribution platform so
Microsoft invests about 12 billion
dollars a year in R&amp;amp;D which I found out
recently only behind Amazon and Google
so they put a lot of money into products
like this so it's a bit very useful but
what's happened recently is that they've
introduced a kind of newer sexier
version of hockey app which they call
mobile sensor which is Visual Studio
mobile sensor we've been using it at
theater for the last three months or so
it's been out as a preview version so
it's been testing about it alone new
features since we started using it so
the project we started with it on we've
now were missing half of the features on
there because they've added the new ones
and we haven't yet integrated them so
it's grown a lot even since we started
using it but last night I had a bit of a
shock says on the way home from a work
party and I got an email through saying
from visual studio saying hello and
welcome to App Center say yesterday they
actually released the full version of
mobile sensor which they rebranded to a
visual studio App Center so it's now a
full full released version of the same
product and it's going to phase out
hockey up so you're anyone who uses
hockey app your hockey up accounts will
log you into here directly and anyone
who was using mobile I sent it it's the
same thing so you're not losing out so
the only thing that has changed is that
it's no longer entirely free to the
preview version they offer
everything for free which we made good
use of so now they have introduced some
pricing but it's actually still very
reasonable and I'll go through it at the
end so what it offers is a way to build
tests and distribute your app all in one
place so you can you write your code and
your laptop you push it to get it's got
a web hook there which triggers the
build automatically runs any npm tests
you have and then if that's successful
it will distribute that to your users
who you've set up in the distribution
groups and then in between that you can
also run the functional tests which i've
never done so I won't go into too much
detail on that but there you can use
espresso and appium or something to to
run full functional tests and then what
you also get for free within the same
platform is an analytics tool so you can
log events and pageviews users
acquisition rates that sort of thing all
within the same platform and same with
crash reports so one line in your packet
or JSON and you have mobile tend to
crash reports and you get the native
errors coming back again into the same
interface and also has a push
notifications utility for for sending
push notifications out to your users
once you've set up the SDKs within the
project so on just sit terrify I'm not
actually I'm not Microsoft salesman at
all I'm purely doing this because we use
it a lot to UM to get apps out the door
inside one hour and what actually
happened is that I've just moved house
recently and my flatmate well I've set
up our electricity and gas bills and my
flatmates
are they owe me they owe me full I know
three hundred pounds or something for
the gas bills and they don't want to use
split wise which we used to use because
this is a refusing to download it but he
also won't pay me until I give them a
better way to do it
so um I said okay I'll make an app for
that and we will see what happens so we
started making the app and actually what
impressed me most was how quickly we
could actually get an app onto their
phone it's in about 45 minutes or
deafening under an hour they had an app
on the phone which at least said their
name and told them they over me and they
have since paid me so this this is kind
of where this is the little project I'll
actually show you so this is the mobile
center interface as you can see all
those things I mentioned a year build
test distribute your crash reports
analytics and push notifications all
there so I'll very quickly go through
how I made the react native app itself
and then what was able to push to get so
its react native in it he odo we use
human generates a pooled RM toolbox
react native tool box it comes with a
lot of countries about 10 generators
included for red axe react navigation
setting up with Fastlane which is what
we used to use for deployment so I still
actually used it here because it sets up
the build the Gradle files nicely say
these are all generators that sets up
the the deployment basically so that
takes that takes five minutes once you
have your mobile sensor API key then you
run react native link and these
generators have installed mobile Center
analytics and the crash reporting so
once you've run react native link they
again asks your mobile Center API key or
your app secret I think yeah and then
suddenly down lytx and crash reporting
integrated into our app entirely and
that's the last configuration you have
to do so that's that's very powerful
then obviously push to github repo then
I'll go through this in the interface in
a minute
but to set up the actual build hook that
triggers the build it's all done in the
UI so you had to build
- to use github you select the
repository and then it's connected to
your repo you have to configure the
branch again all in the UI the only
thing that I found tricky was the code
signing which was you have to set the
environment variables in the code which
you have to rename the environment
variables to be mobile Center underscore
key store mobile send underscore
keystore password so what I'll do share
half live demo say I so I have the app
running on my phone already say I
haven't been able to connected the
screen so you can see the backgrounds
blue basically so remember that and here
we're changing the background color to
be green I think setting to prove it's
mine
so I'm gonna measure that to master and
then we'll go over here and you can see
that my so this is the bills section in
mobiles and in App Center story as it's
been renamed this is the build sensor
you can see I've connected the master
branch up and it's noticed I've just
merged my pull request has triggered a
build so that takes about 6 7 minutes so
whilst that happens I'll run you through
the other things we use here so to
actually configure the build it finds
your practice torch a song finds the
release variants you can build a branch
and every push will build it manually
again like I said you can run your your
NPM tests with a toggle button then if
you want to send the app names you can
say splits its staging little less and
then this yeah this was the bit that I
got stuck on for a little while so these
variables are available to you as Mogar
Center underscore skis he store and the
store password and the same for these
and I just had them without the mobile
sensors so
let's take a little while and yeah once
that's done you can add people you'd
liked it to be distributed to
automatically so it's me and my flatmate
say I'll save that yeah and you can see
the build is actually running yeah okay
say the the next section which I'm not
using currently is the testing so this
is where I said you can run your
functional tests you can choose a you
can have a device configuration I've got
to set up here these are the for testing
frameworks available so the tests are
run on the server but you have to
trigger them locally so it's the least
kind of integrated part of mobile app
Center but you run this command locally
it sends your tests up the app center
they run here so if anyone does do
functional testing if this looks like it
could be useful the bit we use the most
which replaces hokey app is distribute
so you can have your collaborators
groups it's just the two of us and then
these can be tied to those releases like
I showed you in that in the build and
what's very new is the stores section so
from here you can actually connect your
Google Play and iTunes accounts and
Google Play is the most integrated so
far so you can fully deploy it to the
Play Store from here so you can choose
your build and click set the Play Store
and it will be gone and iTunes seems to
be in development so they're saying if
you'd like to know more about this get
in touch but it is possible but I think
it'll be coming in a month or so and the
bonus that's also included is code push
which is Microsoft's technology - for
JavaScript mobile apps - to send changes
over the air without having to get users
to you to run an update so for our
insurance out for example if a law
changes or price changes we can we can
send that without having to get users to
update so for the compliance Department
makes them very happy because we can
promise the app is always up to date and
it works fine on Android and the
applause on on iOS is that you can't
make any kind of significant changes to
the functioning of the app through your
code bush if you're going to bring in a
big new feature you have to go through
the classic release route I don't know
what happens if you get it wrong but I
imagine you get taken down and have to
fight your way back on so also we have
was having fresh reports so these like I
said are native native crush reports
which they so sometimes they're useful
sometimes they're there to kind of
native and it's a it's a JavaScript
exception which that doesn't actually
point back to the line in our JavaScript
code I haven't worked out how to how to
improve that at all
but um we had some youthful ones with
Facebook logging and kept crashing when
users are drying it and that was a
native error that showed up here and
that that was really useful for fixing
and then again for free we have an
analytics tool here so you can see your
active users the daily session session
durations and these are all so there
they can be connected to your production
app this is off their staging app but
there you have separate secrets for each
release of your app just so you can
monitor both kind of separately and what
kind of quite cool is is you have this
log flow thing here so if you're trying
to debug
you with with a kind of a user sat in
front of you you want to see what's
happening or you want to follow what
they're doing you can say new sessions
just started yeah I'm clicking a button
on home so it's about 10 second delay
but um you can see the new events
popping up at the bottom which again
yeah it's very useful if you're trying
to see in real time what users are doing
and the last one which is the push
notifications so you have to set it up
within your app without app center push
I haven't used this over go into detail
on it but um I've heard it's quite hard
to get them set up sometimes say if you
if you want to use push notifications
this could be very useful so now I'll go
back to bills I'll see what's happening
so you can see the current bills here so
weights of the data from the bill vision
seems to take between about 6 &amp;amp; 7
minutes
see if I can download it maybe it's some
she's not coming through to here so yeah
uploading one file now says it's loading
okay so it's going to take it a couple
more minutes okay so while I was doing
that I'll go back and I'll just go
through the pricing quickly cuz I was
worried it was going to kind of ruin the
product a little bit but it's already
reasonable so you get free build time
per month which which is enough to test
it but not enough to UM to do anything
useful with so you get about 40 bills
per month there you get the testing
functional testing for a free 30-day
trial but then everything else
distribution analytics and crash
reporting is all free and then to
actually when you start paying it's a
similar pricing to circle TI which is
what we've been using until now so it's
$40 a month for each build container so
for a team of two of us we just need one
of those and then if you're into
functional testing you can $100 a month
which I guess you need to be a little
more and yeah you need to want to do
functional testing if you're paying that
and say yeah so the build was successful
you can see it's being deployed to the
mobile centers store which and get here
so I can download I've got the the
release node is the commit name in this
case so download it
and okay so install okay yeah it's it's
gone green
so within sort of seven minutes you can
have your app on your for us it's our
probably donors phones so they're all
working Cardiff at the moment so we want
to just a very smooth and smooth kind of
transition for them to start using the
apps which spring on so this is why we
use one app Center so it's mainly to
whywhy people with how quickly the apps
available so we can keep so we can build
an app within an hour have on their
phone that's the number one but also we
can carry on like developing very
quickly giving them a new features very
quickly and new developers who don't
have their mobile experience don't have
native experience necessarily don't need
to know any more than yet essentially if
they can get pushed it they can deploy
the app they can analyze it says very
little DevOps knowledge needed and then
the analytics and crash reports are
included for free so again we've wasted
a lot of time before trying to set
firebase up trying to set up crash
reporting when actually if it's
installed as part of the build process
then it's something we can offer to our
clients very quickly and for MVPs that's
very useful to be able to measure what's
going on and what's actually very nice
is as many things as possible a
centralized so we have one place to go
for nearly everything again that's
useful for new developers that's useful
for sharing the project to two different
teams and it's what kind of it's what
we're hoping to use as we go forward at
Theo de is to move all of our mobile
development workflow onto mobile Center
and hopefully that will help us develop
apps sort of fully functioning apps in
four to five weeks and hopefully where
our clients say thank you for that
that's says App Center dot IMS is
the new it's not mobile sent it's
absented IMS the toolbox we used for
generating the deployment is here
generates our in tool box and that's my
email address there if anyone has any
questions afterwards if anyone has any
questions now I love to date me yes so
the question was is there support for
pre and post build scripts for uploading
to slack and yeah the answer is this
three places you can hook in a build
script so I think it's very very pre
build there's pre release and post build
or something is it the three places you
can hook in a script yeah it's a
question what's the sandbox for those
scripts and the answer is I don't know
unfortunately I yeah as I said our
projects are actually been very simple
very vanilla we haven't had to deal with
any anything kind of particularly nice
around the build process sorry yes
question it doesn't work for iOS and yes
it works for iOS I haven't shown it here
because I have another person little iOS
account so I've got an Android phone as
well but you have to so you can see that
this is the Android version of the app
then the other ones we have yeah you
have to have a set for iOS and Android
but they can they can share the same
distribution groups and the only
difference is the build the build
configuration you have to set up the
provisioning profiles and the Apple
version of code signing it as opposed to
Android yeah so question was what's
actually in the logging view and it's
yes only the analytics events so I've
only got one setup or one custom event
setup which is button clicked but you
can see I can't see start service so
yeah analytics yes yeah so the question
is what happens when the build
successful what happens on your phone
and the answer is you go to see the
install mobile app center comm website
so it's a separate store for App Center
so that the bees are staging bills that
I've shown here so to release on to the
app stores themselves it's this this
feature here which I haven't tested yet
it's quite new but so they have a
staging distribution platform so on iOS
we have the developers certificate or
the Enterprise certificate sorry and
then you have to accept that as a
developer that you're happy for that
developer account to access your phone
so it's again we've I've used the
developer provisioning profile we use at
Theo DOE and I haven't run into any
issues with that okay cool so thanks for
all for coming I hope that's useful he
saved us loads and loads of time at da
day and I'm hoping a really shrink down
and how quickly we can actually deploy
apps so if anyone would like to you I'm
- any more information on it then that's
my email address there and I'd love to
help thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
