some sort introduction I think is in
place I just came to London from Greece
I've been very involved in the local
community they're doing the local nodejs
meetups organising the David conference
which I definitely suggest you check out
for a very nice warm trip on June 2
Thessalonians to meet the best web
developers and trends out there going on
I'm very active on open source 14 p.m.
packages published on NPM and I've
contributed to most major node.js
packages as well professionally my
previous roles were mostly managing and
growing teams and varies the type of
role I'm looking for here although I
know it's going to take long so if you
got any contracted jobs for me I'm here
to take them so we're going to talk
about setting up your testing
infrastructure how you what you need to
invest in so that you have a robust test
infrastructure for your node.js
application and this is specifically
referred to early stage startups so
going through this commotion time and
time again gears over the gears we have
observed certain patterns and practices
that work best and accelerate your
testing and make it even more robust and
widget and this is what we're going to
talk about today so if you are a major
corporation with 200 plus engineers some
things may apply some things may not so
today we're going to talk about the
tools and the libraries used and most
importantly how to set up your node.js
application so it's more testable and
how to create your testing
infrastructure that is the point of this
presentation so these are just the tools
that I use I'm just showing them because
these are the tools that we are going to
be using those differ but what I want
you to keep from today
presentation is the practices and the
patterns which we are going to be
checking out right now so when you are
creating a node.js application what you
need to be careful of is to initialize
everything within functions so you don't
have anything defined outside of
functions that would be executed by the
moment your module is required let's see
what this means in code basically so
this is our index.js file this is
basically your bootstrap file the very
first file that nodejs will load to boot
up your application at the top we got
our libraries that we require and this
right here with the application boot
function we start by we start by booting
our services our database connections
our s3 whatever our queues so everything
is ready for the application to start
when everything is ready within proceed
to start our web server or whatever the
service please
and after that at the end of the file we
have two very important parts we have
the standalone test so this basically is
a hack that stores in the this boolean
variable whether this module has been
run directly from node or has been
required by another module which would
mean that we are actually in test mode
and if we have been launched by not the
node process directly if we are a
standalone right now in standalone mode
that is the moment when we start our
application and everything starts
booting up this is a very important step
so I always to have complete control
over how our application boots and it's
basically to treat our application as if
it was a library that can be required
and initialized both
not automatically so this is your test
directory structure again let's not
stick to the names let's focus on the
essence here we have an assert folder we
are going to talk about it in extent it
we your end-to-end tests your fixtures
we're going to talked about them to
library Ruiz again we're going to talk
about them and your new unit tests I
separate in 20 unit tests and you will
see why they have a different boot path
so what do we do what do we use the
asserts for therefore I found over time
as we are building crud applications
create read update delete that I've been
doing the same things over and over
again so I'm sending a request I'm
getting a response the response object
of that particular resource and I want
to test that object for its correctness
I want to assert that the object that I
have received a user object let's say
has the expected properties with the
expected types and the expected values
so basically that's what I'm checking
I'm checking all the properties there
the user object should have 14
properties username email below are the
types of the properties correct
I'm expecting a boolean here I'm
expecting a number and finally are the
values themselves correct so I have the
date field is the value of the date
field actually if a date or is it
scrambled so I've carried in two parts
so I can explain it better how an assert
module looks like the idea is that you
have a run all method that basically
takes the item the object the user data
object and passes it through the three
consecutive tests that we talked about
testing the properties testing the types
and testing the values testing the
properties is pretty straightforward
item on itself should be an object then
we test for the
this would be two and only two
properties and those should be them
that's what we are certain here and here
we are setting the types and finally the
values the reason we are creating
assertion files is because a specific
resource a specific end point the users
end point and I'm talking about all the
end points of the users are returning
the same user data object for its
request we make all right update a user
in updater in mail create a user login a
user we are always retaining the user
data object apply that to every resource
that we are testing so instead of
checking every time on every test
separately other properties there is
other types correct you have it as a
module and you decouple that type of
testing so that you can accelerate
testing of your endpoints fixtures
so in fixtures you have the modules that
will generate the data required for your
tests to run so I want to create a user
I need the username and a password to
create a user that what that is what
fixtures are for I've taken a liking on
using randomizers so as to not make the
fixture methods I dependent that is they
always read then return a different
result so for instance I want to get an
account object to create a user I need
the name and the phone number I'm using
faker to generate a random name for me
and the reason I'm doing that is to
provoke the system to produce an error
and here somebody would come and say why
wouldn't you do that you know brute
force all the names and again this is
these are techniques for a startup that
is starting out on the early stages or
the mid stages where product screens
over your ear and you only have a very
limited time to get it done and you need
to have it tested
that is the practicality and the reality
of what we are facing we are moving now
into the library's directory the
library's directory contains the test
library jes file that file is the common
library file for every test that we are
creating every test that we are creating
requires this file in this file
these modules purpose is to prepare the
environment for us which is basically
start up the application make sure
everything is up and running and then
pass back control to the test runners
additionally in that directory we are
going to create modules that will help
us perform certain tasks faster so after
we've tested user creation on the next
test when we want to test the user login
we will create a module in the libraries
folder to automatically create a user
for us by just calling a method instead
of creating a user on its test so I've
gone through this I explain to you what
tests Lib Jes is so we are moving now to
the account Lib so account is the user
and basically we want to provide methods
to create users to delete to alter
whatever operation we are doing
repeatedly and require to be done to
bring the system in a state where we can
test it we decouple all of that logic
inside the library folder so it can be
reusable that's the idea and here you
can see a break out of such such module
we have a create user which basically
performs an xhr call to our API with the
account data the account data that we
are getting from arguments and then
after the user is created we return the
user data object as it has been returned
by
by our service to further automation on
that and now we're going into specifics
of mocha mocha like every other test
runner has set up cases which is which
are run before every test and
deconstruction cases which are run after
every test so we can automate that as
well and we can create in line before
weeds which is a special keyword method
of mocha that instructs mocha to run
before every test basically create the
account and as you can see the account
data is provided through the fixture
module which we saw previously so we are
now starting to tie everything together
we are requiring the fixtures module we
are getting a new user data object to
test we are proceeding to create a user
and then this is very specific to mocha
mocha has a context then we store the
created account into the mochas context
that is what this account one does and
this dot account one is available in all
of our tests so we can say you know
through our testing this dot account one
dot ID do whatever you want with that ID
that's the idea so this is a test file
and as you can see in our test file what
happens first is that we call our
initializer from the test library this
will ensure this basically invokes
before reads that will boot up our
application in the form that we saw
before and we until the application has
booted correctly and is ready to get
tested it will not allow anything else
to be executed so basically this line is
everywhere the other part that I want
you to take note of is that everything
is within a single describe we will talk
about this a little bit later and as you
can see what's going on here is that I
am testing
user creation I've taken extra care so
as to not include actual xhr calls
within the test instead I have decoupled
that logic into my library so I can
reuse it it's all the same so what if I
put the code here what if I put the code
here well if I have it in my library it
is reusable and I can reuse it to test a
hundred different scenarios for
registering a user so we want it we want
to wrap all our test cases in a single
scribe that's regardless of your tester
that is going to provide you a very easy
way to run only a specific shoot or skip
specific shoot entirely and then write
create a second describe so you can see
here we have one two describes to
describe the more specific area of
testing as you test even if that seems
redundant if you only have one test it's
a good practice to follow as the code
base is a living organism and setting
patterns and things right in place is
what matters the most and good coding
product practices is all about so we're
moving in a little step further now we
want to test specifically for account
creation and this is how this is
basically how we sorry create an account
again all right
this is the wrong description what I
want to create now that I have created
an account I want to create an event
suppose that events are core to your
product and in order to test event
creation I need a user
and this is where the setup cases come
into place here so I again I'm starting
with my initialization so I ensure that
my application is that has started up
before testing and then right here I can
leap set up one this is the example that
I showed you before that's going to
automatically create the account and
store the account into this account one
and then I can use the user ID to create
the event data and so on and so forth
and this can go down the rabbit hole for
as many set up cases that you like to
bring to bring the testing into the to
bring your application to a correct
State to test like I said never do exits
are calls within your tests as much as
you can try to decouple them into their
own libraries for reusability and beware
of contexts if you're working with mocha
there are certain problems so again to
summarize focus on the patterns here and
not the specific methods focus on the
techniques the idea is that you have a
tester library that will whose
responsibility is to boot up your
application and the next idea is that
you have decoupled all the business
logic that needs to be in place before
you can run your tests so as again to
bring the service in a state that you
can perform your tests next run your
tests and then optionally run the
outcome on the automated Surtur's that
we discussed about I think I was very
fast what was it thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
