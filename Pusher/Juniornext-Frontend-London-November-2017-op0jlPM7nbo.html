software engineer futurelearn so if you
don't know about futurelearn we're a
social learning company we're enabling
online learning through conversation and
before future and I was a graduate
software engineer at Marks and Spencer
so the whole as the junior part of my
career kind of happened while I was on
that gradua scheme but obviously when I
say junior it doesn't really just means
you know depending on where you work it
has different titles and if you're like
you don't even have a specific time told
you just and Angele like everybody else
so I wanted to do this talk because I
got really confused by the whole process
of how I could show that I was making
progress in my career like was I ready
to make a formal leap from junior to
mid-level engineer what does that even
mean was like how was I supposed to do
it so I thought I'd kind of share what
I've learned along the way for other
people and talk about what we can do as
juniors and supporters as well to help
junior developers get on to the next
stage in their career so we can tackle
this obviously from both sides but let's
start with junior developers I think one
of the most important things that we can
be doing as junior developers is working
on ways that we can start to stretch
ourselves so I always actually do an
internal growing when I hear someone
tell me all you've got to stretch
yourself you to push yourself like nope
that just means I gotta do something I
don't want to do I'm gonna find it
uncomfortable but if it is a necessary
evil for me that was public speaking or
Weatherly any type of general
communication you should see me in
stand-ups or sprint reviews like it was
really awkward but the whole process of
putting myself out there a little bit by
bit made that prospect a little bit less
terrifying each time but yeah you can do
lots of things to stretch yourself and
don't just restrict it to technical or
programming aspects because at the end
of a you can be the most technical
person in the world but without your
communication those softer skills then
you're not gonna be able to communicate
with your team for example one per one
graduate I used to work with one as it
Marks and Spencer they said they knew
that are moving out of that junior
developer mindset when they could start
teaching people in their team things and
teaching in itself is a really crucial
skill that we kind of expect from senior
engineers or tech leads but we don't
have to wait until we've gotten more
experience to start practicing this so
am i involved in koba and that itself is
a great way to improve your own
knowledge and confidence while
supporting a new person in their new
career goals and I also found that when
I was helping somebody that was
completely new you I knew so much more
than I thought I did I was like coming
out with answers that I didn't even know
I had but that simple act of like
helping a completely new person put an
image tag on their page and then
thinking it's complete magic it's such a
good feeling so I definitely definitely
recommend helping out an organization
like Coke bar and coaching at those kind
of places because it's great for them
and it's also great to improve your
skills and a great way to check that
you're stretching yourself the right
amount is by thinking about it in terms
of these zones so starting in the middle
this is your comfort zone and everything
in here is like a day-to-day activities
things that you do but you don't learn
very much from these this area so it's
it's an essential place in terms of
feeling calm and reflecting but if you
want to be developing your skills what
you want to be doing is moving out into
the stretch zone so literally stepping
out of your comfort zone so everything
in here includes activities that
challenge you personally but they don't
overwhelm you so this could be something
you've never ever done before or it
could be a completely old activity that
you do all the time but you're doing in
a completely new way and I do is that
obviously it doesn't feel comfortable
but that act of going and doing
something new helps you develop and
you're learning something different
but you can't go too far with this so
ideally you want to avoid this own this
is the panic zone so yeah if you feel
like this is too far basically and how
to tell so if you imagine yourself doing
that activity if you think about it like
you go that few butterflies in your
stomach but you can still do it then
you're probably comfortably in the
stretch zone but if you imagine yourself
doing that activity and you'd like want
to throw up fall on the floor then yeah
maybe not today is in your panic zone
and it is worth saying that just because
something's in your stretch zone today
doesn't mean it can't be in your comfort
zone tomorrow and just because
something's in your panic zone today
doesn't mean that it won't move into
your stretch zone next month or next
week because as the more you develop
your skills the more you become more
comfortable with some of these things I
think one of the other ways kind of
related to this that Gina developers can
start to be moving on to the next stage
in their career is thinking about ways
that they can make a change in their
wider business and this is when you come
across something that as a junior you
find like a little bit annoying and you
think something can be done about this
so it's probably unlikely that you're in
a company that this doesn't happen and
it can be anything from a small
technical issue or a massive
non-technical issue and for me I wanted
to work on getting rotations in the
Graduate scheme that I was on so we I
did I was a front-end developer for
twelve months of the Graduate scheme I
thought it'd be really cool if we can
try different areas of the business so I
worked with my other grads and the
engineering managers to get this process
happening and that happened for the
following years grants well I think
absolutely if you get a chance to make a
change or see a chance to improve
something you should fix it
in fact like you should fix all the
things but seriously it's hard to do
depending on how much you've learned
because for the first three to six
months on my grad scheme I was trying so
hard to figure out like what the heck
was going on I was absorbing all this
new information in a big
in a brand-new really big business that
I didn't really have that much time to
think about what was annoying or what
could be an issue that could be fixed
but as you get into role as you get used
to where you are you start to pick
things up that you can make a change
with and I would definitely recommend
going out and making your whole the
workplace a better place but it's not
just good to see you it's also good for
the people that you work with and it's
also great like extracurricular activity
when you're going and talking about that
next stage in your career and it's also
worth saying that you don't have to do
this alone like raise it with team
managers mentors your input your
colleagues and make that change together
so one of the final things I wish I had
done more as a junior developer is
working on gathering evidence as I had
them so this is really easy if the
company you work at has a career ladder
in place because you can match the
skills that they set to different levels
of engineering with examples of where
you pick them up all you've learned them
but if you don't just think of some
skills that kind of go well across lots
of different businesses so what your
programming skills like have you gotten
examples of where you even learn a new
programming language or implemented
something really cool or what are your
communication skills like have you got
examples of how well you're
communicating with in your team or with
the wider technical team are you
proactive are you going out and doing
different things that are a little bit
outside of your role but also great for
the team that you're working in and have
you the examples of these and the same
for how well you are at giving and
receiving feedback or showing good team
working on the flipside of that how well
are you at working independently so once
you start to get like examples for these
areas just keeping a track of them in
something like a Trello board or Google
Doc is what I had or like but it
journaling it's good for you to look
back on and as you start to see them add
up it's a really good confidence piece
and at the same time
again it's also good when you go into
interviews and meetings you have this
document to refer to of all the amazing
things that you've been doing doing but
that's a lot of advice for juniors
what about supporters how can we be
encouraging and uplifting the juniors
that we're working with well I think one
of the important things that we can be
doing is just investing some time having
an a' junior can affect the productivity
in your team but it's make but we're
making a worthwhile investment the point
is we want them to upskill to
appointment where they can be really
independent and working as part of their
team on their own so work spend time
developing their strengths and
weaknesses getting to know the pairing
sessions for example but pairing
sessions is something that can be done
really badly I've had not the best
experiences of pairing in the past I
once fell asleep in a pairing session it
was only for a second
I woke back up and looked around
realized I was saw that they were still
looking at the screen typing stuff away
explaining things to me that I wasn't
really understanding obviously that is
not a good interactive pairing session
and obviously I wasn't like taking
anything in so if you're somebody that's
supporting a junior developer like give
them the keyboard let them drive and let
them go learn pace that's suitable for
them because once you put the keyboard
in front of them they're immediately
more engaged they have to figure stuff
out for them and like if you let them
figure that stuff out it's really useful
in terms of making sure that you're
developing at a pace that's suitable for
you but also asked questions that check
in on their understanding so instead of
asking like close questions did that
make sense and they say yeah because
well instead ask them like if I move
that line of code down to the bottom of
the function what do you think is going
to happen if I run the tests against
this function what do you think is going
to happen like you'll get a better
understanding of where there are
if they're following along and if you
find that there are gaps that you can go
back and help explain things a little
bit clearer and learning in this kind of
way will go both ways so not only will
the junior you're helping learn but
they're supporter that's supporting
their junior will also start to learn
more leadership skills and teaching
skills so it's a great for both of you
you find that like working with junior
developers their lack of a minute
familiarity in the system and the code
base that they have completely fresh
ideas that some of the things that more
experienced people would not even if the
world I think it's worth creating
opportunities for junior developers so
once you start to get to know them you
thought got to know their strengths
their weaknesses you can start to create
opportunities for them to develop the
places where they find challenging so
one of the things I did was a thing
called living objectives so you'll find
that in businesses you usually have like
an annual performance review and you set
some objectives and you come back to in
a year and see how you've been getting
along but as a junior developer you're
learning so much so quickly that it
doesn't really work so well
so this is what my living objectives
looked like when I first started out as
a grand juror around the outside of the
things I thought were important to my
role and then the orange strength is my
goal in each of those areas so I like I
want it to be amazing at javascript and
CSS but as a front-end developer I
thought I didn't need to think so much
about back into engineering at the time
and then I tape in the middle with just
my confidence level in each of these
areas so I always really wanted to
improve my communication skills where I
do tests I thought I was okay JavaScript
but obviously sauce or into improvement
and when you start working with your
junior and you see something like this
you know what areas will be good to
focus on so you can prioritize things
that are really important to their role
like JavaScript an example but then you
can also prioritize areas that you think
they're not suppose confident in so my
engineering one it just
at some time in an engineering capture
for me to talk about how I found
learning es6 so as so i had time to
learn es6 and also practice speaking and
presenting so as you get to know the
genie you work with it's really great to
create opportunities for them to develop
the skills that they find challenging
and another really important area for
supporters to be doing for juniors is
just giving them some regular feedback
and this is something i wanted the most
because it's just really helpful for me
to see where i'm at and how i can be
improving so there's gonna be anything
from a quick one liner like that pull
request rewrite was really really good
or that approach you took it was really
well written or it could be full-blown
written report on all the things that
you're doing amazingly well on or things
that you can be improving another grad
that I worked with they said that they
just inviolate there were at the
mid-level point they wanted confirmation
from the people around them and I think
that just shows how important it is from
lots of points of views it's really hard
to see as that uni developer how well
you're doing when everyone around you
kind of seems to be like they know
everything okay so I covered quite a few
points there if I do a quick recap so I
think juniors should be looking at ways
that they can be stretching themselves
and improving and developing your own
personal skills I think also genius you
can be looking at ways that you can make
a change in your wider business whether
that is through something small
something massive something technical
something completely non-technical and
also start to just gather evidence of
all the amazing things you're doing
whether that's on Trello or bullet
journaling and then to the people that
are supporting junior developers I think
it's important that you just do vest in
time to help them develop
create opportunities for them to start
improving the areas that they find
challenging and also provide some
regular feedback so they know if they're
doing well if they're on the right track
or if they can be doing something to
improve so the final quote from a
graduate I used to work with he just
said you know I don't think you wake up
one day and realize you're not a junior
developer anymore and she was so right
um myself I never really came to the
conclusion that I wasn't a junior
anymore that never really happened I
mean if we were doing things right we
should always be a junior at something
but for me I just managed to have enough
examples against a mid-level runoff that
I got and that kind of made the
transition real so to junior developers
I definitely say that you should go out
and get that promotion for yourself you
go out and develop your personal goals a
timeframe that suits you but actually
you don't worry about it because you're
doing amazingly well thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
