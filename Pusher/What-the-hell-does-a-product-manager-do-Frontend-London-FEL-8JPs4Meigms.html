here and might be thinking why is the
product manager talking to us what's
this got to do with what we do what are
we going to learn from this and so I'm
going to keep you in suspense on that
for the time being and we're going to
start with this so this is actually an
IKEA rad fir which is not the point of
the slide but what it does is it Ellis
traits kind of one of my slightly
nightmare scenarios um I've only just
noticed the kid in the background though
and so this is like one of those parties
that you go to where everyone is really
cool and there's lots of new people and
they maybe don't all work in tech so
you're kind of getting outside of the
bubble when you're kind of like this is
great and it's not I hate parties or
meeting new people or fun but inevitably
the first question that anyone asks when
you meet them and it has actually
happened tonight already um is so what
do you do much like that
and this is hard for me because you kind
of kind of take a deep breath and I know
what the reactions going to be and I say
well I'm a product manager and you
almost always get this kind of blank
stare or you get also you're a project
manager and I'm just like oh no that's
not at all what I do or if they follow
up with this question so what like what
do you actually do day-to-day and so I
kind of try things like well you know so
maybe they don't understand what product
is I make useful websites and apps for
people but then you kind of have a say
also you're you're a developer you're a
designer and you can't like oh no that's
not what I am either I might kind of
just tell people what to make and I'm
like no I really don't tell people what
to make because although I've got
manager and my job I don't actually
manage anybody in any conventional sense
and you're probably still thinking well
how is this relevant does it really
matter if these people party know what I
do and so these aren't the people I'm
concerned about they doesn't really
matter if they know what I do I might
have an awkward conversation
and be a bit like her it would have been
really nice to have not been awkward but
it does matter that the people that I'm
working with know what I do because a
big part of my job actually is to kind
of help other people do their job better
so that we can all succeed and and so in
kind of the course of thinking about
this talk I've been collecting phrases
or ways that you describe product
managers so I did what any kind of
self-respecting infinity person does and
went to medium and typed in product
management wise a product manager and
you quickly realize for this kind of
tens or hundreds of articles almost
exclusively written by project product
product I've done it product managers
they're covering like what is a what a
product manager is what they are how
they should be how we can be better what
they definitely shouldn't be doing and
it quickly becomes clear there's just
many different ways of defining what it
is that we do and here at made by many
it's something that we have been kind of
over the last year and a half it's a
relatively new job title here and roll's
it's something we've been trying to
define especially where we work
where we're talking about clients so
we're not looking after a product
directly ourselves in quite the same way
and so I also fought ok so medium hasn't
really helped me maybe I'll go and ask
our developers here what they think I do
actually they did quite well they didn't
say anything that was offensive and all
of the things that they said were things
that I consider part of my job but there
was still a huge variety of answers and
none of them were probably what I would
say myself so these are some of the
things I have collected ah yeah there's
some good ones
I kind of agree in part with it all of
them to some degree my personal favorite
is janitor not because it's demeaning
but because I actually think it gets to
the core of what my day-to-day reality
sometimes is yeah you have wondered he
does data entry when you're like we need
to put all the content in this it's
probably a product manager somewhere and
I also found this
which I just let you absorb for a second
and I worry that this is true a lot of
the time I don't think I've ever really
considered myself Superman but I've
definitely been moments where you feel
like a headless chicken and to kind of
stop that feeling and to stop running
around in circles and having people
wonder what I'm doing why I'm doing it
am i doing anything at all and there's
three big questions that I really think
this boils down to so I think ultimately
for me product management boils down to
and this is the difference between a
project manager and a product manager
what is the right product why is that
the right thing and how do we make it
happen
and I put these in a triangle of
uncertainty because they're not all
independent questions but you can kind
of answer simply you can't answer any of
these in isolation and each of them is
continually informing the other and so
as we find out more about kind of what
something should be and why it should be
we're then moving on to thinking about
how do we achieve that but as we start
making progress with how and getting
into details we probably need to go back
and revisit why we're doing it in the
first place as we kind of figure out
well should it behave in this way or
that way and so it made by many for what
we're always aiming for is the right
product this is our Venn diagram that we
use extensively and if you've ever seen
anyone from a by many talk anywhere
before you've probably seen it so we're
aiming for that bit in the middle there
is this really slim sliver between what
the customers need and what's right for
the business and that's kind of our
sweet spot but getting to that war as I
said needs to be continually guided by
the why and the how and I said it's a
triangle of ambiguity and so part of my
job a very large part is navigating that
and helping other people to navigate it
and I kind of think this is for a
product manager most in
Austan thing is being able to ask the
right questions at the right time to the
right people in order to figure out all
of these things and make progress so big
question mark we always have kind of a
starting point for reference in this
case I'm going to sort of be assuming
we're thinking about a product that
already exists in some way shape or form
and so the one thing that helps to guide
all of those questions for me is having
a kind of a product vision in mind and
so for those of you that may not know
kind of exactly what a product vision is
and should be it's something that looks
into the future they kind of tend to be
big and bold and they serve as
inspiration and direction and allude to
the problem is that we're trying to
solve so we like to refer to them a lot
as our North Star because that's that's
where we're going that's where we're
headed and we might be taking small
steps to get there
but that's what we're trying to do and
for me the absolute best ones as well
help you make all of the decisions you
need to make on that journey and those
the vasila questions it can be
everything from which feature to
prioritize over another one how they
should be implemented which things we
should just kill because they're never
going anywhere what we should be
tackling right now because it's going to
have the most impact and what we can
unlike what can wait for a next spin
sprint or a future one so I've just
ranted about vision for a few minutes
but ultimately this is an important one
I keep thinking I've got a clicker Oh
product managers are facilitators not
visionaries and so I think if you're in
a situation where a product manager is
kind of acting like a product dictator
and telling people to solve our to solve
for problems and not figuring out with
an awesome team that for me is doing it
really really wrong you know I believe
the only way to make something right to
make that kind of right product that
we're all aiming for I hope is by
listening to a lot of people and working
with everyone as a team and that's
something that is particularly relevant
to this role of
product management because as a product
manager actually my experience and
knowledge kind of goes across a load of
disciplines but a relatively shallow
level so you know thinking about design
I might be able to sketch out a user
journey but I can't do the actual design
of an interface and make it look amazing
and really work for people I can do some
budgeting and understand business models
but I'm not an amazing finance whiz he's
going to be able to solve all of your
kind of future profit projections for
example and I can sort of talk tech Ilha
laughs um but I definitely can't code
anything in there she wants some kind of
like very nineties iframes but for you
and why I want to talk to you really is
because your knowledge and your skills
are far far deeper than mine
so whereas I kind of touch a bit of
everything you actually are the experts
and I couldn't do my job my job wouldn't
exist without you log and if I wasn't
around you kind of you might miss me if
I got hit by bus I'd hope you'd be
slightly sad but you would ultimately
still be able to make something um I'm
going to argue that I don't think it
would necessarily be the right thing but
you could still build something because
ultimately even with this kind of
amazing deep knowledge where you really
know your stuff
when we're thinking about a product
we're trying to make we're actually all
part of this much much bigger team and
so down here that's probably developers
designers the people working directly in
building stuff on a product team
together with all sorts of people that
might then be a stakeholder in what
you're doing so you might have to make
friends with finance person your CEO or
strategist whoever kind of is that
visionary it's probably going to turn up
with some very strong opinions
we've got marketing customer service and
of course really importantly the actual
customers the people we're building this
thing for and all of these people in the
same way that you have this depth
knowledge about be
young developers on how to write code
and how to make stuff they all have the
same level of depth of expertise as you
do in their own particular fields and me
I see it somewhere in the middle they're
possibly slightly closer to a product
team than anyone else but that's kind of
my happy happy place mostly happy place
it's where uncomfortable because what
I'm trying to do at every point in a
product proper project when making a
product is kind of hear all of these
people's opinions I want to know what's
motivating them what they're thinking
about what they're worried about well
their goals are where they want to be
and helping all of them to come together
to build something that works for
everyone
so for me this is really a kind of a
position of facilitation negotiation a
bit of persuasion is far more about that
than it is for about leadership and the
big thing here is really my role here is
to kind of stop any one of those parties
becoming too loud or Donna McDonald --nt
it's all about trying to balance all of
these inputs to find something that's
actually going to work for people and
it's not necessarily just people either
there's also kind of on top of this you
might have quantitative data what your
competitors are doing changes in kind of
broad technology landscapes for so many
different things that have to be
considered when we're aiming for the
right product and another way for me to
describe this is really that there's a
bunch of people that sit a very high
level who are thinking about that
product vision in a long-term way so
they're thinking about where are we
going to be in the next year three years
five years and then as developers I
think you probably often find yourselves
right in the kind of now and the
implementation and the particular
feature that you're working on at any
given moment and so you're kind of
looking at things from this very minut
detail and so a big part of what I tried
to do is translate between those two
things to help people who are at that
high level understand the problems that
come when you're actually implementing
their grand vision and to help the
people who
we're doing that implementation
understand the why a lot better and as I
said a big part of how I do this is by
asking questions and forming hypotheses
and trying to validate them so here's
the hypothesis for you I think we can
make better more successful products by
all thinking a little bit more like a
product manager I'm not going to try and
convince anyone to become one but I
think there is some things in that kind
of world and skill set that can help
everyone to do their jobs better you
probably thought I was just going to
talk to you about what product manager
is without asking anything but there are
a few ways I think we can all start to
do this and and I think this is the
first step it's like for me the worst
developers to work with are the ones
that are just like I'm really great at
writing code you're just going to give
me stories I'm going to write in a
really beautiful way and I'll do it
exactly as it's described and it'll be
done that's painful
what I actually want is the people to
kind of look at the backlog look at the
tasks and consider user stories within
that wider context of why are we doing
this who it's for and how can I build
this in a way that best serves them
which kind of leads on to encouraging
everyone to step away from their screens
occasionally it does happen and I'm sure
I'm also not the first person to stand
up at kind of dev conference and say you
should all go and meet your users but I
think that is one of the first steps if
you have the potential and you're able
to go and out and meet customers and
speak to them directly
it can make it a lot easier for you to
know how something should be built is
there's nothing quite like sitting down
with the user seeing them use the thing
that you've been working on for days
will be will be a generous and seeing
that they struggle to use their or that
the loading time is unrealistic for the
device they're using it on and it's not
just about customers either as I said
they're kind of one part of
big force that brings a product into
being I'd also urge everyone to kind of
step away from their computer within the
office as well whether it's in the
kitchen and just talk to the person who
you have no idea what their job is find
out what their concerns are and then the
next time someone comes down over like
we must build this feature now you might
have a better understanding of where
they're coming from and be able to solve
that in a better way call my office is
dangerous or not I think a lot of people
also think product managers are in
charge of the process and we kind of say
this is how it should be done but
especially Preveza bits that aren't from
a tech background it's not always clear
to us how we can best help and to make
work more efficient efficiently and
ultimately no matter how good we are at
listening to our customers listening to
stakeholders if we don't get something
out the door it's kind of a work for
nothing
and so I think from that perspective I
think product managers are really kind
of pragmatists there are some things
obviously we want to do and make sure
happen but ultimately you're the experts
on things like estimation and exactly
how long it takes to build something or
the benefits of one way of doing a
feature versus another and I really want
to encourage everyone to like feel that
you can own that process you're working
with to make it more efficient and suit
the way you work and let you do better
work ultimately it kind of all boils
down to me as they ask more questions so
there was the three questions at the
beginning and I think those are things
we can all use in whatever we're doing
to really guide and make the work that
we're doing better so the stuff you can
ask yourself so it's what are we really
trying to achieve with building this
thing who is it for
how is it going to be used how can it
help us to get to that vision and their
things to ask people around you as well
so whether it's colleagues or clients or
customers using that kind of curiosity
to sniff out their motivations and fears
and develop a better understanding of
our point of view can be really helpful
when
unexpected kind of curveball flights in
and that's what I really want to leave
you of is that I think there has been
you know I hear of tension between
product managers and developers and I
think it's largely because you don't
feel enough ownership or a product
manager is holding onto stuff too much
and actually this is all a shared
responsibility so I'm not shared across
the team is the only way that we can
navigate the kind of uncertainty of
getting to the right thing and of trying
to make products that are right for the
business and for the customer is to find
out what we don't know what we need to
ask to find the next answer if it's
going to help us release the next thing
but it's going to get a little bit
closer to where we're going
