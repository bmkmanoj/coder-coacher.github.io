minutes not you can stop me if I'm going
on for too long so the magic alchemy how
can you turn turn digital bits you know
into real money into yours dollars yen
you know but what do you want and here
you have the transactions yeah and the
Austrian chillin you know the the coin
base is the biggest mountain grows
Klockner euros Vinita and you get the
shillings so this looks you know silly
but how can you make it into real cash
and it's simple block chain blocking
block jr. you put it on the blockchain
and the magic happened yeah it's real
money and the what what's a blockchain
you know decentralized payments
decentralized transaction decentralize
banks or it's not the central banks it's
 the banks because you don't need
banks anymore and so what is a
blockchain a blockchain is it's a
distributed database it's a hyper ledger
accounting book it's consensus with
proof of work or a proof of stake
digital fingerprints cryptographic magic
hashes it's a lottery central bank % in
general solutions you know so that's all
the magic blockchain blockchain you know
yes yes yes yes so that's I have a open
what blockchain a page to collect you
know what there's a what blockchain but
these are all you know it's not all the
magic of the blockchain and of course
the proof of the pudding in English is a
proverb how can you check if a pudding
is good you have to eat it you know and
then if it tastes good then you know the
proof of the pudding is that it was work
if you and so the proof of the pudding
I'm I I'm if I'm a crazy guy or whatever
but you know can I prove that this
blockchain magic works and so the proof
of the pudding is the Bitcoin blockchain
you know billions of dollars real money
you know it's no joke so it's working
yeah
and of course the joke with Bitcoin
nowadays is it's not
it was the blockchain but now there are
many Bitcoin blockchain Bitcoin classic
Bitcoin classic gold bit cold silver
Bitcoin Ruby bit current platinum you
know and Bitcoin shilling but it will be
bit chilling without Bitcoin so it's an
incredible success story and the well
first Bitcoin payment so a guy on the
milling I said I give you I'll give you
10,000 bitcoins the first person who
sends me a pizza I give you 10,000
bitcoins and what did they say they said
 you you know we don't need your
pity currently averse nothing you know
and they had a on the email so they were
selling bitcoins so the estimated verse
was about $40 at this time you know and
so somebody called pepper Jones and send
this guy a pizza I think he was and so
he got 10,000 bitcoins here and now the
question is you know it's like the
national day they celebrated 20 million
dollar pizza day but you know that's for
the person of the magic to turn it into
money and anybody knows how much it
works today
10,000 bitcoins so I updated the chart
the highest was like 20,000 dollars for
a single Bitcoin and I think now it's
about five five thousand today might be
five thousand US dollars five thousand
euros and what's to build to build a
blockchain you know from scratch from
zero it's like there was in a job
posting for a full stack group to God
blockchain developer know because you
know if you have to be a crypto god to
work with blockchain all the money all
the magic you know billions of dollars
you create out of nothing
so blockchain blockchain and so is is
and the message is you know it's it's
a linked list so if somebody comes to
you here can you handle an area linked
list so it's there's no magic the
messages yes you can you know you don't
have to be afraid and to build a
blockchain and let's build a blockchain
in 20 lines so I'm not come not adding
the blank lines you just have to count
them either I posted it online and then
somebody say oh these are 22 lines it's
not 20 lines or something you know
so the blank lines are not counted and
you can make it you know more camp
compact to wrap it up so if it's 30
lines or 20 lines there was a article
that like more it has 200 lines but it
doesn't but the important message is a
block chain there are different levels
that's the block chain network the big
network and then there's the block chain
database it's the second but at the
basic core is the block chain is just a
data structure like an area so can you
imagine you know the Austrian economist
ministers he's starting a linked list
Austria energy initiative if you don't
atop the link list you know you will
don't evolve you die so it's like you
know an airy Airy
Austria there's the blockchain if you
don't know there's blocks in Austria you
know from the Austrian government ten a
ten point plan here so that we survive
in the future from the
government-sponsored
blockchain Austria anyway so here you
see the the complete code of the
blockchain what is the magic you know a
blockchain is a list of block or a chain
of block block it and it the magic part
are the crypto hashes the crypto hash is
another word for crypto hashes is the is
a digital fingerprint or a digest and
here we have the block and we have the
hash so to make it easy usually you work
with bytes but in this simple example I
use strings so the
is the authority tube 32 byte string
then we have a previous hash which links
which is a reference to the previous
block then we have the transactions so
in this case my transactions are in the
data string that's the payload you know
which are the transactions and then we
have a little a timestamp and as a
random date I pick 97 day that's the day
I was born
that's you know not Jesus Christ in 1970
you know it's then the new area a pork
so acquitting it's unique you know at
the pairs of eunuchs and they start the
first second and so that timestamp is
just the integer and the magic part is
this calculating the hash and
calculating in the hash the crypto
everything is done in go there's a
crypto package and there are different
algorithms and so we we pick the Bitcoin
secure hash algorithm 256 bits but
that's the you give it the bytes and it
gives you back the the hash and I
convert the hash from binaries to as to
a string the string and to create a new
block to mine to my new plucks you know
you give the block the data the
transactions you have to have the
reference to your previous block then
you add the timestamp it's time now all
UNIX UNIX gives you the unique seconds
and then you calculate the hash and I
calculate the hash by using using the
transactions the previous hash and the
timestamp and then this gives me back 65
characters hex characters or 32 bytes
because you know one hex character are
four four bits one byte has eight bits
and 256 if you multiply anyway and
return a new block that's that's a fully
working blockchain
and that's am I kidding let's build a
real blockchain so the real blockchain
is we start block 0
it's the Genesis verse the beginning of
everything
the Genesis block and so the Genesis
block has no parent has no previous what
is the solution you know what what - do
you put in and so to get the inspiration
from Bitcoin what what this Bitcoin
doing Bitcoin so the gain SS block how
do you know it's the Genesis block they
are using so it's 64 these are 32 byte
256 bits and 64 so in this case 64 hex
hex characters so that's the the
previous hash it's all 0 and that's the
the Genesis and so for the block for the
next block we just put in the the hash
for the for the previous block you know
and then it's the choke about an area
usually you know the link is by hash
what's a ID of a block the idea of a the
unique ID of a block is the hash and if
you link the blocks you link the blocks
by using your hash so it's not you know
so when if you usually they hate the
heat of a block means you know they are
one after another one and if you put in
in an area you automatically get the
index of the areas they hate you know if
you put in here two blocks in an array
you get the blockchain you know and area
element zero is like an assist the block
1 block 2 block 3 you have easy access
and so that's in two lines you have a
fully functional block chain and now am
I making it up so the important part
where the minister might be right you
know it's not a linked list the
difference between a linked list and a
block chain is the magic crypto the
cryptographic hash
magic and the cryptographic has special
magic links the blocks and the magic
properties you cannot change it you know
if you change the content of the block
your hash changes and if you change your
content and the hash changes the link is
broken you know if you change the block
content you break the link and if you
break the link the block chain is broken
and if you have a broken blockchain then
you know that's the magic and so if you
use just the print you know you give in
go format print and you give it the
block and this is how it looks like you
know the seconds from 97 T so it's like
the the time in integer and why do they
use this format they useless format just
you know it's shorter you know - if you
if you save it on on the database it's
just easier to save it's just an integer
then the hello cryptos you know you have
to imagine these are the transactions
the payload and then two important parts
are here are the hash of the block and
the hash linked to the previous block
and you see you know the zero is the
they made up so you see that's the
genesis block and if you look closely
you know this hash and this hash do you
see a difference
so these that's the magic link of the
blockchain and so if I would change here
just one letter up case the lower case
you know the hash changes immediately
and then the link is broken
cryptographic magic and so if you post
this online okay oh this is not a
blockchain you know you are screwing me
you guys came out just accused they
don't want to be accused of being
scammer so I asked Emma
so what proof of work you know proof of
work and consensus that's you know
distributed decentralized proof of work
that's can you add proof of work okay
maybe two lines of code and we have
proof of work
so and that's another important feature
of proof-of-work is the lottery the
lottery against corruption and yeah so
how does the proof-of-work
work and the consensus so the magic
about Bitcoin and the blockchain is the
lottery and so what you do is if you
calculate the hash every time you
calculate the hash if you have hello
cryptos you always get the same hash you
know same input same hash and the hash
is always 256 bits and in this case we
have seen to calculate the hash we use
the the transactions the data
the previous hash and then we have the
timestamp and so yeah and so how can we
make this in in a lottery and how can we
make it in a consensus that everybody
agrees that the that these blocks are
authentic and they real the truth and
everything and so how it works is it's
if you create a hash in Bitcoin you know
it takes ten minutes to find the hash
how come you know if I calculate the
hash I'll show you later in if I
calculate this hash on Ingo on this my
little computer it's eight hundred
thousand hashes in a in a second so I
can calculate it hand mean hashes in a
second so why would it take me ten
minutes to calculate the hash you know
to prove that I win the lottery win the
lottery and every hash calculation is a
lottery ticket that's the proof of work
you can only you can only win the
lottery if you calculate the hash you
know there's the joke that somebody says
you know God you know I believe in you
you know you are the best and whatever
but I'm disappointed you know I want to
win the lottery you know when I believe
in you and 10 years past 15 years and
I'm not winning the lottery and then God
says you know you loser buy a
ticket
a ticket and you are going to win you
know because he was complaining you know
he's not winning in the lottery but was
not buying any tickets you know and so
here the magic is the proof of work is
you you can how do you prove that you
are playing the lottery you can only
prove by calculating the hash and every
hash calculating is a lottery ticket and
you have to find the lucky number
but where's where is the lucky number so
the lucky number is let's go to the next
one well the lucky number yeah
so an important part the crypto magic
secure hash so the first part is I
already mentioned it secure so Bitcoin
is using the sh8 256 anybody knows what
it stands for there's like sweet home
Austria still hacking away so this
secure hash sh2 other 56 is the secure
and so we are getting back to the secure
part it's a secure hash algorithm and
anybody knows who invented that's the
conspiracy theory who who invented and
who gave this Algar a to the world is
the National Security Agency NSA from
the United States
anybody know these guys they are
watching you right now
so hello so they they design this
algorithm which is great because you
know it's secure how do we know that
it's secure we trust them you know now
I'm just kidding is if you have a
cryptographic algorithm by definition
you cannot trust anybody and the only
way to trust that it's working you have
to publish so this is an open algorithm
there's no secret you know and it was
analyzed anybody can analyze it and so
it's open yeah public domain no secrets
but it was designed and donated by the
National Security Agency of the United
States and so the secure how can you
create a secure
hashing algorithm and the most important
part about a secure algorithm is if you
change one bit you know the hash changes
completely yeah and what does this tell
you for a lottery you know if you do a
gaming or gambling what's your source of
randomness you know because if you want
to crack a gambling machine you just
have to find out you know that actually
it's not random if you know the random
seed you know then you can calculate
there you know sorry the randomness and
so here the random part is it's it's if
it's secure it's by definition if it's
the more secure the more random you know
and the more random is there's no way
you can calculate if you change a bit
there's no way to calculate you know how
this is how the how the hash is going to
change and so this is the perfect for
two parts the perfect part is the
lottery how can you find the lucky
number the only way to find the lucky
number is there's no way to calculate it
the only way to find this you have to
try and try and try and try you know one
two three four and that's how you
there's no way you can shortcut to any
way and the other one who is going to
find the lucky number you if you want to
fight corruption then in in the greased
democracy what have they done when they
invented democracy so they tried
different things one way is let's say
how in Russia you know you elect one guy
and then you have the next election and
suddenly oh this we have two hundred
million or let's say five hundred
million people and then in the next
election or what surprise the same guy
but we have one hundred million people
you know that's and so here who is going
to win the lottery the next time you
know every ten minutes in the blockchain
a new block a new lottery who is going
to win you know is every year I'm
winning I'm winning I'm winning that's
you know and then you the guy who's
winning he's checking if everything is
in order I know if every time the same
guy is checking if everything is or and
so the magic part of this lottery is
that it's random and you're not you
don't know who is going to win and so if
you have a network let's say with 200
nodes
everybody's calculating you know then
every time it you have a perfect
distribution and it's a perfect
distribution also against corruption
because every time you know you don't
know who is going to check the next time
that your books are in order you know
you don't know who is going to find
there they like it ticket and so and and
the important part it it's how does now
the the magic so sorry for the long
story so how does it work in practice
so this magic lucky number it's called
nonce not for nonsense but it stands for
number used once you know because the
lucky number you use it just once and
how does it work
every time you calculate the hash you
get the same same results you know and
so how do you get a different hash you
get a different hash by just adding a
number you know if you add the number
one and you calculate your hash you get
a different hash now you add two it's a
different number a different bit you get
a different hash and now the challenge
is what is the big challenge everybody
know what's the big challenge in Bitcoin
and the proof of work in the hash so the
big challenge is if you see in the hash
above the big challenge is this is just
a number you know the computer is
working with numbers and bits and the
hash is just you know a big integer
number and so the challenge is this
number has to start let's say in this
case with four leading zeros you know
and so this is a hex a hex number which
means four leading zeros one hex number
is four bits and four hex numbers which
four zeros is 4 by 4 is 16 bits and 16
bits of zero and so the number has to
start with 16 bits of leading zeros and
so oh and to calculate the probability
if you if your stroller dice and the
dice has one two three four five six
then you have six possibilities you know
if you have two then it's 6 multiplied
by 6 if you have three you know
that your chances to find to have 666
and in this case zero zero zero you know
you have to find 6 x 6 x 6 so in this
case it's a hexadecimal anybody knows
how many numbers does a hex have HTML
has 10 so it's 16 and so 16 1 0 is 16 so
what's the change here so if you're
looking for a single 0 it's your chance
is you need C 16 maximum 16 tries on
average because it's not a perfect
distribution almost and so for 4 it's 16
x 16 x 16 x 16 for 4 times 16 and the
important part it's it's exponential
you know the bitcoin is looking for 23
zeros and you need all the computers in
the world need 10 minutes and so to
calculate you know that's what what
changed there's not a big change that
changes if you have this number used
once nonce and we start by 0 and then a
for loop this is the you know a loop
forever and what you do is you calculate
the hash and what you do is you
calculate the data the transactions you
add the nonce and then you check if this
hash that you get back has the bingo you
know the lucky number the leading zeros
if it doesn't have the leading zeros
then what you have to do you add +1 and
you try the next one year and so on this
computer this might be more there might
be a million hashes in a second you know
calculating but in this case you just
have to to find this number so what is
changing so we add the nonce the lucky
number you know if anybody wants to
check up if this block is in order then
you just need the hash and the nonce and
then you calculate it in milliseconds
but if you create a new block if you
mind a new block you know compute hash
which proof-of-work
you go and it has to find the knots you
know the lucky number that's the how the
mining works and so am I making it up
so that's version 2 version 2 of the
blockchain so we added 3 more lines and
we ago we are good for we have proof of
work and we have consensus the consensus
just means that the longest blockchain
bins you know every 10 minutes a new
plug and the longest chain bins but if
you see the difference here if you look
at the hash you know you see here that's
the nonce and what do you see in the
hash you know it has for the hash has
four leading zeros and the nonce you
know if you remember the nonce was the
loop forever you know and it's
calculating 0 1 2 3 4 5 now the question
is you know how many tries so this block
you know how many hashes did it
calculate try so in this algorithm yeah
it tells you a hundred and five thousand
hashes here and after a one hundred and
five thousand hashes one and six of
course you know it has found the lucky
number and so now the question this guy
above you know the lucky number what's
the lucky number how many how many times
did how many did they have to calculate
so it was forty two thousand two hundred
and seventy-eight you know and you see
the numbers are different why are they
different because it's a random you know
and it's poor chance you can calculate
your chances here if you increase the
difficulty you know if you increase the
difficulty to let's say for 40s yours
you know you are calculating you know
the universe will no longer exist that's
the the big the magic of the big numbers
okay I mentioned a couple of times
what is your hash rate you know well you
know what's your it how much do you
charge but in this case you know what's
your hash rate of if you're mining or
your computer and so all this I think I
have it before if I have this open open
blockchain anybody knows the open block
change on github
so these blockchains they are if you go
out to get tap open blockchains plural
with s and then there's all some
blockchains
blockchain go there's like a JavaScript
Ruby Python version but there's the go
version and so this code you know you
just grab the file public domain and you
can run it on your own and this
what's your hash rate this is an open
block chains and so I'm a big fan of
secure hash 256 so we have a fan page
it's called awesome awesome secure shell
256 yeah and it has hash read go it's a
small not sure if you can save for a go
or code a script but that's the you know
it's missing the import but it's if you
click here it's online you have the code
and what it does is the difficulty so
the factor is the number of zeros so to
find 1 0 you see 1 0 4 bits
hash calculated 56 the time 0 you know
it's so fast it's not even a millisecond
it doesn't even you know it's so fast
anyway
but factor to you know I'm still waiting
you know factor so I just treat factor 7
year if you do factor 8 it's 15 20
minutes and factor 9 it's you know you
have 18 euro couple of months because
it's exponential is no joke anyway so
what what it does it has just the loop 1
to 7 for the difficulty and anybody does
the strings repeat with the factories
it's just you know two zero three zeros
four zeros five zero six zeros and
here's the magic you know time now
before and time afters and then I
compute the the proof of work you know
and this is you know it calculates hash
hash hash hash hash hash until it finds
it and then it tells you know how much
time and how many hashes and if you
divide the hash hashes through the
seconds you get your rate per second so
I have a very you know I work at the big
insurance company so they have old
Computers IBM still I think IBM and so I
posted it on Twitter and a colleague
from tried it at his computer and he so
I'm you see it here I get eight hundred
thousand hashes in go on a low-end
notebook computer Ingo and so here the
Apple state-of-the-art upon wood poke
you know anybody guess how much he can
do so he had like three million you know
three times three million hashes per
seconds and before I've done it in Ruby
so you can laugh at your B Ruby a
scripting language had about a hundred
thousand so I was like the just same
machine you know using go was eight
times or which is to be expected you
know the rule would be like C code is
ten times faster than you know if a
Python or Ruby script but yeah so it's
like let's say this machine would have
like a million or more hashes per second
and yeah so now on you can run you're
encouraged to run it on your machine and
now the quiz is you know you know the
hash rate of Bitcoin of the network or
the other one is if you buy a chip you
know a mining chip
you cannot compete anymore so a minor
chip I think they have like a billion
hashes in a second at least at least a
billion you know enemy and so they
what's the the the magic the hash rate
is still going up you know and this is
the crazy part you don't need it so that
the part of the hash rate is completely
useless there's no value in this crazy
hash hash part you know but anybody if
that's to see if you're sleeping but
what's the idea of the hash by doing the
hashing so they do the hashing that you
want to have a block every ten minutes
you know because if there's no limit you
know you can create a hundred thousand
hashes you know in a minute in a second
you know but because it's so hard to
find the hash you are guaranteed you
know you only get a new block every ten
minutes and and so the only this crazy
part you know
has the only meaning is you know they
want a ten minute or if if a different
block junior you can say the eatery room
sky they are crazy I think they have ten
seconds you know every block every ten
seconds so they have trouble you know
distributing the blocks in the network
because every ten second year you know
you're trying to catch up and the next
the next next every ten and so at ten
minutes you know it's if you go around
the network it's nice and slow anyway
yeah and so this is the only part is is
about the two parts the hashing the
meaning of the hashing in the one part
is that ten minutes and the other one
the secure part is the random lottery
you know for the corruption is who is
going to do the next next block you know
that's the part is every it's random and
so you are getting if there are a
hundred people then you know you get to
build your block and you should get your
reward so that's the corruption in the
Bitcoin buy it field you know because
the idea was everybody can take part in
the mining and you get you know if you
do the block you get the Bitcoin but now
you have a big mining pool you know and
so and they are winning a bit of 50%
mining pool or whatever but the idea was
you know that every node you know is
taking part in the core in the network
and then you get your Bitcoin and every
time you know there can be no that's the
famous 51% rule if 51% are corrupt you
know they can take over the network with
anyway so the question is what's the
Bitcoin hash rate and you see it's going
it's going to the moon it's going to the
moon and so it's I think if they're
number it I think that doesn't exist but
it's like 25 million trillions of
trillions of hashes but you can imagine
you know this computer and they all the
all the computers in the network need
ten minutes to find and it's just I
think it's just 23 zeros you know and
it's 256 so you can add more you know so
it's impossible to which brings us to
the next part you know Bitcoin
blockchain money it's completely not and
crazy you know
and the energy waste and so forth and
and ten minutes to commit okay you know
you can do the Easter iam where you have
seven seconds and whatever anyway so
it's your you know privileged now you
know the magic you know of the magic
because if you read the papers the
article in the newspaper it's like the
mathematical puzzle to find for the mind
it's usually you know it's very mythical
you know how it works but it's you know
it's super trivial free money free money
I'm giving away Schilling who wants
Schilling 100 chillin it's verse zero
but you know get in on the ground floor
let's say choke get another ground floor
and it will you know it will go to the
sky so anybody new tulipmania bubble in
Holland what year you know you get 100
chilling so it's it's 60 is 37 P thank
you and I heard like what's the most
expensive tulip they no longer exist it
I give you a tip it was red and white
you know white with red so it had white
white what's the name the leaves and
then sprinkled with red because the
single color they were the Commons they
had no value only the multicolor and so
the Stamper Augustus you know forever or
Gusteau's the greatest emperor of the
history so same power Cousteau's and
here I was trying to do I have to skip
this one if anybody's interested in
transaction so if you've seen that I
have hello Kryptos the data strings but
if you add the transactions you know
there's no magic you know you just add
the from to the important part is you
know if it's a accounting ledger you
have you're sending the tulips or you're
sending them money then you have a firm
account and a to account and it's called
double accounting double entry
accounting you know you have credit and
debit and if
you add something to your book you know
all this double entry from - were debit
and credit and so in this case max -
Isabel so I'm adding this this stuff in
the next didn't sorry
and so what I'm trying to build for the
Schilling Central Bank a library a goal
library which is an open block chains
working progress and so you know you can
just use new block so it's in an early
stage but it should be in the next
week's and joking about you
are you joking about the shilling so the
inspiration here there were lots of
Eastland was famous you know there was
the GABA menu we give everybody the day
our water and so it was you know a small
they're like carrots the Iceland might
have 200,000 people so it's easy you
know to give everybody free money and so
was it working you know it was working
in the beginning but then everybody
wanted to exchange the new or a water in
two dollars you know and anybody guess
what happened when everybody exchanged
they are or and cells two dollars it
collapsed immediately you know favorite
cells so the important part to remember
who the whole never sell you know
because if you're starting to sell you
know it's going to collapse so hold hold
hold
anyway so touch golden it's no joke it's
real and I've given the the JavaScript
talk in September and so I updated this
chart today and the funny part is when
in September October
it was the market capitalization was
fifty million dollars you know and now
you see it survived the big the big
20,000 Bitcoin rally and it's getting
stable but it has now it has tripled
almost four times so instead of the 40
50 thousand millions
now the Dutch golden is almost you know
165
million US dollars
you know it's to almost 200 million u.s.
dollars you know so the shilling bit
chilly rock solid
we are not scamming anybody in Austria
you know rock solid you know we're
honest people so and the important part
is invest only if you you know trust if
you trust this on the skies and it's
going to launch and you see I'm not it's
not just a white paper it's working
software
I have image here the central bank note
you know and you click mind block on the
test network anyway it's going to start
you get 43 you get forty three shillings
in the beginning that's the country code
of Austria
you know Bitcoin start it is 50 so we're
starting with 40 43 and then the
National Day October 26 so hold your
purse 100 in 97 days you know we are
launching in 197 days but probably only
the test network
oh yeah the important part is it's on
github you know on github get up calm
get up calm Bitcoin if anybody has
checked a Bitcoin code on github
anybody knows like how much how many
lines of the initial Bitcoin revolution
how much C code anybody who wants to
guess I can give you an example I work
at an insurance company and we do let's
say a car insurance you know and the
enterprise Java guys you know factory of
factory and over engineering in ink
level you and so let's say this one one
calculation for this insurance work are
two hundred thousand lines of Java code
you know just you know for inputs and
then you get you know that's your
insurance premium
so this factory factory Java guys two
hundred thousand lines of code but the
Bitcoin billions of dollars you know how
many lines of C code you can go to
github you know get a Bitcoin common
this is github.com pitch chilling you
know that was the because the shielding
was taken on
so I had added a bit bit showing so it's
about I think it was 40 50 thousand
lines of three code and that's this one
guy you know I'll show you later
that's one guy how do I do it and go you
know if I do it go you know I need a
3,000 lines you know so he has done you
know he's not accepting any contribution
because he wants to but there's if you
build it and go you know a single person
can do it you know not over the weekend
but you can do it in ten days and you
have a complete from scratch you know
I'm building two versions
I'm building a cool version and a ruby
version for the pitch chilly but it's
the same you know building your central
bank it's you know there's no magic in a
ruby it's a if you have a library you
know it's 3,000 lines of code anyway so
the important part yeah that it's online
get up and check the code they go
version and so the Bitcoin magic what's
next you know
money money money of course but if
you're a greedy who are not greedy you
know you want to conquer the world you
know it's anybody what's next for the
blockchain what can you put on the
blockchain you know now you can you you
can print money you know but what more
can you do know is this good enough you
can put cats you know kiddies small cats
puppies small talks you you can put them
on the blockchain and what does what
what's the point of putting a cats or
dogs on the blockchain of course you
turn it into money you sell
they are tradable and they you can call
them collectibles you know or digital
assets anyway you know the anybody own
crypto kiddies cryptic heads
nobody's invested you're not yet
convinced more puppies they're dogs what
the land was you know the Lambos are
anyway
so the kiddies puppies dragons lumbers
but it sounds funny so and that's also
I'm doing the crypto car this because
you know I'm
in the it's serious business so I'm in
the beginning from the by tears you know
I'm saying there you know if you do this
token sale they're worth nothing
and so it's yours piece you know they
are threating me too you know
I'm we are going to ruin your life you
know you're accusing of you know you're
running away or whatever anyway so if
you play with the blockchain it's yours
business and so fun fun fun fun yeah the
script Oh kiddies that's a great part
you know you can play with the
blockchain and it's who is taking your
serious you know I'm I'm trading a
kiddies and how many kids do you have
and you can breed a kiddies there's even
one one guy he's selling a Japanese and
you you can preach you know and that's
how you create new value you know and
then they're the own and you can sell
and there's something called the that's
how how how created is there's something
called the Japanese where one part was
the celebrities you know you can collect
celebrities that was a complete scam and
that guy collected the money and after
three weeks you know the site is offline
and it's not coming back you know he has
collected a couple of millions anyway
but there's one inspired by the
celebrities it was it's called Japanese
porn stars and then you can breed them
you know but you don't see there at the
action so it's really a fun fun fun
so the kiddies are accurate part dragons
lambeth but the important part is the
non fungible tokens which means unique
bits and bytes so every every cat is
special every cat is special and if you
have a dollar a dollar a dollar is a
dollar shilling is a shilling you can
add a shilling and so if you trade a
shilling you don't care but if you treat
cats or these collectibles every it's
different and so now the magic part
serious business you know it's not
anything let's say land you know they
are selling there's one called crypto
countries you can buy Australian you can
buy you can buy the United States and
the guy got greedy but did he got greedy
with this game so he in in the world
there are 200 countries you know and he
has at the map and you can buy Austria
and it works the guy you know if you buy
Austria you own it you know
but it's capitalism if somebody comes
along and and pays more then you know he
will own so the guy who pays more is
going to can snap snatch it and so and
he gets his commission yeah and the guy
under him in a classic pyramid scheme
you know he gets also his money back you
know and the last one is holding the
back but you know you're holding Austria
you're precious
so it's fantastic so it was working like
fantastic but then he got ok I'm screwed
you know 200 countries you know I want
more money money money so what was his
next adventure crypto cities you know
there are 10,000 cities in the world so
he's selling you you can buy Vienna you
came by you know New York and so forth
and because it's a pyramid scheme you
cannot buy Vienna you know first you
have to buy first karate you know some
other cities and then once you have
invested you know you can buy the bigger
ones anyway the important part land land
houses apartments you know yeah that's
the so the cryptic Achilles sound sound
funny or something but the serious
business is the collectibles you can put
apartments houses lands cars you know
you can put everything on the blockchain
and then you can trade you know if you
buy a house you have this you know the
Revolution land rich history house and
everything is tradable on the blockchain
and the best way to get started or the
the crypto kiddies so that's how they
look everyone is ever you see everyone
is live different chains generation and
everyone is different you they have
different colors anybody knows the most
expensive the genesis are the most
expensive cat salt how much did they
donate
how much 100,000 yeah good guess yeah so
they sold it was also their funding the
founding cat so they sold on three or
four cats for $100,000 the biggest one
but now you can the cheap ones now the
breeding female in comics you know is
nobody is going to sell you a cat below
the breeding fee and so it's about I
think one one dollar or something the
cheapest and now they're more than half
a million every 10 minutes every 15
minutes and this case every 50 minutes
every generation zero cats for one year
until November and 100,000 the most
expensive but you see this one's anyway
if anybody's interested I have the
crypto kiddies and the copycats a ruby
version of crypto kitties and then I
have the copycats on the blockchain the
crypto collectables and that's the
awesome blockchains and now the
important part the articles so anybody
if you check and Ingo you know there are
great serious so this guy he has a
serious called pilk cotija on blockchain
ingo and every you know every part is an
article and she shows on kita PSD code
so the basic prototype it adds
proof-of-work adds transaction then the
addresses so in my case if I had the
transaction you know I have the name
Yosef Maria Theresa and in the real
world you have you know you use a
cryptography for your address number
like a account number addresses and then
the network you know it builds a
complete part and there's this one
that's last year and this one is pretty
new I think it's January February or
March in in less than 200 lines and then
it has the mining and the networking
part using a web service and then you
exchange with you know to you exchange a
blockchain as JSON and it even has you
know latest technology proof of stake
how can you make a stake
you need a cow cut it apart and then you
grill think still free in in Vienna
going to tono Antonio to do steaks for
free proof of steak yeah so maybe I skip
this one yeah it's the part it you know
it's with the tokens and these are
examples you know Austria and blockchain
on the rice you know and you see I feel
from Austria high quality and Arnold
Schwarzenegger you know we are and so
they're here guys so why you do I think
I was just putting on that you know you
should be extremely careful if you
invest in this token because at Bitcoin
you know everybody accepts Bitcoin or
you know it's money but these are called
these tokens are not money the shilling
is going to be you know money and it's
half a joke but these ones are so called
application tokens you know you can only
use it word for that for the blood for
the hero platform you it's not you know
nobody's accepting these tokens only the
and so what's the worse that where's the
decentralized part you know
decentralized means you know nobody's in
charge but here you know if there's no
hero company then there is no hero token
you know because they are the only one
accepting and the value of the here
token of course is zero but if you buy
it you know you have to buy it for real
money and they tell you what do they
tell you you know now they tell you
because it's going down they tell you
just hold it you know because if you
don't hold it you know and you sell it
it's going down more you know and it
will go to how far will it go it will
code to zero because this is you know
they have no open source code or no
platform you can't just you know and
basically they just collected your money
and they part apart this is there are
two fools you know if you buy it you are
the you are the fool in acid if you
think and here here's a new one you know
so this one happened last year and this
is going to happen now it's called the
crowd it's not the crowd to eat in
Austria you know it's the crowd
kondeh Austria and so they are tweeting
you they are tweeting February 20 they
are tweeting Saifi crypto investors are
investing making return on as mad as
high as 50,000% you know and then if you
read this article so I click on this
article and I'm not making a 2-day moon
you know we are here at the accelerator
accelerate accelerate you know and we
are going to beat record where are we
going
where are the prices going to the moon
anyway and so if you read us paying off
big times if you you don't get any
interest if you put your money on in the
bank account 10% in stocks you know and
here if you're you know bitcoin they
pour bitcoin only a thousand percent you
know but this token you know not only a
thousand percent fifty thousand euro and
and they show you you know a hundred
dollars you have a hundred dollars you
know you know a big guy a small
capitalist hundred dollars and we give
you you know fifty thousand dollars you
know in a year how do you say you know
Shep is a chubby little trading yeah
just hold and so what's the point of
here of course this is of course a
 you know and you think that's a
scam or is that the scam I mean if they
are telling you and that people are of
course who doesn't want to get rich you
know and more sophisticated
there is the pimp it panda Panda scale
you know that if the South Sea Bubble in
in England there was you know they
invented the the first real problem not
the tulip there was the South Sea Bubble
in in England and that was you know
England was not yet an empire but it was
the trade with the colonies you know and
they if we are going to trade with
America South America you know we are
going to get rich because the Dutch you
know they were getting rich trading in
the East Indies but the trouble was you
know the Americas was part of the
Spanish Empire so no so to trade and it
was a monopoly so it was impossible to
trade but they were selling here we are
everybody was making up and so bit panda
they are posting 7 March they're posting
yeah we will offer if you
collecting ten thousand ten millions of
dollars they will collect it's running
now you know and they are telling you
what are they doing with this magic
money they are building a future-proof
solution here that will create tokens
for all four block chains you know
they're you know future proof you know
III was their opinion yo I don't know so
this might work you know I cannot
predict the future who can predict the
future they can you know its future
proof and then all platforms you know
all plot for blockchain platforms now or
also all plot blockchain platform in the
future you know you see this is and they
have great material you know they are
not like the average so they're
collecting so and so why do you think
sorry that's the before the books that's
a lot before the last so why do I think
that they are going to collect your
money and then it's not going to if you
read the legal part about the token it's
not money you know and in the legal and
the pentose here with bit panda they are
the best well you know they're the most
honorable it's the first unicorn of
austria so they will you know a million
a billion euros the first unicorn in
austria the most value of a company
stirrup anyway and so if you read this
the legal thing it is in whatever form
you know it doesn't represent any you
don't have any claim at all you and they
will not exchange it you know there's no
you cannot say oh I want my money back
or I want just the seat you know I give
you money
your for your enterprise and if it's not
working out at least you know sell off
your furniture or whatever you know you
have zero you know nothing
so let's rent no claim here and you
cannot exchange it in money and at any
time you know they can do they can do
with the money whatever they want you
know you cannot say oh you you you could
say it we have to you are building a
platform you they you know there's no
they don't have to build a platform you
you can do with the money it's at any
time they can solve this Gretchen
discourage I mean they can do what they
so my liberal interpretation
interpretation is thanks for the free
money easy money and thanks for holding
the bag that's the important but
hoo-hoo-hoo
you know don't sell dog here find
greater fools find greater fools to
their marketing we make you rich you
know and so what's the point is you know
what's the value it's my opinion your
investment advice P please advise your
lawyer know it's so Bitcoin has value
you know the network and for general
payment but this video is this
application tokens is and the first
business you know in pizza do you have
friends you know money you know talks
you know and in business business this
business you know just not oh you're mad
you're so nice you know my little friend
you know if you're on board straight you
know Wall Street owns if you read the
history digital gold so Wall Street owns
you know the the Bitcoin you know they
are holding because it was you know was
cheap you know fifty million dollars you
know that was is at peanuts you know
they bought at all and now so but the
greed is that's a funny part the greed
is destroying you know because if you
have money and you're not using it you
know you're holding if you did a history
if you're gold you know the Spanish boss
they were thinking you know we are
collecting the gold from the Americas
you know and we are the richest and the
rich and they British that you know Adam
Smith said you know your gold you
know you're not rich you know the wealth
of the nation is not your goal you know
it's what you know you have to produce
and trade you know that's how you and if
you have money and you're not using it
you know then the value of the money
decreases you if you cannot pay with
your bitcoins you know you're destroying
the system you so they and agreed you
know they are holding holding so they
are destroying their own the greed
destroys Bitcoin because they are not
using it for payment anyway so I might
just be yeah that's just my opinion but
read up there's a great book so there's
lots of books you know
blockchain is the greatest part of their
so this anybody knows this attack of the
50 feet blockchain it's $15 from a
British guy from London
so if you read this one you know that's
fantastic it's he's a professional
skeptical you know and he can write you
know funny funny funny so-and-so also
you know about scams and it's complete
and so this one is more serious you know
mastering Bitcoin it's online free
that's you know it's fantastic it's book
called the Bitcoin in detail so that's
really the second edition even it's on
github you can buy the book too and so
it explains the Bitcoin and magic
let's blockchain for dummies you know
it's not not bad you know it's free
download it's for business block change
for IBM and high pal agile but it's you
know if what's the hype about business
so that's a free download you have maybe
you have to give them the email but if
you click on the link and there's a new
I'm reading this one came out three or
four weeks the truth machine from New
York Times Wall Street Journal
journalists from New York the truth
machine you know the blockchain and so
what they are saying you know the IBM
blockchain is a fraud you know because
it's just a database you know I've also
the IBM meeting and then they they are
selling a blockchain blockchains and
then the guy was asking you know how
many users does your blockchain have you
know they are the IBM oh we have one
user you know one note
oh so if you have one one note you know
maybe it's just a database you know or
and and that's you know so if you have a
blockchain it has to be you know a
public public and then you have to if a
thousand nodes or something you know but
if you have two notes you know then it
might be a little stretch and then you
have two notes and it's not public and
everybody has to log in you know there
was I was a guy at the shilling meetup I
have a shilling meet up every two months
to build the shilling he has a webshop
and he wants to put his webshop on the
blockchain it's fine you know just put
on you know know your vape shop based on
the blockchain and Microsoft Access it's
fine you you log in and they buy it yet
you buy the stuff and you recording the
database you know and so they die
of course they are a different level but
it sells you know blockchain blockchain
and they sell their cloud service but
they parties you know that's another
discussion but you're all using the
blockchain because you have seen the
magic part of the blockchain is the
crypto hash you know and then the other
magic part is that distribution you you
can download if you get clone you get
the whole history you know and in
Bitcoin
you know you download the whole the
whole history all the blocks or all the
commits is like a kid clone you know if
you run your Bitcoin node first you have
to clone you know the repo and the funny
part is of course it doesn't have any
fork the consensus is a single branch
you know ink it it can handle you know
these are the branches the branches in a
blockchain and the modern lightning
Network anybody knows how they are
called the branches and the lightning
Network state channels you know I state
you open a state channel it's a branch
you know and then if you merge it back
you know that state Chandler is you
record it back in the commit you know in
the block and so if you do a git merge
you know you're an S with the the last
one so that's to wrap up I hope that was
that long is the they always funny and
the same is with blockchain you know
anybody understands kit you know I'm
working a couple of years now with kit
and if I have a trouble you know it's a
here I don't you know analyze I just
delete it and do a fresh git clone and
so with Bitcoin here who understands
that's why it's so crazy you know them
and like money's involved you who
understands blockchain and Bitcoin and
and so how do we use it you know no idea
you know you just memorize and you hold
you believe and you're getting rich and
of course you have to grow the network
that's the pyramid scheme so yeah so
thanks for its online and questions and
hope it wasn't too long</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
