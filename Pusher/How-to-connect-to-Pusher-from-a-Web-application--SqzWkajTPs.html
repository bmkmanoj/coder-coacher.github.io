butcher so the first thing I'm going to
do is include some script libraries I'm
going to include jQuery just because
it's handy I'm going to include the
pusher JavaScript library version 196
and it's a minified version I'm also
going to include this helper library
this doesn't actually do anything as a
minute other than other than create
assign a function to the log method
which means that we get debug
information so first thing we want to do
is script tag renewed push for instance
we need to supply our key which is
defined in the pusher dashboard the next
thing we want to do is we want to know
when we've connected so there's a couple
of ways of doing that we've got the way
the pusher works is there are channels
and events we've got a connection object
which is an event distributor so you can
also bind events to that so if I do push
it on connection find and I want to get
all connection state changes state
change and then by supply an event
handler and what I want to do is the
script I probably I also want to section
here
where we can output the status of the
connection so when we get them update
but when this when the state change
event fires on the connection object we
will then be able to access the
connection status element and update the
text to represent to show the current
connection state so up there we'll see
we're connected so this is Jeff's been I
can just render it in full but connect
it straight away and go back to the code
comment out that line now we'll see that
there's no status listed I can comment
it back in we'll see that we're
connected again so which means we're
connected to pusher and that concludes
our connecting to push your screencast</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
