developer from Australia and for a long
time I used to work for the Australian
Government I'm not exactly sure how long
it felt like about 90 years it wasn't
actually that bad but it was a little
bit bad so I quit my job and now I'm
here so yeah I spent a lot of time
hiking around the world this is me after
walking 800 kilometres across Spain so
when I'm not hiking and exploring I like
to experiment with code and you can find
some of my half-baked ideas on code pin
or github and occasionally I write
something a little bit more detailed on
my blog i'm on twitter too if you want
to follow me and it's how I measure my
self-worth so that would be awesome but
yeah the title of my talk is a CSS
urology so I should say thank you all
for coming on this very somber occasion
now it's not a eulogy for CSS itself
although the landscape is certainly
changing and that is something that I
want to touch on I don't think we'll be
saying goodbye to CSS itself any time
soon so rather this is a talk about
looking critically at some of the
patterns and techniques that we've
regularly used and asking ourselves this
is the best way or are things moved on
and surprisingly the answer for that
might not always be obvious now I'll be
honest with you it's not going to be
easy we'll be laying to rest some
much-loved patterns and designs things
that have served as well over the years
so lean on the people around you be
prepared to reflect on negative margins
lament your love jordis clear fixes and
long for the days of pixel-based
certainty but we'll also be looking to
the future and acknowledging flexbox
viewport units legacy something that
we're constantly dealing with and as a
result of this we don't always move on
as fast as we should I think we often
cling to add a outdated techniques
either out of fear or comfort and I want
to tell you that it's okay to not want
to let go in the dying days of IE 6 and
7 despite my personal rocky relationship
with them I still found myself reaching
for the comfort of a robust our hack and
to this day where inline-block is
concerned in my heart zoom will always
be one
and what I'm getting at is like anything
our habits when writing CSS can become
ingrained and difficult to change this
might be even though we know better so
what I think we need is proper
acknowledgement of this so that we can
all move on and get that well needed
closure cherish the memory now as we say
goodbye to one of our founders friends
the clearfix it's not quite working
there but sorry now you all know what
I'm talking about when I say a clearfix
it's a hack to make a parent element
clear its flavored children but it's of
course a very versatile hack one that
underpins a lot of patterns that we use
things like media objects navigation
grids and all of that in fact we use it
so much that we forget it's a hack but
if you've ever had to explain what a
clear fix is to someone who doesn't know
you might have realized it doesn't
really make very much sense although it
feels like second nature to us floats
were never meant to be used for solving
the majority of layout problems that we
ask them to solve they require hacks
likely affixed to even work in the first
place so why should we have to do this
is a perfectly legitimate question and I
think all of us in this room have come
to accept that this is the de facto way
to solve this problem no more thinking
required and it's when we get to that
point that I think we become close to
new ways of thinking and fail to see
better options so before we look at
those better options this is a eulogy so
let's take a quick look at the life and
evolution of clearfix I mean it's been
good to us so it feels like the
honorable thing to do and this here is
of course a primitive ancestor to our
modern cliff fix or if anyone here has
perhaps been to the London Zoo you might
say Mike you fool that's a chimp this is
exactly the kind of nonsense we expect
from the colonies and okay London very
clever of you also very snotty like say
but he's a very symbolic chip and the
reason he's so happy is he's just
realized that he can force a container
to clear its children by adding an empty
div at the bottom with the property
clear both it was a simple and fairly
elegant solution but it wasn't semantics
and dare I say it real developers don't
use empty elements feel like I should
duck when I say that what this chip
didn't realize was it like a fish taking
its first evolutionary steps out of
water the next few years we're going to
be a little bit awkward
and I do hope that you'll forgive me for
extending that metaphor but I think
you'll agree it was worth it to get
these guys on a slide what I'm not
really getting at very well is hourly
clearfix tricks they weren't very pretty
they look something like this I don't
want you to read it I just want you to
glance at this with a fond nostalgia it
contains various hacks to target
specific browsers and in each case these
hacks are trying to achieve just one
thing and that is to trigger an internal
browser rendering property known as
block formatting context so you might
remember as layout in IE if you don't
know what block formatting context is
simply put it's the devil's magic it's
an internal property that we can only
trigger indirectly and it's what all of
those hacks were trying to achieve
clearfix is a side effect pretty soon
browsers lifted their game and we didn't
need all of those ugly hacks like I call
this one a transitional stage clearfix
it's not quite as uglier I'm not quite
as scary in 2011 Nicholas Gallagher
improved on this again and we have the
micro clearfix now if you're using a
clearfix today it should look something
like this and an interesting point to
make about this example is like the
earlier one we're inserting an empty
element at the bottom of a container
with the property clear both the only
difference is that this time it's a
pseudo element and I think it can be
valuable to reflect on the life and
evolution of techniques that we use
because sometimes like this they point
us to the future all right so a quick
show of hands who hears use the clear
fix in the last year nearly all of you
those of you that put your hands up
who's used it in the context of a dot
clearfix utility class or something
similar I'm very pleased to say a lesser
number but I'm sure it's something that
we've all done at least once at some
point and it's something that I'm guilty
off too and I'll be willing to bet you
my left hand and this is my left hand if
anyone wants to know what they're going
to get into I bet that this is going to
be one technique that we say goodbye to
once and for all this year now the
reasons I think that firstly is there's
better technique layout techniques that
don't need clear fix at all but more
importantly than that pre processes such
as less since ass and I guess I should
include post CSS now as well in terms of
a dot utility class layoff
us tools to get rid of this previously
it might have been easier to write the
clear fix once in your CSS and then
apply the class anywhere in the markup
that you needed to use it this was
obviously faster than writing it in
every component when needed but
obviously mix-ins give us an opportunity
to do this now and this is something
that I had difficulty letting go of
again I don't know if you can read that
up the back but it kept me up at night
wondering whether I should use a mix in
or a utility class and I'll always have
fond memories of this I used to call
this the clearfix shotgun approach if
you don't know how to solve a layup
problem simply clear fix all the things
and it was always a nice surprise to
come in in the morning and find that
someone had committed this usually
happened in large teams with multiple
developers and it wasn't until
preprocessors Gators place holders that
we were able to forcefully put an end to
this now placeholders differ from
regular mix-ins and they're not written
to the final stop final style sheet
except where they are used in general I
think that modern tools like
preprocessors a good things to lean on
in times of hurt they'll help you move
on and I think you should do that so
when I first gave this talk to test this
theory I did a little research I went
and visited the blogs and websites of
all the speakers and organizers at the
conference because you know that's a
great way to make friends but luckily
when I was conducting that test I found
that despite of being very
non-scientific I confirmed that the
clear fixed utility class was indeed out
of favor and of about 50 websites i
visited only around five had it and I
might have had a hand in one of those as
well so I hope I've convinced you that
you probably don't need a clearfix
utility class but do we need a clear fix
at all and the answer to that is depends
in a lot of situations as better
techniques that we can use now and I
think it's time that maybe we took a
look at some of those examples so this
is the media object you're probably all
seen this it was popularized by Nicole
Sullivan it's the poster child of
object-oriented CSS it's been a pretty
solid go to pattern for a number of
years and traditionally it has an image
heading and some text to one side
but apart from the container needing a
cliff Ock's you also need a block
formatting context on the content or a
left margin equal to the width of the
image to prevent the text from wrapping
underneath so I'd often see a lot of
examples like this when browsing the
interweb and I'm wondering how might we
rethink this well-known example to get
rid of this reliance on magic numbers
and I found a solution by someone called
Harry Roberts now I have no idea who he
is but his solution looks pretty good
you wrote about something he calls the
flag object and it's not just a poorly
disguised rebranding of the meat no it
is just a poorly disguised rebranding
and remedial object let's be honest but
it adds to it with some additional
options and versatility it's supported
as far back as I ate so if you're
supporting legacy it's an option but as
well as that you can vertically Center
the image or align it to the bottom and
because the image extends to the full
width of the container you can have
different background colors and sorry
for my terrible color choice that I'm a
much better design of these days and
when I develop that one but anyway it
makes this a display table and
personally I feel that that's something
that is criminally overlooked I wouldn't
use it for out lining out laying out a
whole page but used in moderation in
components I don't see really what the
problem is I think we just sometimes
cringe at the word table but if you're
ready there is a more robust solution
that uses flexbox and this one's by
philip bolton so like the flag object
this implementation gives us control
over the positioning of the image but as
well as this we get something called
source order control this means that we
can move it to the left or the right
without changing any other HTML and all
of those alignment options are inherent
in flexbox and this is really good this
means that we're not relying on hacks
and things to make them work so I'm not
going to give full detail of all those
different techniques but suffice to say
that flexbox gives us greater control
over layout and any other techniques
that we commonly use and as I said
they're built in so if you haven't seen
Phil what insight sold by flexbox I
strongly recommend that you
look after this it contains that and
many other patterns but for now let's
just take a quick moment silence to say
farewell declare fix we've loved you and
you were there for us when things were
tough you will always have a place in
our hearts but sadly we no longer need
you like we once did you may be destined
to fade into obscurity but you will not
be forgotten Thank You clearfix but
let's not dwell on our sorrow for
clearfix too long because there's other
patterns that we need to say goodbye to
and one of those is negative margins now
despite their images are hack negative
margins are well described by the CSS
specification and in many cases we use
them exactly as was intended now I'm not
firing at negative margins in general
but I do think that they tend to be a
symptom of poor choices in our CSS and
with more layout options available i'm
finding fewer situations where i
actually need them so one practical
example of this and a pattern that we've
seen many times one that's probably
familiar to you if not quite as
comfortable is modal's or more generally
positioning anything in the center of
the screen it might be a log unbox a
message a dialogue or you might be
asking me to share your article on
facebook before I've even read it and of
course if that's what you're doing you
can stop but there are legitimate
reasons for needing a pattern like this
and whilst it might not be as close to
our hearts as clearfix I think maybe we
could quickly take a look at the life
and evolution of this pattern so
historically we might have used an alert
or a confirm dialog but the problem with
these is they were ugly obnoxious and we
couldn't change a thing about how they
looked so with those limited object
options understandably we all just
avoided them in favor of custom options
so oh
sorry about this guy's yeah so let's
just do this all right right I've lost
my speaker notes now okay um right so
yeah get mote modals what we would do is
we give it an absolute position in a top
to top and left value of fifty percent
that would move the top left corner into
the center of screen and then move the
center of the element into the center of
the screen we gave it a negative left
margin equal to half its width and a
negative top margin equal to half its
height so you've all probably seen this
who here has used this technique before
is anyone still commonly using this
technique maybe one hand that's really
good I still find sometimes that I reach
for this just out of habit or comfort
but the problem I have with this
technique is that the width height and
margins are all magic numbers and I also
find that with responsive design I'm
doing multiple versions of it for
different screen sizes and maybe an
inline version for mobile but as well as
this there might be situations where I
don't know the size of the thing that I
need to Center or where that should be a
percentage and so this once robust
techniques no longer meeting all of my
needs now to address that unknown size
thing one of my first inclination was to
try and solve this problem using our
percentage for negative margins and of
course that's a problem I only made like
a thousand times as LSCs and developer
and it's a simple mistake that you've
possibly all made but percentages for
netware negative margins are concerned a
relative to the parent container not to
the element itself so that's not really
that intuitive but luckily this is how
CSS transforms work unlike negative
margins when using translate to position
an element you can say move it move it
fifty percent of its own width or fifty
percent of its own height any direction
so it's a lot more robust and intuitive
and no more magic numbers but
like I said you probably you've probably
also in that technique as well but this
too might be a transitional stage
solution I think that this pattern may
also be on the verge of making another
evolutionary step and what I'm talking
about is the dialogue element now this
is relatively new I think it's in chrome
and opera but it may have recently
landed in Firefox I'm not too sure there
are some polyfills however that you can
use today and they're as good as any
custom solutions that we use so I think
you can start using this and the
dialogue element doesn't require any CSS
for positioning I don't know if you can
read it there but it's only got a width
in that example you can override the
default positioning of course with CSS
but as well as that we get native
JavaScript methods for interacting with
it no not no more toggling classes or
anything like that and we get this
backdrop pseudo element which makes it
pretty easy to add a background overlay
which you probably know is very hard in
CSS and so here I'll just quickly set it
to a beautiful shade of pink so there
you go that would have been like many
lines of CSS prior so again in a circle
of life kind of way I feel like this
pattern has come back to its origins
we've gained full control over the
presentation with CSS but just like the
alert and confirm dialogues we're back
to a native sorry a semantic
representation of a dialogue with native
JavaScript methods for interacting with
it and this is how it often goes we we
have a problem that doesn't quite meet
our needs and we bend it and we break it
sometimes hacks are born things like
clearfix but occasionally a new element
like the dialogue is born so goodbye
negative margins our relationship was
one of necessity that you made so many
things possible and whilst this might be
goodbye it could however be a chance to
reacquaint ourselves with some patterns
and thanks to your hacky ways we may
have lost our spark
now the final farewell I want to mention
today is the shake-up that viewport
units are going to give some of our
topography and lay out best practices so
viewport units have been around since
2012 in fact I II was an early mover and
they're supported as far back as I e9
viewport units are really easy to
understand it's basically one percent of
the viewport so there's four types of
view port units you put our VW which is
viewport with the H which is the
viewport height the min which is the
width or height whichever is smaller and
vmax which is the width or height
whichever is large so that's pretty
intuitive so I think that the reason
viewport units are not used more often
isn't due to a lack of developers
understanding or browsers support but
rather more down to the lack of control
that designers have and maybe
specifically over things like font size
so you might have thought that we said
goodbye to pixel basis font sizes in the
late 2000s and we largely did we favored
EMS and percentages because pixels don't
change according to user preferences and
this is bad for accessibility if not
just rude but pixel-based apocrypha
wasn't quite dead I was just lurking in
the shadows and waiting for the days
when browsers often zoom to enlarge text
and with this some developers decided
that the accessibility concerns of pixel
based fonts we're no longer as much of
an issue that debate still rages but the
truth is whether you're using EMS our
EMS or percentages these are all just
abstractions of a base font size and we
usually know that to be 16 pixels so
we've never really had to give up
complete control but viewport units are
different they represent an evolutionary
leap a fundamental change in approach
for the first time we have true
responsive topography viewport units are
not relative to the base font size in
any way and I think that's what scares
some people this means goodbye too
clunky responsive type techniques like
this and the problem with examples like
this is that they're jumpy they require
multiple media queries and they don't
necessarily resize in proportion to
other elements on our page this means
that they can jump out of containers
trigger overflow cause all kinds of mess
it's like feeding a gremlin after
midnight and honestly I don't know why
we persisted with this method of
responsive to fog raphy for so long
avoiding some of these problems and we
can limit the scaling by only applying
you put units above a certain screen
size we could also use calc in this
example says set the font size at a
viewport width of zero to exactly 16
pixels so that's a little bit more
precise and then scale at a rate of
three viewport wits from there so yeah
there's still limitations for there's
ways to hack around them again but when
I was preparing this talk initially I
was thinking about some of those
limitations and whilst we can limit
scaling with media queries and calc we
still don't have full control so we're
essentially not over multiple viewport
wits anyway we're limited to whatever
three viewport wits was in the previous
example at any screen size without
another media query or a change in the
font size we can't change it to for
example to 32 pixels at an 800 pixel
resolution like every eulogy you've ever
been to this one ends with a closing
rant now that we've had a detailed look
at the life and evolution of a few
patterns as well as some of the hacks
we've used to get around those
limitations I hope you realized a
familiar theme our hacks are usually
just clever workarounds for the
limitations of CSS and in most cases
those limitations relate to layout and
that's because CSS was not designed for
solving layout problems it was designed
for adding simple styles to HTML
documents in fact not even necessarily
HTML documents XML was still a viable
option then thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
