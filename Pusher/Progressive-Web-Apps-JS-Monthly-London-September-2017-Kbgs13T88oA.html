web apps this is a term that I imagine
probably most of you have heard enough
I'm fairly familiar with but I think it
can still cause quite a bit of confusion
this term and there's still a lots of
different meanings that you'll hear from
different people so what meaning will I
share about it well probably my favorite
succinctness enforce Web Apps upgraded
to be first-class apps alternatively as
Alex Russell said who came up with the
concept and also named it along with
Frances Barrowman they're just websites
that took all the right vitamins another
quite a good way I think of describing
them is that it's kind of the best of
the web and the best of native apps
that's what we want the best of the web
being these things that we know and love
about our web platform the fact that we
can write web applications that work
across any platform they're frictionless
so people can just tap a link or type in
a URL and they can access this
immediately they're discoverable on any
search engine and they're open for
others developers and also for our users
we don't have any license fees to pay or
profit shares to give away everything is
open so it would be nice if we could
combine that with some of the best
things about native apps such as having
a home screen icon that we can tap load
our app and have that display then in a
standalone window have them work
reliably independent of the network
conditions and have it load instantly or
near instantly from cache then these
things aren't really core features of
progressive Web Apps but you can also
add to that some extra features that the
web has been gaining over time like push
notifications and other device features
like accessing the camera so now to
share a few myths and hopefully dispel a
few about progressive web apps the first
being that they kind of they're like
this magic recipe right that
no one really understands but really
they are based on a set of web standards
so you can think of PWA is really being
made up of just these three things
really firstly you'll need to serve your
site over HTTP you'll need a service
worker with some basic caching and
you'll need a web app manifest that
defines a few basic properties like a
title and an icon then the other stuff
that you might hear that goes along with
pwace is generally optional extra stuff
like push notifications often gets
talked about in context of pwace the
other thing that isn't on here but that
is also important with pwace is
performance and that's something we'll
get onto a little bit later when diego
shares an example and we'll see
lighthouse and which will score your PWA
based on performance too next myth is
that well these are things we already
have right these are just a set of
standards that are already there with
the web so this isn't this just a buzz
phrase that can just an amalgamation of
things but it's more than that because
progressive web apps get some special
features
if browsers recognize these these traits
and these technologies that are being
used as part of them so for example on
the Left this is Samsung internet and if
it detects that you're viewing a PWA
based on HTTP service worker with basic
caching web app manifest with some basic
properties then it will dynamically
switch that icon that's in the top left
in the URL bar which is normally a star
for bookmarking it will switch that for
a plus icon that gives you an easy way
and easy shortcut to add that to your
home screen which is nice then also
depending on browser metrics around
engagement and when they determine that
is a good time to display this to a user
they can also show up and add to
homescreen banner for you so that's an
extra way of helping users to know that
they can actually add this to their home
screen and to prompt them to do so and
in Android Oh in chrome now we even have
web abk
which means that when you do add your
web app to your home screen you'll
automatically get your web application
route as an actual eight as an actual
native android app which means that it
will show up for example in the actual
apps list and you'll be able to access
actual app settings for it so this is
truly actually making your PW a
first-class app and they're even coming
to app stores so Microsoft are already
working on this and it's beginning to
happen in the windows insider preview I
understand they are doing passive
ingestion of pwace into the Windows
Store which is now the Microsoft Store
so unless you opt out and if your PWA
passes their tests and they think that
is a good enough experience for people
then they can automatically pull it into
their App Store and similarly although
this hasn't happened yet we've heard
some pretty strong hints from some of
the people in the chrome team that this
is something that they are looking at in
terms of the Play Store as well so of
course it's the web so you don't
necessarily need your web apps to be in
these app stores but it can be pretty
nice thing for them to be there as well
for their extra discoverability if
people are looking for apps then maybe
they're going to be looking in these app
stores so it's quite nice that your
surface up there to miss three is that
PWA Cerrone
well skipped ahead they're only really
useful if you're interested in making an
offline application and if you don't
have any particular requirements around
offline usage then maybe you don't
really need to to worry about it but
actually the real thing about
progressive web apps and service workers
and caching is that it gives you
reliability to have your site your app
work independent of those network
conditions you don't have to worry about
life.i and bringing in Clapham Junction
and not having a signal
and everyone needs reliability that's
what pwace can give us miss for we to
see this sometimes from certain
publications PWA so a Google brand or
there a Google only thing or there
google pwace but really they're across
browser collaboration as demonstrated
here nicely at the PWA dev summit which
is in amsterdam last year when some of
our Samsung colleagues were on stage
with Google and Mozilla and Microsoft
and opera and so yeah it's just like web
standards themselves are a cross-browser
collaboration progressive web apps are
to miss 5pw A's are not ready yet
because they're not on iOS right
although we did have the good news
recently that Apple have actually put
service workers officially in
development in Safari so it's
progressing but you might think of this
as you know well they're not an iOS so
they're not really here yet well
actually a whole bunch of organizations
and big organizations like these and
many others are embracing pwace and
making the their sites petabytes already
or making new sites that are pwace and
you might have come across some of these
so people are doing it now and you can
do this quite safely with progressive
enhancement you can have your app your
site work just as it would do normally
on iOS and on Android or other platforms
where it has support for these extra
features you can use those and make the
most of them the last myth is that PDAs
are just a mobile thing so it's only for
mobile apps but actually we will see
that there are also for desktop for
example so this is Samsung internet on
decks which is our little docking
station that you can plug your keyboard
and mouse into and turn your and turn
your mobile phone into a desktop
experience and this is showing that you
have pwace on desktop too so like just
like in the mobile version of
Samsung Internet you have a little plus
icon there if it's PWA and you can do
add to homescreen and so in this case
Add to Home screen is a desktop icon and
when you load it from there you have a
standalone application like a native app
let's just go back to present also
desktop these kind of features are
coming to Chrome OS and also edge as
well and not just mobile and desktop but
virtual reality too and that's what
we're going to be sharing a bit more
about today because if you are
developing a virtual reality web
application then why wouldn't you also
want to take advantage of some of these
great features of progressive web apps
too so as Dan Scott shared he wrote a
blog post about this what if I could
just escape into my lovely virtual
reality scene wherever I am without
worrying about connectivity or how long
it would take to download so this brings
us on to progressive web vr apps and at
this point I'm gonna do a quick
microphone switch here who is Diego so
Peter has given us a great introduction
into progressive web apps what we're
going to see now is a special demo that
we prepared for today unlike the one
that we had last day s monthly where we
had a bit of an issue with illegal panda
coning that happened on stage right now
you know we needed a PWA
there was iconic we actually looked for
many hours what was the pw8 that was
going to make the cut and of course I
don't know how many of you are familiar
with this logo over here can I see some
hands yes the famous air horn er by Paul
Kinlan so well he is already informed
and he actually approves the web via our
version of the air horn er so not going
to spoil it I think you already know
what's coming but the meetup is going to
get a bit loud what we want to do is we
want to take dear Horner and we want to
upgrade it to the next generation of the
web which is pretty much VR so the past
probably day and a half we were working
very very hard in order to get to you
dear Horner if you guys want to go to
the if you all want to go to the link
and see the air horn or you are going to
be able to see how it has evolved
probably you're not going to see many
changes at first but just wait and see
because it is magical this changes
absolutely everything about pwace again
so what we're doing is pretty much that
we are using PWA technologies which
peter has explained to cache audio the
very famous audio from the air horn we
are using a splash screen to load or
play audio this is basically a trick
that we're doing because we need the
application to be able to play audio and
in some browsers like mobile browsers
you actually need to register user input
first and then we are touching
animations to events so when you load
the application once you go in to start
you're going to run into a webpage that
looks more or less like the initial air
horn except and it goes crazy 3d and
it's magical so what we are having is
again all the benefits that Peter
described like yeah there you go that's
what I wanted to hear great thanks so we
have an icon at a home screen we have
the application per se and we actually
tested that this application works in
different types of browsers including VR
browsers here we have a here we have a
screenshot of how the web page looks
inside the Samsung gear VR browser and
I've actually loaded here I'm just gonna
go in VR and go into the start and the
immersive mode now I'm just gonna give
the headset to some lucky person
in the audience and feel free to tap
away this was something that we did in
the course of a day and a half we did
run this earlier today like two hours
ago on lighthouse to see if we were not
failing
epically and it turns out that we scored
quite well and a progressive web app now
the website my website is not
automatically redirecting to HTTPS so
there are things that I no shame right a
bit of shame I know and I'm sorry I'm
very sorry for that but we can see that
the part of us most impacted was
performance now here it has to do with
the script da frame is kind of its kind
of like stopping the rendering because
it needs to of course create the 3d
elements etc etc but nonetheless I think
it's quite good
yes can can we get some approval from
you yeah amazing great okay so now that
we've seen a basic example of how we've
taken a web VR experience that's running
on of course on the browser then we
decided to test it okay it needs to run
in mobile phones and it is running on
mobile phones you've seen it in your
devices when you actually started
tapping we tested it in three degrees of
freedom devices and if anyone wants to
try it out in VR it's quite basic but if
anyone wants to see that it actually
works please feel free to ask me go for
the headset we have it running on a
three degrees of freedom or just
orientation with the tapping here before
coming here we actually tested it on an
oculus rift and it is actually working
the problem is that we don't we didn't
implement anything to actually tap you
know that when you have the gear VR you
can tap and it represents it click when
you go on the phone if you tap the
screen and represents a click on no
noise on the oculus rift we actually
need it to create this click event
because it doesn't have any touchpad or
anything that that triggers the event
then again it's probably one of the tips
that Peter is going to show us following
which would be related to progressive
enhancement and making sure in an
experience works across different types
of devices so that would be for the air
horn or VR 2.0 version
next reloaded so that's it for the
example the code is already on github we
are going to share the code and the
slides and peter is going to give us
some tips on how can we makes PWA
technology with where we are to create
these type of very engaging and amazing
experiences we coming to the end of the
presentation but I wanted to share a few
more thoughts about the progressive part
of these progressive web vr apps
starting with a great video by Arturo if
this will load because I think this
really shows it well and you might some
of you might have seen this animation
already about how you can have these
experiences that work as normal in
normal browsers and mobile devices as we
used to you can also have what we call a
magic window effect way you're using the
accelerometer of the device and you can
see different parts of the 3d scene by
moving it around and you can have this
going up into the higher end devices and
it works then is the devices like a
daydream and the Samsung gear VR and
then even going up into the higher end
devices which cut off at the end but
things like the rift and the vive and so
the idea is that you should really focus
on that initial mobile low end device
and then progressively enhanced it build
up more functionality for those other
devices too so Virtual Reality is not an
excuse to make people wait you might
think that well people are gonna love my
VR experience my VR I a corner I'm sure
people would wait for that but you know
maybe maybe not that long but really
you're still not going to have very long
before people give up and go you know
I'll try something else or come back to
it later and then never do so it's best
to get things on screen get the first
part of the experience up in front of
people as soon as possible one way you
can do this is there's a model of Call
of Duty
assets demo from play canvas hopefully
this slide doesn't look too threatening
sorry about that this is not saying
download at high risk as I suppose load
sorry but is to share their example
where they are initially loading low res
assess low-res textures so you get to
see this model as soon as possible and
then once it's loaded up its then
downloading as streaming down to higher
resolution textures and then it over
writes them replaces those on the fly
which means there as you're viewing this
probably by the time you then start to
zoom in and and look around this model
you'll probably have then by then got
the high res assets in anyway and then
you'll be able to see it at high res
version we also like to talk about this
concept of continuous browsing
experiences because you don't
necessarily have to just think of your
app as being a VR app it can be a mobile
app which has a VR element to it so you
could imagine that people are viewing
your page or your application on a
mobile phone and then maybe there's some
part of that that says hey there's
actually a virtual reality part of this
experience that you can try so that they
go okay yeah I'd like to do that so they
slot it in there in their V / true
reality headset and in something into
that that will then make it loads
automatically in the Samsung internet
for gear VR in in the virtual reality
browser and then they can experience
their virtual reality version and then
once they finish they can take it out
and they're back to the mobile
experience again as an example sorry we
could turn the sound down that good me
thank you so as an example imagine you
were reading an article about the Nasdaq
stock price and whether there might be
another bubble again but it's kind of
you could read about this but you might
not really feel it you might not really
experience it so imagine if then you try
out the Nasdaq rollercoaster
which lets you actually take a ride on
this stock price and then you actually
really get to feel the ups and downs
right and and it's sighs it was an
experiment by The Wall Street Journal
and it was more just to try out a
concept but they had a really good
reaction to this people were saying
things like I never would have bothered
to read an article about this but this
really brought it to life for me this is
the scary of it when it it's also
important to remember that in these
virtual reality browsers are to the
sites are the sites are applications
that we have already they'll still
continue to work as they are because
these VR browsers even though you're in
a 360 environment you have a web browser
window you'll have a 2d essentially
window that you can still view your
content as normal you're just getting me
back from before and you can use the
virtual keyboard er you can use voice
input even to interact with it then
finally it's interesting to think about
this third axis itself as being a kind
of progressive enhancement so imagine if
you had your regular website and you had
your HTML and CSS and then just by
adding some extra CSS 3d properties you
could then take advantage of that third
dimension this is a concept that has
been just talked about a lot and there's
been some initial work gone into it but
at the moment this is not something
that's available in the web at the
moment to do web VR apps we need to have
a separate WebGL canvas although with
libraries like a frame that's starting
to get us more towards this really nice
progressive enhancement model because it
is actually letting UI HTML but
hopefully in the future we might also
have this CSS 3d enhancement and be able
to really easily progress
enhance our sights to take advantage of
3d so with some of these things it is
kind of early days for virtual reality
on the web but we are progressing sorry
I think at that point I probably should
just end this and say thank you very
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
