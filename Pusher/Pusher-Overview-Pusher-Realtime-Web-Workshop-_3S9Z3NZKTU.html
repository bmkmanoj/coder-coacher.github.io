developer evangelist of pushing the
purpose of this video is to answer the
question what is pusher but also to
provide examples of the sorts of
functionality that push it makes it
possible to achieve within your web and
mobile apps following on from this there
will be a number of other videos
demonstrating how to get up and running
with pusher including some basics like
connecting subscribing and publishing ok
so what is pusher we're a hosted service
companies like Twilio and semi-great and
top box or other examples of great
hosted services the point of services
like this and of course pusher is to
offer infrastructure as a service
specifically with pusher we're offering
a real-time infrastructure for
communication between your application
servers and clients clients can be web
browsers or mobile devices or anything
else that has a connection to the
internet because we're hosted service
we're massively scalable this means we
deal with scaling so you don't have to
our focus is to be as quick and easy as
possible to use with that we understand
the security aspects of having real time
infrastructure so we offered that as
part of our service and ways of ensuring
that your application is secure when
using pusher we want developers to spend
time building stuff applications
features enhancements and not
downloading installing configuring and
maintaining infrastructure so what are
real-time apps and the purpose of real
time technologies so real time
technologies offer to start off with
opportunity the technologies have been
used for around 11 years starting in
finance where real time delivery of data
matters the opportunity that this
technology provides meant that traders
could instantly act on sources of
information and make crucial real-time
decisions following on from that the
technology provides convenience the
convenience of information being
instantly sent to your end-users imagine
having
to open up an SMS application and check
to see whether you have any new SMS
messages
imagine having to check your phone to
see whether or not you had any incoming
calls of course we don't to do that
because our applications our devices
instantly informant as soon as there's a
new SMS message or as soon as some of
these callers we live in a world where
information is pushed to us also using
the technology it's possible to build
interactive experiences interaction
between users and systems or between
multiple users we could be talking
thousands or millions of users if you
look at Twitter or Facebook they're
great examples of interactive
experiences and with those applications
built on real-time technologies such as
pusher you can build engaging
experiences experiences that keep users
coming back and keep them immersed
within the application all this
functionality is powered by real-time
events and push it is built with a
vented real-time architectures in mind
we make it easy to build real-time
applications so what are the uses of
real-time technologies everything is
data so that's the fundamental use we're
delivering data from that people build
notifications activity streams
interactive experiences like chat social
TV experiences second screen
applications collaborative applications
like Google Apps and multiplayer games
to mention just a few first let's look
at data data that complements your
application data that's caught your
application think real-time stocks and
share visualizations think betting
applications think real-time web
analytics and then the data can actually
be the content for your site let me
provide you an example let's go to the
itv news site they've redesigned to
focus on a lot on a live news stream
here's a simple example of actual
notifications the applications been
notified that two new pieces of news are
available this news is actually being
delivered to the app it just hadn't been
shown yet if we click on the
notification UI the new news items are
shown to us
also if we go to the ITB sports page
this is some historical information but
if you look at the layout of this page
might go all the way down yeah when the
game was actually in play you'll see
that it's all snippets of live content
that have been delivered including
advertisements during Euro 2012 ITV used
pusher to deliver this live content
during matches here's an example of
activity streams both of GetGlue and
feed camp the point of activity streams
is to make users aware of things that
they've already registered interest in
and get glue it's friends that they
follow in free camp which is a project
management system is information about
projects that they're already involved
in or to do items that they've already
commented up again if you think of
Twitter or Facebook they're really good
examples of activity streams and push it
makes it possible I'm really easy to
build that sort of functionality
collaboration example this example is an
on-stage
add-on for MailChimp it allows multiple
people to collaborate on the same
newsletter at the same time this could
be designers marketers and CEOs
all working together to build the same
newsletter they can work and collaborate
on synchronized to-do lists and also
chat in the peanut gallery multiplayer
games whenever a new technology comes
around people want to build games with
it
real-time web technologies are no
different here with an example of a
massively multiplayer Scrabble game
called word squared that allows people
to playing against thousands of other
people to quickly play styles and score
points
as with any multiplayer game the real
time aspect really increases user
engagement on the next slide we can see
part of a world map
so if you think about this there could
be millions of people playing this game
all at the same time against each other
okay so that's an overview of pusher in
some of the use cases pusher also makes
it easy for you to build these
applications in a number of different
ways as I've said we're a hosted service
this means that we deal with
infrastructure for you we have two types
of endpoints a restful endpoint and a
WebSocket endpoint the restful endpoint
is for publishing information and the
WebSocket endpoint is for both
publishing but also more importantly
receiving information users using the
WebSocket connection of the system
connection to pusher which we managed to
instantly receive information with
libraries for a whole bunch of
technologies JavaScript for web iOS
Android net Silverlight Ruby
ActionScript Arduino and many more and
server libraries PHP Ruby Python no net
ColdFusion and more
we also offer tooling on the right hand
side you'll see there's a debug console
this is available within the pushy
dashboard unless you see when people
connect disconnect send messages and
various other pieces of important
information about your application
pusher and we're championing WebSockets
it's the best solution to real-time
bi-directional communication between a
client and server in the past there's
been a number of hacky solutions
umbrella under the term comet some of
these technologies are still in use
however WebSockets were designed so that
comet solutions could be made obsolete
we had a layer of abstraction on top of
WebSockets in our client libraries so
that you can use the publish/subscribe
paradigm you can subscribe and publish
to channels and on those channels you
receive events or you publish events
here's an example of subscribing in the
JavaScript library and there's an
example of publishing from the PHP
library we'll go into that in more
detail in other videos
so that's pusher hopefully that provides
you with an overview of what we offer
that it's easy to use as the provide
tooling that make it simple to build
applications using pusher so sign up for
a free sandbox account now at pusher Con
