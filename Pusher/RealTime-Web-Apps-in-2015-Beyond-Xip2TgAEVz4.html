2015 and beyond my name's Phil Leggett
ER at legged front Twitter a little bit
about me I'm not going to go into this
in lots of detail but I'm relatively
unique in that I've been working with
real-time technologies for quite a while
since 2001 when I work for company
called Kaplan systems they're one of a
few companies that kind of pioneered
real-time technologies although kept it
all in-house so no kind of knew about it
I'm software engineering background
although my job title in a minute is
like developer evangelist which is it
has its pros and cons my focus is always
been API is SDKs dachshund basically
developer experience in in numerous
roles and that's still kind of what I do
now as well as give talks I currently
work for pusher I've interests who's
heard of pusher 12 okay and so we're a
hosted service and with a focus on
helping people add real time
functionality and data into web mobile
and IOT apps we basically sit as a
real-time layer between your back-end
and a map no matter the technology
whether it's PHP Python node java.net
and your client applications again the
matter what their kind of written it and
I'll focus as I said is to make it easy
to integrate that real-time
functionality into any stat and I'm at
this stage of development so my history
in real time and also the job what I got
right now obviously leads into my
interest in real-time technologies I
gave it basically a year ago version of
this and the organizers asked me to give
an updated version so I'll share these
slides afterwards if anybody wants to to
IFC recorded at my shed at home so if
anybody wants to have a look at that and
compare it to talk today and you're
obviously more than welcome to the first
thing I'm going to want to talk about is
we talked about real-time web apps and I
know the title of this talk is real-time
web apps but web and internet become
kind of synonymous but maybe they
shouldn't be so maybe we should be
thinking really about internet apps
we're not always talking about browsers
when always talking about
HTTP hyperlinks and so on so maybe we
all think about wilt will turn into the
applications because fundamentally it's
no it's the internet and if you look at
the work the definition of web it's
slightly different so on so I also want
to talk about real-time now um glare
mode this morning spoke the author of
socket i/o spoke about some of this
stuff but I don't know about anybody was
here but my definition is kind of it
goes from the Wikipedia definition so
there's this idea of hard real-time now
if you were using like real-time web or
real-time Internet technologies you
wouldn't use them to kind of control the
safety system with the enterprise social
enterprise warp core and there's a hard
real-time factoring that so say an event
takes place which means the warp core
knees is going to explode it needs
ejecting you're not going to use soccer
I oh you're not going to use pusher to
power that real-time safety system
there's absolute hard deadlines that
means fundamental failure of that system
if an action isn't taken on that event
which is hey the world cause without to
explode Geordi LaForge wouldn't be
particularly happy either if you were to
plug in safe a or signal are to handle
this or stuff although signal is net and
therefore maybe enterprise so what we're
really talking about again either come
up with these terms is firm or soft
real-time and what that means is the
deadline for dealing with the the event
taking place and the data becoming
available doesn't need to be absolutely
met it means that the system will
degrade in terms of performance in terms
of what it will deliver and that the
experience that's delivered to a user
potentially but it doesn't mean absolute
critical failure so when we talk about
real-time web internet technologies
we're really talking about firm or soft
real-time and obviously social the
source social apps we've seen a built
using real-time technologies or examples
of that on a couple when we need a real
time when it kind of matters so is there
a timely nature to the data that's been
delivered obviously in a safety system
an event takes place there's some data
which says the warp core is about to
explode
there's obviously a timely nature to
that data now we're not talking about
that sort of hard real-time we're
talking about other applications
software or firm real-time so there's
still occasions where data is generated
and there's value to getting that data
sooner rather than later things around
no user experiences things around value
in terms of stocks and shares in
executing trades something I'm quite
keen to talk about in a minute and I'm
not going to a lot of detail is that
everybody in this room everybody in this
building new builds applications will
have real-time data within their systems
so anytime that any event takes place
within an application and there's data
associated with that there is real-time
data so data changes so crude you know
create read update and delete data
changes all of those represent an event
with real-time data associated with it
system interactions obviously an
interaction with a database is also an
interactive system interaction but
interactions between systems interacting
with the web endpoints that data that's
returned as the result of that all of
those are interactions with events from
real-time data and obviously user
interactions there's the user themselves
there's the data associated with the
interaction if you're interested in
going to into that a little bit more
I've got again another talk on that
helping people identify it's another one
in my shed where real time debt might be
in your system and the second point
about where real time really matters is
is with user experiences and that's
where we're seeing most the value is
that there's a timely nature to the
experience that's being delivered so you
mean to human interactions is something
that most of us crave some of us not so
much some as some others more so but
it's a natural thing that we want to do
so it makes sense that we try and do
that online we know that how experiences
degrade when we don't have real-time
tactics references you've set aside a
skype call with a lagging latency and
it's terrible so we need that real-time
data and that real-time technology to
enable us to build these sorts of
experiences that we want so to summarize
like we need real times real time is
required when we need or demand when
there's a need or demand for up-to-date
information so to be in the know or
there's generally value that information
or to build engaging experiences user
experiences interactive experiences and
as I'm kind of mentioned these aren't
new needs or demands we want to do those
sorts of things in person so it makes
sense that we look at the internet as a
platform to allow us to build similar
experiences but in focus to the internet
generally does get in the way and
husband in the past so I'm going to
cover a bit about the background of why
we kind of want this technology how
we're building applications with the
technology now and then what we might be
doing in the future with it so here's
the internet is finance level as you'll
tell I'm pretty awesome at design this
is my google drawer application I'm
going to be building on now the arrow
here kind of represents the amount of
effort that as developers we have to put
in to achieve that point of innovation
within our applications so when we think
about the internet and the fundamentals
we have to put in a hell of a lot of
effort in order to build anything in it
innovative that really delivers value
HTTP is obviously helped some you know I
don't I'm probably discrediting it here
a little bit by making the area so big
but fundamentally it has stopped us
building at least these real-time
applications so it was better but we
already wanted to do more than that so
this is talk romatic from 1973 which is
clearly an Internet console-based
real-time chat application so back in
1973 we were trying to build real-time
chat the people that weren't being able
to be in the same office together some
of you might remember yahoo chat again
at least it run in a browser but it was
a Java rappler I mean you know you
couldn't do sound you can't do voice
otherwise so we're trying to work around
what was fundamentally our viewport into
the internet which is a which was our
browser although that's changing a bit
now we're trying to work really hard to
achieve these real-time experiences so
going back to finance which as I said
kind of pioneered some of the
fundamentals of these real-time
technologies this is Reuters three
thousand extra chose real-time stops and
share prices but it's a fat client so it
made sense that back at early two
thousand people tried to take these
applications and put them in web
browsers because web browsers we you bit
with us everybody who had a PC had a web
browser at some point so you could
obviously
more easily I get people to just go to a
URL and access real-time data but it was
really difficult to do that if you look
at what's going on here there's probably
only one that's the frames are HTML the
browser windows probably an iframe but
the rest of it like java applets so HTTP
generally and the browser itself as well
wasn't providing was enough work as with
the north it was a request-response open
closed kind of paradigm maintaining
consistent connections was hard for the
numerous reasons that the runtimes and
the technologies we were using weren't
generally used to that we couldn't do
cross and there was no cross browser
support for doing like similar things so
we were hacking around stuff there was a
two connection limit to the same domain
you couldn't make requests to a
different origin so I couldn't make
requests from leg otoko tuk to you know
NYC camp to org and browsers were doing
things in loads of different ways so it
was a complete pain and again the amount
of effort we had to put into trying to
achieve these things was massive so we
have you've already seen that java
applets were there they were kind of the
first way of achieving this
communicating between javascript and
java using java as the connection
transport flash and HTTP hacks
eventually but luckily we're now in a
point where we're real time has gone
mainstream so i want to provide five
reasons that i believe that we are we
are there right now the first thing is
social has been really the first
demonstration of the value of offering
more of a kind of real-time feeling
experience we know the value offered by
Twitter and Facebook we know that loads
of people use it and it's it's
demonstrated business value as well as
social experience value outside of
Finance kind of the first time for
real-time technologies now although
Twitter don't use real time server to
client technologies in this case it's
still shown that the user experiences
you can build and that there's a craving
for a real-time feel I want to know
exactly what's happening right now
another interesting thing that Facebook
and Twitter of also introduced is this
idea of users identifying the data that
they're interested in now
no we don't think of is that the
interaction they actually intent we have
with the application itself isn't oh I
want to subscribe to that person's feed
its I want to follow them it's I want to
like a product is I want to friend
somebody but from a technology point of
view we've identified the subscription
to data that we're really interested in
we've obviously had massive technology
improvements processors and memory we
can process data a lot faster that you
know there was a sea 10k 10,000
persistent simultaneous connection limit
and that we thought was going to be very
difficult to overcome that has been
we've overcame that scaling it's still
difficult although there are patterns
there are technologies that allow us to
do that much much more easily web
browsers are still generally our portal
you know into the internet or window
into the internet so it's great the
browser's are becoming an amazing run
time and with consistent ways of
achieving similar things the
xmlhttprequest object you know came
around with outlook web but now it's
standardized and we're using it in all
browsers we can do cross-origin resource
sharing for cross domain requests we've
got service and events and the event
source API for standardized http-based
real-time streaming and long polling
solutions and we've got WebSocket which
has come along with the absolute need
for real-time bi-directional full-duplex
communication communication between
client and server and then more recently
WebRTC with a focus on audio and video
but also support for data focused on
peer-to-peer connections but there's
news to say that appear isn't the server
so we've got we've got an amazing point
it's much easier now to try and reach
that point of innovation we've got these
fundamentals in place and I think one of
the important things now is that
although a lot of these technologies
generally start being browser focused
their specified you know the
specifications they're defined ap is and
there's no reason why these can't be
used in other technologies you know
there are client libraries that there's
a you know a WebSocket library for
basically any technology and the
software choice has massively improved
as i said i'm back in early 2000 catlin
systems causing light streamer we're all
pioneering that real
time technologies but keeping this
technology absolutely in-house it was
there you know it was their intellectual
property it was it was what they
licensed at large cost of financial
institutions but because of the obvious
need and demand for real time
experiences elsewhere people who
potentially didn't want to work in
finance moves and open source
technologies once we've got one open
source technology we can look at how
they've achieved something and look at
other ways of achieving them standards
have also helped push the software
choice forward and I've obviously got to
say well sure that I believe hosted
services have really helped me know the
benefits they offer in terms of general
hosting infrastructure it's the same
with with real time it's it's
questionably but i believe easier to
integrate with a real time hosted
service than it is to try and roll your
own and host and deal with the
infrastructure around that kind of thing
and the final thing is that the huge
increase in internet usage it's
continuing to increase mary meeker
provided does a report every year and
there a couple of slides again guillermo
showed an example earlier of this a
later slide but this is showing that
basically basic digital media usage is
at five point six hours per person per
per adult per day in the u.s. I thought
it might have been a bit higher maybe
maybe you spend a little bit longer in a
digital media that so this slides
actually from from last year and I
haven't dug into the the results and the
stats again but I still think that you
know crazy it's 200 billion emails or
sent per day 500 million tweets it will
be more than that now 200 million hours
of YouTube is watched each day which is
crazy and if we look at where real time
comes into this you know tweets Facebook
status updates real-time cats through
Instagram and skype is obviously a
real-time audio video experience and
then if you look at a game from
merrymakers report the top apps that are
used and the number of sessions six of
those are messaging based applications
so fundamentally some of those will be
powered by some form of real-time
technology so it's quite clear that
real-time is a massive factor and I've
just picked out a few examples that I
really like so Facebook it's obviously
got real time status updates in the top
right the main wall is a real time
updating you know Activity Stream and it
has facebook Messenger embedded in the
app as well uservoice is a real time
support system where both the support
agent and the person seeking supports
experiences massively increased most
people here tried google docs or maybe
Microsoft 365 I believe it is the online
version and the hours that the
productivity gain we get from
collaborating at certain points in real
you know of the workflow in real time is
massive compared to tracking changes in
a word document checking into SharePoint
checking it back out again so we're
seeing benefits there and Boober
specifically as well for real-time
tracking of taxes again it's just become
this kind of level of expected
experience in applications so before I
came to give this talk i sent an email
round and early internally at work to
find out what other people thought and i
fed that into this and my CEO is let me
quote this paragraph from an internal
email saying that I'm not sure I believe
in such thing as a real time realtor
maps anymore either absolutely update
instantly and smoothly or the air pear
broken so quite a bold statement I feel
that real time as a feature has moved
down the kano graph I'll talk about what
that is in a minute it's much more of an
expectation than an exciter so it's
saying so Max is saying that he believes
that you know applications should behave
in this real-time smooth updating way
well they generally feel broken now the
quena graph from that little quote
that's coming exit over time delightful
innovation becomes another basic need so
what max is saying is that he believes
that if users don't have that real-time
update that smooth experience is that
they're actually dissatisfied with your
application now now obviously that's up
the debate but I'm putting it out there
to see what you think I kind of agree
but I think there are certain use cases
where you and you absolutely need a
real-time and others where you can get
away with it at the minute so the real
real time is except essential because
the Internet is that stale communication
platform if you look at all those
messaging application
if you think about using email you think
about using skype you think about using
Google Hangouts if you think about using
google dots all of those are ultimately
communication platt communication
applications built on the internet as a
communication platform I actually gave a
talk about this exactly at 2012 to Leo
calm and I'm holding true to that an
interesting of it's becoming our
entertainment platform at home I don't
have a normal aerial for TV everything
is on demand I use netflix amazon prime
maybe download the occasional film so
you know the Internet is becoming where
our source of entertainment as well and
gaming obviously so realtor maps in 2015
that's kind of where we were where are
we now what are people building and I
want to talk about two things the first
one is something I'm calling
communication patterns you could call it
programming models and I want to look at
what these programming models are or
communication patterns are and look at
the use cases the best suit those so the
first one is I mean some of them were
quite fluffy and I'm again I'm by
sharing this I'm hoping to get some
feedback is simple messaging and
suitable for notifications and signaling
so most people have seen the Twitter you
I where we have like you've missed that
there are five new tweets and but this
is ITV that actually used pusher and
their site looks like an activity stream
anyway so it kind of feels real time but
anytime that there's a new piece of news
they just push the contents basically
HTML contents as a simple message
through to the UI and then just show how
many um UI updates are pending to be
displayed so as I said a simple message
it's just a blob of data you've got the
connection open so just send that data
there's also now I'm going to struggle
here to put this on and I don't know
whether the sounds going to work my
master he's a got a really bad though
that he's been trying to squash the last
couple of days he's struggling and then
eventually he comes across a solution
and then he wants to give a high five he
wants a high five from it from his team
so uh he then yeah go ahead
right so that's just silly except but I
mean I'm sure most people have seen
Internet of Things this was a couple
years ago i am called Sid Lawrence who's
doing all the talking he works with me
called we make orange and and a guy
called also Thomas on the left now all
they're doing is they're sending an
event and a message which doesn't
actually need any content just the fact
that a message your eyes means that
those arms move now it's you know a very
very simple example of signaling this is
Tokyo by a company called and yet who
are based in the States one of the guys
actually works in Edinburgh where I live
as you can tell I'm very attractive so
this is obviously that the application
itself is much richer and much more
requires a lot more functionality than
just simple signaling but fundamentally
to connect these in this case myself
with myself on my phone with my with my
browser is a signal to tell with a
simple relatively simple data payload to
tell these applications how to talk to
each other I'm okay that I think that
was all right yeah that was fine oh okay
thank you anyway you're watching me
always rock chainless okay cool thank
you okay well do that ever need it Laura
Scott thank you um and this is just some
code to show you how you might achieve
this is it this is actually engine i/o
at the top I'm creating a connection I'm
binding to certain events so open and
then I'm binding to another event which
is message so that's you know a very
simple API to let you achieve these
things on the bottom sending a message
there's you create a server you listen
on port 80 you bind to whenever a
connection occurs and you do socket on
send so just an example of technology
that lets you achieve this sort of
communication pattern so um web hooks
most people might have heard of web
hooks the ability for commuter service
to communicate an event takes place and
you make an HTTP request normally a post
request
delivering that data client server
technology stock Jess which is like a
WebSocket polyfill engine i/o which I've
showed an example of an Primus which is
actually an abstraction on top of jas
engine I and also something called
browser channel so it lets you change
the engine that you're fundamentally
using but use the same API and these
people to be a solution is probably you
do a lot more than simple signaling but
they let you power that kind of
signaling for the WebRTC so that adds to
our stack because we kind of reach reach
towards innovation now pub/sub which
Chris spoke about earlier my feeling
around pub/sub most people have heard of
pubs are bright bubbly subscribe it
provides your way of identifying data
through a simple naming convention
normally called a channel or a topic or
subject and I think it fits quite well
when data starts to get more complex or
activity streams where there are
multiple types of activity life whole
surveys data visualizations and chat so
they're going to hit that home with an
example this is Manchester City's much
stay Center Emergency there's quite a
lot of different parts of the UI and
quite a lot of different pieces of data
and if you think about building
application you wouldn't want to just go
on message and then get all the data for
all parts of that UI and then have to
update all the UI or search through that
data and find the right piece of data to
apply to a certain bit of you I you want
to be able to partition that data
probably based on how it looks visually
so there's an overview section at the
top so you might subscribe specifically
to the overview section you might
subscribe to that events section in the
minute words yellow cards and red cards
and specific maps their events and then
the tabs might represent different
activity streams so a commentary
activity stream and a key moments
activity stream so in your code you
actually subscribe to these different
channels and have different callbacks so
your your code is naturally separated
which means as you change the UI you
only subscribe to certain channels that
are actually shown in the UI so another
example of that let me see my mouse is
it there this is tricky
and so this is this is something called
cut and traded at Catherine systems
build as you can see it's a very complex
UI and we're pub/sub really comes into
its own as well as where there's lots of
data so each of these kind of panels
could be a subscription to a certain
type of data and you'll see that as the
user uses the application it might
change the subscription their data that
they're interested in so it makes sense
that you can subscribe to data when it's
visible and unscripted unsubscribe to
data when it's not so publish-subscribe
generally fits very well with this kind
of scenario I can't see that deposit for
the life of other again okay so an
example pups of example this is fay
which is available for Ruby and node
we're creating a client we're
subscribing to messages and we're
passing a function call back so we could
also subscribe to activities or or
financial data or you know FX fi or chat
and then publishing is as simple as
publishing on the channel messages and
the data now something that again is
relatively new in terms of thinking
about the best kind of communication
patterns for real-time technologies is
that again even a message blob itself
probably isn't even when I so partition
by a channel probably isn't quite enough
because say the channel identifies the
data that you're interested in then
there are different things that happens
to that data so you know data is updated
it's deleted there are other kind of
events that can take place on data so i
think a vented abstraction on top of
this idea of pub sub works particularly
well so in this case this is the the
pusher javascript library and an example
below using I think node but you
subscribe to a channel which is messages
and then you bind to different types of
events so in this case I'm saying new
message or message updated but again if
it if it were you know a record in a
database or a table it could be
activities and then you bind to new
activity activity updated activity
deleted so from a kind of programming
model or a communication style I feel it
works a lot better with with real-time
web apps as you build them
and if you look at some of the existing
solutions actually socket i/o has an
idea of namespaces and has rooms and
it's always a vented it's you know you
bind to on any type of event charm on
chat message so it actually is an
invented pub/sub abstraction have use it
in a certain way and X sockets similarly
and there's some of the hosted solutions
there at law so that adds pub/sub to the
stack there's also RPC NRMA sorry remote
procedure call or remote method
invocation I specifically like the idea
of remote method invocation because
you're interacting with objects defined
on a server from your client or objects
on a client from your server and you're
invoking methods on those objects now
I'm not entirely sure about the best use
cases for it but I think it suits quite
well when you've got some quite complex
server and client interactions so when
there's some very domain-specific
semantically which interactions that
take place that can be lost when you
just think about messaging if people
have tried to write like a pure pub sub
only event hub based architecture you'll
probably find it quite soon you're
you're writing a lot of code around just
dealing with messages and it doesn't
quite fit so I think RPC RM RM I
solution script pretty well with that so
to provide an example here like a trade
ticket now the workflow for this is you
open a trade you get an acknowledgement
of opening my trade you wait for it to
become executable it can then either be
withdrawn it can expire or exit it can
execute trade is then the trade isn't
confirmed that confirmation needs to be
acknowledged or can expire so I think
rmin RPC that provides know those very
specific domain based functions might
work quite well for this kind of
scenario or potentially synchronizing
state which I'll get into a little bit
later and this is something called
shooter by the guys by Damien Edwards
and David Fowler who built signal r
which is a.net solution and maybe games
are another example of that we've got
very domain specific pieces of
functionality like you know player moves
left move right shoot turn on shield
teleport and so on
and this is an example of signal our
sorry it's done at C sharp and but at
the top here that you define something
called a game hub and you define a
method in this case called move on it
now at the very bottom of the client
example code you'll see there's games
server don't move so what that does is
that executes that function that's
defined on the server and then within
the the top code there's move so when
that's executed you can use the
framework supported syntax of clients to
also all clients call their player moved
function so it's quite complex as you
walk through it but it actually is quite
nice as you're writing the code against
that and there are a surprising number
of solutions like how many interests
anybody use a real-time what framework
that uses our pc rmi yeah one okay too
alright cool so there's obviously and I
it's felt relatively new to me although
Java and lies been around forever so and
some you know obvious wants to point out
are things like meteor you can define
you can call your client side code from
the server and sockets dimmer guy called
I'm Paul Jensen spoke yesterday on on
socket stream so we've got pub sub in
there and we've got our am I simple
messaging finally there's this data
thing no data synchronization specific
quite well for me in terms of when
you're collaborating on shared data sets
on a shared structure and it's
interesting to see that data
synchronization is the solution or the
communication pattern that that back-end
is a service style solutions offer with
firebase and sink a no or sink are no
fly base I think another one but if you
look at these they tend to offer this
kind of date synchronization solution
now most people obviously know that
Google Docs is a great example of that
where ultimately you're you're
interacting with and manipulating shared
data structure and those changes are
then synchronized to different devices
originally the server and then
distribute it to other clients and I
built a mapping example using their ESRI
JavaScript API using a data
synchronization solution gain it's quite
multiple people working on the same kind
of view it works really well to
collaborate together this one doesn't
always work hi I'm Stephen Garin a
developer done Xenophon using firebase
for some of our applications in
emergency management and new forms of
human-computer interaction done lets
people come around physical surfaces
like a sand table or an immersive room
to communicate the effects of models in
real-time events looking at what the
firefighters will use a common sandbox
will use very traditional medium of yon
to express the progression of fire that
we saw that initially is a primitive
interface but now we see that is
actually something of a goal as a human
computer interaction let people express
models and interactions in that way and
we're cloud projecting digital
information on top of that the best part
about using fire bases I don't have to
actually focus on the back before it
becomes a marketing video but I really
like that this idea of digital and
physical I'm using something like you
know a real son table and you know
string and synchronizing that state
obviously you're not synchronizing sand
on another table but you'll think you're
transmitting digital changes with a
physical interaction so I think that's
really powerful and you know that's
happening today this is the five ASAP I
believe there's a talk on fire base
later in this case it's really simple
you're getting a reference to an object
you could treat these objects in
different ways in this case I'm drinking
is a collection I'm pushing data onto
that and again the importance here is
like the real time web the invented web
is that there are events you bind to to
identify what's happening to that data
so child added child change in child
removed and obviously the API offers
more than that but with that itself you
can synchronize state and there's a
growing number of solutions in the space
of dobie jess has been around for quite
a while I think the people that created
it will actually went off a dip in some
consultancy but it's still available as
a solution like this Lola DB and the
people that built that actually
contacted me
it looks really interesting they've got
a lot of client libraries available for
this the back end node and some of them
are kind of more all in than others so
Derby and meteor your kind of buying
into using that framework almost in this
entirety you're not going to have an
existing say Drupal up and they go well
i'm going to use meteor for this bit
about i don't think i could be wrong
maybe there's some talk later about that
sort of thing so there are different
solutions which fit better with
different stages of development and
obviously hosted there's a bunch of
different examples available so we've
now you know we've only got a tiny
amount of effort that's so easy for us
now as developers to reach that point of
innovation and build amazing apps so
there's no excuse but obviously there's
a lot of solutions out there so how do
you go around choosing them I'm going to
briefly cover this there are technology
considerations you know not every team
wants to dive into no not every team
wants to build a scarlet app so there's
a skill set list languages and there's
also infrastructure considerations you
know does your team really want to build
that infrastructure and maintain those
connections and deal with scaling on or
not there's business focus as well you
know if adding an application feature is
more important than dealing with that
infrastructure layer and you know
dealing with at scaling then obviously
there's more value in looking at a
hosted service a native mobile support
is something that you do need to
consider not all of these solutions
often iOS Android or Windows Phone
libraries and the stage of development
that you're out obviously affects things
like you know meteor is kind of an eye
man or it's an all in application
framework for building your app so it's
probably not a great as I said a great
solution for augmenting an existing
application but if you're green fielding
you know you can actually get stuff
built really quickly with meteor you
need to think about connection strategy
in a production based application web
socket is the ideal connection but you
need to fall back to two polling some
solutions still go for just a sea-based
connectivity because it will connect but
there will be a small amount of latency
at the very least so you need to think
about what it is you want the experience
you're trying to deliver is real time
really important you want
WebSockets available but you also need
to fall back for proxies firewalls and
all the devices how do you choose which
communication pattern kind of suits your
needs now this is again quite a
rudimentary way of looking at it but
hopefully provides a bit of a a bit of a
framework for considering what you might
want to choose so the y-axis is data
complexity so obviously with on message
that the data is relatively simple
you're just sending a blob through
application complexity is kind of sort
of functionality that you're offering
the types of interactions that are
taking place you probably wouldn't use
on message for that now as data gets
more complex than pub/sub becomes a
better solution because you can
partition the data your subscriptions
identify what the data you're interested
in a vented pub/sub probably sits kind
of right at the top of that arrow in
terms of day complexity and you also
build synchronization type solutions
with that application complexity and low
data complexity maybe maybe rmi data
sync seems to be kind of the way that
we're moving forward with real-time
technologies and again the first talk
today suggested that that was a solution
to go for I don't expect people to read
this and I'm not going to go through it
but it I'll share the slides afterwards
and it gives you an idea where some of
the existing solutions might fit the
cells gs1 might be slightly wrong but
again by sharing it o clock and get
feedback when I go into this in more
detail in a couple of talks I gave a
ten-minute talk for Jess earlier in the
year and for London there's one this
year if anybody wants to go to London
I've got a 15-percent discount code um
there's a flag for 35 minute talk there
on that so that's the history that's
what people are building right now and
now we need to think about beyond what a
what can we do with this technology
going forward there's something's
getting in our way network
infrastructure reliability speed and
this absolute understanding it there are
so many legacy infrastructure systems
that just expect HTTP and nothing else
these things are getting in our way of
as others really innovating on the web
HTTP two looks like it would be a
shining light I'd recommend till I call
Delia gregorich who works for google
recommend he's got a book which is
amazing and following him for updates
that we generally need about these
different you know we've got WebSocket
we've got a vent source and the service
center events API but what do we do in
terms of those communication like
patterns and paradigms and programming
models you know do we really need a we
need a protocol for pub/sub we need a
protocol for data synchronization we
need a protocol maybe maybe not for
simple messaging but so there are soft
as a socket i/o protocol there's DDP
distributed data protocol by phoca
meteor is that going to be standardized
is it going to be adopted across other
frameworks what is the pub sub solution
is it MQTT which has originally focused
on machine to machine via servers but
very low latency very very small and
efficient and pub sub solution is that
the way forward am i right is vented pub
sub so important that we should have you
know a protocol that's used across
frameworks for that are there other
standards I don't know this is something
that I think needs to be addressed um I
obviously need to talk about the
Internet of Things I'm not going to go
into detail that there's a million talks
on internet of things but there are some
interesting facts can everyone see that
yeah so apparently we've got 15 billion
devices connected right now and by 2020
will have 200 billion devices we're
going to have 26 smart objects per
person so that's you know from watches
to t-shirts that refrigerators two plugs
everything will be connected to the
Internet so it's obviously going to be a
massive trend we're going to see more
and more things you know there are car
kits for specifically around things like
this hopefully i can start controlling
my children and stopping them crying and
that would be really handy i'm not going
to play this video but we've all seen
drones but this is quite interesting
it's a dance mat and they're controlling
the drone with the dance mat so it's
letting as plug things that we wouldn't
have thought can communicate with each
other together and doing crazy and silly
stuff with it Google are pushing
something called the physical web now
that the physical web is this idea that
any object could potentially provide a
URL and our devices will be able to
discover the objects that are nervous
request information from those objects
in
we'll just be a URL and then the URL
will take our application or a web
browser to like deep linking to our app
or to a URL and then the communication
between the devices will really start to
take place via the Internet in this case
they've used the web and specifically
here they save web socket but they mean
real time communication between the
device and probably you know in this
case what's this a parking meter and a
mobile device so this is definitely
worth looking into the physical web
obviously because the massive trend the
IOT we're starting to see more platforms
any of the real-time technology
platforms that I've mentioned already
will already have SDKs and libraries to
help people build with IOT I three know
Raspberry Pi which is just a standard
you know linux box anyway and now
windows supporting but there were
specific ones that are coming along
smart things that really interesting was
a company called ninja blocks who
unfortunately recently fell out run out
of money so not everyone is going to be
successful everything was quite
interesting go called Chris Matthew
create something called Skynet I am
which was kind of a very happies socket
i/o solution but I believe he's done a
lot of stuff like this in the past he
now works for Intel and he's now behind
them something called opto blue and if
you search for IOT platform you'll get a
million hits ish now something else I
think is going to be really important
especially when you think about the
experience that the understanding that
data has a timely nature to it the
understanding that the experiences that
we want to build for our users is really
important the api's will start to move
towards be offering real-time delivery
of data so anytime an event takes place
there will be as some form of
subscription by the API that can be
pushed to the KPI consumer if you look
at some of the api's it available the
minute twilio centigrade MailChimp I
know github Trello they all have real a
real time endpoint of some sort whether
it's a web hook or whether it's web
sockets I will start to see api's for
API so fan-out are focusing on being a
rail real-time API infrastructure and
you might not think there are any
real-time API is available but
interestingly enough if you look at some
of
some well-known applications they offer
real-time API underneath so the only
exception is maybe paypal that you
probably think of as an API as well as a
nap and but all of these you know
Twitter firehose you've probably heard
of but all of these other applications
offer real-time API of some sort so
we're already starting to see apps
offering real-time API is because they
want people to build real-time
experiences with it again I going toward
these help on that and the talk I gave
that API strategies around helping
people choose which which how to start
building real-time API so please watch
that if that's of interest to you so
taking IOT and real-time api's together
most people have heard of nest right so
that they're focusing on being basically
you know a smart homes technology
provider now they're required by Google
for 3.2 billion dollars which is quite a
lot of money I think and they're
offering you know thermostat smoke
detectors alarms but interestingly
enough they actually use the fire based
protocol as their API so I don't know
but I'm guessing that means they've got
a self install version of firebase now
google acquired vibration recently now
did they acquire firebase fees in it
because they believe that it's the
future of building applications or did
they acquire firebase because
fundamentally firebase is fundamental to
the success of nests which they just
paid 3.2 billion dollars for probably a
bit of both firebase is a great
experience for building on so it's
obviously going to be important this
sort of thing I've already mentioned
that real-time experiences it going to
be even more essential data audio and
video are going to be a big part of that
I think I originally had this is
stagnation of the use cases but I think
it's probably unfair and but these these
use cases for real-time technologies
have been around for five years like
notifications activity streams that
visualization result but I think and
they haven't changed I think we're going
to see more people adding those two
applications but also them change
slightly so if you look at the UI's of
things like the notification screen on
android not only are you getting a
real-time notification you're getting
prompted straight away for an action
you're not asking them to jump straight
into to Twitter all the time or
another application there's actually the
ability within the OS to support actions
within applications and I think that's a
place that we're going to go with this
if you look at something like Google now
Google's identified information you're
interested in but it's now prompting you
to subscribe to data to understand what
that user is interested in more detail
so get updates on things that you're
interested in so subscriptions and I
think we're moving towards this idea of
users identifying streams of information
and events that they will want to
consume personalized event streets so I
think again this idea on the real-time
web that event is really important and
because of that and because of this idea
of the notification we started see
unified API is across different os's
that we can hook into and plug our
real-time data into so I've got like 15
seconds so I'm going to skip really
quickly multi-device experiences already
interested you think we've got all these
devices connected to the to the Internet
why can't we use multiple devices
together to achieve things a few we've
seen some second screen applications
that kind of do this but there's also a
gang called watchdogs which is quite
interesting to look at for this I'd
specifically recommend you follow
Benjamin been been a guy called been
Foxhall he's done some amazing talks if
you're in the audience for his talks
it's genuinely amazing that he's
communicating between multiple devices
sending sounds around capturing
information from these devices so i'll
just say please follow Ben he's a great
guy and a really clever and so in
summary the internet is our
communications platform I think that's
pretty clear it's now easier for us to
innovate we've got loads of technology
but standards we've got technologies
that let us innovate and provide these
reels from experiences we all have
real-time data in our apps so think
about the data that's important how you
can expose that and how you can build
these real-time experiences otherwise
your app might start to feel broken you
know the pull down option to refresh it
doesn't feel right anyway and the future
is improvements to infrastructure and
standards in various places obviously
IOT I believe API is real-time API s and
this idea of personalized events dreams
because users are identifying the data
they're interested in so it should be
pushed to them and then you can build
these experiences on those events
so real time limited apps ultimately the
Internet of Things because browsers are
things web servers are things native
apps are things devices are things
everything is a thing ultimately we're
building real time into the apps that's
it I haven't really got any time for
questions but be around I've got some
t-shirts and stickers as well of anybody
would like them so I'm going to hang
around for this talk and please give me
a sh afterwards so thank</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
