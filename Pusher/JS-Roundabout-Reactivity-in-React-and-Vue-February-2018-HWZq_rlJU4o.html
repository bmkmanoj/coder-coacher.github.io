talking about reactivity in reactive
view so we're gonna do a sort of
high-level overview of how the
frameworks work and how they both
implement reactivity which is sort of
the core of the frameworks so my name's
ed Yarbrough I'm a software engineer at
the BBC and I've also part of the view
core team so out of interest who has
used react before okay yeah okay quite a
lot of you and who here's use view
before a not so many of you but still a
few of you so we're not gonna go over
like the details of how to use them but
I'm just going to try and give you a
high-level overview of how how the
framework works so from writing your
component to what happens when a user
clicks on or interacts with your
component and how that triggers an
update in the Dom so viewing reactor
really similar frameworks they're both
the view lever the book both the view
layer so they're sort of the V in MVC
they both use component based
architectures so the the sort of
philosophy is that you use these
composable components to build up your
application and they both use the
virtual Dom which is like a slight
oversimplification but but basically
they're both use this thing called
virtual Dom which we'll talk about later
the biggest difference between them is
how they implement reactivity so first
thing is components so this is a this is
a view component right it's it's just a
template and it's going to render a div
with an h1 tag with the value of zero
and we can use this component once we've
registered it in a view app just by if
you look at the template we can just use
it like an HTML HTML element so this is
the sort of the composability
view under the hood view compiles that
template string into a render function
so if you look at that function it's
quite confusing at first but basically
we're calling this function called
creator element and then we're calling
it with a div and an h1 and the value
and you can sort of imagine that this is
like telling the Dom what it should do
and it's creating these elements and
then putting them into the document sort
of like document create element but a
bit more complex so yeah we need to talk
about the Dom to talk about these
frameworks the DOM is a document object
model so once your HTML is rendered in a
browser it gets added to the Dom which
is sort of a list of the interface for
reacting with a document it's how you
have reactive web pages so if this is
the HTML that our component earlier
would generate the the Dom uses a tree
data structure so it would take that
HTML and then render this this tree of
data where you have the the parent div
node and then a child h1 node and in the
Dom a text node is also a node so we
have that's 0 being the child of the h1
node so earlier I was saying that you
could imagine the the render function
basically just calling document create
and creating these divs in the Dom but
the problem with that is it's really
expensive to update the Dom so if your
composer application was updating the
Dom every time some state changed in it
your your application would seem really
sluggish to users so we need to be a bit
smarter about it and that's why this
thing called the virtual Dom comes in so
the virtual Dom is exactly the same as
the Dom it's it's a JavaScript
representation of the DOM and that might
not make sense to you it's easier to
sort of understand it if you think of it
as literally just an object so this is a
really simple example of a virtual Dom
where we're describing the same same
HTML structure as we were creating
earlier in our component
so you have this object we've called it
Vinodh and each object has a type and a
children array and inside that children
array it can have more of the same kind
of object so that's a really simple
example with virtual Dom it's just a
JavaScript object so our template from
earlier had this render function and I
said that create element could be almost
thought of as creating an element in the
document but what it actually does is it
generates the virtual Dom so the sort of
process of application that uses react
or view is to generate this virtual Dom
from the components and then update the
Dom using the virtual Dom so instead of
just creating a new Dom structure each
time the each time the applications
re-rendered it'll at some point call the
function that sort of diff the virtual
Dom against the real Dom and only makes
changes where there's a difference
between the virtual Dom and the real Dom
and this way we minimize the amount of
changes we have to make to the actual
document which makes our applications a
lot faster so when you create your your
application using a component you have
this initial render where you render the
virtual Dom and then the applica be the
reacts or view framework compares your
virtual Dom to the real Dom and updates
the real Dom to make it in sync and to
reflect the virtual Dom so hopefully you
hit you guys are still following me so
the virtual Dom is great and we had that
component that rendered the h1 tag with
with the zero value inside it but that's
not really much use alone we want to add
something we want to add a bit of
complexity we want to add this thing
called state so space is a way of
storing data inside a component
this is our component from earlier I've
moved into a view single file component
format so we have a script block and we
can extract the template into this
template block so this is the same
component and it would render the same
HTML and now we can add this state so if
you see in the the object we've added a
data function and that returns the
initial state of our component so here
it's count and count set to zero and
then inside the template we're going to
render the count value so at the moment
this does exactly what our component
from earlier was doing but it set us up
to be able to add in some interactivity
so the next thing to do this is a
counter component we're going to add in
a button if you look at that button tag
you can see that there's a an act click
property this is basically an on click
event and it says that when you click on
the button update the component state
the components count state by one and by
doing that because view picks up that
the state has changed it's going to
re-render the component rear-ends of the
virtual dom diff the virtual Dom against
the real Dom and re-render so this is
this is an example of the component that
we've got so far you can see that by
clicking increment we're incrementing
this this state so Dom looks a bit more
complex now we have a button and and an
h1 tag and they both have text values so
if we just go back we see that we
initiate with this this zero value in
the h1 and then if a user triggers a
click on the button it's going to update
the count value which is going to
trigger a re-render the virtual Dom and
the virtual Dom is going to update so
the only difference here is that the h1
node now has a child node with the value
of
one so we have a virtual DOM and a real
Dom that's out of sync inside this
update process and what view or all
react is going to do in simple terms is
compare each of the nodes it's going to
loop through this tree structure and
compare the nodes to each other and when
there's a difference between the nodes
so here we've got we're comparing one to
zero the framework will pick up the
difference and update the Dom to match
the virtual Dom's node so that values
been updated to one and then we'll carry
on dipping and in this way instead of
updating the entire tree we've just
updated one node so that's a factor of
six times less work already you can
imagine it in an application that has
thousands of nodes it makes a real big
difference so what we were doing we we
updated the state by clicking on a
button and then somehow updating that
state triggered the virtual Dom to be
rear-ended and then after the virtual
Dom was rear-ended we updated the Dom by
comparing the virtual Dom to the real
Dom so we were looking at view so far
and we've sort of got all the
prerequisite knowledge in place let's
just go through like reacts reactivity
system because it's a bit simpler to to
understand and then views so here's the
same component rewritten with react our
sort of comment I've commented out the
constructor and the increment method if
you look inside the render function we
have a very similar looking function to
what we had in view we've got a div we
have an h1 we're using the state value
of count inside the h1 and then we have
a non-quick method on the button that's
going to call this increment and you can
imagine that that updates the state and
then triggers re-render
so it's worth noting that inside this
render function you have this stuff that
looks a bit like HTML this isn't
actually HTML it's something called JSX
which needs to be compiled into
JavaScript before it's run in a browser
and when you compile it it looks like
this
so really similar to our render function
that we had earlier we have create
element function calls with the load of
arguments that's ultimately describing
how to create the virtual Dom so this is
the you can see here the constructor
where we set our initial States for the
component and then we have the increment
method where we call this set state so
this set state is the key to reactivity
in react once we call this set state it
tells react that the state is updated
and reacts going to go through the
entire render process it's going to
update the Dom the virtual Dom by
calling render then it's going to diff
against the real Dom and update yet and
update the Dom so that we have a
reactive application so that's react I
think the main takeaway is that reacts
reactivity system is more of it's a pool
reactivity system so you need to give it
an explicit signal to update otherwise
your component isn't going to do
anything so changing the state without
calling this set of states or another
method that tells react explicitly that
needs to re-render and go through the
rendering process again if you don't do
that react isn't going to be reactive so
if we look at view views a little bit
simpler to look at so in our in our
component earlier when we were updating
the count we literally just had this
count increment value which seemed
really simple on the surface until you
start think about how calling
incrementing count triggers the whole
rerender process
so to explain how view knows that
updating a property is going to need to
trigger a rerender of the component you
need to understand setters and getters
just hands up who's heard of setters and
getters before ok cool pretty much
everyone that makes it a lot easier so
so basically setters and getters are a
way for us to proxy functions to be
cooled instead of the default behavior
so if you look in this example we've
we've got this state object and we've
added a setter for a so when we call a
with a new value it's going to set the a
that we have outside of the state it's
going to update that and then it will
console.log that we set a with the new
value and then we can add a getter as
well that's just going to log that you
called get a when the component chose to
get that value so so basically what view
does to add reactivity is it steps
through a component and it finds every
single reactive property and adds it as
a getter and a setter to the component
and then it keeps track of so doing this
it keeps track of what properties are
reactive and what property is changing
and being set need to trigger the
component to re-render so earlier we had
our counter account property when we
originally instantiated the component
for you we'll have made a setter and a
getter for that count property and
therefore triggering it updating the
value changing the value later will
cause a the whole component to go
through the rerender process so actually
I've just realized that I deleted a
slide that explains the process a bit
better but this is this is the last
slide that sort of shows how I don't
know if this makes much sense if you
haven't seen the
previous example but basically that's
the in and out of it
view walks through a component crate
setters and getters and then by doing
this can track what components need to
re-render depending on what value has
been updated so yeah thanks guys that
was like a really high level overview so
the question was in the dipping process
do we actually go through every single
node and compare it to the node in the
DOM and yeah like you suggested that
would be monstrously inefficient so
that's not how it works it's actually a
lot more complex and I don't think I
have the explanatory powers to to give
you a good explanation of how that
happens it's very different in reactive
view they both have different patching
algorithms which diff at the virtual Dom
and the real Dom but yeah there there is
some trade-offs and some assumptions
that both the make that make it a more
efficient process cool thanks guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
