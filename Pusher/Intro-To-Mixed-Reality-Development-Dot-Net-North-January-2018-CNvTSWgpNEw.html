wonderful world of the windows mixed
reality environments who here has
already heard about Windows mixed
reality alright I'm going to expect a
larger hands who's heard of VR for
virtuality there we go so I got some
newbies some new experiences and lastly
who has already got a Windows mix
reality headset yeah mic at the back put
his hand up considering you work for
Microsoft right so I'm Simon darkside
Jackson Microsoft MVP I'm actually a
dual mics of MVP because I bought I old
both Windows and Xbox if you'll ask me
about Windows stuff you can if you want
ask me about the Xbox or deploying to
the Xbox you can as well I've written a
few books I've done layered unity stuff
I've done numerous Congress on things
with Microsoft and as of late now I've
now been dragged into the London world
of Windows mixed reality or basically VR
in general so I'm out there delving into
VR toolkits building solutions work with
people together things don't done but
the only thing I can't find time to do
is actually build my own stuff
unfortunately being MVPs you're always
helping everybody else or writing books
to help everyone else when it comes to
writing your own games or building your
own projects finding the time to little
bit more tricky well anyway that's me
I'm out on the interwebs and basically
Simon Darkseid Jay wherever you want to
find me where anyway we're here about
Windows mix reality so last year
Microsoft entered into the whole VR camp
with their new offering providing
virtuality and much cheaper cheaper
costs and also the fact that having
multiple manufacturers delivering
headsets rather than just any single
manufacturer the mixed reality story
actually started sometime before this
who's head of the hololens they're so
small as it who's tried the hololens yes
well sue people if you get to chant at
any trade show or anywhere else
get him to a hololens line no matter how
long it is and try it because it is
truly amazing wearing a computer on your
head and looking at the world and then
having things augmented to put on it is
great well anyway
we're here up a mixed reality which is
more the other end of the spectrum now
when we talk about mixed reality this is
regardless of experiences that you can
have provided direct from Windows 10 so
we've got the one in the spectrum here
got realities this the real world we've
got the physical desks physical things
in the world also what we're currently
experiencing except for those probably
on high-grade drugs who probably
excavates things are slightly different
when we dial this forward as things like
the hololens is that we start log mented
this space with additional things so we
can actually paint something on the wall
put a nice little dog in the corner and
have it following us around and also
having to recognize the real world for
what it is I'm placing things within it
within the London mixed reality we can
take this further so we have like
virtual presence where you actually in
current having virtual people in your
virtual world and having virtual Cantus
but still in a real room if you look at
the videos online around this you'll see
things like a group of people stood
around a car some people actually have
the physical car some people see a
virtual car but pretty much the same
thing what everyone experiences the same
thing in the same world when we Dallas
all the way out to the end everything is
virtual you know is I'm stood here what
case leave what I see is something
completely different and the land of
mixed reality is the fact that we
darling this back just a smidgen just a
bit simply because Asli if you're
wearing a VR helmet we have to recognize
that there is a physical space you walk
around it if I walk out this door either
will walk out the door or walk into a
wall so we got a brain till that back
ends keep the present or the area that
you walk around in as this is my
physical play space so it'll go walking
off a cliff which apparently can be
quite traumatic if you're wearing a VR
headset and actually fall off a cliff
rather than just seeing a virtual one
although who's in the videos of people
wearing the headset on the top of a tall
skyscraper and then someone push them
hilarious except for the person wearing
the held so heads open McNeely as a
heart attack
now the mutuality set up as well is more
than just the headsets encompasses
this thing so it's from your mixed
relative ready pcs whether this for your
baseline intro specification to say I
can just about room VR and a good spec
to their ultra spec itself we have the
headsets and we also have these lovely
own motion controllers which is pretty
much the same as what we have with all
the VR setups with one key difference
everything you see on the screen is all
it is
so who's used and I've I've or an oculus
VR headset right and how many people
have tripped up and spent hours trying
to set up the environment ready to run
for that it's wrong for it
the big difference here is the fact that
with Windows mixed reality that's all
you need you don't need to be good
screwing holes in the wall and trying to
look like beacons and things like that
this is all it is
now one thing myself did quite well here
is the fact that Microsoft don't build
their headset yes to build the hololens
that's one thing but all they did was
build a specification which allowed at
the moment six manufacturers there are
actually two more in the works one to
whoever announced at CES are actually
bringing up more headsets and I don't
expect this train to stop the prices
headsets range from anywhere from about
300 pounds to about 500 pounds although
we know all the Black Friday sales that
heard quite a lot of people actually
getting them for about 200 so it's very
affordable very good entry-level but
each of these manufactures have popped
their own little spin on how the headset
works so whether it's a nice little
pixelated style from the asus or we've
even got the Samsung headset which
basically has built-in headphones and
also has settings to adjust it for your
eyes and things are that meaning each
manufacturer has gone their own way
around how they're going to do these
things but it's the same headset same
software same everything else you simply
plug into your Windows 10 PC make sure
it's up to date and that's it no
additional setup is required now as I
said the main one of the main
differences is the fact that the windows
mixed reality headsets use what cold
inside
out trucking which means everything to
control tracking in the headset track
and the controls is built into the
headset there are two special sensors if
you want to come we'll look at this
later
which basically do all the tracking for
everything with the lights of Ivan
oculus you need additional beacons or
set and sensors or setup normally about
two or if you want the more advanced
setting about three and if you want to
change your setup or move it that means
you've got to unscrew them from the ball
pack them up with you and go along it
makes you always the headset is perfect
and especially for me when your eyes do
presentations I couldn't imagine trying
to do this for all the different person
tations sessions I've got to end up
going on to do and just so I'll show you
later how simple this is just plug it in
and go right details it's all about the
details now you know system price wink
dollars because when originally wrote
this deck that was all-american it's now
in the attic UK's butts call come down
so you got the high-end range with the
Samsung that's about 500 550 pounds now
to buy and they it is seen as the
premium headset as well so really nice
rigid body design they have
antibacterial pads so you can which you
can detach put into the washing machine
and they know that keep all my ting
clean it's a fogging stuff the another
way to adjust the sensors for different
eye levels so if you've got a really
wide distance between your eyes is
called the IP deal that eats into
prepared distance try saying after a few
pints it's not gonna happen
but it can allow you adjust all the rest
are all fixed and you're just it through
software so that's like the really
highest end and then the price had come
down from there the Acer which I've got
is around Cape around 200 pounds or 250
ish now and if you go to the right place
if you're buying with a PC it's even
cheaper if I think with some pcs I've
seen you guys to get the headset
practically for free so it's worth
shopping around for deals and things now
the resolution this is high it's almost
double of what is for the current the
current generation of virtuality
headsets are there today analysis CS the
other money headset manufacturer
and come up with their better ones but
they're still going but how priced
higher than what these are but
occasionally for your entry-level
headsets you're getting a very high
resolution that's like a 3k resolutions
14 foot 2800 by 1600 or 1440 per eye
effectively and that's an extremely
crisp present resolution especially if
you're reading text or looking at things
from a distance about the only negative
thing can see is the fact that all
current generation VR headsets out
aptitude once placed go are Fresnel lens
which means you get a perfect view if
your eyes are dead center off center
gets blurry or if you're looking right
off to your right but what your fun is
majority of your experience you use and
the ones that your play is once the
headset on you can see fine you only
ever a little looking forward you're not
really looking on the car nearby because
that's how you drive the VR experience
they have a base refresh rate of 90 here
so it's key to make sure it keeps it
fast keeps it free if you drop it the
base resolution and the wrong things are
basically it's 60 Hertz that's what the
low-end entry-level PC so you can
actually run all these headsets on off a
laptop if you wish fairly medium spec
laptop but a left fairly good a little
good laptop run run this off a PC just
because again the only connections you
need is a HDMI and a USB 3 but they're
both fairly modern connections your Sony
Bluetooth and that's there also modern
Bluetooth so if you move bluetooth north
to it you need a good bluetooth adapter
all the things they tell you about and
within the experience themselves was
already a wide range of experiences
there's also the ones built into Windows
itself they're the native from Windows
10 mixed reality applications in which
the stories growing at about five a week
everyone just keeps throwing more stuff
on there but not to be outdone the fact
that find these are all on the Windows
Store who's using steam or steamvr he
says yes right so every title is
currently on Steam VR is also accessible
to Windows 10 because Microsoft
basically got hold of steam and said
right we want
something to make you work with us so
all the thousands of VR titles are
currently on Steam are also working on
mixed reality so from day one you've got
a huge array of content already out
there to play with if you're a consumer
if you're a developer it makes life even
easy because it means that you can build
for whichever SDK and you know you can
be able to hit everybody with it but
more on that later right so that's fine
if we consume and there's still the
consumer piece around the fact that
there's the headsets we can all get it
on this nice and easy
certainly by far the quickest settle
ever which will demonstrate in a bit but
how do you want to get started as
developers because also we want to build
solutions for these things so first and
foremost places the fact that is the
windows developer site which gives
getting all the tools information for
getting building building from mixed
reality now one issue something here's
that you're actually building a Windows
10 Universal app which means once you've
built it it's going to run on Windows 10
for the mixed reality it'll also ball on
hololens with zero effort elearn also
from an xbox there's no VXR works yet he
says don't ask me about that I can't say
anything getting started basically you
need to have a base with Windows 10 with
the full creators update installed which
now is actually live at the tumblr did
this it was still in certain preview boy
basically later make sure you meet feces
up to date and install Visual Studio and
that's it you know this visit windows
they don't make things difficult when
you're asleep building to these things
there's no extra software no sir tools
just need to have Windows 10 and Visual
Studio installed if you also want to
target hololens and the also you can
install the hololens ami later which
gives you a few extra little things
we're allows you to test across things
built in with the entire project and
ethanol's
is a full simulator so even if you don't
have a headset you can still test and
play with this
for a development piece II mean the
specs they can actually use for mix
rally sim cells are quite low ish you
need a core i5 Intel machine with about
eight Gege RAM and at least they say it
gtx 950 but basically a a 1050 or 1060
card is enough to run it develops spec I
probably recommend more like a JJ X 1080
and at least a core i5 with 16 gig or an
i7 realistic if we're doing development
work although saying that this PC which
cost me seven hundred pounds I filed
with 16 gig in it runs everything
perfectly so there's no big outline the
old huge expense when developers started
out with the the oculus or the vive land
you found that you need it like a
fifteen hundred or two grams PC just to
actually run the thing windows as Lisa's
brought that whole spec down so it's a
lot more accessible especially different
developers always say one thing that
they don't really state on their is make
sure you have an SSD don't travel on the
sort of physical drive it's just not a
good idea when you installed it in
Windows 10 is built into the mixed
reality development setup and simulator
and everything yeah it's all built into
the operating system you don't have to
install anything once you run it up you
have a full simulator built into the
actual tools themselves which will show
up show in a bit which gives you far
access to controlling for the headset
control from controllers in doing speech
input you know it all just works as you
pretty much would expect to enable the
simulator itself
you run the mix rally set up as you
would and then you simply have the
boxer's simulator it's not more
difficult than that this case we just
turn it on the PC will then switch over
to say right I'm not using the headset
I'm now using the simulator if you want
to go back you switch it back very
simple very easy by the only thing
you'll need is admin privileges but who
doesn't have that anyway I'll put that
on but hey so I say with the simulator
so it allows you to move around position
the headset do a lot of testing and it
gives you a wide range of things you can
do and
- the around but the only thing he can't
test for is walking off into the sunset
with wearing the headset and then being
dragged back because the cable snapped
your head back with the simulator I was
they just simulated it's just take keep
that in mind he says right so for a
building microsoft recommends using
unity I mean the SDK and the tools are
all built into Windows 10 the Windows 10
api's I am working with the mana game
team to try and get the whole mixer alex
is set up working for now but it means a
few tweaks to how money game works so
the primary development studio moves is
unity unity is also now built in full
support for Windows mixed reality so
again there's no additional set of a
test you simply target the YouTube you
don't repeat platform you go into the
settings for virtuality and so right I
want Windows mixed reality and that's it
I mean you don't have to be install
anything else at that point because it
just works it's all built into unity and
it actually does work in though its
unity just nice we have a few little
things going wrong got the beginning but
it's all sorted now so if you're
actually using one the modern version
unity our unity 2017 - or 20 17.3 it
should all just work trademark should
right so if we're building for a virtual
right environment
there's several concepts you need to be
able to make get your head around for
when building these things first
foremost is gaze it's the primary thing
that most VR titles don't take account
of unless they're just a headset only
experience which is where is the user
looking what am I looking at where am I
actually interacting with objects based
on gaze if I launch up them the basic
virtuality experience within mixed
reality that's the default thing you
have so you can actually control
everything just by looking at it it's a
powerful thing which a lot of fellows
don't take a count off even if you use
murkland controllers it's taken account
of what am I looking at one of my
focusing on and within gaze within the
hop the whole API for Windows 10 you
know this is supported both on Holland
and
also what would classes the immersive
headsets on the mixed reality headsets
themselves it's perfect if they do like
actions on things I'm looking at or
doing something different because I'm
looking at it Mike's got a lovely
butterflies demo so you can control
specific butterflies based on which one
I'm looking at and do little things like
that the next thing which really stands
out the whole mixed valley to platform
is voice and window stays about the only
one that provides this you know Cortana
support in mixed reality by default so
you can actually provide speech based
commands for your fertility to
experience itself so you can do
different commands and different things
based upon what you're saying if you
think headed up with what you're looking
at say because I see this butterfly make
it fly and nothing flies without there's
no control nothing else it's just doing
it doesn't have to be the primary input
method but it can be a supplementary
want to assist or in gay to the
experience where it's going around it's
interesting to see the fact that a lot
of people are really shocked by this
when they actually start to talk to it
talk to their games or talk to projects
themselves actually the other main mode
of input now is these motion controllers
yes I'll admit they're not the prettiest
ones the world everyone keeps saying the
vibe ones are prettier well these are
generational devices and I can always
see if they're actually improving these
these could basically your left and
right hands controls and I to then have
directed input into the environment
there are buttons on these things
they're accelerometers for controlling
where it moves grr oh so tell what pose
you're holding they're handy and if
you've seen some really bad VR
experiences where your hand is shown you
know it's like contort around there cuz
you're twisting it around just things to
be aware of but they have an array of
inputs and how they work
there are grab controllers there are
trigger controllers unlike other VR
headsets oh well these will have both
touch paths everyone can have a look at
these later and also a thumb stick most
of the controllers only have one or both
the one of those we should say which
gives you a wider range of input you can
do and
the controllers recognized what you're
doing in is interesting in fact if you
actually just sit in this and that's
Lewis look at control look at the
controller well it's just in the cliff
house when the very beginning you can
see all the different things also
looking at ways to overlay actions on
the controllers you'll see a lot of VR
solutions actually use the control
itself as an input so you can actually
shoot at the controller and do something
else the Google Earth via Google Earth
VR solution as handles this brilliant
where you hold the controller up to your
face you then look at Street View oh if
you shoot you Hanlon Street View and in
and out and things so don't look at
these as simply your hands you go look
these as fully interactive devices on
how you're building into these
experiences so you look along the way
these different things work when we're
building experiences is that all things
mix relative really brings to fold is
the fact that we're not just looking at
3d or immersive content even see them 2d
it can actually build a full 3d virtual
office having 2d screen you can have a
2d screen up on one wall and move around
you can pin things around a virtual
environment and actually have those as
screams I think and some of the demos
might have done they've seen oh well I
can run my entire office just in VR so
here's my outlook here's PowerPoint is
coming Excel spreadsheets I wouldn't
share my too long or his videos and
things like that I mean what one big
powerful experience of this is there's a
full video wall player where you can
look at simple 2d movies or they can
direct yourself into an immersive 3d
experience and just taken over the
environment so beyond the 2d is the foot
then the fully immersive experience is
where you're taking yourself out of the
world and into your own generated
environment where they're floating
through space or whether you're actually
is walking along construction site but
as far as the tether will take you you
know you get a three meter tether with
this if you're looking can actually good
a good extension cable with that but
building these environments themselves
is that there's no right or wrong to say
you have to have one or the other look
at both look at different ways to
actually build the experience of the
environment when looking at these
solutions it's not just a one-stop-shop
of a little soy sauce shooting game you
know pan it out and see what all the
experiences are going to be throw into a
project
says throwing casually right so when you
actually want to get started several
resources there you can actually just go
direct to unit to yourself and just get
started all there are several projects
and github it's a gay going quicker or
all the websites themselves
one of the biggest resource is the mixed
reality toolkit or formally known as a
whole hollow toolkit and this provides
you a full engaging interactive
experience of how to build mixed reality
solutions but they've also gone beyond
that they actually allow to give
different mechanisms and different ways
and show you different ways actually do
things within a project self when you're
actually reaching out with the motion
tell how do you grab an object how do
you make is the fact that when you grab
it is is it snap to it a fix to your
hand or is it actually a spring joint to
actually does follow you or can you
throw it in can you not and all the lots
of different experiences of how you can
actually control all the different
inputs and mechanisms that are in this
control and in this project there's a
lot of work going on with this the only
downside with the mix right Ito kit
today is that it's only four that makes
rally headsets so when you're looking at
a cross-platform solution it means
you're gonna build one and build another
he says there are all they're all talk
it's called the there's the virtuality
toolkit which i would have recommended
up until last week until the developer
said he's not going to stop building or
investing anymore
but actually in conjunction with the
mixed reality teeler actually looking at
what helping build a multi-platform
solution into the mixed royalty toolkit
so it's not just a build once and
throwaways build wantin and extend it
and build it to other platforms we're
saying that the wing that when Microsoft
has also entered in so the the open VR
open Excel project where you can build
it for an open API and it will work in
any headset so there's a lot of other
things that coming down the line but the
first thing foe must mean is I get to do
he's actually getting there start
building these experiences building
these applications and how you're
actually going to full evolve these
things there are a load of videos on
Microsoft build for then
building mixed reality solutions I think
Mike's you've got several blog posts and
things for actually having to do things
and these are great for getting you
started forgetting you thinking giving
you ideas because the one biggest thing
with virtuality is is coming up the
ideas of what solution you're going to
do GDC have also posted a load of their
historical virtuality developer
conference videos online and you simply
look those up and they're fascinating
there was one where they were going
about in building immersive experiences
and once you do basically sat down and
built 400 prototypes they spent maximum
of four hours in each of them working on
what kind of things that can do and they
even they're like Mario game in VR and
changing is the fact that instead of a
2d presentation of looking at you just
got a a VR camera that's walking around
the player as you're playing with them
ask them meant for a seated experience
but it gives the world what you can
actually try and do and lots of
different things can try also don't be
afraid to actually borrow off anyone
else so looking what people have done
and thinking oh I could try and do that
actually another big source of
information is the max off site itself
they've got a huge catalog of array of
information including the whole Academy
series which teach you about building
mixed reality solutions there's a whole
course going through from start to
finish of how do I build something for
gaze how they're built into the motion
controllers how do I build something for
voice and so on and so forth
also looking at scale when you're
building these VR experiences within
your 3d solution scale is key help is
always at hand to those who wish to find
it and for this case of this they know
it's the hololens the foot the mixed
reality set help is all along hangar
Microsoft there was tons of experience
from loads of people actually building
experience in these things they've gone
through the realms of what is possible
what's not
there's also a good place to ask
questions if you ever get stuck as well
as Polly on get up on something other
virtuality help sites one of the things
everyone was into also twice slack
there's lots of slack channels now I
keep slacking off from work and people
aren't notice yet so it's quite fun
who's getting slack overload there's too
many channels and too much chat
everywhere and then someone hurts that's
why chitchat
thinking this like I suppose it for an
hour and come back in the torrid 40
messages nothing I was not gonna read
that who was time to read chitchat slack
chats
well anyway right okay so that's the
talk part of this the next part were to
go into demo things so anyone actually
only questions about building mixed
reality things or headsets and stuff ask
away
SATs gone be gone saw the question yet
every single additional visual studio
support is supported for developing
missionary mixer Alex experiences in
fact that's no that's not a trainee more
got enterprising that I always thought
always used to only have a run community
simply because I do VR tutorials or
develop YouTube tutorials and basically
the entry war always has to be the
lowest point for everybody so no matter
what version of visual studio running
except for v8 features here the code
there's no mix trail these plugins about
you but if using vision at vs community
which is free you know your Windows 10
you strolling your P City mostly free if
you'd bought it with a new PC you know
there's a zero I'll a cost of I'm going
to buy a headset or if you want to run
the simulator beforehand even unity
which is probably the easiest tool to
start getting buildings things is
completely free it's free let's get
started guys anyone else are new
questions or things yep yep
right okay so separating out what is VR
on what is Vidhan what is provided when
the head sets themselves VR itself when
you're actively playing it you'll notice
very little difference the end of that
it is still VR you know we're not
providing input into what's into the
real world you're given a boundary this
is your spec play space which is exactly
the same survive the only other
difference which people pick up it is
the tracking which I talked about
modulator
because this is an inside-out tracking
system so everything is built into the
headset okay
headset has two sensors looking forward
we're actually looking slightly down so
you look at it is that looking about
that way so it's tracking all the
controllers from my unit ivory arms
reach within your field of view I'm
picking you're paying that up with what
sensor date with subtly getting out of
the sense themselves for orientation and
snell so when it's in view you've got a
hundred percent confidence you know
exactly what's going on now the thing
most people then pick up on or saw going
it's not saying is that once I take that
out of view I can't see it now this the
SDK yet this is still getting full
sensor data of motion things ourselves
and as long as you're moving it's still
got perfect tracking but when it's
behind me if I stop moving then all of
those rotation and I won't see it again
until it comes out now what a lot of
people try to pick up ways that Oh what
I can't shoot from behind me I can't do
this and I'm sorry but it's all rubbish
because the end of the day the HD came
the API around is that it tells you if
it's in view if it's not and you'll find
99% of all the VIX prints you use your
hands are in front of you because you
need to see your hands to do whatever it
is you're doing but the few differences
are things like shooting games where I
need to be able to put me a hand over
here or I want to be able to put a
shield over here and do something out
over here and what you find is that all
the times that we showed earlier so I'll
go back to this a super heart involves
basically picking up objects and
throwing them in any direction it has
zero issues with this forward tracking
system because it knows the fact that if
it's in viewing and grabbing it's quite
if it's throwing over that way it knows
right my hands gone off that when it's
throwing in that terrain your direction
and
gonna let go enough so it doesn't need
to know exact track and when it's Dex
you'd simply throwing it space pilot
trainer which is one that is a really
fun to have this so you can try it today
if you want has two guns and yes she's
shooting all different direction things
has zero problems with it being out of
view because again it notes the fact
that fits in view I've got full tracking
total control can rely on the centers if
it's out of view then I'm relying on the
movement and controlling the track in
the egg-cam would tell you nine percent
of time exactly what it's doing and go
where it's going when when I actually I
recently went to had a vibe my next door
knob I had one in like nicely but lent
it to me and after about two hours of
setting up the beacons which is not fun
I can tell you is that yes perfect
firing all back into until one of my
children walked in front of the beacon
and that the SDK is basically went oh
and my arms sony flung over I was
actually paying a space game where I had
to maneuver myself around the space
station pulling my arms back into and
something one of my arms especially
floated up into space and where's it
going because in the vive SDK when
you're building those solutions it does
not tell you when it loses tracking of
that controller your hundred-percent
reliant on it's a perfect tracking he's
gonna work until he doesn't and then it
goes free clear one of my children was
also playing there's a nice free game
called Star Wars droid repair Bay now
that's nice little tool where basically
all you have it till at the grippers and
he fixing droid great until he was
having problems that were adjusting the
vibe because it's a much different way
of holding on to your head and I went
over to go and help him and do it
vive them went I've lost tracking and
then they're winning regain tracking the
controllers were backwards and I
couldn't fix it until I turned it all
off and turn it back on again
granted some of these are fairly rare
experiences simply cause if you're
running a vibe where you've running an
oculus when you're mounting your beacons
you're meant to put them above head
height which means you do have to fix
them really to a wall I was using them
on microphone
still quite high but you could block it
if you haven't really up higher they
don't has many issues but they do an
issue is the fact that if you walk in
front of it it freaks out
where's these I've only had one occasion
went freaked out and that's because my
kid had dropped a control and it rolled
on the floor and it couldn't work out
exactly where it's sensitive so I picked
it up and passed it to him
now if we have time I suggest everyone
have a quick try let's now show you this
in the demo the inside-out tracking for
these controls themselves is spot-on
I mean into real world okay so I can
leave them on the counter walk up to
them and pick them up I mean with the VR
headsets on not looking in these
controllers you know it is perfect is it
well not make perfect as close to
perfectly it's going to get it
realistically I've also used this in
various light conditions there's a few
different videos and things and one
video I recommend watching is there's a
child called mixed reality TV on YouTube
and he's basically done no Tommy reviews
on these he's even because you can plug
this up to a fairly good laptop taking
it outside although he does demo on a
car park I would not recommend trying
this on a car park because you know like
a bring down by a logic downside of
being outside but you didn't live very
for things thereby the only situation
didn't work in was on grass because
wherever the inside-out tracking is it
didn't like grass for whatever reason
maybe confuse it for weed I don't know
it just didn't like it but hard surfaces
it basically coned off an area set it up
and that was it is walking outside until
the battery died and they realized maybe
we should have brought another battery
anyway any other questions
right so comfort obviously when you
wearing these headsets themselves
there was a various degree of how people
of perceive these so the vibe in the
oculus are fairly weighty there are a
couple of pounds and when they're
sitting on your head all the weight is
on the front even we got the straps
nothing else balanced out so if you're
getting just right he might be okay but
you still have a limited lifespan
because it is fairly waiting again we're
in the
right I tell them to come pick this up
because when I had this delivered I even
wondered if it was in the box this thing
weighs next to nothing
look at the truck dropping it and I've
had zero I've had kids playing this for
about eight hours and they didn't notice
now okay fine kids they're quite
energetic so I had the in-laws at the
in-laws round and put it on them and
it's case of they couldn't feel it so
these profile later much long much more
a long time twice for playing it the
only Asli got has taken account the fact
that at the end of the day you've got a
tiny screen right pointing at your eyes
so the only thing you might conquer is
like some eye strain one of the good
thing is the fact that these work
perfectly glasses and notes a lot of
people's but the volume is not too bad
but the the oculus rift is a bit pushy
you against the head see hungry wear
glasses with it comfortably these no
problem my daughter wears glasses and
she it's fine for most of time except
when she has a headache apparently my
game really interferes with having one
bright light shining in your eyes some
reason but from compromise there's
something the most comfortable the next
one with the vibe itself and then the
rift beyond that is a bit heavier there
are some other newer heads that's coming
out which offer 8k resolution brown with
a little bit more waiting so you always
got to say wait into account how long
you can use these things but this is
certainly by far the most comfortable
thing next with Holland yeah
right so mixed reality relates to the
family of devices so it's a command
return that covers everything from
hololens to this
now these generation on devices you know
there is no via their side the note AR
there's no alternative reality there's
no camera looking out what the sensors
tracking is it's you basically exactly
exactly the same sensors are in the
hololens just two of them and what this
is tracking is light and depth all the
crusts have seen there you're looking
out and it will recognize and remember
the environment you've set it up in most
the time it's actually quite good in the
way recognize the cells and like and
most of the experiences you can either
set up for a seated experience where
you're not tracking you're sitting down
although you can't stand up and move
around doesn't stop you or you can
Spacely set up for the walk-around
experience or the room scale where
basically then trace out an environment
and have it set up now I was actually
quite surprised when I tried the vibe
you still have to do that even though
you've got beacons which tell you that
this is my physical space this is where
a walk you still have to tell it well
this is where I can actually walk around
my environment when you setting up the
other thing I got really confused with
with the vibe is that if you set it up
for standing and walk around then fine
use the headset you walk around don't
know one way around this was confusing
if set up for a room scale you use the
controller to set up your environment I
mean as long as it knows where the
headset is if you sit still for sitting
down then you have to use a headset and
a tape measure don't ask I had I spent
five minutes looking around for a tape
measure and said right tell me how high
off the floor the headset isn't like
this B yeah it works so there is no real
world present in there in these units
today not to say another generation
won't actually add something I have seen
some experience where they've actually
paired it up with like a mighty leap
controller
and other things to have like hand
tracking as things are that which
reminds me right
who's heard of the void right before
y'all gone tonight on your phones Google
the void I was a Bing the void says
basically the void is a fully immersive
interactive experience which is well
there's one done in London they velcro
look my nice great little session based
around Star Wars characters me muster
sponsored them they've also got units in
California and two to two in the states
and the setting were elsewhere
what they've done is they built a custom
VR headsets patio with some like my gel
magic leap sensor for hand tracking
they've also paired with a body shock
suit and they have a fully immersed
tracked environment in VR and what this
effectively means is the fact that they
paired up the actual real world with a
VR headset and I can mention with the
with the inside-out tracking on these is
something quite easy to do just to take
that as a little step further except for
the cable these are on tethered
experiences so when you actually walk up
to a wall in their environment it's
actually they're in the virtual
environments you reach out you can touch
and feel these things in so much the
fact that they've got one of those big
robot the big and robots out they've got
in force awakens thing was I can
actually be taught you can touch it and
whack it on the head as it's hooked to
most people who've tried for experiences
I've gone into that and they've come out
speechless even the pros so Google it's
Bing Bing Bing the hook so it's a six
that's up later and simply look at the
void and look at the video it's
themselves it doesn't do itself justice
because we've got the virtual rounds we
just virtual bookcase of Europe a
powerful vibration nearly controls
you're not gonna free old feedback sent
in the world with the hololens you've
got the real world so it can go off and
see and touch it and do things with it
but if I put a 3d model in space you
know I put my hand through it they've
gone completely other way in the fact
that even some words the fact that I
actually have a steam vent so in the VR
you'll see this huge fire you walk near
it actually you actually feel
the heat coming off this thing it's hard
to express just what it is it just shows
the bounds of waiting go with virtuality
and what you can do with it if you
really think beyond or outside the box
or in their case put you in the box then
puts a lot of things in with it with you
anyway god yes we're there
well the end of their mixed reality is
over off your Windows 10 PC so yes
although I'd stock up with to mix Carly
to control it in your hand and wonder
where the phone would go in there maybe
it starts sellotape it around the head
you know the only if you're going to
phone in yes you can now ask me out off
streaming services and things like that
because the end of day you have your
cable you're tethered today although we
are now seeing wireless VR solutions
starting to sort of bubble up vive I've
got one coming out and I think
everyone's finger oping it's not going
to be just the five so we can plug
anything else into it along with the car
battery you'll have to structure your
back to be able to run the entire thing
but here the question is about how the
real world plays a role in mixed reality
now this comes back to the fact that
mixed reality is a family it goes from
Tara spectrum of the augmented reality
of the verb the hololens all the way up
to the virtuality in between now where
the physical think I'm glad to into it
with mixed reality realistically is
you're going to walk into walls you are
in a virtual world but you know you work
at you're working in the physical
presence in its sense rather the mixed
fancy family itself is today we've got
hololens
and we've got mixed the VR diminishing
or the vp our side of that that isn't as
he showed fault is the entire range and
there's hold to said the fact that
future devices may actually have more of
a presence in the world to augment into
the virtual or coming from augmented
into the virtual
the hololens does a fantastic job this
assault but then again who's got five
grand sitting in their back pockets go
get a headset on and walk around it is a
whole price range to do things but it
gives you the opportunity to look at how
you want to build these things into it
so said to somewhere else in the break
is that
say you wanted to take the headset a
laptop and walk around the warehouse so
you got a virtual world and you're
walking around but the only thing has
stopped you is the actual physical world
so there's nothing to stop using things
like the dispositional dead reckoning or
all the kind of little technologies to
say right I find another scheme of this
at this house I've got some
architectural drawings away and this is
how it's physically laid out I can work
off your actual physical position
because the phone the laptops got GPS
I'm using a positional dish dead
reckoning so I'm using the Magna
magnetosphere of the building and how
I'm position so far know where I am so
it's not a story from your any release
were actually changing how the world is
we're walking around it in the virtual
world and you could do them but yeah
that's setting up your actual
limitations of where you can walk and
that's the same as other any other very
environment is that they give you a
actual physical space you can walk
around it for what's called room scale
so allowed you says what I can actually
interact with this entire virtual world
within this space beyond the space your
used techniques of what called
teleporting a good quick dipper over
that where instead of walking there I'm
actually simply going to say right put
me there and then your 3d view moves one
of the key things you'll find especially
start to do VR development how you move
is extremely important because you have
this little thing of the fact that you
anyway in your eyes and your brain goes
if they don't agree you're gonna throw
up
so if you take someone in VR and then
hurtle in 100 miles an hour you will
almost instantly throw up because your
brain goes oh I'm not moving but I'm
going at home to miles nowhere that's
not right and it gets really disoriented
it's some people having really badly
some people don't so there are a lot of
techniques you learn and through via
when you doing V aren't developed of how
to move to player in a way that's
comfortable or doing lotta little all
the tricks we're putting things in the
scene where your eye can fixate on this
but so it doesn't notice the right
you're actually walking and moving or
not going as fast as that
I think one of the toolkits they
actually have a mechanism where every
step you take is - which is fine but if
you can make it three your stop
it's a strange but anyway let's get on
to demo them right if anyone wants to
get started this the rosacea nice little
workshop built right built for getting
you started into this and it gives you
all the setups were actually getting
into it all the tools setting Malone
little Virant having some play with some
in things and that leads your mentor so
there's the whole mixed reality or
hololens academy which teaches that all
these things in more detail this is like
a ten-minute run-through of i've got up
i've put on some 3d content i'll throw
me a headset on and i'm in the world and
gives you some nice little too sharp
tricks of well if you put yourself too
big this is what happens if your grates
are too small this is what happens drop
someone in the middle of a cliff when
you can walk through it and it's fine
but anyway I shall leave that up as I
move over so setting this thing up so as
I said when you installed Windows 10
fold create a kit you get to the lovely
little app got the mixed reality portal
I forgot that word this is thing that
gives you both access to the virtual
environment it also give you access to
the simulator and also access to store
lots of things you could pull this over
here so you got a lot of things here and
so we've got like developers stuff down
here so I can use the simulation parts
again all built into the tools nothing
else to install you want to start
simulating turn them on I'm not going to
do that cuz then spend the next five
minutes reconfigure in base PC great but
when we get silk so when we get setup so
I've got when you start this up I've
plugged into my PC I got my headset I've
got my controllers these these are
basically Bluetooth adapters so exactly
same thing as everyone else you just
pair it to your PC and it's done the
updating of these is handed
automatically so every time you start on
the portal it checks to make sure you
run in the right version of firmware and
both controls on the headset if it's not
updated
does it fool you fun but you saw enough
the headset itself and you then given a
choice so if you put the headset on
you'll get this lovely nice little set
of experience where I can say sitting up
first sitting down or standing you're so
sitting down but yeah you can stand up
and still move around or basically won't
stop you from going anywhere
won't give you a need limitations he
says for that state give setting you off
its case off you tell it I'm sitting
down it goes right where's your headset
don't the same set of experience on the
vine the oculus says about 10 minutes
between pairing your sensors get your
things set up measuring the floor make
sure you have a tape measure ready
things like that this nothing they've
got the rooms file experiences and
there's only two questions this things
can ask you is one where's your star
point so it's going to first ask you
where's your Center so I'm gonna say
there's the head sir
I could be holding it but doesn't matter
all that's to do to make sure there's
enough light and there's not distance so
you know if I put this up against the
wall
go go and that's no good star point so
hold it over here okay
so that's my star point then I'm going
to tell it how far around the room can I
go now this is measuring not just you
know physically where it can bump into
walls yeah y'all have got this cable so
how long is your cable mine's a bit
longer than what you'd normally have and
also there's a do this goes basically as
the demonstration shows you could just
have to walk around your room now you do
have to do this with the vibe and all
the environments but two K's off what
this is going to do Dada Dada
we set up get back to beginning there
you and don't and that's it that's my
time virtuality settle don't ya that's
now in the porters wall soaking the nice
little previewer so you can see the
world and now this is going to get
tricky but that setup had a very small
head now unfortunately I can't see the
microphone but I can see these
controllers you'll notice the fact
that's I just walked up to those and
simply pick them up because they're
positionally tracked perfectly in the
real world and how I move these around
you see the shadows as well look oh my
back this will say if it's moving 0
issuing grabbing this if I do this and
hold it still then here I actually work
there you go and this gives you full
walk-around of what this is now this
leave I'm that you starting up here
there is what's called the cliff house
I've got a few here give me a huge
desktop clothes that I've had headsets
on the kadosh use control this with
voice and microphone as well so you can
see and just simply move around this
nice view of Mount Rainier from the
distance there shave a few millimeters
off then give us an actual walk around
and this will talk about your two ways
of walking around river so I can fish
them to walk around without tripping
over the cable as I get towards where
the edge of my boundary is you can see
this nice little box appears that says
watch out you're about to walk into
something also this reacts as well to
your control is not just the headset
itself so you can see here this is
telling me I'm penetrating my boundary
sounds good so that gives me a space you
can walk around here but I so then we
got all the motions of I'm gonna share
my still pointing in the crowd all the
modes of locomotion well can actually is
the controller so then teleport around
and that simply jumps you from one place
to another within the virtual
environment
I told you around
they can go down to like this muck nice
house my favorite experience here's my a
300 foot TV who's got one of these in
their house I know our house was great
I even got a sofa but I would not
recommend sitting in it
I don't need to guess why I can sit in
this but one thing it is I can also yeah
that's when you throw on the floor need
to adjust my floor really ah but a can't
put on table because it's not there he
says but it's great because the another
feature this fact out which is different
to the vibe in the oculus is that if I
want to focus on an app or an experience
I simply need to teleport to it and it
will move me to the actual perfect
sitting or viewing location for whatever
it is it's fun a dorm so this cool whoo
I'm not wearing that one cuz it's not
good now if you want a nice love you how
about watching a 300 foot TV at night I
know a lot of people spent a lot of time
- sitting in this virtual cliff house
and looking around it was quite good
specialist I was going night see so it's
daylight in my living room - at night in
my actual cinema room haha he says we're
going and this room is set up who moved
my photos now that's not good
know what everyone start photos okay
let's move that back on the wall you can
the good thing about this is another
thing that goes wrong with this is the
fact that within the virtual environment
itself this has got world space tracking
of so if I put this thing on the wall
here it remembers where it is within
this cliff house the cliff house gives a
good example hey your order okay haha
doing something this place up if I
probably say that it's gonna stay there
and every summer room my virtual
environment yeah it's gonna put things
exactly where they are where they are
the same thing instead of hololens
except it does that with the real world
so there's a lot of similarity between
these and my kids have moved to Hong
Kong there is this
yeah yeah look who's been with my
Holograms the lizard on a bike here we
go have some fun things
my daughter giggled it giggled profusely
when she saw this hello I was changing
color haha the other thing they'll think
this gives us his full access to
everything on a Windows 10 desktop as I
said this is both the 2d and a 3d
immersive environment it - let's see I
can go go actually go and browse the web
pull up somewhere and go and search for
something I can go and browse the store
but also you get access to all the 3d
apps and things you say so have a look
Oh Alex explores not great oh yeah
there's one up I recommend to anyone to
troll it's lost image so when you launch
a 3d immersive application itself is
going to take you from that 2d world
into the fully immersed 3d environments
you can see them starting off there's a
little bubble and giving you a nice
little presentation of where I am in the
space station this is usually two things
so if I didn't have these controllers
this also works with just gaze but as
I've activated these things look there
are others display station there we go
welcome to the International Space
Station everyone and if any I'd get hold
of these headset there's great thing
about this is there's lots of videos
nice l'Ã©ducation n't and this is what
you look like in for zero-gravity hair
great anyway let's go back out of that
gonna see it's quite a free-form
experience themselves one thing just
something to know the fact that for when
you're building through periodic
applications and you're building from
winners mixed reality by default you're
going to get one of these kind of poster
wall things which it's okay but it's no
exactly
immersive is it where you can also have
these 3d holograms this available to all
developers when they're published
ramifications all you need to have a
model associated with your project and
that's it will be it now that were
looking over there okay it's not like
one thing but as I said as well
you also have access to a full stay on
steamvr library so if I wanted to
da-da-da-da-da-da-da already know
updating Steve I know it's up to date I
updated it just before it came out not a
wise move but hey it worked huh Nikki so
actually I've already got several VR
titles there now apart from installing a
an app which basically says this is the
Windows mixed reality for steamvr like a
little extension to steamvr that's it I
don't have to do anything else it just
works so any steamvr Title II will
automatically launch steamvr want you in
the cliff house ready and waiting they
often go I've been playing that for a
while now that is the only way to play
only if anyone here play elite
one-person VR is the only way to play
this game hands down if you want to try
and then you'll never play it the same
way again
blaming but there's also there's lots of
a lot of things here and I said the
Starwood Tori Perry's great you're
sitting there as a nice little droid
with two little arms and fixing droids
I'm watching the Empire and Nestle come
up and then shoot on your cruiser
nothing but basically the entire steamvr
libraries are working now what steam
have also done is within their within
their store they've also added a Windows
mixer LZ category for VR which I now
can't find there we go
no dearth today today there are some
titles which for whatever reason don't
but basically they've added this mixed
reality category which basically means
these were all approved and definite
work the ones that don't work a very odd
so one game which I tried on a vibe
spiral prologue downward spiral prologue
which is fantastic a neo in space move
moving around I run in a mixed reality
and it wouldn't well the game would star
well you couldn't do anything as if it
was waiting for you to press a ball but
you didn't know what it was so the old
things where it doesn't work but
generally speaking ninety ninety-five
percent all the titles are on steamvr
will just work because the adapter works
the ones that Dallas is just so few
little tweaks and it's dead easy to fix
so when you're building titles for mixed
reality it's dead easy I shall hang back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
