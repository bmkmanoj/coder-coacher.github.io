of tends to four GS is like maybe a
quarter of what four times slower than
what you can do with native CUDA and
Python stuff but still it's good good
performance so I'm not betting but I'm
sticking a lot of my energy and effort
into this future direction I'm see
eighty percent of my time right now I'm
actually focusing on learning can't
answer for also learning machine
learning and the kinda cool thing is a
sort of motivation from me there to
learn this stuff what to interview in at
school your trainer line up my
mathematics it's kind of really boring
and dry because you're not seeing any
practical use for it so what I'm doing
is I'm learning this machine learning
course and I'm also playing around with
tencel 40s and I saw higher level to see
what I can do and then that I get that
concept I don't understand now that more
it beats me to go on back and look at
the maths and Wikipedia no I want a
warning when you start looking at some
of these terms machine learning and
you're going to Wikipedia you really
quickly get into 20 tab grab a hold deep
of terms and you still that's like it's
like looking at a fractal all these
terms you can go down and down down and
down down
but it's mummy it's really stimulating
so there's good news and bad news here
for you guys you guys are probably a lot
weaker at maths compared to the people
that are doing machine learning at the
moment but you guys JavaScript
experienced an application development
give you much big advantage in those
guys so all those people are moving want
again to the web from path and I don't
have to relearn how to do JavaScript
application development you guys if you
want to get their stuff you have to look
at the maths and and there's gonna be
hard if you guys want to you can't just
casual again to their stuff you have to
think okay one night a week or three
nights a week for an hour yes I saw
office like through roughcast I walls I
mistake some doesn't so in order to
actually help me in my learning process
are on in this whole deep learning
journey I create a desk or server for it
and actually for people in Google about
you have joined the server this is a
discourse
for 10 to the 4 GS and just kind of
interesting discussions going on because
a lot of these these concepts and stuff
that scan our country key but yeah it
does what about linking me up about this
desk or server this is a tensor for GS
website there are some interesting
examples that there are the Kenard high
level and there's a lot of advanced
concepts in them that you know would
take you a few months to figure out how
was actually going on lower level but
the libraries itself is kind of high
level them a lot of the the algorithms
and stuff for machine learning and for
various shapes of artificial
intelligence applications are built into
the library and they're becoming more
and more like the Python version of
1040s so for example Python has support
for inverting a matrix whereas Java
Script one doesn't have that yet and
what the light actually does it has you
can do all the stuff in a CPU as well as
a GPU and never of a library that
manages all the calculations on the GPU
and the code is kind of hairy because
it's the the actual library tends to 4GS
is having to manage a lot of were level
details and operations on the GPU
translated sort of from JavaScript and
what it does internally is that has a
big string Boulder and it builds up
shader programs and make sure things
like that and gets stuff to run in GPU
but anyway a lot of stuff is actually
can be headed for you from you and you
can do as long as you understand the
mathematics and the models you can do
machine learning applications in a
browser running on the GPU they're also
working on North GS support so you can
run the same calculations on GPU you can
run all the CPU stuff on the nodes but
not the GPU yet
so that the tools are actually really
really well-written
there used to once in deep plunge es
we're not quite as good as these ones
but they've done a really good job here
there's a lot of there's quite a few
Google employees are work on us library
I created one just to just to play
around for difference different things
and the one the deep learning examples
were using rows and rows of Phi or
something like that I don't like using
birds by using webpack so I took one of
their examples to to test for a
quadratic equation and Android webpack
way to import it and I used I used
typescript so before the deep one jet
library you know in a few months nobody
asks yeah but no it was actually called
deep lunge yes nobody look here but just
to give you guys a lot about history
because you there's about history with
me you guys and deep lunge yes before
the library was called deep learn and
everything was underlined in space DL
but whatever it was and then never the
new library its pencil for and the
import is no just that's actually split
onto 7m p.m. modules it's just at tensor
for I need widest replace to get the the
new pencil for one versus the deep one
one I just replaced DL with TF and then
you can use all of the library features
so just to give you an example of what a
typical machine learning thing looks
like an intensive or I'll just take you
through the first tutorial here and
explain what it's doing so I'll skip
this bit here but the low-level building
walks what what tensors are these things
called tensors which are basically
multi-dimensional arrays and they're
immutable sort of when immutable
straight the box you can you know and
then so a typical problem the machine
learning is trying to find the patterns
two things
whether it's be classifying emojis or in
this example fitting a quadratic
equation ax squared plus BX plus C Jen
remember that from from high school then
I don't know what quadratic equation is
CV cigar y-axis in x-axis and you draw a
line just regular line so for example
this is this is a what I mean this is
not a high performance application this
is just like the CPU could run there's
no problem this this training example
but it's just to show you can I however
what the library library does of this
course on my Bitcoin share price use up
here I can't see anyway today was a bit
of a wild one for a Bitcoin ready so
here a chart that we we know is an ax
squared plus BX plus C and that's
definitely more than you read nor if
you're looking at me using machine
learning in our real-world application
but this is a simplify thing so we've
got all these points here and what we
want to do is we wanna train a machine
learning program to work with the real
data on what the coincidence are for
that equation so a B and C for the
quadratic equation so what you do if
tensor for here is you create these
variables and these aren't immutable
variables and they're sort of magically
updated well you train the model and and
you eat yours in JavaScript so these are
the you create these variables
JavaScript and and these will be used
throughout the application and this as
you train it and the way the e train the
application should create this thing
called a production function and a loss
function so what we do here is some this
is a prediction
so it takes an a value and then it
multiplies it by the constants here and
there are national Asian initialized at
random its star so for example this will
be ABC with a random number and the
reason that we have to wrap it and say
this tensor for scalar things that we
can't connect commits to a tenser and
tenser is a thing that tends of for
manatees in the GPU and all that kind of
stuff for you
so these all these things that are
tensors are sort of running on a GPU
because much quicker and this prediction
function takes in a value and then
multiplies this tensor up of operations
these all the operators upon GPU or CPU
depending on whether you specify that on
the CPU or CP isn't available and it
gives you an output value and then well
it does in the tutorial if you run on
your laptop or plot the line so for this
one it's not being trained I'll give you
a line that doesn't fit the data that
then you go into this what's chaining
the models so you have to create these
different things a loss function which
compares the actual value versus predict
put that leader value and then you
create an optimizer function which then
changes but the variables in a certain
way in this case is called gradient
descent it's a tournament you'd get onto
and week two of the machine learning
course the free one creating the same
basically what this is a tries to find a
point where your error function gets a
lowest point and it says that's that's
the value and that can work for any as
much dimensions as you want so they have
this statistic sort of stuff where you
find them a lot of click commonly this a
lot of the stuff intensive for is they
use normal patterns within machine
learning and those patterns are the same
whether it's Python JavaScript or
whatever
just there's a lot of research papers
have been taking you know this decades
and decades of research that have
basically come up with a lot of these
things so yeah there's loss functions
compares predictions to the values from
your model and then you have this
optimizer function in this case for this
example we're using something called
using descent or stochastic gradient
descent and you have a chaining look so
you have this thing training in the
browser for like five seconds or
something like that and it keeps
adjusting the values of the variables
until it finds a loss function is
reached a minimum and it says this is
the coefficients of the equation that's
the simplest example decently that ISIF
are learning the later examples and it's
gone to images just how to look at a
number and how to classify a handbrake
number into actual error I'm still
learning how that works there's a lot of
stuff on to do the convolution there's
some good videos on YouTube explain what
convolution does and not sure what this
is it looks for patterns within lighters
and from what I understand as a sort of
groups these patterns and gives you a
probability of what number that hand
rating was but I think I see em so it's
gonna new stuff it's been doing for 10
years it's but it's a fashion you know
because I want to be you know people
thought these conferences are not really
talking too excited about you know way
Bluebell and stuff like it's all a I so
I want to be part of that a future
that's why I'm that's why I'm basing a
lot of time and stuff so anyway this in
this case here you have your this is
what's this training it so you have them
the real values of x and and and the
real values of Y and then but you don't
know what they you don't know what the
coins that the variables are and what
what happens here is and it's optimized
a function you check the loss of
the equation above and you adjusts the
variables for this is making sense it's
not easy
so any once you tree in this thing you
end up with coefficients that minimize
the loss function for the quadratic
quadratic equation and actually it will
find out the constants for you that's
really all they wanted we talked about</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
