did you
we good
hey how's it going everyone welcome to
Kotlin London the kind of pusher
addition my name is Alex I work here at
pusher I'm just here to do a few
housekeeping notes before I pass she
wants Enzo who's the organizer and
before I do that I actually just thought
of interest who here has heard of pusher
before just by show of hands also like
very few people actually so it's really
great to have you here if you haven't
heard of pusher as most of you clearly
haven't and you want to learn a bit more
basically we're a developer tools
company we spend most of our time and
energy focusing obsessing about building
amazing developer experiences as well as
tools and api's that help programmers
like you and O's focus on the problems
their importance our applications our
main product is called channels and it's
a real-time API it helps you build
real-time features into your
applications it's essentially a pub/sub
API which is like it will just scale
infinitely of your application basically
but what's really interesting and the
kind of things that rotating on the
screen actually is the over the last two
years since I joined the company we've
been doing kind of like a lot of
research and development we obviously
acquaint better than developer
communities we talk to all our customers
and we're constantly kind of looking for
patterns and trying to identify problems
that programmers frequently face and two
things that we've noticed a lot over the
last couple of years is developers
building chat since their applications
as well as push notifications and so two
of our main products the first one is
called chat head and it's essentially a
library it's got Kotlin library you can
install and it gives you all the basic
building blocks for building chats into
your application things like typing
indicators read receives who's online
lists all these kind of things it makes
it super easy to build chat into your
app so you can focus on the things that
are kind of unique to your application
push notifications very similar it does
present 410 pretty much is a developer
API developer API
API of sending push notifications to
both Android and iOS devices the rear
not going to talk about them very much
but the main reason I mention them is
that all of our new SDKs for Android a
built in Kotlin which i think is pretty
cool so yeah real quick and housekeeping
surf the kitchen is down there like help
yourself to peace if you haven't already
drinks from the fridge alcoholic or
non-alcoholic it's all good the
bathrooms down there as well the exit is
pretty much the entrance where you came
in but the door is not in Syria save if
you want to get out there's a button on
the left hand side you can press but the
best thing to do if you're struggling
just to ask someone we've seen people
get confuse of the door and it's not
good also by the door there are some
fire escape instructions which I
encourage you to read but along as short
of there's like yeah okay you like
cotton is pretty hot but it's very
unlikely we'll have a fire in that case
obviously we leave the building and
we're meant to solve Istanbul on the
corner of Clifton streets just around
the corner to the left and yeah that's
it from me let's introduce you to Enzo
who's going to introduce the meetup yeah
awesome thank you right very quick thank
you for coming have a meet up there's
more and more people very happy
well we have two talks as usual but
before just one thing so if you want to
be a speaker if you never be a speaker
before you want to try just came up last
me just tell us we are very open as a
community to get in new people so first
speaker is vector is a reason kasnia
introduced but is really in love with
Kathleen so he's basically passing his
night studying and is also now a
contributor of the standard cotton
library so kind of so they run the
prospero better
yep
hello can you hear me yep
I'll present
I will present to some worker that I did
on caught him as I said I actually heard
about cutting the first time three years
ago but I just started working on
Corinne
basically end of the last year and so
let's let's talk about the goal I don't
know how many of you have a okay so on
and so this talk will be my talk talk
about how to do a computer and okay this
has some information if you want to know
and in the innocence well let's talk
about go became very famously because it
was at the last game where the computer
was not able to beat a human and it was
predicted that was will take at least
another 20 years to computer to beat a
human but the last year Google with the
deep learning manager and this was a
quite big news that at the beginning
nobody we may wonder why since chess are
basically computer before it's
completely different
and this is at the world champion the go
and this is how they go keep me both
look smallest looks like in a play a
very quick introduction after alphago
and alphago was using on go and then
they apply us in several other games and
you can see resistant is the strongest
commercial go software
more or less in this area the bit above
3000 is the level of the Olympian this
number have a mall and then go did I
mean Google did the first version that
yeah but not exceptional and then he
again with the Li which it was like a
number three or four of the world and
then he went for the for the top and and
then on top of that they did another
version alphago see how that was still
stronger than the previous one and it
was also interesting because the old
version of alphago were basically
learning the deep learning path on play
I mean using all the human played before
but I forgot you know we started from
scratch so basically they trained at the
net on itself
but we took in another bit about the
planning at the end of the talk now
we'll go a bit more technical on the
details and why go is such a good game
and maybe I played that a play ago so
the very quick introduction who's of the
go I mean companion with any other white
stones and the other guy has the black
stones each Turner you put the stones on
the board and that's it and when you
have your stone completely surrounded by
the other colored stones a distance go
to remove and okay now you you know the
who's of God okay there is another who's
you cannot we have you cannot play the
same position that before
so the with one stone and then the other
can eat a back of the stone and go back
to the previous position that is
forbidden so you cannot do that but
apart from that I mean these tools there
are no other rules but the implication
are incredible
and so this is the first just to give
you so basically if we have a
disposition and someone put that the
black stone here the black stone our
killer all the white stones but if we
have a disposition
now this position you cannot put the
black the white stone here because it
will be automatically dead and there you
cannot even put it here but for the same
reason so any shape with that they are
called a technically I any shaper with
the two eyes is a unkillable two or more
than two eyes so it's alive
it's called any shape that has only one
eye is scalable and sometimes they have
those are called false highs like this
one because it seems like an eye but if
a white place on CMB then you can place
on a and the kill you will kill this
tree so this will be only one eye and
the kalos or the other one so all the
strategy of God is a to manage it to
have a grouper with two or more eyes and
this but is not actually whole is
something that emerge from the holes and
just for your reference this I mean
maybe you want to see later but a bit of
program that do take apart the first one
is a client a so it has no logic but you
can use it to play with other guys or a
play against an engine Patchi is the
strongest open source game Lilith jaha
is the new one which is basically based
on deep learning but is open source so
it's kind of a he doing what Google did
and I is really not like I think at the
beginning of this
was still weaker than party but probably
it will be stronger in the future and
the cozy stone is a commercial program
in the the strongest and those of
consistent now is switching to deep
learning and we tried to explain why and
instead the new go it was at the older
program so the only actually there was
something that I didn't tell you yet in
the go basically programmed aha
the older generation which is a new go
that is based on set of rules more or
less like the chess players then all the
others like Apache or resistance are
using strategy which is called Monte
Carlo tree search and we will see later
some code about that and then that was
that the current a bleeding edge until
Google came and now there is also the
deep learning strategy but the deep
learning is something that goes on top
of Monte Carlo tree search so it's not
that now there is a dis book in a mere
from Manning that basically explained is
quite a nice book how to do a kind of
alphago yourself and I when I see you
there was all this example in Python and
I thought well come on Python we can do
better we can do cotton so I what I did
basically is taking the code of this
book translated in Cortland that was one
and then improving on the cotton impart
and this is a one I think quite
interesting point so left is Python
right is cotton and is almost identical
it's quite impossible I mean it's not
some trivia code
the code is one of the most complicated
piece of code and it has a lot of ifs
and it's really really and I mean so far
I was considering Python the easiest and
cleanest computer language but I think
Khatri now is still better because it's
all source types so you can really help
you with Python sometimes really
difficult to understand which type is
expected or something like that and just
to give you an idea this is the
algorithm when you place a stone
so basically well first there are some
guards that we are in the grid and the
point is actually free because otherwise
of course you cannot place a stone then
basically it creates some sector that we
wanted to know understand that we put
which are the stones of a same color on
the opposite color and the liberties the
liberties the basically the free place
around when when you have a shaping go
basically each on the board that there
could be another stone soul can be empty
the empty are called liberties because
one year you got an ollie but is
basically your you died usually so
basically for each a neighbor point
assuming okay this is a bit old version
of code and now it's bit more because
this is when I did that the conversion
then if you look at the coding get now
it's a bit more not complicated but as a
more optimization aside basically it
check the color and they put in one of
the three set liberties same color
opposite color Danny create a ghost
ringa basically I will look but the
ghost wing is a set of stones of God
that are on the same basically they are
touching each other not in diagonal but
directly
and then if the stone is touching at the
same color stones of the same color
basically have it emerge this finger in
Cuban 1 or if you are putting a stone
with three strings almost touching
basically you have to merge the three
strings and then once you do this you
have a to remove the liberties to the
other strings that around because now
you are putting so that is not a Liberty
anymore
and if some of the opposite color has no
liberties left that means that you
completely surrounded the string and
then you can put those tones away
so this is one of the most complicated
piece of code and it's raining pressure
is very linear and this Python and
cotton are really really similar okay a
bit of lesson learned so far about the
types the the question mark types
sometimes at least for me at the
beginning of Sabae cuz I had some
experience with groovy well using the
question mark is not such a good idea
it was a bit scary to use the question
mark in cotton but then a completely
change idea I think a question mark is
really I mean nullable types are really
good things so far the types are really
new label I mean if there is a reason
why the the response can be Nala I mean
a domain reason that's completely fine
that's great if there is no reason the
only reason that you put the question
mark is because you have a lazy
initialization stuff like that that's
not good
but instead the double exclamation mark
is very bad so you I think no or maybe
very few in some case because every time
you put a double exclamation mark you
are saying okay this topic it can be
nullable but not here and why not here
that means either there is a summer
fashion that is missing that you wanted
to remove all there is a kind of not so
good coding because actually it can be
not in that point and you can have our
problems but we don't want to have
another pointer exception so really we
should avoid the double question Monica
immutably imitability is very nice is
fantastic but there are also some
performance issue so if you are in the
very very I performance code maybe you
wanted to verify because sometimes is
helper the performance sometimes is not
so it's something we can maybe look at
some code algebraic data types which are
the shield a class where you have a
several instance are great great things
and they can really help both
performance and simplify the code and
the premature optimization is the root
over area so you have to think I mean
it's very good to optimize at the
algorithm but before trying to optimize
the code you really have it to measure
for example at the beginning I tried to
put some in lines around but in in lime
sub absolutely zero impact on
performance unless they have some a
specific some like lambda parameter and
stuff aware the in lines actually help
you or it ratified types but otherwise
in line staff to absolutely knowing
impact on performance ok back ok maybe
this life work I tell you before anyway
these are the explanation how to capture
so if you are gonna say if you are in
the if you are the black one and you put
a stone in well is called a you can you
can it
the white if you are white I put the
dust on here you can eat the black so
it's there is a lot of like a problem
and yeah this a bit of definition each
one is a stone a set of stones is called
a string and the liberties at the end so
for example this black block has truly
batiste this was a lotta so you don't
even have to call Conte this has only to
this a to and a lot of
strategies based on the number of
liberties and then there is a group for
the poor all the black stones here will
do a group which is more very important
when you study go I mean as human but
for the computer there is no equivalent
is very very hard to define what is a
copper from the computer point of view
so we just avoid we just talk about
strings and strings are touching
basically Cooper connected man not
touching each other now a strange
problem with go is when to decide who
win because I mean on chess the last one
win is very easy
instead the English absolutely not easy
to understand who win I mean for human
player what do they do basically the
counter D territory that you are
surrounding so for the per if this was a
play the black one and we have a da
parte de statue in the sea and also the
the stuffer of those d white they are
actually dead because from this position
there is no way that white can save
those stones I don't know if it because
basically whatever died white can do
here if a black put one here and then
one here die we kill two and then black
put another why kill and then black all
of them because it's not that the two
eyes instead these are two eyes and this
is
alive but when you have a player human
player basically they can decide this is
life this is not alive if there is a
some difference of opinion you can keep
keep playing until it's clear but it's
very very hard to do an algorithm to be
able to this to do this so what computer
does is a keep plane over and over again
I mean keep playing plane until all the
left place only one side I mean one
single empty space because then is easy
because you never play where you have an
empty space of your stones I mean black
I cannot if the X is black black will
never play here and white cannot play
here because it will be suicide there is
no waited and so when there is no place
that you can play you just quit then
that computer can just calculator and
calculate adjust the number of stones
and at the point that that are so random
of stones so but this 20 because yeah
you have it to keep a plane much more
than a human will do and at this point I
think a bit or maybe we can so the the
boat that you said before is that the I
told let me show you okay this this is a
a go client so this is not mine
nope I cannot use my first
I wanted to basically to show you how a
play between professional looks like
but
this is a alphago play yep
so I will do very quickly and so alphago
is the black and the white is the human
and this is how a professional game and
there is a lot of strategy involved and
basically the strategy
BISM or lesson that is much easier to
surround the territory on the corners so
firstly they play the corners and then
they played the lateral area and finally
the center but on the other side if
someone get for example here black pitch
taking basically the territory here but
the white is getting the territorial
center so there is always a bit of give
taking very of course I don't even
pretend to understand exactly I mean
there is a lot of ax but it's very cool
at this point I mean for even for a
human player that is not professional
it's very hard at this point to
understand who is a head but the in this
point of the what the champion basically
resigned because it was a human will be
behind maybe something that for example
this those three stones are actually
dead because you can see that there is
no way that they can format your eyes so
they are already counted as white and
this is that al alive because here white
as enough space to do two eyes so this
is a lot of stuff that a stronger player
do automatically not even think about
and and this for the body stones are
actually connected because of the shapes
I mean if a white play here black play
here so
can connect us so there is a lot of
stuff going on and so but this is that
the profession I mean professionally the
full board when you play with with
someone else' basically you can okay
I don't know there are you bit
interested on the stuff now let's see
the code just just another bit basically
this is one of escala suji's this kind
of a strange combination basically here
the black stones seems completely alive
because you think okay these are the
white the white of the only one I the
black are here and they are not far from
here so what is in a bad situation but
actually these stones can be there is a
a sequence basically where white puta
distancia and then black basically
wanted to eat this one he cannot place
here because of the white white eat this
too so black please yeah then white
extend at this point black I cannot put
here because otherwise will be eaten so
black here and white put here and put at
the top and then black it doesn't
realize that there is a tab so it the
white white play again black it again
and now black white this at this point
that these three are on parent so black
had to put here and black does hit this
one and basically now black is
completely dead whatever it does
basically white can play here black
can't idea it's completely black this is
a how but basically you
your strategy it's a lot and the roots
are so easy but just for the beginners
basically what you want is to play on
something simpler and you play online
the full board is 19 by 19
instead the you play with a small one
nine by nine it's easier and they'd be
much much shorter so just that to show
you basically this is my software so
this is a regulator one move for 10
seconds so basically one black here the
white will be the software and with one
move for one ten second I can always
beat em beat it quite regularly but with
the one move away twenty thirty second
it it bit me
so it's kind of I got a polygon that is
stronger than me that's already and so
basically this is smaller so it looks
like it's not a great move but it's not
completely random
it's a and if I give him a like thirty
seconds from over they move started to
be quite good and okay and we don't have
a time but it's quite easy and
sorry I kinda wanted to show you this
one I have a bit of a problem okay so
this was also quite interesting no
actually I'm sorry it's better if I
explain you first okay let's do this
how algorithmic to play games works the
easiest is at the mini-mart so it's
basically a take the current situation
you do some evaluation how who is ahead
well not at the beginning at the
beginning there is no evaluation so it
take all the possible moves and then it
takes the possible move of a possible
move so create it we have all the moves
then at the end of it valuate the moves
and then it shows according to the to
who's the player so here we'll take the
lowest one because of course is your
opponent so we'll choose the best for
him and then he took at the iist of the
possibility of this level and then you
took at the lowest so each level you
took it at the highest on the lowest
score and at the end of you you have
because you assumed that your opponent
is playing the best for himself and
you're the best for yourself and this is
the the first possible algorithm and
there is a problem that you have to
expand all the moves and enjoyable but
even tested out too many moves so
possible I mean am i best a better
solution is I have trying to look at the
moves at the better moves first and if
you already have a move that is better
you basically pull that way that is
so basically if you're established that
there is a move where it can kill you is
pointless to look at all the possible
husbands because you already know that
he has a better move than this so in
this way you can cut a lot of moves in
the evaluation but this is still not
enough refer go and basically the go
program is this Monte Carlo tree search
algorithm because the problem with go is
that at some point you wanted to
evaluate and for example in chess or in
other games it's quite easy to evaluate
I mean you have a summary stick so you
can count the number of pieces and stuff
like that but in go is absolutely not
easy especially I mean not even
professional I can say at the beginning
who is ahead so what the program is
doing this doing some rollout so a
completely random game so it just put in
pieces in the random place only legal
moves of course and the idea is that the
from a given configuration playing on
DOMA statistically the best position
will win I mean the player with the best
position so if you do ten times it
doesn't really matter but if you do ten
thousand or one hundred times roll out
you you understand who is actually
winning that position
so one and this is how the basically you
take you select the movement you try to
select the mobile optimizing and then
you do evaluation and then you have to
balance between discovering new moves or
get the or getting better evaluation for
the most that kind of winning because
maybe they are just winning
it seems they win but just because of
statistical fluke so you have a two
handed hand again and so when we you
write a software to play go the most
important part is how fast they can
valuated is allowed
and this is my laptop so nothing
particularly fancy and the the first
line was basically when I just take at
the Python code and copy paste it and
translated in coffee it was a in let's
just look at the first oil just to the
second just one column the first column
means on the nine by nine in the second
column 19 by 19 the in timing
millisecond to do a single hole out and
you have to think that you need at least
10,000 whole out to make something
what and they saw at the beginning was
the taking 10 millisecond on on the
small board so that will be like 100
second to have I mean more than one
minute just to have a decent play and
then basically I keep improving improve
improving and the de Quinta's the last
situation is basically twenty times
faster or less modern and well most of a
lesson learner on this performance staff
is that what is really important is the
algorithm so trying to avoid the for
example using immutable ago strings
instead of immutable ones really help a
lot of performance using a neighbor of
map so instead of just have a mapper
with everything that it can be
calculated in this case I was all the
neighbor from each point instead of a
calculator with timer you put in a map
so it really helps to understand if the
position is high okay improve the
algorithm and this was a quite so
Philippe at the beginning every the
Honda bata so the one that do this one
was calculating all the possible moves
valid moves and then just pick up one
handle instead now basically it's a
pickup random than
check if is valid and if it's not valid
to pick up another random but this is
much faster than calculated all the
valid and then pick up a one on and then
okay instead of shuffle all the possible
moves they just do the singles were
opened and do the random are one by one
basically oh if you could you can look
at the code every finishing Gita so the
last one is also quite a nice basically
sometimes we are using map like a hash
map but we actually froze up I had the
map pair with the player 1 and player 2
so there was a mapper with the key
player 1 and some stuff key player 2 and
some other stuff particularly using an
array is much easier faster because I if
the map is completely filled because we
completely put all the stuff and we know
exactly where to go using an array is
much more network and I mean coming from
a Java world away are kind of bad you
know because our low level and we want
map but technically with also with
cotton is much easier to use an array
than with Java and for example one
advantage that if you go on an array you
don't have to put the double exclamation
mark because array always return is that
the map always written in una Bala and
this air was also happen a lot and
oh no no I can show you some code oh
well let's talk about the next step so
at the moment the the algorithm is
pretty good it's already able to connect
her with the client so you can play with
it with a kind of dysentery traffic but
okay there is something the number that
we saw was a for a single call for a
single trade now I'm working on taking
advantage of the full credit that is bit
difficult but also coordinates with the
coho teens an inductor it's really nice
decoder and once I finish this basically
the next step is using deep learning and
the point of deep learning in an NGO
yeah is it - basically when we do this
Monte Carlo calculation we have to to
trial the possible position so in the
middle and then the game that's quite
good but at the beginning squat hopeless
because you cannot really try totally
all the possible 400 position at the
beginning and instead what deep learning
help you is a doing us a lot of
analyzing a lot of games it is this kind
of a convolution so basically he has a
bigger net that to take all the possible
and then split in small grid small and
small liquid and at the end basically it
gives you the full basically a list of
output which is the same number of the
possible position on the board with
their position a bit better with the
probability for each one so it can tell
you which is kind of intuition
analyzing the shape is understand the
most good shape it can be this this and
this I mean the position where I could
maybe play and so you have a small
number of a position which are
interesting and there you can feed those
to the multicolored research at the
beginning so Monte Carlo tree search got
a lot of improvement from this because
it doesn't have a - I mean it started
with a very good approximation and then
of course it to have a final number you
have actually to verify that it works
but is incredibly boost of performance
so this is I think after second half of
this year I will concentrate on this
part of any question yeah sorry I did
put them I well it's only github anyway
yeah with the coho teens okay so my aim
my experience has been I had there no
problem so far they are very fast so
comparing with the using Java fork/join
directly I I mean I'm working on the
backend and also on Android but I didn't
notice any performance issue the only
thing is that there's not much
documentation I mean basically apart
from the very very hello world the
examples there is only one page from the
guttering guys that explain and this
buffer so if you wanted to use the
producer the actors try to use the
channel for the performer to do this
tougher what I have it I have it to
generate the moves and then I have a
number of a worker that's more or less
like the course of the computer that the
analyzer and I don't want it to have a
too many mean I can I can create a 1000
Cortines at the beginning with all the
possible solution then let it one but
definitely is quite confused I mean is
taking a lot of resource I mean not as
much as I tried but still take I also
try with like 10 million co-routines it
works but it's lower then I mean I have
a tank also when think oh it costs so no
four calls with the I perk also but more
than eight basically don't have any
advantage in performance actually goes
down so I needed to create one coho teen
with that give a deposition basically
just put a requisition and put a
deposition in a channel you know that
the channels are connecting coho teens
or arctos and the channel has a fixed
amount that is like 10 I cannot so maybe
show and so basically when it fula
the channel is full the coho teens that
is producing movin weight because he
cannot put an infinite on the other hand
I have like 8 or 10 cooties that are
pick up in order to be examined by the
channel do all the calculation and at
the end updated a result and yeah it
works is fast is very nice code but it
took me a lot of to figure out exactly
how to connect the decoder so actually
this is something that I wanted to blog
about because it really there is not
much but yeah
I need to repeat him sure
hello everyone my name is n I work at
pusher as a developer evangelist and
today I would like to present you the
state of Kotlin precisely I'm gonna
present you the results of a survey that
I've been running for the past three
months that a bunch of you probably saw
or even filled in actually let's do a
show of hands who filled in the state of
Coughlin survey about half that's good
thank you everyone who who contributed
who took their time to do it so yeah
we'll be looking at where we are at the
moment in the Coughlin ecosystem and
yeah so I work at the pusher which is
where we're hosting you today and Kotlin
is used for all new Android SDK
development here that's in products such
as chat kit push notifications and feeds
I played quite a large part to put it in
there as the original Android enthusiast
so yeah my background is Android
development I moved into SDK development
and currently I'm doing surveys jokes
aside I love Kotlin Kotlin is I think
it's it's a great language and more and
more developers I spoke to it basically
shared the opinion that it makes us
happy I don't know why but it does
so yeah with this survey I wanted to
learn I wanted us to learn about the
Coughlin ecosystem because no one's ever
done it so we didn't really have a
comprehensive view of what the ecosystem
is I also want to produce something that
can be used to promote Kotlin as a
language that can be used by the
community so something that you can take
to your team and try to convince them
that cock
is maybe the way to go if you're doing
Android applications if you're doing
native applications if you're doing any
web stuff anything and yeah give back to
the community
My dear wish was that we get a thousand
responses to the to the to the survey so
yeah start in December start putting the
questions together with a lot of help
from the community I've gone through
several iterations to kind of put the
survey into the shape that was then
released to the public and mid-january
to mid March it was it was live it was
running we're doing some promotion to
get more and more people involved we
even offered a prize which was a trip to
Coughlin Kampf the premier conference
for Coughlin developers this year is
gonna be in October in Amsterdam and the
price was that essentially trip to
Amsterdam with flights hotel and and
ticket to the conference and we did a
prize draw at the end was completely
random and anyone who filled in the
survey after email and wasn't a pusher
employee or their close family member is
pretty much legible to to win it and it
was won by a person called Nicola it's
your Levitch from Croatia so if you're
watching a Nicola congratulations again
there wasn't a flowers awesome so let's
let's go on so I was hoping for a
thousand responses we got almost three
thousand which is scary and also super
exciting it's also ten percent off state
of jas which is probably the one of the
biggest state off kind of surveys going
out there 33 percent of people who
landed on the survey actually completed
it which my fellow marketeers also tell
me it's it's a quite a good ratio and on
average they took 13 minutes and 14
seconds of their time to complete it
doing some maths it also means that
people have spent 25 days filling the
survey so yeah thank you so much the
categories we surveyed we're how Kotlin
is being used how people learn
Coughlin's what are some of the favorite
features and how they are used and also
Coughlin's zeitgeist which was a
experiment I did to kind of grab more
open-ended questions open-ended answers
to questions and lastly I checked about
demographics so yeah without further ado
I would like to present you the state of
Kotlin in early 2018 let's look at the
usage first mmm 58% of people currently
use Coughlin's on a project it's quite
remarkable people who don't use it
currently on a project they've maybe
used it for learning or playing around
that's like 17% of those and 13% of
surveyed people say they have no plans
and they haven't used it so far among
the rest there are people who plan to
start using it or who use it in past or
who
only evaluated Kotlin as a potential
language to make their software in
people use Coughlin's in mostly in both
work and personal projects out of the
people who use it on a project anyway so
that's 66 percent of people surveyed
apart from that there are about 18
percent each only doing work or side
projects and out of curiosity how many
of you are Android developers it's about
right
a lot of hands went up because according
to the survey 80% of people use Kotlin
to build Android applications it doesn't
surprise me at all because it's very
popular in Android and the ecosystem has
been stuck with a quite a old version of
Java for a very long time so yeah out of
the Work Projects and to be honest it's
this graph is pretty much the same for
side projects 80% use it for Android
development and about 30 31 % each use
it for also server-side or SDK
development there's a few others who use
it for other type of things and yeah
surprisingly the side projects they
don't really defer like it'sit's pretty
much the same distribution here among
other things people use it for scripting
and obviously also experiments and just
learning and playing around and I was
also surprised to see data signs there
people several people have mentioned
that they use Coughlin's to do some data
Sciences things which is pretty cool
next thing that I checked was what's the
percentage of people who who have kind
of Coughlin as their projects only made
in coughlin
so and compare that to like people who
said they use it inside projects and
people who use it in their work projects
and the distribution is as seen so 55%
use have hundred percent Coughlin
projects in their side project so
they're there like if you're doing
something on the side they're probably
smaller more experimental things and
like a lot more people who are more
comfortable just having full-on Coughlin
there versus 25% for people who have it
in their work projects which is also
quite a nice number
I guess pusher is amongst those 25% yeah
so in work projects you see 25 and then
about 20 to 15 to 20 percent in in other
kind of distribution so 75 250 percent
to 75 and so on 1.4 percent people said
that they only use cotton in tests in
their work projects in their side
projects the distribution is quite
different because you see that it's
heavily skewed towards full-on Coughlin
or 75 to 100% Coughlin in android I
think the 25% ish is probably XML for
views yeah and a lot less people use it
for tests on Android apparently okay
other programming languages because it's
usually not the only program denies that
you work with no surprise here Java is
massive because it's kind of did older
cousin off Kotlin anyway and so is Swift
which is the super similar but not quite
counterpart on iOS JavaScript and node
are just big so that's why they were
quite often mentioned and lastly there
was Python I was quite surprised to see
Python there
so prevalent I'm not sure whether it's
related to the data science or it's just
people who do django and flask and other
things or even scripting but yeah these
are the few most popular other
programming languages for Coughlin's
developers another interesting feature
of Catlin is how close it is to Java and
how easy it is to migrate Java code to
coughlin so we looked at how what kind
of how many people decided to do this
conversion so 87% of people migrated
some Java code to coughlin it also means
that 13% of people didn't do that maybe
they just started out writing
Coughlin's directly maybe they just
created new classes in Kotlin I don't
know and yet those people who had done
the migration vast majority use the
Wizards to convert individual classes 66
percent 56 percent of people used did
the conversion manually and 47 decided
to convert only snippets by that I mean
Android studio and IntelliJ allow you to
if you copy Java code automatically
convert that into Coughlin's if you copy
it into Coughlin file which is pretty
cool
there's also 10% of brave souls who
decided to it's a good idea to convert
the entire project and 20% all of people
who done the migration decided it was a
bad idea I imagine it went something
like this
so yeah I asked about the reasons
dependencies were a big reason why the
migration didn't go as planned so as
reflection a couple of names popped up
on Android it's it's dagger it's green
Dao it's realm there may be a bit some
tricks involved to getting this migrated
correctly in the early days it was also
spring and we can't just look at
technical reasons because there's also
the organizational reasons there might
be corporate policy at play too that
prevents you from convert from just
migrating to a completely new
programming language so yeah these are
quotes if you see slides like these it
means that there are direct quotes that
have taken from open-ended questions so
someone made was made to revert it due
to organizational rules or another team
took the code and they didn't want
cortland sad on a more technical side
migration triggered a number of changes
in the java code especially when you
have a bunch of statics and it kind of
breaks your api this is what can happen
it's also that the wizard migration does
not provide idiomatic Kotlin and it puts
a lot of neurosurgeons which can be
considered code smells which means that
you might want to rethink this and do
some conversion manually as opposed to
using the wizard so yeah that was usage
of Kotlin moving on i decided to look at
how people decide to learn Coughlin's
what they use and when do they learn it
so what's interesting is that this is a
pretty much hockey stick graph it
started in 2011 with very very small
amounts so on
nil 0.1% of people picked it up in 2011
and exploded in mid 2017 after Google
i/o when Google obviously announced that
cotton is now officially supported
language for Android applications so 46
percent of all people surveyed said they
started using Coughlin's after Google
i/o another important spike was in 2015
I can only speculate but there was also
the time when Jake Wharton a very famous
Android developer used to work at square
now he's at Google released a white
paper originally internally at square
and then publicized it it was basically
an evaluation of Coughlin as a
programming language that Square can
pick up and it was released as a Google
Doc and it obviously exploded there was
also a bunch of talks starting in 2015
so that's probably what helped explosion
of Coughlin and popularity mmm so yeah
reasons why people start learning it
Google support in Coughlin officially on
Android it's definitely a big one
so is JetBrains so big companies like
that big respectable companies when
people see it that's kind of their idea
to just kind of believe and trust those
companies tooling is also important
luckily Coughlin has JetBrains behind
them which are in my opinion the best
IDE makers in the world
so tooling is there and then there's
community our already mentioned jake
wharton and there's also
Christina Lee and Antonio Leyva and a
lot of others who especially in the
Android space helped to popularize
Coughlin and on the JetBrains side there
is Hadi Hariri Svetlana Zakharova and
Andre brass love and many others who
also did the same thing one person who
answered the survey also said they were
introduced to Kotlin by their friend Leo
so Leo if you're watching
thank you you're a good person
so yeah among other quotes and reasons
why people picked it up is the
popularity of Coughlin in a short period
of time we've seen the hockey stick
graph it's really astonishing Java was
very verbose and Coughlin is just love
and happiness I guess I think that was
like Java being Java was one of the
biggest most often repeated reasons why
Kotlin is so so popular so for instance
this one
it's like Java plus plus although I
don't think I don't know what to think
about this
so yeah the resources that people used
to learn no surprise Coughlin Lang dot
org the official web site is almost 90%
of people use this to learn Coughlin and
followed by different talks at
conferences and resources like Kotlin
cones the the most prevalent Community
Supported projects are I would say
Kotlin weekly which is a newsletter
which pusher is has been sponsoring for
the last couple of months and the Kotlin
for Android developers it's a book by
Antonio Leyva it's been around for a
while he published it on lean pub I
think at first and then it's been quite
popular and then yeah different blogs
different courses I would also like to
pay attention to the Kotton Academy
which is a publication on medium
currently it's had four point eight
percent of respondents say they'd kind
of picked it up from they learned
Coughlin from it but I think given that
they're producing so many great pieces
of content it's gonna be a lot more
prevalent in the following iterations so
yeah developers who learn Catalan come
from different backgrounds
mostly Java and Endor
unsurprisingly but also front-end
back-end desktop development other
mobile they may come from Swift maybe
maybe Swift developers decided to hate
they have a cool thing on androids as
well let's pick this up yeah three point
eight percent of people decided hey I'm
just gonna learn Coughlin from scratch
which is great I want to see what this
what this changes to in the in the
following years so yeah this was where
people come from how people learn and
what people used to learn but let's talk
about the features because it's it's got
some pretty amazing features Knoll
safety is by far the most favorite one
so eighty percent of people say they
they love null safety this was a
multiple-choice question so they could
people could say they love all of them I
try to encourage them to pick only three
followed following null safety you've
got extension functions Java Interop and
data classes which which are favored by
sixty something percent of people then
followed by higher-order functions and
type inference about 40 ish something
and lastly you've got the newer features
like multi-platform support and
co-routines which have been introduced
in the later versions of Kotlin at 20
something percent or to be precise
among other favorite features you've got
the when keyword you've got the ray fide
keyword and you got sealed classes and
lambdas that popped up often during the
the comments there was also a blooper in
the original iteration of the of the
survey I must have come from the
screening of the last Jedi and then
writing the writing the questions
because I confused higher-order
functions with first order functions and
if you follow Star Wars first order is
the are the baddies of the new
so yeah bit of a blooper so yeah if we
look at the breakdown of different
function of different features of
Coughlin's 77 percent said that they've
used extension functions extensions are
you can easily add what would otherwise
have to be
static utility classes static utility
methods in Java to existing classes
they're used to reduce Android
boilerplate they're used to kind of
replace utility classes as I just
mentioned a lot of people mention
conversions so strings object things
that get from API is they just can
convert them and dsls
what people say about them we felt like
going overboard with them now trying to
find happy medium they're not the best
thing but because because it can easily
be easily be abused and overused the
most important use case is lambda
parameters for dsl style builders and
for clean code because they make the
code more readable because you can just
name different things on things like
strings integers any any given object
you can just call them different on the
other side you have cortines introduced
more recently and only 20 well not only
but 29 percent of people have used them
mostly for threading and any i/o UI
based operations and also as a
replacement for our X Java rx Java is
the reactive extensions for Java it's is
the library brings us observables and
the reactive paradigm but most people on
Android mostly use it for for simplified
threading and scheduling things on
different threads so co-routines because
they're just that are probably gonna be
taking a bit of limelight from Java or
agava in that
sense there's also a bunch of people who
said they come from the C sharp
background and they've missed the async
and wait keywords so they've used that
so yeah some people also say de I've
used it with arrow because they use it
for four comprehensions I've got back
over there in the audience who's one of
the main contributors to arrow if you
want if having error questions please
ask him
someone said they stopped using
co-routines because they are
experimental fair enough they actually
are and someone used them fully in
production for a FinTech solution any
munzo developers here know okay
they also provide a very funny API when
used to wrap J's promises I have no idea
what this means another popular thing in
Kotlin are the non JVM features
targeting being able to target other
platforms 26% out of which 15% are
excited about coffee native so the
native compilation target for Kotlin
there's going to be possibility for
doing writing Coughlin to be executed on
iOS and native as well Coughlin jeaious
with 11% and lastly multi-platform
Coughlin with 7% of usage outside of
features I also asked about build tools
so what do people use to built Coughlin
projects no surprise here again Android
studio is with 75% clearly in the in the
lead followed by IntelliJ at 65 and
Gradle at 62 they're all used for
Android development so no surprise here
our
quite surprised and disappointed why
cobalt the native Kotlin built system is
only used by 1.1 percent of people
honestly I haven't used it so it
shouldn't surprise me that much but yeah
other tools included basil and Griffin
and also buck apparently there is
support for buck as well in for Kotlin
41 percent have used a DSL in Kotlin
prevalent is anko with 23 percent anko
is the UI declaration library for for
Android actually it's 24 percent
Coughlin Gradle the ability to write
Gradle plugins in Kotlin is another one
with about 17 percent and lastly you've
got cotton XHTML the Dom manipulation
DSL with 5.6 among the others they're
mostly homegrown dsls because 24 percent
have actually developed a DSL themselves
what for
it's mostly used for a lot of people
have mentioned Jake Wharton's again Jake
is getting boring
Jake Wharton's testing robots
it's it's a it's a blog that he wrote
about nicer testing on Android with
write by writing a DSL a lot of people
write UI declarations and custom data
structures DSL but there's so many use
cases from banks to AI to to all of that
so people have mentioned pretty much
everything I was really interested in
this actually it's you've probably seen
that a lot of libraries are replacing
sees with case so there was category
which was spelled with a k
there is inject with a k' again so I
asked like what do you think about this
do you like it you don't most people are
indifferent but 32% of people say that
it should be compulsory and 10% of
people say that katydid it's two decades
ago but not not everyone is so enthused
the survey started with a button saying
comments with a k' so someone didn't
like it
classic Dylan so yeah that's enough for
features let's look at the zeitgeist
what people actually think about cotton
why do they what do they miss what do
they like 29% of people say they are
missing things in Kotlin most dearly
missed is the ternary operator at least
for the for the server itself s a.m. for
Kotlin classes it's also a big one and
yeah there's like a lot of people miss
new things all the time
syntax sugar someone missed link so must
be all the c-sharp developers out there
apparently I've heard there is actually
a alternative to link in Coughlin but I
haven't I'm not aware of it it's
interesting because a lot of people who
filled in the JetBrains survey called
Coughlin future features they asked for
collection literals and they weren't
that often mentioned in
in my survey so yeah more things that
they're missed so custom operations
support for view a single multi platform
IDE
I think Jett the IntelliJ does it for up
to an extent and there's also Swift's
guard statements so like all the i/os
transplants would be missing the guard
statements from Swift 21% of people
don't like certain features in Kotlin
they don't like companion objects
because the way it does this kind of
interacts or kind of counteract statics
in Java some people don't like its old
public by default even though it's also
quite immutable by default someone says
it's not a dynamic language not sure
what to think about this but yeah but
yeah what is the best ones though what
people like they like the features
they're like the null safety they like
the coroutines they like the they're
like Java interoperability they also
like it's a modern programming language
again two Swift typescript and others
they like it's not a Java they're like
it's fun pun intended because functions
in Coughlin's start with a fun are
declared with the fun and platform
independence was quite often mentioned
obviously it's also a very functional
friendly programming language so that
was quite frequently mentioned to my
favorite quotes about this was it can be
read like a story I think that's just
nice and another one I smile again when
writing code that's just poetic isn't it
and the language does not get in the way
of getting a job done it's pretty cool
and my favorite one actually is mortal
kombat the program
language I'm not sure whether that means
the arcade version was better than the
home console ones but yeah honestly if
anyone has any ideas I'd like to learn
what what that meant so yeah that's the
Kotlin zeitgeist and lastly we've got
the demographics we learned that
Coughlin airs live everywhere on earth
that is we haven't detected anyone
coming in from outer space yet most of
the surveyed people are employed or in
being students but there is also others
like CEO startup founders interns all
sorts
how long have people been working as
developers I think this is a pretty
standard distribution honestly I will
when we release the report we're gonna
compare this with the Stack Overflow one
just to see how it is all stacks against
each other number of people in your
organization has there is a big spike
with 10 to 50 people and quite a large
spike with the freelance but nothing
nothing scary there is quite a uniform
distribution across the other other size
of companies so imagine the 10 250
people are like small agencies startups
that are quite eager to try out new
things quite flexible to move move
quickly and how many developers are in
the organization's
a big spike at 2 to 5 developers it
probably means Android themes working on
Kotlin that's my my hunch because that's
kind of the size of a Android team 3.7
percent of people have more than 50
coughlin developers in their orts so
Google JetBrains the likes sectors no
surprise here
Tech is tech is leading the charge and
pretty uniform distribution unless
you're working in government or
insurance so yeah that was that was the
demographics and I would like to ask you
what do you think about the future of
Kotlin and the future of state of Kotlin
if you have any questions that you would
like to see asked and the future
iterations because there will be more
what would they be
get in touch please and let me know and
we can make this a great experience and
use this to kind of just grow the
Coughlin community further that was
state of Kotlin and I am zan Markin
thank you I don't think losing there is
okay the question was how about groovy
because in androids Kotlin has been a
better Java for awhile and in
server-side and back in Java groovy was
the better Java for a bunch of years and
whether I planned to include the
migration from groovy to the survey I
did not plan about it didn't plan to do
it it wasn't really on my radar but
maybe it could be something that we ask
in the future okay the question was
about the negative parts of the survey
negative thoughts about Coughlin and how
many people were concerned about the
state of compilers and compiler plugins
I'm honestly not sure there wasn't many
that I've seen but I imagine if we asked
that question directly some people might
might mention it but I haven't seen any
spikes
yes so the question was 13% of people
filled in the survey about a cup about a
language that they had no interest in
yes that is correct and I imagined the
prize that trip to Amsterdam was part of
the reason why 13% did that I think
we're done thank you very much
