front-end developer I'm someone who
loves to play around with new
technologies old technologies
yeah but mainly things with JavaScript
because yeah this is what I enjoy I also
like to create prototypes prototypes are
is grateful for proving concepts proving
ideas and to have something touchable
and I'm pretty fortunate to to to work
at the company that is actually doing
prototyping yeah yeah this is my my
competence as you see in the picture we
we do prototype slightly like this in
the first phase we we try to you to ID
eight and understand ideas of our
customers of their requirements this is
a this is required to to discover and
understand not so this is a key concept
of a prototype yeah the goal is to
validate technical feasibility and and
user acceptance yeah but technical
feasibility I mean if it works if it
works for the user if it works in
general
there is a the key concept here is there
is this vast failing and learning from
from the behave from from these these
failures if there are any and in some
cases we will start from the beginning
with a new concept now this is done it's
it's clever with this one team one room
concept which works like this
the
the business design architect and the UX
architect tried to create a concept
together with the customer product owner
and the domain expert and the next step
we we that's how the UI designer creates
a visual prototype which usually ends up
to being a click dummy this is our
specification so we don't have a lot of
text stand we don't we also don't do
scrum because we don't need these these
huge specific specific specification
things and in the next step we start to
develop the prototype the team which I'm
part of as a front-end guy this happens
simultaneously so the back end and the
front end actually happens together and
this results in something that I call
user centric application design which is
when you search for it and then wherever
you get mostly not that what I mean
under it and tune and I want you to
explain it for this prototyping reuse
currently this stack we use view Jas
because it's simple and easy to set up
it has lots of building things it's it
works for us as a framework it has this
router in the store which are easy to
use to communicate with a back-end which
is implemented in some language can be
implemented in some language we use JSON
API because it gives us incredible
flexibility you can also use graph QL of
course this worked for us so we chose it
and then the the key essence and the
entire thing is the the matching UI live
you want to be fast you want to to
handover something that's working for
the customer so and it's something that
is as close as possible to the UI to the
to the UI design in the Kliq domain and
in CMS's it should be beautiful and
that's why matching UI library
is easily configured and of course
depending on the needs you
you can install anything you want Maps
really it's up to you yeah the basic
principles here we use or yeah this is
something I like to use is when yeah we
use in a team as well put contextually
close things together this is yeah well
it's the best practice for us this means
that you have your components store a
namespace one in one directory we call
the main and this fellow is a shallow
structure so it's flattened out you
don't have deep technical and abstract
and whatever stuff we use across the
team you bigger this language so
everybody knows what's going on and we
get this this language from actually the
domain expert the customer and we do
this because we need to talk to them in
in some occasions and if you're working
I don't know eight to ten hours straight
on a prototype because at the end of the
day you want to show them something it's
it's pretty hard to formulate the
language you would use in a
computational environment to that one
and then we make use of declarative
methods now if you come from a react
background or or a view background or
well any declarative framework library
whatever and it's nothing new for you
also we use some some functional
techniques but it's not a must it's just
we have much things readable yeah so
here deeper again containers and
presenters thank you Dan Abramov the
concept is not ours the work works great
what comes here is the namespace store
and if you are from a redux background
this probably is something that doesn't
sister but maybe I'm wrong I didn't do
read access much yeah it's close close
to the domain to the problem and then
another part is the API communication
which is a separate thing you want you
to get it away as far without huge
extractions from the core domain and we
come new cage but it's yeah it's an
abstract leave part of this this helps
to to keep focus on the problem and it
makes refactoring easier now imagine
that you are working you are we're
working on a prototype so you don't
build Enterprise great software and and
you need to throw away stuff
occasionally even in later in later
parts of the process yeah I know you
begins language I understand yeah what
I've just told you about this the entire
team has to have a domain language even
even the back the back ends guys who
aren't directly working with us but when
we're communicating with them it's
essential yeah and the naming
conventions should be simple nothing
like a multi but supporter or something
something segregation and and so on it's
cool it's you it's it's specific it's
it's exact but it's not it's not
productive yeah this resulting in some
sort of almost documented code and if
you sit with the domain expert or the
business developer in front of the code
even they have some sort of idea what's
going on there to separate a little bit
at least we decided to go with with
upper casing the the store related stuff
and this is the declarative thing I was
talking about here I wanted to mention
that you shouldn't care about
losing performance but apparently this
is another problem as we have heard in
previous talk it reduces the length of
the code and increases the readability
of it and this results in a more
efficient coding as a team together and
if you so this looks like this usually
we we start to developing and sometimes
the competence and and well we aren't
fast enough or we are behind our goal we
need to to get some some other team
members and and they meet you to get on
the bandwagon as fast as possible yeah
what I I think are are essential for
this approach is really defined process
and you can only define this if you have
gained experience in it then so I
encourage everybody to to try to create
some prototypes and a non-conventional
way and an ugly way or everything and
try to learn from it and and also have a
team that's with many companies try to
work or imagine to work with the team
that has many different competences
because not everybody is a developer
here when we are doing the thing yes the
the essence of all you should always
know your - in the deepest way possible
because only then you can be truly agile
and the only thing you can can rewrite a
reliable code that's working actually
yeah this common language thing is
really in essence here and to keep
everything simple simple in sense of
logic in sense of in sense of in
structure in sense of well yeah
everything so this was my first talk
ever held on meetup so thank you very
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
