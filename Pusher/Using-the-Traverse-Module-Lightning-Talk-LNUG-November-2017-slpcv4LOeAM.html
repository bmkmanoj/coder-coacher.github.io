I'm transforming Jason from one format
to another that's pretty much you know
probably 80% of the work I end up doing
so one of the things that I've found
that I use all the time is this modulus
fantasticks called Traverse and gives
you a whole variety of ways of where's
my working here we go
gives a whole variety of ways of
traversing a Jason object but the one I
use most is this map function and you
can do all sorts of things with that
so have a check out Traverse if you need
to do a lot of work with Jason objects
and this will go down to any depth you
like but what I wanted was to then make
because I was doing this all the time I
didn't want to do it programmatically I
wanted a more kind of non programmatic
way of describing how you want to
transform one JSON object into into
another format and so that other people
could could do the transform
instructions instead of me doing it
programmatically so I've created
something it's a bit of a mouthful it's
called cube transform Jason and the key
thing I wanted to do was describe the
transform using a template which itself
was a JSON object okay so the the
transform is described by the object
which is a template which immediately
shows the shape of the object that you
want to create during the transform I
couldn't find anything else that would
do this and so I wrote it myself and and
in order to make it really easy I've got
a thing called even more of a mouthful
cube transform Jason editor which allows
you to try this out in a browser and
I'll show you very quickly here it is in
action so it uses three Jason editor
components on the Left there's a very
simple little object I want to this is
my starting point
and I want to create a new object which
is a transformation of the first one and
here's my transform object and it uses
this double handlebars convention so it
says this a property is going to be from
food up bar 1c is gonna be and this
could be nested any level you want and
here I'm inserting inside text and
here's a literal text and then all you
do is you say you try these things out
and you click this here and if I click
test your template then it should be
coming out with the so that should be
food bar I want correct
been good and you can do all sorts of
other things with it you you can add
functions to do more complex things like
date transformations
it'll cope with arrays repeating stuff
like that and I use it this all the time
now and and you can say the syntax is
all described in that first library road
and seems to do everything so give it a
go if you want if that's what you need</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
