participant at refugee is called we are
learning there about cs50 and actually
we are learning first how to become
ambitious before how to learn to code
and it's quite like learning so fast
there and it's kind of its kind of
Awesome being an amazing environment
there and there we are learning and cs50
from Harvard which is completely
different from what developer it's C and
Python and something inside the hardware
software so I would like I'd like what
since I saw Daniel did a post on
Facebook about some of someone would
like to represent something about doing
any project is done I would like I did a
some project here it's a job search
engine it's connecting with a github
database so everything every database I
have it every single detail is
connecting with a github job this is the
website I did it it's the front end and
back entries the back end side is about
no JavaScript and the mango database and
the front is I used HTML CSS and
uncommon framework it's semantic
framework which is very uncommon so
anyway if more someone would like to
search on something I can just easily
type stuff like some kind of job I'll
write something about JavaScript and I
will use the countryís
I suppose there's nothing in Vienna
because it's a it's a job it's
connecting with a github which
everything in America so I will use the
remote they will try it
remote means so there is two kind of job
so a
here you can see that there is a date
where is the website comes yep and it's
not quite you cannot see it but here is
the title of the job and the name of the
company comes under it and remote eh
where's the location of it like if it
could be the New York at somewhere
anywhere it comes there then type how
long is this the full time and they'll
click here for the description it comes
the description it's which is jQuery I
used so that you can see it and here if
you want to apply for it you can't just
cut with a click here and go to a
website which I don't want I if you want
to search again and you'd like it this
is the website where I used yeah the
stick which where I did it I used I used
in the back end and no JavaScript and
Express framework and the mango database
which all of them connecting with the
backend the front is it was HTML and
semantic framework and jQuery the truth
I did it the kid hop get and get hot and
the hiroko and MBLAQ em lab is with the
people who does not know it
M lap is about a cloud database service
you can hosting your Mongo database on
it
the here ok it's a cloud platform you
can publish your website I published for
free because it's so domain and you can
publish it even if it's a domain until
500 megabyte I would like to go a little
bit into the code so this is the node
javascript this is the back end code at
the beginning I give a little bit there
is for like I said MPM package which I
requested from the NPM package is
connecting with an odd JavaScript I
requested the mangos and requests so
that I can request it and Express and
then I assigned the public which is
connecting with a style sheet and then
comes whether you are
they they here is type you can see it
I'd like to see it to show you this here
speaks those two lines it's this is the
global URL this is the online URL which
you cannot see it because it sits inside
the Hiroko there you can't it comes the
name and the password and the name of
the database if I come published on get
up it's gonna be a disaster and this is
the look at your area and this or means
it's quite good because once you are
working on a website every changing in
the locker you don't want it to mix it
with it on your door your deploy website
you deploy tube side then comes the
search page and the result page where I
as I asked you the request this line
from the github job and then it comes
for the request this is the third page I
think it's quite common for some of you
it's an HTML but the classes is semantic
framework and this is also the the
result page you can see here this in
this line I guess you cannot do it yeah
on this line and other line is here the
job those are working with the node
JavaScript those are EGS is if you
wanted to connect if you want to mix it
HTML with a back-end use those kind of
thing the packages that I use it AGS
express and the mangoes and the mango
database that if not a month it's you
cannot you can also not using because
it's also it's something comes with the
command this is the API this is the API
I request that I can what I can ask from
the github I asked it for when I created
it this is the timing
and the title the manager director the
location and asked for the time the
description and how to apply I didn't
ask for the company RL or company logo
or nothing else so the hero code this is
Hiroko Hiroko is like I said I used it
for I published my I deployed my website
from Hiroko so it's connecting can you
notice you noticed can hear you can
notice here it's connecting with a
github and I deploy it from here
deployed a master branch who are with
people who are familiar with the gates
hope they can notice its to comment to
connecting to the github thing they get
hope with the Hiroko the aim lab that a
page service is also the yeah this is
the database the global one the online
to take a visit on downline you can see
here that you can see here is that
database password and the database user
this is was what was I was talking about
the title page URL which you cannot see
it it's hidden this one I I took it and
I put it I make a configuration in the
hero core so that they can automatically
configuration so yep this was my app
that I created for you so yeah I guess I
present yep
thank you for this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
