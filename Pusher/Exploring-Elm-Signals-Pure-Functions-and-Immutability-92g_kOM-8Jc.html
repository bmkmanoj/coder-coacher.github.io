Elm a new program language I've been
babbling with recently in particular
we're going to chat about three
interesting ideas I've come across an L
and so far signals pure functions and
immutability so Elvis built for building
reactive user interfaces well that means
as we build user interfaces where we
have to deal with things like the user
clicking data changing or a lot of
different things could change at any one
time so do this elm introduces the
concept of signals these are values but
the values that can change over time
whereas in JavaScript use having a
variable like X and my preceptor number
four in L we might have a signal of
values and it'll be a number that will
change over time for example in L we
have a signal representing the users
mouse position if you wanted to change
the color of the page depending on when
the users mouse was we can listen to
that signal of values this means is you
can you can deal with these signals and
these values as if they're normal values
and one of them changes and will rerun
all the code it needs to so your
applications up to date this makes it
really easy to deal with user input and
reactivity and elam because it's
natively dealt with in the language for
you so if your function is a function
that has a tape all the data it needs as
arguments it also can't reach out to
grab any extra data that in my need we
have to explicitly pass in what it needs
well this means is that if we get the
function the same arguments and will
always give us the same output this is
really handy because it means it's much
easier to debug things we lose the risk
of coming into our whole class of folks
where we're modifying its thermal state
or external data that the function
doesn't have access to functions can't
reach out and modify anything else so
they're much easier to work with much
easier to debug and there's less chance
of you introducing folks when you write
these properties
finally all data and elm is a musical
well this means is once we've declared
some data and store dip we can't then go
back and change it this is a common
source of bugs in applications in
JavaScript example if you have a regular
object you can change your values and
properties in that object as and when
you please and any function can do it
this means it's really hard to track
down a bug if that object has changed
you don't know what's change that object
or what function has messed with it in L
every value is immutable so you can't
update an existing object you always get
back a new object what this means that
we eliminate any chance of bugs around
mutating objects entirely they're just
gone because L doesn't let you do that
as a language this means you know that
once you have an object or some data
that object is always going to add that
data and no function or anything can
ever mess with it this means it's less
likely that you're going to run into the
sort of bugs typically caused by
mutation so Elms a relatively young
language but I've really enjoyed playing
with it so far I'm excited to see what
the future holds for it I'd love to hear
what you think about the language feel
