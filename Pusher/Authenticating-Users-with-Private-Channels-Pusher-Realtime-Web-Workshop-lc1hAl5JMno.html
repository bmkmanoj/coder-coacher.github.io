pusher in this screencast we'll be
covering using private channels now
private channels are for a way of
authenticating subscriptions to the
channel this is really useful when you
want to restrict who can access data
within your application so for instance
if you want to users chatting to each
other over one channel you could create
a private channel and make sure that
only those two users can subscribe to it
the pushchair libraries and pusher
itself I've introduced an authentication
mechanism to make this possible
for this workshop we'll be using the
real-time web workshop the source for
this is available in github keep calm
slash pusher slash real-time - web -
workshop before we get started I wanted
have a quick look at the existing code
so from the last tutorial I've done some
refactoring so the start of this
tutorial
the codes a little bit different simply
because the the organic way that we
created the code previously we didn't
cover any kind of refactoring processes
so I've reflected for the start of this
and I just thought I'd cover koval what
happened so first thing to know is that
index.html from previous one's been
called an index dot PHP now this allows
us to obviously bring in some
configuration and information from from
the server so things like as I said
configuration
it also lets us so here you can see
we've actually we're pulling in some
configuration from these defined app key
and channeling values so there a couple
of things were thing worth mentioning
the channel name is the thing that we
subscribe to and the thing that we
publish to so we subscribe to it on the
client and we published on the server so
we share that information now via
configuration we've seen the app ID app
clean up secret before if we go into the
JavaScript you'll see there's now an app
app j/s that's included rather than it
being in line within the HTML you can
see here we use config push it
at key and conflict pusher Dutch channel
name
I've also moved the CSS into a CSS
folder installs dot CSS and included it
in the index.php file and you can also
see when we trigger messages we use the
channel name constant
okay so as I said the point of private
channels is to restrict access to who
can subscribe to a channel so this can
be really useful if we're having say a
one-to-one chat or we want to restrict
who can access status updates from a
particular user so let's have a quick
look at the documentation the
documentation provides an overview of
the authentication process so here we
create a new push object in the sequence
diagram the WebSocket connection is
created to pusher pusher returns a
socket ID now that socket ID you need to
identify that connection to push it
there from there we subscribe to
something now we subscribe to a private
channel now we use convention here over
configuration to determine what a
private channel is and how to identify
private channel so a private channel
just has a private - prefix once that
subscription call is made the library in
this case the push of JavaScript library
makes a callback to an authentication
endpoint on your application so this in
the push JavaScript library this is an
ajax request or a JSONP request within
that request which is a post request it
passes a channel name and a socket ID if
it's a JSONP request it also passes a
callback javascript function name your
authentication endpoint should then
authenticate that users those so check
the session check the user has been
authenticated and is it logged in and
then you sign the subscription request
return an authentication signature and
then a subscription is made to pusher
for that channel from the JavaScript
library passing the channel name and the
signature and then from that during the
authentication process it means the
pusher knows that your server has
authenticated that subscription in your
application because the signature uses a
private a secret key that only your
server and push your knows about so to
change the application to use private
channels is as simple as prefixing
the name of the channel with private
well we're here we should also update
the app ID up can app secret otherwise
we obviously won't be able to connect or
publish information so now if we jump
into the application go to the real time
my workshop private start and we'll see
the app if we open at the JavaScript
console okay so you'll see we've
connected and then we're getting this
failed to load resource the server
respond it's bonded with the status of
404 not found this is because if I
reload the app you'll see that along
with the resources for the application
being loaded that our call to slack
pusher slash off now this is the default
endpoint for the authentication call
when a private channel is subscribed to
so the next thing we need to do is write
our authentication endpoint so let's
create a any file which is which will
make both PHP and secondly we want to
update the default endpoint the endpoint
is called to a different URL
so if it had gone to push a slash off it
would have gone right underneath real to
my workshop we want it to go in to start
off dot PHP so by defining a relative
URL that's where it will go we've got a
Roth PHP file if we jump into our app
all right that'd be like the page you'll
see all that PHP is called but obviously
we're not responding with anything yet
so we want to do two things here we want
to include our config we want to include
the pusher library we want to create a
new pusher instance so we've got the
code there from elsewhere and the PHP
library provides a way of creating the
signature for you so down the bottom
here we use the pusher instance
that's so we're gonna create the earth
has a function called socket off and it
takes a socket ID and the channel name
we don't have that yet
but if we go over here and look at the
the earth request you'll see this form
data set which is socket ID and channel
name for data means form data means a
post so we can get socket ID from the
post
and we can get the channel name as well
and finally we have the off so we just
need to echo it back I'm sorry I said
earlier the this author signature is
created based on socket ID channel name
but also these credentials that you've
passed them previously so the up key app
secret an app ID the app secret is the
key thing it's something that only
pusher and your server know about so if
we jump back over to the app again
refresh you'll see the posters okay we
can see that we've got a response which
is some Jason and all signature and if
we jump to the console we actually got
and on of so the subscription failed so
let's try and work out why that's the
case if we jump to look at the earth who
have got it could very easily be yeah I
know it is it's because this takes a
channel name and the socket idea jump
over here that's all okay have a look at
the console and there we go subscription
succeeded so we're now subscribed to a
private channel now obviously at the
minute we're just letting anybody in so
what we want to do is we want to make
sure that only authenticated users are
allowed in so to do that let's create a
new functions.php
well have you user logged in and what
we'll do is we'll return false to start
off with and then here will include the
functions if the user isn't logged in
then we want to say that they're not
authorized for access
I guess this else part isn't really
required let's make sure we were respond
saying that that wasn't allowed must be
American okay
so now if we jump over to the up again
reload we'll see we're getting a 403
forbidden back if we change the be
logged in function return true and we
let the page we're allowed in again then
let's add really horrible but basic idea
of authentication what we can do is
let's check the let's check that there's
a query parameter with a value of 1 just
to make sure that they're authenticated
and obviously that's set the worst
security ever so we'll check the HTTP to
see if it has off equals one
okay so if we refresh the page right now
and we're gonna for a few forbidden but
if we have add earth equals equals one
where the subscription succeeds I best
just demonstrate the example does work
okay so the app still working we're
authenticated if this guy over here
doesn't authenticate and I send a
message from the left and because the
guy on the right hasn't authenticated he
won't receive the message okay so that's
an overview of private channels</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
