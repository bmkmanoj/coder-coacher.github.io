Hannes I'm an engineering manager and
architect on
JIRA which I'm sure some of you are
using or have been using in the past
what we are doing in pure land these
days is we're giving JIRA a big
usability update or UX update so we're
going from this well known but maybe a
little bit dusty designed to do this
which i think is looking much fresher
and actually also much easier to use
I'm super keen to hear your feedback if
your users at the bar so that said JIRA
is actually a pretty old piece of piece
of code so the first version of JIRA
dates back to 2002 so on my personal
popgun to Top Gun to timeline JIRA 1.0
is actually close at the top come that's
mind blowing anyway what I'm trying to
say is there's quite a bit of legacy
that she was carrying around so when we
said we are starting this UX update we
also saw this as an opportunity to get
rid of you know all the jQuery and all
the backbone garbage oops
that has been lying around and really
create a you know a nice nice modern web
stack so there's there's a bit of logo
porn behind me but I think the most
interesting row is really the first one
so it's a I want to say relatively
traditional react redox architecture
rxjs for side effects using style
components quite heavily storybooks are
awesome and the whole thing is is flow
typed so I think this is pretty pretty
neat pretty modern web stack plus there
is quite a bit of surface area and Shera
it's a it's a large and complicated tool
or powerful tool so it wasn't too
surprising that our new front and
repository that hosts all the new
front-end grew quite quickly so these
are the numbers from from yesterday
we're talking 600 k lines of code and
actually more than 150 individual
contributors obviously not everybody was
contributing a whole lot of code to that
but
but still right so when I'm talking
about world-class fronted engineering at
scale this is the scaler we're talking
about mm-hmm I said what that would like
to do today is really just share a
couple of lessons that we learned over
the last 14 or so months when we were
working on that I think there a lot of
react projects out there but I think
they are not actually not so many in
that scale so there may be a figure
there may be some interesting aspects to
that so I would like to start with the
first maybe the most powerful learning
actually divide and conquer what do I
mean by that so I think most of you
probably know that the high-level
architecture of flux right you have your
stage you have your view whenever the
state changes you really render your
view either speech dispatch reactions
close the full cycle somewhere along the
way you do your side effects well nice
and tidy everybody understands that
beautiful unidirectional flow of control
in reality however if you build a really
large application it looks far more like
that right state is huge
hard to control a true monster the same
for the output and the side effects
right every single one of them is cute
but you have so many Jesus so it's
really hard right and we don't want that
so let's look at a concrete JIRA
application for a second JIRA screen so
this is a Cheever issue if you if you
know it open dinner in a in a modal if
you have good eyes you can see that
there is a board software board in the
background and on the on the left hand
side from your perspective there is a
navigation bar so obviously we could
build this as one large react Redux app
right it would probably look like that
right it would be really hard a lot of
code to manage so do we want that nope
now that we already divided our view
into kind of logical pieces
why wouldn't we build a navigation app
that just deals with navigation state
just deals with navigation view
just used with navigation side effects
sounds reasonably easy right and we
could do the same for the board just
build a board app the deals with what
concerns and finally build an issue app
that deals with issue concerns and this
is actually what we do in JIRA we call
this an app that's really I think the
main concept in our code base when dude
cheer developers talk to each other you
will hear the app the word app quite a
bit not in the mobile context but in the
cheer context so what's an app an app
really just combines a view with a bit
of state and optionally some side
effects nothing special all right
the important thing is just that that
whole thing is clearly bounded through a
JSX interface so that whole thing is
really just a component right and very
powerful but still just a react
component that retrieves all its data
through props and files all its events
also its props all the internals really
don't really matter right from a
consumer perspective so a very concert
we call this state didn't call this
store because we may use Redux
but it actually doesn't matter right use
components they'd use understated use
whatever makes you happy the only thing
that is important is from the outside
it's just a component so you get to that
really nice setup where if you want to
render an issue which is actually a
pretty complicated piece of piece of
logic a lot of fields that you can show
or not show all you need to do is is
mount that component and pass in the
issue key the component would retrieve
all its data by itself and render nicely
and if you're actually interested in a
change event sure be my guest
wretches then on change handler easy
enough right so the question remains
though now that I have my different apps
navigation board issue how to actually
wire them up right how did they play
together it's actually quite simple the
only thing that you need is you need
some kind of orchestration layer on top
of that they're actually just wires the
properties of the different component
together now that looks a little bit
complicated but really try to think of
an app just as a component right and if
you would look at a setup like this so
it says there's a text field that shows
some value and there's a button with the
label on with a label submit and if you
click it we do something with the with
the with the value I think everybody who
did a bit of react development came
across that and everybody can solve that
right it's trivial use redirect use
component state use whatever makes you
happy now
really you can just replace the input
here with an issue and you can replace
the button with the board it's dealing
with more complicated components right
but the logic is still the same super
trivial to the wire so if you now call
 on me and say do you do you
talking about divide and conquer but
really it's just composition you're
right it is really just composition
there's nothing special about that I
really just want to point out that if
you work on something as large as JIRA
you want to get this right I do you want
to get your composition vision your
actual vision right from the get-go the
second lesson that I would like to talk
about ownership I think we've all been
there done that
work in a really large code base where
some code exists that really nobody
feels responsible for but it's there but
nobody owns it it's a nightmare it's
terrible it's a clear indication that
everything is going south we experienced
that a little bit in Sierra and wanted
to get it under control ASAP so what we
did is we build a system around what we
call manifests so a manifest is really
just a JSON file that specifies an owner
and all code that lives next to that
manifest file or in subfolders is owned
by this this individual by this team and
that's if you commit a code that is not
associated with a manifest jason with
you built so there's no code that does
not have a clear owner define somewhere
and that's already useful so I can look
at our directory based app I spare the
details and I can immediately see that
my my buddy Camilla is the owner of that
app beautiful we did something water we
built a little bot that for reasons that
I never fully understood was called
golem and what it does is it's really
just a bit bucket what would work on
github as well
dad monitors your your changes the
changes that you are committing in your
PR and figures out if your a touching
code that is not actually owned by you
and your team and if you do that it
automatically adds reviewers from that
other team to the PR so there's no
sneaking through little subtle changes
there's no you know unintentionally
screwing something up works really
nicely for us let's number three being
opinionated that is a more interesting
one I think so with that concept of an
app and the clear ownership what we have
in you know to your fondant repo is from
a high level perspective it's really
nice and tidy right we have all the
little boxes that represent an app have
the clear API you may wire them up in
whatever way you want or good if you
look in at an individual app if you're
honest with yourself they actually all
quite similar from a conceptual level
right they are all react we Dax placed
in our case they all follow our design
guidelines to all use our component
library they all talk to JIRA
standpoints
they all do this and that say they
actually not that different and you
would reckon that all these boxes into
your front-end I actually code that in a
somewhat similar way was structured in a
somewhat similar way however what we
figured out is that we're really talking
apples and pears here and a whole lot of
other fruits which really means that we
have and I'm simplifying a little bit
yeah but we got to a point where we had
let's say 50 apps and 50 different
architectures now I said cool I don't
think so because it it made the whole
repository incredibly difficult to
reason about all right so you get used
to one app and at some point you want to
look at another app and it's a whole
bloody new universe you don't even know
where to start right everything is
upside-down mm-hmm but we could probably
deal with that I think the more
frustrating part is actually that you
get really really bad in sharing code
and sharing knowledge right because you
kind of start solving the same problems
all over again you think you find a
really good solution on structuring your
Redux reducer great but who knows maybe
another app has solved it much better
already
and even if I figure out I may not be
able to use it right because the whole
big picture it's just completely
different and that solution may be great
but it doesn't work for me that's all
very frustrating so what we kicked off
in JIRA so that's the JIRA internal
announcement slide was a program called
tangerine where we really kind of
rallied our forces and said that we as
an engineering to you need to become
opinionated on what are the right
patterns practices and technologies to
build a large-scale react application
right if we can't figure that out
nobody can so the goal was to define
these principles and make sure that
everybody is happy with them and
everybody actually uses them so on a
higher level what we wanted to achieve
is we wanted to get from this basket of
fruits to something like that right sure
every app still has a slightly different
flavor every app has a slightly
different color some are bigger some are
smaller that's all fine but they should
at least follow the same world-class
high-level principles so the the process
if you want that we that we decided to
use for that is decide document do where
decide is probably the
the hardest part really so if you think
about problem-solving the first part is
actually always to find different
different solutions to your problem
right and the larger your team the more
brains you can use the better solutions
you can find so that's great but the
more people the better the modem area it
gets really hard though if you get to
the point where from all the different
solutions that people were finding you
actually want to agree on one that's
really hard right so there's a
lot of shrugging going on and I think
we've been all in that we often in a
situation like that I know if all under
I disagree on something we can get in
front of a whiteboard and sweat it out
right there's no problem with that but
if there were 150 people that gets
really really hard so what we
established in JIRA is a pretty rigid
process of how an idea a problem if you
want goes from a very rough idea to a
principle that is locked in and final
and should be used by everyone doesn't
mean that it may not get changed in the
future but for the time being this is
how we do I actually similar to the
process that the ACMA script Committee
is using for language adaptions that
whole process is guided is facilitated
by a dedicated front and committee which
is really a bunch of you know pinchable
developers architects folks who know
what they're doing these are not the
actual members of the committee though I
would really love to have mark on out of
which on it but I think the most
important thing is we are representing
different parts of our organization
which is quite challenging in a team at
largest as cheer actually we have a
couple of external advisors so these are
these are folks who are from different
parts of Atlassian or even from
completely outside the company and there
are a couple of seats that we are
rotating in and out so that we get some
some fresh insight some fresh parts to
the committee that's working quite
nicely actually and we identified where
we locked in a couple of
of really good principles in ceará high
level app folder structure hard one very
spicy took us a while to figure it out
but I think we're quite happy with that
now
but there are more that are less
controversial I guess no how do you
compose your smart component and your
dumb components how do you compose your
reducers that's it's not rocket science
you I just want to pick one principle
and stick to it and really like the
small media queries like in flow do you
use the one notation or do you use the
other notation is it the most important
thing if the word nope
is it one less thing to worry about 100%
absolutely so we actually have a pretty
rich set of principles these days which
the next step would be the document so
we'll put that on something like this
don't search for it doesn't exist yet
coming soon that would be awesome and
finally do right we have our principles
we have documented them it's now time to
do actually implement them and code them
and that's really the easy part right
every engineer laughs building good code
everybody every engineer loves following
good strong principles the only thing
that engineers love even more than doing
that themselves is have a robot do it
for them which brings me to our fourth
and last learning ready kelly automate
so in JIRA we developed quite a passion
if not obsession with all forms of
static code analysis mostly years liened
so we actually have a ton so we use all
that the standard is liberal a B&amp;amp;B
configurational or whatever their
standard is we use that in a lot about
that but then we have a ton of custom
rules that we actually code it for cheer
specific principles that live in an hour
in our code base directly or when the
process of open sourcing some
particularly good ones and it's actually
quite an interesting experience to code
in JIRA because you write your code the
moment when you hit save you may get
something quite different from what you
forgot to type before which takes a bit
get used to it but it's actually
incredibly incredibly cool so I just
want to share my favorite we will should
want to brag about it because it's so
 cool
look at look at that I don't know about
you but for me this makes me sick I'd
look at all the imports there's no
structure there's no sorting the library
imports there are relative imports there
are absolute imports imports down to
highway kita imports up the hierarchy I
hate it
so what you can do in JIRA is just press
save and you get this isn't a beautiful
group I kind of imported it said the
module is it said relative is it
absolute alphabetically sorted there's a
bit of semantic sweating in there as
well that you can configure I love it
so much less time spent on renting in
the arse and arguing on whether that
employ should be on top of the other one
or not it's just locked in that's how we
do another thing that we developed and
that's actually open source already is a
thing called strict are so strict that
is quite similar to be aslant but it
doesn't so much focus on individual
files what years Lim does but really
focuses on a project as a whole my
favorite rule layer is the circular
dependency rule which identifies circles
but not only on file level but on folder
level so think about this let's say you
have a view folder that contains all
your reacted stuff and you have a state
folder that contains all your redact
stuff
it's perfectly normal perfectly
acceptable that view imports from state
because after all you got our end or
something right you gotta get your data
from somewhere now what could happen
might actually happen quite often is
that somebody for whatever reason
introduces some dependency from state
back to view which is but you
shouldn't do that and strix that will
tell you and stricter will break your
build so we are talking about a
unidirectional dependency graph or
direct the dependency graph which is
pretty awesome another thing that we use
twixtor for that is just to indicate how
opinionated we
is a rule that defines the structure of
an app really on a file name and folder
name basis so don't don't read this
configuration it's not important but
what you may or may not be able to see
here is that all the different apps that
we have actually look there is similar
view if you if you look at the middie
idea right so you know there's no I
named this file this you name that just
file dad that's not all naming it the
same which allows you to build a really
strong mental model of how an app works
it makes it really easy to jump into one
if you want to change nothing so this
really rounds it up for me so I think
number one learning for me is is divide
and conquer if I'm stating the complete
obvious to you that's great if that's
not the case then think about it when
building your next react application
next one is generate generate and I
guess support some sense of ownership ya
seen that manifest chasing there
different ways to do that this one is
really strict in that it guarantees that
no file doesn't actually have an owner
be opinionated that's I guess a bit of a
controversial one and it has been
controversial within geo as well but my
personal recommendation is don't be
afraid don't shy away from being
opinionated across teams all right sure
there may be some pushback everybody is
proud and opinionated on on their way of
doing but in the long run you will you
will have more more effective and
actually happier happier people in the
organization and last but not least or
the major out of it
right so you can agree on all the
principles of the world if nobody
follows them they are worthless but and
one way to do that is just keep an eye
on it in PRS but we all know how humans
are at seeing slips through and you get
a broken window theory we're slowly
everything falls apart
robots don't make these mistakes if done
right so have a look at Ashland at the
US Mint Docs it's actually great
fun to do that I love nothing more than
writing a you know a casual yes Liam
jubilant evening brilliant that's it for
me yeah yes Atlassian the company that I
work for was kind enough to sponsor this
event I can say a few words about
Atlassian so Atlassian doesn't only
build cheer but also builds a couple of
other tools that you may or may not know
so Atlassian builds confluence bitbucket
and also Trello all teams that all
products that help teams to work
together more effectively headquarters
in Sydney but we have large engineering
offices also in Boston and New York City
and was in the Bay Area so there's
mountain builders San Francisco there a
couple of other offices around the world
I just spent a week in beautiful Gdansk
in Poland and they're actually a couple
of folks working from Austria remotely
and we're hiring really across all these
offices
I personally hire up for for Sydney but
in general we're hiring everywhere and
across all all usual roles so front end
certainly a big focus area up it is I'm
always happy to do hire full-stack
developers and that can develop us as
well
so if you're interested I'll stick
around for a bit let's grab a beer
together I have a couple of these
t-shirts here that I happily trade for
contact information so I'm just grabbing
on a more personal note actually
relocated myself from Vienna to Sydney a
couple of years ago it is a really good
place to live that's actually from my
apartment windows a good good place to
have your morning coffee very open
society brought my girlfriend she
obviously likes it as well the only
thing that I really miss is good old
Krishna kyle super so every time I fly
from from Vienna to Sydney this is what
my suitcase looks like this is it for me
