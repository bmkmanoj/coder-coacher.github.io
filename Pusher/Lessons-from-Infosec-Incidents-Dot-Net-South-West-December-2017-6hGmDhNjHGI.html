going to talk to you about lessons from
InfoSec incidence tonight so what can we
learn from a variety of things that
happens or other companies so they don't
happen to us and I was looking for a
picture it's it kind of illustrate fail
and I found this and I think it's not
InfoSec but it's a good example of a
security problem so you know a great big
gate there metal spikes on the top
that's all brilliant but all it takes is
to know the right secret and you defeat
the security so we don't to be in a
position like that really so hopefully
we can learn something from some of
these things so Who am I well my name is
Robin Minh so I am Technical Architect
software developer I work for a company
called buy box we're a logistics supply
chain management company technology
based we work globally but were based in
the UK I've got a distributed team of
software developers which I'm one always
looking for new people of course as is
everybody nowadays I've had an interest
in security probably almost as long as
I've had an interest in in computing so
I don't know if anybody who recognizes
what these are but these are BBC be
micro computers and we had a lab very
similar to this in school and me and a
friend would sit down and in those days
you'd you'd get a magazine to get your
source code you can get it off the
internet and one of us would be reading
it and there's going to be typing trying
to trying to get this software into the
computer and the bits off one I
remembered one bit of software we we
acquired that way and built built into
something bigger we used to take over
the entire network every single machine
was singing a song displaying some key
Fix and the teacher was basically
standing there not really understanding
what was going on completely bewildered
yeah and that mate of mine is now on the
security team at Google so quick show of
hands but do something slightly
different can you see that
if you go to that URL I'm gonna do it
I'm gonna do a poll with technology
rather than the show hands
see if this works so HTTP etcc h / v V
small V small Zed's
large W you got that it's all safe for
promise this is not one of the lessons
no I mean this this is really just a bit
of information gathering and I can
almond often I'll put I'll get people to
put their hands up and that's great if
you look around where I am but for you
guys you won't know what the score is so
with this I can show the results and
everyone will know so as everyone people
got that okay I'll start then so
question one what's your primary role
you developer architect QA what oh look
at that it works laughs we got out and
never guess what that top answer is how
we all done let's go that bingo software
develop all we got some other who's
another what you okay you couldn't you
know K alright alright cool one more
question
what's your primary language now this is
not that Southwest so there's input
COBOL in the list so are y'all in a lot
there's a late camera with something
that all look at that anymore for
anymore okay
he's the other what you okay fair enough
fair enough
right okay so I will put that aside for
a moment and carry on thank you very
much for that that's helpful for me
hopefully helpful for you let's give
this
right so why do we care about security
lots of reasons really
people people are trusting their data to
us and our applications that might be
our personal data that might be company
later we really don't want to be in a
situation where our company's in the
headlines like this this is V Tech in
2015 where they lost loads of personal
details about lots of their customers
and their customers kids and it's not a
great place to be there's data
protection regulations out there now
they're getting much tougher next year
with GD P R I don't know if you've
really with that but bigger penalties
people will start going to jail
potentially the board would be very
interested in in what's going on as well
so hopefully some of that will will mean
that we do improve but we need to know
how to improve another reason we don't
want to be losing our data I don't know
if anyone's familiar with this website
but you know this is a breach aggregator
from Troy hunt you know you really don't
want to end up on that list of people
who've lost their data so how are we
doing in terms of security well not
brilliantly 4.8 billion records lost
since 2013 now I left that slide in
there that's from last year actually now
it's more like 9 million and it's
getting worse because the frequency is
increasing as well so lesson one know
your enemy
this is a typical hacker everyone knows
this this person always wearing a hoodie
not secured in green but it's a bit more
nuanced than that I think so
you know it might be a script Kitty or I
mean it could be a disgruntled employee
activists could be organized crime
industrial espionage even up to
nation-state actors and I think you know
you really need to think about that
because I think the Sony probably didn't
think that they were going to be
attacked by a nation-state in the form
of North Korea just for producing a
movie but that's actually what happened
similarly the BBC also had North Korea
trying to prevent them broadcast in a
documentary on North Korea so you know
you can be affected at all sorts of
different levels and I think it's
important to think about that there's a
25% risk that it might be someone inside
your company that's gonna cause you some
problems like this this is all
statistics from the 2017 data breach
investigations report from a company
called Verizon in the u.s. they're big
telco I mean one of the big motivators
is obviously money 73% of breaches are
financially motivated so another big
motivator and so threat modeling is kind
of the the big thing that you want to
think about here I've heard a great
expression which I really like which is
evil user stories so you're doing your
scrub and you've got user stories well
actually think about it from a from an
evil user perspective and I think that's
really powerful so what about incidents
that we can learn from well here's one
William Hill taken off the internet from
a DDoS attack I'll talk a bit about DDoS
and what that is in a second
but again this is this is this speaks to
that that that portrayal of your hacker
in the hoodie and often it's not just
your evil criminal mastermind sometimes
it's just a teenager in his bedroom this
is a young guy from mr. Sherr charged
with running DDoS services a teen that
suspended sentence probably got a lift
home from court by his mom you know that
sort of thing so what is DDoS well you
got your attacker in the top corner
there
you got your webserver in the bottom
corner there
the attackers got a control server and a
set of zombies he sends a message to his
controller that sends the message some
messages to all of his zombies that
floods loader requests towards your
server and basically just hit takes it
off the internet those zombies might be
servers on the internet or pcs in
people's homes or it might be even
Reuters IOT devices so denial of service
is used by script kiddies to knock their
friends off the internet when they're
playing games but it could be to take
you off the internet stop you from doing
business blackmail you into paying them
a ransom to let you kind of continue
your business I mean it could some of
these guys just knock each other off the
internet just because of just for shits
and giggles really
I hope they might just be offended an
interesting technique is to use denial
of service as a distraction so you take
some off the internet but actually
you're you're actually breaking into a
system somewhere else so that's yeah a
big distraction I mean you can defend
against this by having a trap traffic
scrubbing and proxy in front of your
website so something like CloudFlare or
Akamai will happily take your money to
to take that bandwidth away from you and
that can be incredibly effective but it
could be quite expensive so I mean this
is going to be the biggest
deal if you're a big financial company
so you know William Hill mentioned there
but bookmakers are a big target for this
because it's obviously there as soon as
they're offered off the internet they're
losing they're losing money and the
criminals know that one of the other
things I was going to show you is a good
demonstration of attacks now this is
this is a great illustration of the
attacks that are going on at the moment
this is from a company called North
score great looking great looking map
great to show to the boss not quite sure
how effective it is or how real the data
is but there you go looks amazing and
one thing you can do on top of that you
can make your own so here's the dot ness
net Southwest attack map it's all
completely real nothing fake about this
you can even customize the sounds so
they go your very own attack map and
that's some github it's not mine I
didn't write it I can't take credit for
it but so you know it's great share that
to your boss
tell him you're under attack ask for
some more money so the next lesson cover
the basics
can anyone see the problem with this I'm
logged in and there's a little tick
there that shows that I'm logged in and
yes you're right no HTTP now yeah yeah
that's helpful thanks Chrome I think
that just means that yes so many
passwords yeah no you're right you're
right yeah and no no no padlock on the
left though
so no HTTPS no test codes have to fix
this but before they did you could sniff
the traffic off the network so if you if
you've got the if you're on an open
Wi-Fi hotspot for example in in in
Starbucks you can you can watch the
traffic go by and you can grab the
cookies and then this in a specific case
you could grab the cookies take the
session cookies put them into your
browser and suddenly you're you're
effectively logged on as the other
person and you might think well I don't
connect to open Wi-Fi hotspots well you
know I wouldn't do that but you know how
do you know you're not connecting to
something like a Wi-Fi pineapple which
is a device for impersonating white
networks that you know about so your
hope if your home network or it's more
likely going to be Airport Wi-Fi or
something that you've connected to in
the past all of that is in your phone or
your laptop as soon as your phone or
laptop tries to make it basically sends
out a probe request saying hello why are
you there Wi-Fi network this will say
yes Here I am so this will basically
respond as hundreds of different Wi-Fi
networks and you can then basically
proxy all of the traffic through that
and you could potentially even strip yes
a cell out of the out of the request and
response so that people end up on an
insecure connection anyway and that
there are protections against that which
we can talk about in a second but yeah
you know you might be unwittingly
connecting to a hot spot that you
weren't expecting so I think if HTTPS as
security pixie dust you know it's it's
pretty simple to do it secures that
traffic in transit doesn't really do
much more than that but you know there's
not really any excuse not to do that now
so it mitigates all sorts of issues
there even features in html5 that will
only work over HTTP and the geolocation
I think is one example so if you haven't
got HD TPS you can't use some of these
features so that the whole internet is
moving towards that and it's not it's
not expensive to do you can go to let's
encrypt org and get a free certificate
from them that's pretty straightforward
or you could put some light cloud for it
flare in front of your in front of your
website and and get it that way as well
they'll provide SSL certificates that
keep up to date for you so there's lots
of lots of things that you can do I
think you need to make sure that you
keep that up to date so there are tools
tools like SSL labs which will validate
your SSL configuration and you can get a
score which is great oh good got an A
that's by box thank you very much
that will that you know that you can get
you can get your SSL configuration wrong
if you basically take the configuration
of a Windows server out the box for
example that's not gonna be set up as it
should be so you have to pay attention
to that and I mentioned the ability to
strip SSL from your from your
connections when you're connecting to
websites you know something like this
might run a bit of software that
basically intercepts the traffic strips
the HTTPS off your connections and puts
you back to a an insecure connection you
may or may not have heard of HTTP secure
sorry strict Transport Security which is
a which is a header that you put in your
on your web server to
enter the organ to your browser which
says this this connection should always
be over HTTPS and that's a mitigation
against having the SSL connection
stripped off so that's kind of something
to think about as well and then there's
various details about that in terms of
what happens the first time you came to
the website I'm not going to go into
that but you know look at HTH sts HTTP
secure trick Transport Security has a
really great measure for making sure
that you stay encrypted when you should
be and in that vein I just wanted to do
a nerve the poll so if you go back to
your phones and I do so I'm really
interested you know bunch of developers
in the room
it's HTTPS and then that you worry about
or do you think you can you can hand it
off to somebody else
or 55 oh okay you're looking for flex to
the front there have you got a different
answer so you saying that you could
could pass it off to somebody but they
wouldn't do it properly okay okay
interesting right good cool so okay
pretty mixed thank you very much jelly I
was really helpful because then as devs
you know we may or may not have to deal
with that sort of stuff so you know do I
should I be talking about that more
here's another here's another lesson I
think we can okay on a minute let's get
back come back to that
here's another lesson so yeah it's it's
not just companies that are under attack
the government are under attack as well
and they've they had a bit of a problem
with people trying to brute force the
passwords on their on their accounts in
Parliament and well as he more
recently it turns out that they give
their passwords out pretty much to
anybody anyway which I think might
change given some of that publicity that
they've had recently but you know there
are probably nation-states trying to
trying to do it remotely trying to log
into their accounts so I think there's a
lot we can do there you're really into
computers yeah what are you doing going
into the school's computer
today we might ever have to put that
phone into where they change the
password every couple of weeks but I
know where they write it down soon n
days you didn't even have a username
it's just half a factor not even T
factor yeah so passwords are a big
problem 81% of hacking related breaches
were leveraging stolen or weak
credentials passwords so I think there's
a there's a bit of an issue there what
do we do well we can help our users we
need and the latest the latest advice
from you know the cyber security in the
UK and also in the u.s. is that we want
to be much less restrictive be nice to
our users use technical defenses instead
of big complexity rules so no more
complexity rules allow long passwords
allow any characters even emojis allow
people to use password managers because
that's the great solution to having
hundreds of passwords and you know
you're trying to encourage your users to
not reuse the same password everywhere
because that's leading to trouble
because that password is probably going
to be out in the open you know train
users to avoid creating passwords that
are guessable that sort of thing
and identify Maps just already said this
but you know I think the advice that you
have to change your password every month
or every three months or every six
months so that's now that's now going
away you only change it if you know
there's has been a compromise and I
think one one great approach is to ban
passwords that are obvious so you know
that that password there it's not a
great password it might have
substitutions and numbers and symbols
but actually it's a terrible password
and I think I'll show a bit
I share an example of why that's such a
bad bad password I mentioned have I been
poned earlier
Troy hunt actually released all of the
passwords that he he's collected over
the many years of aggregating breaches
so you know if I type in that password
that I just showed you so capital P a
couple of dollars w0 Rd yeah no that's
that ones that ones in the list and so
people will use this lists like this to
brute force passwords so actually we can
use the same list to prevent people from
using those passwords there's no reason
why any of those passwords should be
used I mean by box has been blacklisting
passwords in that way since 2012 and we
had a list of 7,000 those top the most
popular passwords so you could you can
do something you could take thousand a
hundred thousand you could even take
that however many million that Troy hunt
has published and stop people from using
those passwords in your systems in a
similar vein over had a bit of a problem
recently where they uh played it
uploaded credentials into their github
repository so this was a combination of
attacks so somebody needed to compromise
their their developers presumably to get
into their github repository so that was
probably password reuse one of their
developers using a password which had
been compromised somewhere else
attackers get into their github
repository and then they've got Amazon
credentials or something similar in
their github so it might be a private
github but don't put don't put secure
information into it because you never
know when it might not be private
anymore you might you might make it
public by accident or somebody else
might make it public on your on your
behalf so that's something else to be
very wary of
now amazon have got an extension forget
call get secrets which you can plug into
your get running locally and it will
check to see if if you if you're putting
credentials into in to get for you know
arms and buckets or something similar or
you know API keys now obviously that's
that's really just relating to Amazon
but you know you might do something
similar and I think actually that there
are there's even been mention of
certainly there were certainly BOTS
looking at new commits into the github
to look for this stuff on behalf of the
body so I'm sure that goodies might you
know get there in the end and start
doing the same thing is there anyone who
isn't familiar with a wasp okay a few
people probably half the room in fact so
wasp is the open web application
security project it's a charity there's
a set of user groups and they produce
projects articles and documentation and
standards around security
aimed at aimed at fixing a lot this
stuff now they've got a really
well-known project called the
top ten one of their most well known and
that there's a new version out this year
and they talked about each of the
vulnerabilities that are around and
which are most prevalent which you know
so the number one is the most prevalent
the biggest risk that sort of thing and
they're the they they talk about how you
fix that what what the risk is and the
ways you can go about fixing that within
the top ten and there are also much more
detailed projects on there's some great
cheat sheets that are really helpful in
terms of using you know you might have a
problem with cross-site scripting that
you want to think about so you could
look at the cheat sheet for that and it
would give you all sorts of ways to test
for it and ways to fix it and there's
tools like a wasp zap
the zed attack proxy which is a great
little tool that you you install locally
or you can run it from docker you point
your you basically proxy your browser
through zap and it basically analyzes
the traffic to and from your website so
you can be doing this while you're doing
development and it's it's basically
looking for problems all the time and
then you can just basically look at the
issues that it's found and you come up
with it'll give you suggestions for how
you fix it so I think from it from a
dotnet perspective we're pretty good
there's a lot of mitigations in the
framework you know so you might be
already using lots of those I think the
key there is probably not to turn them
off but in terms of the number one
vulnerability sequel injection or sorry
injection not just sequel injection you
might be familiar with this cartoon from
x8 xkcd which talks about little Bobbie
tables if you haven't seen that it's
great you look it up it's great
and that's something about sequel
injection using untrusted input from the
user in ways that that's really not
expected by the application now I'll
talk a bit more about the fact that it's
not just sequel but certainly sequel
injection is still a big issue TalkTalk
got fine 400,000 pounds after this
attack in 2015 this wasn't this wasn't
their first problem so I think that's
why but that's the last of the largest
fine that the Information Commissioner's
Office has passed down on a company burn
dodgy under gdpr that could be 20
million potentially and it was a sequel
injection attack so you know they could
have fixed it really nowadays
Instagram had a Sam had a problem where
a young lad from Finland
found a way to delete comments with a
similar similar situation and this is a
great one so this is a election
tampering in the US and they found a
sequel injection of vulnerability there
and really you know this stuff's been
going on for a long time this this is
this is frack magazine which is a an
old-school online magazine this is
actually from 1998 December 1998 and in
there they talk about sequel injection
this is not a new problem and really
something that we should all be well
aware of so I'll talk about it from a
sequel perspective so you've got a user
user forum a password a user name
password form here on your on your
website you you take the the data and
you pass it into a string with a bit of
string format and if somebody passes in
the right format of injects ejected code
you end up not requiring a password at
all in that sequel and so this is a
fairly well-known problem and I hope in
the dotnet space we're probably not
doing that anymore
but you know it's worth mentioning and
that untrusted user input could come
from a form but it could also come from
a query string or a cookie or an HTTP
header so we really you know you need to
be thinking about more than just this
scenario here and as I say it's not just
it's not just sequel so there are
attacks against Mongo and it's probably
going to be attacks anywhere where
you're mixing commands and data in that
way
so yes parameterised queries use lease
privilege so you know allow only allow
access to the data that the user should
be able to access I mean maybe it's
read-only stop them from deleting stuff
and you know you can whitelist input or
validate input in to prevent this kind
of thing happening another lesson so we
got any any Ashley Madison customers in
the room sir
so this this one there were they had all
sorts of problems with their systems but
the flaw in their authentication meant
that they a couple of passwords were
compromised now in this case they'd
actually gone to quite a lot of trouble
they use bcrypt to store their passwords
but unfortunately there's somewhere else
in the code that used an md5 hash which
is trivially easy to to get the password
back from it even though it's supposedly
a one-way function so what do we do
about that well in this case I'd
probably say don't do the don't do the
authentication yourself unless you
unless you really know what you're doing
so you can use a separate authentication
provider it might be a espied asp.net
identity sort of basic level but you
might use something like identity server
or you might just allow Facebook or
Google or one of the authentication
providers to to do that authentication
for you or if you are going to roll your
own make sure you understand how you're
going to secure those passwords so that
they're not in plain text and not
reversible encryption and using a
suitable algorithm and one thing I'd
like to mention which doesn't come up
very often I think is is crypt crypto
agility if you are storing your own
encrypted data right be it hashing or or
reversible encryption store it in a way
that you can change that encryption
going forwards so that as attacks get
better and they always do you can change
your algorithm to adapt I think that's
it
a really helpful thing that I don't see
enough of so cross-site scripting this
is a bug that happened to eBay again 25
2016 this has dropped down the OWASP top
10 this is dropped from from 3 to 7 so
you might think that actually it's going
out of fashion and again in the.net
space there is
there's output encoding built into the
framework if you're if you're kind of
using it in the right way
it's almost safe by default and you're
probably going to be alright as long as
you're not switching that sort of thing
off but I think actually I think this
year there's gonna be a lot more people
looking at looking for these
vulnerabilities in website so I'll talk
about why in a minute so just a really
quick look at cross-site scripting so
here's a I'm accepting a username here
and in that username I'm passing in a
bit of script and in a cross-site
scripting attack the browser receives
that bit of code and inserts it into the
HTML and suddenly that JavaScript runs
and steals the cookies so again it's
untrusted data from the from the user
there's variations on the attack the it
might be reflected so used you send
something to the web server it sends it
back to you I'll show you that in a
second or it might be you might persist
it into your database and then it comes
back to bite you later but it's
basically allowing arbitrary JavaScript
to run in your browser to attack user
sessions to face websites insert hostile
content redirect users you know install
malware that sort of thing and again it
comes to that back to not trusting that
user input escaping it using the correct
encoding for HTML or CSS or JavaScript
and you know the framework will help you
there generally but you know you can't
use some of the
HTML encoding in net in the JavaScript
because that wouldn't kind of work
you've got HD you've got request
validation in asp.net don't turn it off
if you do need to turn it off turn it
off for the minimum amount don't turn it
off for the whole app you know be really
be aware of what you're doing there and
then content security policy is another
great technique for for dealing with
cross-site scripting and I think if you
can build that into your app early on
it's it's really easy to do again it's
another HTTP header that you that you
serve with your application and in that
you're specifying where you can run
JavaScript or where the trusted
JavaScript comes from so you can turn
off inline JavaScript and that basically
DIF that stops pretty much most
cross-site scripting attacks so I just
wanted to show you the power of
cross-site scripting I'm gonna go over
here so this is Bob's discount diamonds
this is a dotnet app that I wrote it's
it's basically deliberately flawed it's
just to demonstrate some of these these
problems so you know you can you can go
around and look at the various diamonds
that are available and you can send a
message here I can say hello that's very
says hello back so why not do here is
actually let's have some JavaScript in
there
and because I've done the wrong thing in
my code when it comes back it actually
sends it's put up an alert box just zoom
in so that alert box comes becomes
because I've allowed that JavaScript to
run inside my application and once you
can do that you can do all sorts of
things so let me show you I'm gonna grab
this bit of script so what you get back
in the browser is it so you know it's
nothing to see here this is great except
if I go over to this other application
of the web browser which is here this is
a thing called beef the browser
exploitation framework so what what this
is done I've run that JavaScript and
it's now running in the browser and that
has allowed me to well that bit of
JavaScript is is communicating with this
virtual machine running up in Azure and
hopefully I should be able to send
commands to this browser so there's all
sorts of things that you can do in here
you can get information about what's
running in the browser you can smooth
that out of the way
you can the social engineering things
are quite interesting so if I do that
something over there seeing now
hopefully in a second now look that's
Clippy so if I click yes I can it'll it
will let me download an executable and
who knows what the executables then
going to do could do anything right or
you know maybe Google one's quite kids
see so once you've got JavaScript
running in the browser on somebody
else's browser you know all sorts of
good things so let's see if this is
going to redirect okay so would you type
your username and password into that
maybe you would as soon as you do it's
going to come back into my console over
here and then I can log into your Google
Mail so that's the power of cross-site
scripting and I think yeah once you're
there you can do all sorts I mentioned
that I thought I thought we're going to
see a bit of a comeback for cross-site
scripting and the reason I think we're
going to see it come back for cross-site
scripting is that you can now run
Bitcoin mining in the browser so I saw a
tweet today where somebody had gone to a
Starbucks in Brazil and they suddenly
found that their browser was was mining
Bitcoin for somebody else and the reason
it did that is because their when in
that case it was an open Wi-Fi hotspot
so they'd they'd manipulated the HTML as
it went through the open Wi-Fi hotspot
you know similar to what I could do with
this but if you've got a cross-site
scripting vulnerability in your web site
if someone can leverage that to send
basically the JavaScript for Bitcoin
mining into your into your customers
browsers I think there's a real scope
there for a lot of people to do a lot of
Bitcoin mining and I think I think
that's why cross-site scripting isn't
going to go away just yet the next
lesson I'm again pretty close to the end
I see for me it's continuous improvement
one of the problems I think we've got is
that we build software and it's finished
and we deploy it and we're done
unfortunately the rest of the world
doesn't stop just because we've finished
with our project so dependencies in our
code have vulnerabilities in them our
own code make our own code may not have
vulnerabilities in them but you know is
the jQuery library that you're using
up-to-date what about some of the other
bits and pieces that you're using you
know do you need the latest version of
reactors or is there a problem with that
so I think you know really we need to
keep an eye on those dependencies to
keep our applications secure I think for
me that's really important now get her
back she have a project to which i think
is which is brilliant and that will scan
your your code in github and it will
look at the dependencies and it will
tell you if some of them have
vulnerabilities based on this CVE
databases CV database contains all of
the known vulnerabilities in various
code and they're still there actively
scanning to detect that which is
brilliant but the language support is
limited so I think if you're in Java
Script is probably okay but that and
there's a few others that are coming but
I think you know it's a bit of a way to
go there and I think that's really
helpful the other thing
it's catching problems early so you know
here's your here's your development
pipeline you know your plan code test
release deploy operate perhaps so you've
got your dev and you've op so oh maybe
on maybe your now DevOps where do you
where does your security happen
does it happen here maybe does it happen
here possibly really at least happen
here so in the same way that you
involved it Devon ops together and
you've probably got QA in there too
so I've heard people talk about dev QA
ops well you know I think it needs to be
dev QA dev dev set QA ops etc you know
there's no point how it having brought
these two silos together and forgetting
about the rest we need to include QA too
I think you're probably undoubtedly if
you're doing DevOps you're undoubtedly
involving Q way anyway so bring security
and as well get them in up front and
yeah I think that's that's that's the
way to do it we know that that bugs cost
more money the longer you leave them
doesn't matter whether they're feature
bugs or whether they're security bugs
get them early one last poll
okay
I'm really interested to know what the
next thing you're really interested in
learning about and I've put a few
oxygens down there it might come down to
other for everything but I'd be
fascinated to know oh this one's
multiple choice so you can pick more
than one or across the board look at
that
let's see what the answer is answers are
okay cool
so I've done a lightning talk on iOS
blackbook she'll come into the security
testing thing I've got a talk on
authentication that I can do as well so
that's great thank you very much
there's some resources on my blog hey
Robin intercom slash talks
slash fail time for questions
has anyone got any questions one
question
crypto agility yeah
okay so if you asked let's say you're
storing passwords in a database and you
know that bcrypt
is a great algorithm today and I mean
bcrypt has actually got some features
built-in to enable crypto agility so
I'll talk about both bcrypt has a work
factor so you can you can vary how hard
that algorithm works to hash your your
password so it might actually do say ten
thousand iterations of the algorithm to
give you the hashed result that means to
get that if you want to brute-force that
algorithm by where you take the you take
the plaintext and you put it into the
algorithm you get the hashed value out
and then you compare it to the one
you're trying to brute force and you do
that with a dictionary or a big long
list of combinations and eventually
you'll get the you'll get the answer if
you make that algorithm slow to run say
ten thousand iterations it's going to
take you a long time to brute-force that
the result that you you're looking for
and so in B Crips you've got a work
factor so you might increase it to more
than ten thousand iterations a hundred
thousand iterations so as processors get
faster as you start throwing more
hardware at it you increase the work
factor and it makes it it means that the
the the speed that the algorithm runs as
processors increase you can tune it so
so the attacks don't inevitably get
faster and then crypto agility is kind
of the next level of that you know
you're using bcrypt but actually now
you're in the future you want to move to
there's another algorithm called s
script or perhaps I think it's called
argon which is another next-generation
password hashing algorithm so if you--if
you store the fact that you're using
bcrypt
in your database alongside your your
hashed value when you want to map
migrate to another algorithm you can you
could actually combine the hashing
algorithms so you have bcrypt plus s
script and then you store you you know
that you've used both algorithms so you
then do that when the person logs in you
can apply both algorithms or if you
haven't used both algorithms you're
still using just bcrypt
for each record you know what to do and
so that I'm sure if I've explained that
particularly well but it's basically
gives you it gives you the ability to
select the algorithm on the fly as
somebody logs in and then as they log in
they've just given you their clear text
passwords to compare you would then
rehash it with the new algorithm and
then store that and you could then say
okay so this person is now using s
script this person is using bcrypt this
person is using s script so yeah that's
that's that's one way of doing that then
you can you can use one yeah so that's
why that's why I would I would actually
use a combination of so you could say
you this person has used bcrypt I don't
know what that password is but if you
then apply s script on top of that
you've kind of got this this hybrid
approach and so it's protected by a
script and bcrypt but that's probably
that's probably overkill in the end and
you might want to normalize down to s
scripts for everybody as they log in but
certainly those those older accounts you
would be protected by both and then once
you've got through once well I mean you
might never get rid of that combination
but certainly that you might want to get
rid of that just for the speed of
processing for people logging in yeah
the problem there is going to be if
somebody wants to cause problems with
your website by sending you that sending
you login requests for people who don't
exist or sorry who aren't logging in but
you know that that kind of extra
processing power might be problem for
you you might be paying the cloud
provider for it for example but you can
do the same with with symmetric
algorithms as well so you might know
that you're using AES 128 now but in the
future you might use that something
completely different and if you know
what I'll wear them you use because it's
on the record
you can then change that at you because
you move forward so if you are if you
fall and fall to something like this so
your traffic has to be being proxied by
someone who is up to no good so it might
be an open Wi-Fi hotspot something like
this there is the potential at any open
Wi-Fi hotspot for your traffic to be
diverted through through an attacker if
that if they are diverting your traffic
they've got control over it so you make
a request to HTTP slash slash Twitter
comm they see that go by they they will
probably make that request to Twitter
from so your your machine says his the
here's the request they can basically do
what they like with it so at that point
they could they could potentially send
it to Twitter
as HTTP or not and then capture the
response and send it back to you often
you will you will you will strip the
HTTP off because that then gives you
just complete flexibility over what
what's going on
you youth your browser may have
requested HTTPS in the in the first
place
but because all of the links in that in
that webpage are basically being
manipulated by the attacker they could
they can do kind of whatever they like
with it really
yeah yeah that's a good point I think
let me think through this a bit I think
you would have had we would have had to
intercept the traffic before it got to
that point potentially
I think I think probably the way it
would happen if you actually go in and
type in HTTPS you'd probably be safe but
how many people do that you know you
just go to your browser you put I mean a
lot of people just type Twitter into
Google right they search for it in
getting Google or you know or you type
it into the address bar so even though
if you don't put that HTTP on the front
your browser goes off over HTTP to
Twitter Twitter then redirects you it's
at that point we've got the opportunity
to not allow that redirection so we can
basically get in the middle there okay
