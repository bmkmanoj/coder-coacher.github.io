my name is Mark Luke John a--which and I
would like to present today a project
that me and two colleagues together like
during December and it's called web tags
that as Mike web for Internet network
website and taxes graffiti first shortly
about us I first introduced myself
because I'm a bit new I think to like
develop that development or something I
started learning some fourteen months
ago when I discovered free code camp my
plan is to actually like do it on some
professional basis but I still think I
have a bit to learn and I have some
portfolio to finish so this is what I'm
working on right now and my background
is actually like film and video and
photography auto lash is the third of us
who is not here pronunciation is
I think 19 or 20 he finished high school
I think in the last year
now here's like a gap year and he
service service September and I think
he's also learning something around the
year and yeah I guess his plan is to
continue studying with some informatics
or computer science is called in English
and the third member is Andriy Sidorenko
who can say Bodeen okay he will
introduce himself when you know you'll
have this part of the presentation so
it's about us I was thinking maybe it'll
be very interesting shortly to say
something about how this VAT tax project
came about and
it started in November when Daniel and
Robert organized Meetup when it wasn't
actually about presentations but it was
about people coding together and
afterwards it was like my first
experience coding with some other people
and it was quite interesting in many
ways and afterwards I was talking with
Daniel about why there are no hackathons
really or at least as far as I can say
happening in Vienna there was one which
is supposed to be in autumn but then it
got canceled because there wasn't enough
people interested in that I guess and
then I was thinking on the way home
simply like that it would be really
great to do something right like that
like to code with some people or do some
acetone but I really don't know enough
people in Vienna to be able to organize
anything like this so I was thinking
like how to make something similar
happen and I had the idea to maybe it
wouldn't have to be like a competition
between teams but it would be just like
one team that realizes some idea that we
kind of like decide on together and I
posted an announcement to Facebook group
of faculty and Vienna and a couple of
people answered to it and then we met
and it was originally four of us who met
and we just threw some ideas on the
table and we discussed them and
brainstormed a bit and then we came with
the idea for this thing that we call
that pipes now demo web text is
something like an application or a
service I can say like now we only have
like a very simple basic working
prototype but it works and the idea is
that it's service let's say but it's
like a bit too strong word I think - it
allows you to post a message and leave
message on any web site and read
messages that your friends left there
and as you see this like green thing try
to do a demo this is like the interface
for leaving the message and
it works like the principle is that you
basically create the account with us
like this for us feel free just to your
email then you search for people find
some people become friends with them and
then you can leave those messages and
those friends of yours can access those
messages besides you and I will now post
one to show you just simply how it works
it's not know nothing
you think our server is sleeping so it
would probably take some time to wake up
yeah yeah you see like yeah this is like
it's it's we didn't do really any work
basically I would say on some like user
interface so dislike to create a message
and to like reduce messages like mingle
together so it's maybe confusing but
this is the message that I just posted
yeah this is how it works for example
yeah it's simply like the point is that
it reads the URL in your address bar and
save this in the database was with some
other information and only on that URL
you can see those messages yeah for
example I have like this one medium so I
would just like very briefly say like
what this project like technologically
consists of and then professor Andre
will take you through the guts of some
deeper layers of the project so
basically it's the JavaScript script
that gets like injected into into a page
and that renders like this interface and
all those messages like it makes
requests to server and fetches all those
messages from our database and that's
great is injected into all those pages
using a browser extensions now we like
work with Chrome extension but
planets like eventually to do at least
also a Firefox version but I think it's
theoretically extendable also to like
all the all the major browsers that do
support this like classic classical
extensions API and of course like this
like front-end part communicates with
server which is no js' application and
we use database and in our case it's a
MongoDB database now I'm very welcome
okay my name is Andre thank you for
giving us possibility to give this
presentation about our project so in
principle I joined the project as Marco
said in November when we discussed what
we are going to do and what how we are
going to apply our skills in programming
can teach our self how to do that
actually in programming I'm not new
because I started many years ago from
such old languages like Fortran and even
assembler so but then I didn't do for
many years because I worked in physics
and did many things there as an eye when
such language like Python appears so I
started to work with bison because it
was very useful for my purposes and
physics very useful for plotting and for
data analysis and so on
and recently I just started to think
about having fun with programming and I
found the JavaScript now is quite great
language and one can do many things and
I discovered it probably I need to do
something with that
and that time actually probably was in
September and fortunately Marco appeared
already quite soon so we met and started
our project okay as Marco already said
so this was considered as an application
to communicate between just at the
beginning it was considered like leaving
some messages on the website so but of
course it's not that exciting just to
leave a comment on the website for
yourself so and we decided just better
if we are extending it and have these
messages or commands for groups for
available public
and also for friends and actually where
it can be applied why it can be
interesting so the first idea was just
we can leave the comments or say some
some ideas on website like a news
website and this website in principle
you can leave the comments there but
usually it's prayer or post moderated
websites and you need to register there
so you need and all these messages can
be only public so you cannot leave these
messages there for your friends only or
for some special groups so our web tech
application allows these all things to
do right for small communities or for
yourself or for just for friends to
leave these comments okay so as mark
already mentions this application
consists of a few layers as a first or
the top layer is a lightest layer which
is called extension and it's in
principle on the browser's browser site
and it's responsible for all these
operations with signing up and signing
in up and out and also the main purpose
of this extension is to load the client
script which is the next layer and the
client script is made for just a display
messages or say it's just a user
interface and and in principle the
clients client script is supposed to be
uploaded by the extension so as the
clients creep should be kept should be
stored on the server side so the next
layer is a server script which is
responsible for sending and receiving
horses requests from the client script
and all these API s and middleware
points and also for communicating is a
database so it's just normal REST API
which like food
post and so on and it does it gives a
response in JSON format and also as I
said it's communicates with a database
which is stores all the information
about the users group messages and also
authentication information and this all
four layers and in principle at the
beginning we saw that probably it's
necessary to just write one extension
and do not split it into extension and
the client scream but then we found that
it can be quite difficult to write all
these extensions for all different
browsers so in our case we have a client
scream which which does all the job for
displaying the messages but the
extension is just a small piece of code
which is very easily to transfer between
different browsers so okay now
everything all these layers and what we
used for making this different scripts
so in principle as a client script is
written in JavaScript also this HTML CSS
as a main main when which is what we use
there and this server script is not J's
and Express J's and databases mark
already mentioned that was we are using
MongoDB and for keeping this database we
are using ham lab and now just beat
about how the database is organized
because this is also quite important
part I'm not going to too much into
detail about all these scripts which
were made like server script and the
clients pre because I think it's too
much too so about this
quote but here the database so it's
because it's MongoDB is known as QL
database with which is not a relational
database it's just contains few
different tables so and the main table
here is the user's table which is which
contains the name email and passport
office of scientific authentication
information then we have this session
which contains the cookies it means that
when you're registering or when you are
logging in all these session cookies are
created and they are stored on the
server side so the server always checks
whether you're allowed to access to some
certain API is or not and gives you some
possibility to reach different API and
also separated in table slight friends
groups and messages messages another
main part of this database which
contains the text of these texts or
messages and also users which created
these texts and users for whom it was
created and on principles is how the
piece of code looks like so I don't want
to speak very much I just want to
mention about this using Mongoose
because people quite often as I can see
because I'm new in JavaScript right but
I can see and I'm quite surprised by
people not don't like to use it because
it's just simple way to connect the
server site or say
to work in not j/s with MongoDB and
databases so as you can see here all
these fields which were which we have in
in the messages table so this text
created forward means that for whom it
was this message was created as an URL
and also created the creation date and
created by but whom it was created so
also because this database is not a
relational database it's necessary to
link it to the other tables and here you
can see that for instance created by its
referred to the user data to use of
table and it allows just by knowing the
ID very easily to find as a user name
and all the information of this user on
the other hand it also allowed to link
it dynamically for instance here just a
couple of lines allows to refer to
different tables in the same database by
groups users and friends and so on this
how it looks just a static method method
for finding messages knowing just in
this case ID of the user and URL the
user so it's you can see here is a chain
structure chain like structure and it
selects some certain fields in order to
send it to to the client and also just
as I said dynamically populate with
depending on what the request is like
its messages for the group so for the
users or the friends and also it
populates instead of IDs
it's substitute IDs by names from the
and tables there this in principle how
it looks in the database this entry one
of the entries so here you can see it
was created for the groups and with the
idea of certain group and for the URL
and okay this is just one of the user so
and you can see that the password is
encrypted and in principle yes this is a
standard sink which is can be made with
the encryption package confession
package just standard thing okay so I
think Marco can continue because just
too much details in the court I don't
going to take your time well because if
you have questions about the court we
can speak later
you know how to continue exactly like
maybe I'll show you maybe it didn't seem
like really very exciting or something I
don't know it depends on your fantasy
maybe I would say but if you get just a
bit creative you can get to things like
this for example this is what I left on
Roberts and Daniel's page will be down
this is one of these are two messages
that I was just like toying around with
this is not a picture this is not just a
picture this is like this CSS going if
you ever saw these kind of things like
this is also I didn't create this
Frankenstein I only like copied in a
very crude way parts of the Frankenstein
picture but by one girl who is I think a
bit like one of the authorities in the
sexiest drawing medium post about it
doesn't matter like this is just like in
in mine HTML and this is just like a
simple text with some style like here
you can basically like really just
copy-paste some inline HTML and then it
will no it's not protected yet but then
it will I create anything like this for
example that I showed you or for example
yeah but it can also be as simple as I
showed like before like this these
things like that and then you see like
who posted it and then the text of the
message I don't know like for example
now I would imagine myself using it I
like to use a sound code a lot I map it
survive 2017 and I really like to listen
to these like long chats there and I
just like to bookmark like some some
some songs for example but it's not
really divided and when you have too
many comments then you're like bookmarks
there like it like really down down in
the comments and it takes a lot of time
to load in blah blah and I felt like
maybe I could use like this thing for
just like leaving some kind of marks or
the time codes of the overdose when the
my favorite song started something like
that or for example when I don't code I
cook so for example if I find some
recipe that I really like and I don't
have something and then I try to replace
it with something anything you need to
works out like well then I would leave
for example for my friend something like
I know I replace this with that and it
was not so great try it basic use cases
I was thinking I don't know I don't know
how many of you are like familiar with
like like browser extensions like how
many of you have tried to read some some
tutorials on how to like make extensions
but maybe it seems a bit skilled so
maybe skip the part with the extensions
but if you haven't like had to look at
it I kind of recommend it like if you
don't for example there are these
extensions like I have here like adblock
plus just like box commercials on the
pages I created my own this was actually
the time when we met first I was
thinking with my first extension which
was this one to just like prevent me
from seeing Tom timeline on Facebook but
all the other pages like an economic
sense or this one I really like to use
like it just stops gifs and you can also
use this one you can there is this like
little icon that's invisible for now but
if you like just click it it just like
toggles like this and then you don't
have any messages there you can just
like you know you like see the pages it
was so this is one way how to do it or
if you hate this big green tea then if
this appears this is like the other like
say part way interface where you log in
and walk out and do some basic settings
like for example I can turn it off like
this also this is the other way then of
course like now this will take me to the
account account page of my account where
I can like look for people and manage my
messages and friendships and requests
and things like that
it's like far from finished and this is
just like very basic design and
everything and the functionality is
definitely not finished yet yeah just
like this bookmarks as you can see you
know these here are some messages that I
left
yeah you can see like it is the link
where it is the text of it the date when
it was posted and then also here my plan
is I'm kind of like responsible on for
this part so I my plan is then to put
here of course like delete message edit
message nah some of those here this is
like here you can see this is not
compressed this is how it look this is
just like you see each tag with a bit of
style like I was actually thinking it
would be quite maybe cool and fun
project to take some Street guys it
sprays and give them a different tools
to create some graffiti like some HTML
and CSS and start with this yeah and
this Frankenstein looks like this yeah
so these are my tags here I have
friendships like this is gray and this
is Otto you can of course unfriend them
here are the requests like we have some
test users I have this pretty and Bill
Gates is like thanks test users I was
like doing this API endpoints for this
friendship for business so I created
these two people and yeah you get sent
me a friend request so I can accept it
or like just tell him sorry and I sent
to this girl yeah wait and I can also
like answer my request before she wants
to like it's like yeah this will be like
to search for users and maybe later some
maybe messages with some specific
content but for now it only like you can
search for users and for now I also work
with is that when you just send it empty
it sends you all the users that are in
the database and you see like this is
how it kind of looks and here I can send
a new friend request to this guy who was
not on the previous bookmarks yeah then
one of these bookmarks would be also
groups but when I was personally working
on all these like a PN points for these
friendships I got a bit tired of it and
then the guys came with the idea to
create groups and I said like you can
create
to itself I think this groups part will
be probably big business also yes so
there would be one market groups and
some settings here later I don't know we
have to what exactly to put there but
something would be definitely necessary
yeah and here I look out and what
happens this is like the page disappears
like this I was thinking like when we
started working on this thing like I was
thinking to give like we'll just take a
few more minutes of your time only we
were thinking like what like
technologies to use and stuff like that
and I mentioned some things and I
mentioned also this glitch I don't know
how many of you maybe know this glitch
is calm does anyone know okay like I
guess like everyone knows like things
like goat pen and Jase fiddle and the
glitch is something similar but the big
difference is that this is the place
where you can actually create like your
node.js application and it just takes
like a few clicks you just have to like
log in with your github account there
like I will show you this yeah their
homepage it's like colorful things like
that I do like it I've been using it
last year all the time before I kind of
learned how to set up a taco so I kind
of assumed that people here are more
it's like learning mindset or learning
face so maybe it can be useful and I
really wanted to show you because it
seems no one knows it yeah this is how
the homepage looks like these are like
my projects and what they really promote
like what they really want to yea like
pushes that people create projects and
by default they are like publicly
visible by anyone and you can just like
push a button and like clone the project
like to your yeah create your own Fork
and just like change whatever you want
like and they also like
all this stuff like tutorials how to
create boards and whatever you can think
of this is how the environment looks
like oh this is yeah this is some old
like basic project yeah this is like the
editor part yeah nothing nothing
familiar here are the files the point is
that you just type and the moment when
you type it's immediately like if you
would have a phone for example next to
you or any other computer it's
immediately online it's not like
localhost you can access it anyone
anywhere can immediately access the
application here you're like trying to
make without all this has so like I
don't know how if for example like local
host local host is not enough for you at
some point and and you don't want to
have so like you are trying something
new and we don't want to ask so we'd
like working with Heroku for example and
all the time like having to commit your
stuff to get and then get happened and
like actually deploys it I think this is
like really like long chain at least as
far as I managed to discover how it can
work this is like really immediate and
quick and if you're trying to learn
which I don't know no news or anything
basically you just like really type and
the point when you change it it's
immediately like this is the active like
page in the application that is deployed
I think it's really like great maybe
like just show you how our project
project looks like after some work of
you guys it looks like this this is a
Rigney okay this is just some very basic
set up for all these other other things
yeah yeah it's like this is like this is
the server script you set up the stuff
as you are like used to and of course
it's like an oj oj s environment
so you can of course I can stall like
all these note libraries and in this
case you do it like via this package to
Jason that here this is this classical
Jason file and if you look for some new
package then you just type it here and I
don't know what it could be like
anything just for example if it finds it
and it uses just NPM you click on it and
it immediately installs that if you want
to look at the documentation you see
it's on NPM J's calm you just like see
documentation and you just go on I mean
other than a couple seconds like this I
think it's easy like accessible for
anyone this is how I was learning my
like node.js first thing I think it can
make like things three easy easy without
any like setup to things and stuff like
that it just it's like open you just
come and I'm not paid to do this
advertisement this is I actually was
looking a bit I didn't find a way how
you can pay for using it I think there
is not really a way this is like a side
project of some just mentioned elsewhere
of a company called fuck Creek and they
created some decide Kanban one of those
like fail more like successful Kanban
applications for team to cooperate and
this is just there's a project here like
you can of course like the points that
you could collaborate with people here
are my colleagues now that can access I
go so what you can do is options yeah
the point thing is like by default the
every project is like turns out that it
can be publicly accessible to anyone
like meaning like that they can see the
code but you can switch it like normally
it would be like me private and of
course if it is like you can connect it
to your github its iconic github but you
can like create like access to your
repository and push and pull and backup
and then maybe like really extremely
briefly about some small plans for the
future like because this is like really
very basic prototype and of course it's
only a hobby project we don't plan to
start in a startup or something like
that like trying to sell it or like push
some advertisements to people through
different channels but we still have
like some plans to like kind of bring it
to some bit more interesting state like
now by default when you post a message
it's accessible to you and your friends
and we also want to do it like the
Facebook style kind of the Duchannes
which is on yourself choose also for
anyone without any friendships things
going on and also for the groups then
one of the problems that I really don't
like is this you probably didn't notice
but like when someone would post like
any of this like HTML like code instead
of a message and you don't any any rule
that you don't specify and it is
specified by the page where it gets
injected it just like the style of the
page leaks into your things and
sometimes it's really ugly like I was
struggling a bit with these two things
that I was and the other thing so I
don't for example with this one I don't
really know how to solve yet it will be
a small challenge so that even though
Otto already has some ideas but we
didn't have time to discuss it yet then
under problem is this URLs like you know
that someone some sometimes there are
parts of the URLs are like this query
strings or for example this campaign
like you know like this question mark
UTM Facebook campaign ID blah blah blah
and this is like the links that you
cannot really beat and if you now I
think we store like the whole the whole
like URL this is something that we will
somehow need to figure out a way how to
do it so that only the relevant part of
this URL is next door I also personally
don't really have any idea yet how to
approach that and also like as a small
small challenges
to learn to work with indexdb and be
able also to like get rid of those tags
when they all read like to put them into
some kind of like being there so that
they are not really visible and I would
prefer not to store this stuff like in
the central database but just on the
user's machine and I really find this
index to be in general like quite
interesting like for some offline
applications for example in general and
so on so I would like to learn to work
with that so it's one of the last ones
that I would like to mention and that's
it like repository like you could have
seen on on these slides if we don't we
don't have it like if you would want to
use it for example you cannot really
find it like among these official like
Chrome extensions it's not there yet
because first we are not finished and
second you can just like on the
repository and you like oh like if you
know how to load the extensions in the
development mode then you just load the
folder built and you can use it we did
some small like change of our database
just before Christmas and we really
didn't have time to like really figure
out some things especially with this
friendship stuff which is my part so
friendships will not work for now but
others otherwise you can already use it
for yourself and then I hope in next
days I will just fix those several parts
that I am responsible</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
