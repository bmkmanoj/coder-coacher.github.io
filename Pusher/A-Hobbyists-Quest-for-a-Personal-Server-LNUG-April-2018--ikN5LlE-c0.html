you're probably used to because I'm a
hobbyist and I'm not professional and I
was gonna say if you're gonna go down my
github I thought that we'd have this
talk before Pizza so that'd be okay but
after pizza I might get a little bit
sick because of the the spaghetti code
that I have in all of that and you know
I use Excel so I think we all have these
little tools and I use this exhales I
always use Excel to keep lists of
various things these are a bunch of
bunch of web services that provide nodes
and hosting node and the one thing that
I always found frustrating but Excel is
that it didn't have track changes and I
think I've lost my key out there so
whenever I would change something here
because this does not exist this our IP
version of introversion doesn't exist
I want to track changes on Excel so I
went and built this little app that I
actually you know that I like which I
called mystery which basically has the
same thing and I have my little table
here and I can change things and put all
right key here and save it and basically
my little excel sheet has the history of
the changes so I can keep track of them
and I think this is the coolest thing
you guys probably don't but the point
here is that I'm showing this because
whether you're one of you guys like a
dev who can whip up an app like this in
like half an hour or you're a newbie
that wants to and that you know takes
three months to build some sort of very
easy front-end web app we should all
have kind of a space where we can
actually have our our apps running on a
server so let me just get this
presentation going and that's what I'm
gonna talk about there we go
so that's my example of my history which
I call kind of a poor person CRM but the
idea is that you know it would be what I
would like is to have a personal server
that hosts a bunch of front-end web apps
I have my data and my files sitting on
my server right and I want this personal
server to be easy to install where I can
have em where I can easily build apps
and install apps and run your apps and
my apps and these are not complex apps
with you know really complex back-end
processes I'm just thinking about
there's a bunch of apps which just need
access to a file system and a database I
want to be able to install these really
easily and I don't want to be locked in
and that's important because if I have
my personal server and I have my data
and my files you know I wonder if I'm
running it on Amazon on me I want to
move it to Google or to Heroku or
whatever and that portability becomes
important and the example is that a year
ago I signed up for this you know to
create a node server on on AWS and I had
this one year a free and free time
basically gotten sort of yeah a lot of a
lot of free server time and the new
Orion and I started getting billed and
literally it took me like five minutes
to take my little freezer server which I
call it and move it over to Google now
from your perspective you're like well
yeah it's easy you've just been on go
and change the DNS text records and
stuff like that and you're done and this
is sort of I have my own sort of URL
Salman FF com
so from your perspective that's easy but
if you think about it from a kind of a
more of a newbie consumer perspective
where people have their own apps that's
like the total opposite of kind of the
model that's on the web today right I'm
all on the web today you're kind of
there you have nothing you're no
portability the services are the web
services are out there and they have
your data locked up and a lot of people
are talking about this because of
Facebook and I'm not saying these
services are bad you know these are
wonderful services but I'm just saying
it'd be nice if we had our own servers
where we had our own data and we had our
own apps and we could actually sort of
move things wherever we wanted and we
had full control over our apps our data
or files so how do we get there
obviously you actually have a person was
already gonna have to build it on node
right because notice so cool and because
most importantly because it's
multi-platform
so you can run it on multiple different
service providers you can have just
local hosted and you can have it on and
on your own sort of server at home or in
the office so that's that's really for
me the great advantage of notice sort of
the multi-platform and so you can
basically host it anywhere you need a
database I work mostly with MongoDB
again partly because it's open source
and you can have it in different places
but really you do want to kind of have
it be you'd want your server to be
database agnostic effectively because
you don't want necessarily to have
complex or you want to sacrifice the
complexity of the data rates operations
for and the portability and that's
that's key and then you want a file
system and you know whether it's s 3 or
Dropbox or what-have-you and Dropbox is
an interesting one especially for
newbies you guys probably have never
used Dropbox it's kind of a files file
system on your back-end and again from a
newbies perspective even if you have all
of these and the idea is that you know
is it possible for a newbie to have all
of these set up really easily even if
you have all of these you still need
something which I call middleware which
I started build with just called you
know freezer which is basically kind of
a middleware for allowing you to just
build your front-end app and just say
for example you know upload file or
write to DB and then everything is taken
care of whether you're running on s3 or
on Dropbox or whether you're running on
Mongo or another database you want that
to be abstracted right you don't want to
deal with that complexity I mean you
guys want to deal with that complexity
but I'm talking about kind of newbies or
hobby is sort of having their own their
own servers so also my criteria for
choosing the best back-end is probably a
little bit different from the way you
guys would look at it to some extent or
you guys being developers within a
server corporate context but perhaps not
as obvious so you know looking for a
friendly UI you know no CLI is you know
sort of all click click click you don't
want lock in and talked about that
that's really important and you want to
fit here sort of you're thinking about
consumers and sort of hobbyists
effectively and what happens at a lot of
these as you guys know a lot of these
services are really geared towards
preferred
like you and not necessarily for
hobbyists so they had a lot of
complexity and they're looking for you
to give you a free tier and then charge
it 200 bucks a month which is nothing
for a company but for a person it tends
to be a lot and so these services are
geared to that audience and not for a
personal server yeah so you have to kind
of hack your way around it effectively
but it to get a personal server that's
easy to install and what I like to say
is like you know my in the ideal world
the the server should be as easy to
install as you signing up for github or
for Dropbox right that's kind of the
goal and the ideal so you want some
features like HTTPS if you're putting
your own sort of your own you know
important data on there what have you
and you want custom domain so like you
know - Salman ffs not com so when I
switch switch servers that domain
remains there and and and my the URLs
that I may have are still the same URLs
effectively so I kind of went through a
bunch of the different services that
offer node Mongo etc - - to everyone and
especially if the way and try to judge
them by the that criteria the criteria
of this is for somebody who wants this
to run as easily as setting up setting
up github or or Dropbox so the most
interesting for me is openshift which is
run by Red Hat's
which is really within six clicks you
can have a note server run you like you
sign up you click you know sort of the
starter you open console you name your
project you create project you browse
the catalog openshift sort of combines
nodejs and mongodb so you have that
option you click on it and you sort of
point it to a github repository of your
account server you express etc or your
freezer as I call my little server and
you go to next and create and you have
your note server and that I find is
amazing because it's almost like a
consumer experience you have to do
another few clicks like if you want
things like HTTPS and things like that
but really with things you know like six
to nine clicks and two text boxes you
have a node server running one of the
problems I find with OpenShift is that
it's actually sort of it works in theory
but I think
like a lot of these services are really
geared towards not the personal server
but really towards the professional
person who wants to have a server so a
lot of times actually this the Mongo
nodes combination runs into resource
constraints and they're trying to sort
of push back and prioritize other
constraints we have to kind of redeploy
I could get into some some technical
issues around redeploying the server to
get it running but I'm showing this to
you this because the interface is so and
I don't know how many people have used
OpenShift here no the interface is very
very consumer friendly and if actually
you and one of the interesting things
about it is that so for you know a lot
of these things are running off darker
right now you reboot darker and you lose
effectively your environment if you just
have a server running there and you need
a way to actually have persistent that
environment variables effectively if
you're doing it this way where you're
sort of pointing to a public repository
to grab the server code in fact until
like six months ago when they weren't on
docker they provided this amazing
experience where literally within the
same sort of workflow within two minutes
you had your server running with a file
system and a database and with these
persistent valuable so you could do
whatever you wanted with it and for me
that was like that was amazing and then
they phased out of it one of the darker
because it was much cooler and much
better oriented towards their corporate
customers but for the new reason and for
the hobbyist there's there's other
alternatives and Heroku is a great one
as well you basically you know have a
few clicks you create the app you give a
name to the app and what Heroku doesn't
give you a few options but one of the
things that it does is that it allows
you to actually use draw box in order to
get get your server files deployed onto
their servers and so here basically you
have you know Heroku on your Dropbox on
your on your on your on your Mac or PC
and on
and in the cloud it creates this sort of
like Heroku folder and puts the name of
your application and then you can put
whatever note files you want in there or
JavaScript files you want in there for
it to rock to deploy the server and you
just basically press deploy and you're
done and though again in this case the
server and shuts down every once in a
while because they're limiting free
resources effectively and and so you
kind of like you need to sort of copy
the environment variables in there
effectively so that you can actually
have a persistent persistent environment
where you're not sort of resetting
everything and every time the thing
restarts which is basically you know
every every two hours or so but it's
still you have a server and like in like
you know nine clicks or what-have-you
which I find amazing but it's only a
server there's no database and the
easiest database setup that I've seen
Mongo setup that I've seen is M lab
which again is incredibly user-friendly
and again six clicks and a name and you
know you choose Amazon again it's a
sandbox environments or not talking
about huge robustness though even like
I've had a couple of hundred megabyte
but megabytes running on my on my server
on em labs and haven't had any problems
and you know in the past year or so so
it is pretty robust so they obviously
they would like you to go beyond the
beyond the free tier which is which is
fine and you just press Continue you you
give it a name and you submit order and
you have and you have a database running
you define your user and and a password
and basically you get a URI to Mongo
which you can then as easily as that you
have a URI which you then you can put in
your whatever server software in order
to be able to access that that database
so you have a sort of Heroku and you
have your database and what you need is
is a filesystem and actually Dropbox is
quite amazing because if you go to the
Dropbox of developers you're actually
again you know four clicks and you
generate an access token again that
access token is something that you can
put in your your server software
effective
to get your environment running so again
all of this is for me the easiest way to
to get to running a full server file
system and database without having a CLI
and without having a complex process to
get things running thank there's an
easier way actually to get a file system
and I'll get to that but you know sort
of going back to my list tree so you
know I mean again I don't know I'm sure
you guys use you know Google Cloud or
Atlas or AWS here a lot right yes I
imagine and you know I mean a double
this is great and so is Google Cloud
again I think the criteria that I've
kind of used to judge these is to say
well how can we get to a personal server
that you can run up within a few clicks
and have apps running with Anik a few
clicks so basically I mean in my
experience again MongoDB Atlas which is
which is great and robust really as
geared towards is really pushing you
towards sort of the corporate user and
not the hobbyist as as this presentation
is you know looking for effectively an
database we talked about this as a new
being and sort of there are newbies out
there I find the AWS elastic beanstalk
to be incredibly user-friendly as well
because you have a user interface it's
kind of upload the code and it deploys
it for you and again with it within a UI
which is web-based and is not complex
again that's sort of the criteria for
getting this running so you have your
personal server so sort of back to this
anyway the idea is you know having a
bunch of apps running on our server our
own servers with a database where you
can keep our data and a file system work
and keep our files obviously running off
of node and sort of talked about the
services for running node and database
in the file system with a very easy
interface and then the question is sort
of zero is there you know you need
something else in the middle which is
the middleware
and basically a front-end NPI which
allows you to again right say you know
write this data point and for it to
abstract the way what data base you have
in the backend or what file system you
have and then up so you have the sort of
the FSDB connection you want to be able
to manage the the app installations
manage the users and this is a personal
server but you want to have like you
know friends or family within that
within that environment and sort of
manage the permissions I think the idea
of having your own personal server with
your data on there with your apps and
data on there is be good because you
want that data to be free for you to
have other apps interact with it so I
may have so for example I build this
little sort of browser plugin which is
which I called view log which basically
sort of logs all your data and the idea
is you know Google and your telco
provider and everybody seems to follow
you and know every website you've ever
been to but the only person who doesn't
have that data is you right so you might
as well have it and put it on your own
server so if you're gonna do that then
maybe you're gonna have an app that
interacts with that data and does
something with it right so you want to
sort of permission that so that these
apps can interact and and access your
data but within your environment not
within the environment of a of somebody
else's servers and that's the concept of
concept of a personal personal server
and once you do that so this is where
you know you're in the computer wouldn't
even cooperate to start so forget about
doing a demo right because everything is
so basically you know I took you through
we're going to try this so basically if
you've gone through sort of setting up m
lab and setting up setting up your
freezer server on on Heroku for example
as this is the case so you get this sort
of you know you get your I'm not live
which is a code word for it to crash
Heroku app comm and then you say okay
well there's no there's no server
there's no database or there's no file
system so what we're going to do is
we're going to have an external database
and I've just this I had prefilled this
before before it crashed
but basically you take the URI from M
lab and you basically fill in the
various little things here and hopefully
I didn't make any typos and basically
you've set up your database for your
external file system actually sort of
you can also instead of going to develop
Dropbox on developers you can actually
just have it o off effectively so
basically you you or you authenticate
the server and and in your Dropbox
basically you can have a just allow this
right basically I've now gotten an
access token and the idea is just you
know Salman FF my server just acting as
a as a as an OAuth provider and anybody
else can actually provide that so the
idea is not to lock in but they actually
have anybody be able to provide an OAuth
so that you can actually now have within
your so within your Dropbox right you
now have apps basically you have a
freezer app which you can work with
because you just thought that and under
Heroku you have this l not live which
has your system right and then you just
call sort of put in a past name and
password and you said you know sort of
the Dropbox access token is there and
you set parameters and your server
should be running if the world
cooperates right and you launch freezer
and so basically with the screenshots
that I showed you and and this sort of
simple process for create having your
own for having the the environment
valuables become persistent you have a a
server and what do you do with this
server so
we're just gonna I'm just gonna do a
little demo here where you know so apps
are basically in a JavaScript HTML CSS
files right so if you want to create a
an app basically you can go to let's go
to downloads I'm gonna create a hello
right oops I'm gonna create a new folder
called that and then I'm gonna create an
index.html right and I'm gonna create a
little dip here say hello and I'm gonna
name it ID equals hello so basically and
this becomes an app and if I go to
downloads all I need to do is to zip
this up and back on my freezer server I
can go here and just say okay so I have
I'm gonna take this file and upload it
and that becomes my app so that's your
app is now installed on Heroku
effectively and you have your hello
hello world and what's cool about that
actually because you have this Dropbox
back-end effectively again for making
things simple now under L not live sorry
under freezer you actually under user
Allah your user apps you actually have
your index.html so your your your server
environment is replicated on via Dropbox
on your desktop effectively right and if
I can do one more thing I'm just gonna
actually so the other cool thing about
doing these apps is actually you can
have a electron app which one's the runs
the same code so this is my note-taking
app that I have on my on my freezer
server so I'm not gonna like try to type
this out lie
so basically obviously any app like
index.html you can have an sorry I can
go to my Dropbox apps and I go to my
user apps here and in here just to index
Jas and I copy a piece of this code
basically just you know this is the it
sort of the abstraction or the API that
says hey write to the database right and
then just query the database so it
should be that simple for a newbie who
just set up a server in 15 minutes just
right
everything else is abstracted and now
that I put it on my Dropbox even though
I'm live here
right basically it's just writing for
the beta base and querying back all the
results showing that again trying to
make it really easy to have an
environment where a newbie or a non
techie can have their own servers can
upload their own apps whatever that app
is and and build their own apps
effectively so around that there's also
like I said permissioning so different
apps can can access each other's data
with your permission and if I just go to
my little conclusions page so so you
know the the question for me it was you
know is it easy enough to set up a
standard kind of consumer server
consumer-oriented or new be oriented
server and no not really but we're
pretty damn close and that is quite
amazing that the server with your
database and and file system can be set
up basically through the web with a few
clicks right and a couple of copies and
pastes and if we have that one why not
have a common middleware something like
freezer freezer you know I'm like a
yes you know it's not it's a personal
project it's not widely tested I'm in
serious need of your your work there to
test this and it's it's not elegant code
for sure and it's not really robust but
it's kind of a start or maybe a concept
or a start of a concept to say hey and
there is this model out there where we
all have our personal servers just like
we have our Mac's or pcs and we have our
apps on there and we own and control
that data we are uncontrolled our apps
and we can do whatever we like with them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
