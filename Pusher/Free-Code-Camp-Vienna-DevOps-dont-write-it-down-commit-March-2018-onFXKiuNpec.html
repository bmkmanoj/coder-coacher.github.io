my introduction today I'm a first time
actually at free code camp and already
giving a talk how good is that
and I'm gonna talk about DevOps it's not
really coding I want to show much code
but I want to show you something or talk
about the culture of DevOps a little bit
and I see many developers in every day
and I don't see many companies that get
DevOps right and it's very a very
important topic and I think everybody
should know something about it first
thank you thanks we accelerate I think
it's really great because we are
starting to do more and more meetups
here in this place and I think it's good
to have we accelerate here and giving us
the opportunity to to enjoy this venue
just a few links I'll probably put the
slides online and I like to do things
and references first because otherwise
nobody will see them anymore in in
afterwards introduction Who am I I'm a
software developer for 10 years or not
really a starter and currently my
favorite language is golang I do a lot
of Perl and I do
typescript mostly because I have to I'm
not too good at it and I started off as
a sysadmin some what 15 years ago I
thought about it yesterday when I wrote
my slides and was sysadmin at the
University of Economics in Austria and
so I had some 20,000 users we had to
administer and you guess probably there
wasn't much manual intervention possible
doing that so we had to do a lot of
coding so I switched to becoming
yourself to a developer when I actually
quit the University and
I'm quite an expert at causing and
fixing disasters causing is easy but it
doesn't happen as much anymore
and fixing is okay it takes some time
and experience but I'm pretty relaxed
with these situations I get dumped into
my name is Klaus eater forgot to say
that usually I have a NIC
somewhat combined with coqui coqui is
very quickly taking in all the public
websites so look for derivative of that
that's my twitter handle it's easy to
remember and sorry for the layout
because my slides got messed up when i
arrived here they were all written in
markdown and i should have some plugin
that tells them to HTML converts them to
HTML but something happened so i had to
rewrite some macro in my editorial just
quickly make HTML from my slide so for
that they are pretty beautiful and I'm a
total dopant CSS so please just get used
to those slides and they won't get
prettier than that some bars words not
important is some get a feeling if you
have any questions just ask them ok I
don't like having all the questions
afterwards because maybe you don't
remember and you might have okay okay
sorry
no questions hate you and no cases
DevOps the initial setting how did we
find that DevOps or how was it incubated
or whatever there was sis admins and
there were developers and and there were
business requirements and sales people
and each of those silos actually hated
each other or I think they still do more
or less but something is happening so
the two sides that were the most opposed
sides were the scissored means and the
developers and
both so it's easy for me to to tell you
this
it gave me hard times quite often sorry
for the small funds but that's my CSS
skills okay so the there's a there's a
conflict in sysadmin and development as
a developer you always check for the
latest library and you always want to
have the latest and greatest tools and
try this and try it try that some AI or
whatever and as it says admin you
usually are being paid for sitting in
the back room and just keeping
everything stable and as soon as
something moves a little bit you just
bash it down so it doesn't move anymore
and so those two groups are somewhat not
in sync and someone someday just said
well you know we could work together and
at the time I was in at that university
I had told you about there was I think
that there was the seed of DevOps coming
up that there were configuration engines
starting to get bigger and bigger and it
was the very early I think puppet wasn't
no puppet wood there was no puppet at
that time but there was cfengine at the
time and and people started scripting
infrastructure and and people stopped
actually doing things manually the bad
thing is I still see a lot of people
manually intervening with their
computers and the what are the goals of
depa DevOps we just want to keep a
constant flow through the technology
value stream so so what does that mean
it's in the old days you always had
infrastructure and you had development
and those two didn't work well together
and especially in bigger companies there
was software development and software
development cycles were months or years
long and then there was an integration
phase
and that handed over the software
project to the UPS people which are
system administrators and they tried to
figure out how to actually get a project
working and running and stabili running
and that pushed the launch date of every
product further and further away and I
still see that in many startup companies
now also I mean people are developing
and developing and then there's release
day and they find out Oh we'd never
thought about infrastructure what we
actually want to run the project but it
works on my machine I see that quite a
lot and it's it's a lot of about culture
to actually put together all the team
and make everybody participate from from
the team so it's not only developers or
C's admins but it's also the marketing
people it's the icon designers it's the
I don't know CSS people are those
developers yeah let's say and it's the
sales people that mustn't sell things
that that can't be developed or
everybody needs to be in a team and this
is a bit what DevOps is about also the
thing I explained before they zero day
one day two day and the product has to
run all the time and yeah basically work
together in all of phases of its life
DevOps is about culture automation lean
measurement and sharing these are the
key points of of DevOps let's go through
them culture is something I see a lot in
technologies there's that boss and the
boss shouts at everybody and this is
this bone I mean this leads to results
in short-term but people leave and
people join companies people leave
managers and it doesn't really lead to a
good team and
- good work experience and what we
really want to impose it get blame free
learning experiment and experimentation
framework so we all make mistakes we
make a lot of mistakes probably but the
only difference between between a
well-established developer or a DevOps
guy or whatever and and the beginner is
the number of mistakes they have made
that that's the only difference
and yeah this means we really we do have
volatile in environments anything we do
changes all the time and because we do
experiment everybody is allowed to
experiment everybody is allowed to bring
in new technologies we change everything
all the time but still we managed to
reduce risk I'll explain that later how
we manage to work that out
we try to have no more silos and which
is actually fun because we start
actually talking to people there were
some people who came here to talk to
others this is true for every company
the developers can start talking to
marketing people and the C's admins can
start talking to sales people and
actually this is an interesting thought
it should be it should be a baseline in
every company anyway we all shared a
responsibility for our finished product
we all earned money that the company
earns and we all have to bring in money
and we all important for the company so
of course we share responsibility and
it's important that everybody knows that
everybody is responsible for having the
product out and autonomous teams is just
because we share responsibility we are
able to actually decide things on our we
don't need to ask the boss all the time
Automation there's a I think on the
first slide I had those thank you
things there's a book it it's a long
book and it gets a bit boring after a
while but it's the sre book of by google
i don't know if you know a site
reliability engineering and but they
have amazing chapters that are really
good and one of them is about automation
and toil especially and I like the term
it's it was created in Google I think
and it means that anything you do and
anything you do more than ones that can
be automated must be automated and this
is one of the really basic thoughts in
DevOps so whatever can be triggered by
whatever metrics needs to be
automatically you automatically solved
because otherwise what you might see you
have many many busy people that do the
same thing over and over and again and
this is the worst that can happen okay
so anything that's manual repetitive and
automatable tactically important for our
company has no value at all that's very
important you know the webserver that
needs to be restarted because whatever
we have bad code and we have mem leaks
or whatever and the sysadmin goes to and
look logs into that web server SSH is in
there and and just types in nginx
restart that's a waste of time you can
automate that you can just watch memory
and just kill that thingy and and it'll
have the same effect it's not a solution
it's not a long-term solution but it it
will take away work from the sysadmin
who can then develop a better solution
and probably reduce memories okay
and doing this
removing toil all the time is a huge
resource saver and and imagine I mean at
Google did the sree teams they are not
allowed they're not
even allowed to do more than 50% toil in
their their work time which is I mean
think of your scissored means what they
do all the time
least of them are actually living that
well there is that term lean eliminate
waste amplify learning decide as late as
possible deliver as fast as possible
that's all D they I mean I hope you you
live by those standards no I'm empower
the team build integrity and see the
whole see the old is I think the only
thing I really have to explain more even
as developer or sysadmin or whatever
person they were in whatever topic you
are in just see what the goal is and and
always know what is my company doing and
what are we actually trying to get out
to our customer it's very important to
to see that all the time is what I am
doing
currently important for my customers
does it actually give value to the
customer instrumentation anything
and this gets forgotten but but most I
don't know how many startups are here I
just saw some everybody who's making new
products and many people have started
new product and they forget about
measurements and instrumentation and
this should be one of the core built-ins
in every product that you create
if you don't instrument everything you
do and if you don't have graphs for
every whatever information you you
generate in your software you will feel
a DevOps because if you can't measure
things and if you can't analyze things
you can't react and of course a human
being can react and I have a very good
feeling about you I don't know I think
the system is in a bad state and I have
to do something but if you don't have
number
to prove and if you don't have numbers
to analyze you can automate these things
here you see a graph from this is
something actually a marketing guy he
created these graphs we are generating
all the the information and the
marketing guy just clicks together it's
some health whatever tool and and they
can just see okay how do the numbers
perform did we I don't know we had some
release and numbers went down and then
other releases and we try to to get to
release the numbers up again and just
just to show you that anything we do and
whatever whatever this is
registration verified verification
profiles setup so so people that try to
register verify their profit profile and
then or change data in the their profile
which is important in this project which
is measure what they do so we have the I
call it the DevOps bretzel and if you go
to DevOps meetups nowadays you see this
brittle all the time and I just wanted
to show it to you it's it's a
never-ending cycle of okay you release a
product you configured you monitor
monitoring okay you plan for the next
release you build you create you check
the numbers again from monitoring you
package it release it and so on and so
on you know and that cycle goes forever
and now the testimony I am a developer
okay DevOps is something that should
actually impact the whole company and I
don't know much about how marketing
people feel about it I mean I know that
they work in my team together with me
and and we have a good relationship but
I don't know what they feel about the
whole DevOps movement so what I can only
talk about is how software
it goes software operations and how we
execute it okay I don't really care
about the finance department there's so
much okay how do we live it we use git
or whatever revision control system
you're using do whatever you want but I
mean I think everybody uses get if
you're not and I've seen that recently
in the last two years actually companies
not using it start using it use some
integration service everybody knows what
an integration service is it's an
automated tool that takes your product
and puts it into production
it must be automated don't have someone
say okay should we release today maybe
you talked about releasing today but it
must be automated the whole integration
and releasing process must be such a non
op that you do it all the time you did
all the time and use build tools so
however you try to make your final
product I don't know if you do web
design you probably have some grunt or
web pack or whatever running automate
that you can have it running but if it
needs any parameters script that at
least we have build tools built into the
gate chain so if I get pushed and the
product gets built and released I would
recommend I mean this is not an official
statement I'd recommend you use a cloud
it doesn't matter if you have your own
cloud if you have I don't know a service
center and 2000 servers and just run
your cloud find that that's fine but the
concept of cloud must be implemented so
so probably if you're in smaller
companies use I don't know a double
years Google something like that use
provisioning tools for everything
you don't start naming service or
anything like that
the a a I'll come to that later and and
see your hardware as software okay
so don't don't name your hardware don't
don't know your hardware any more
abstracted make it software okay
continuous integration there's a great
article by Martin Fowler about it Martin
Fowler you all know Martin Fowler he's I
don't know and I can in ite I take he
writes articles do all of them were like
15 pages long and quite quite a read but
always well well thought of and
well-designed and he look him up Martin
Fowler and read all his articles it'll
take you a month or so but it's worth it
and he says continuous integration
what's the base point checkout main line
main line is the master branch yeah
develop a quick feature and I mean we
even have tools for if we have an issue
or ticket that we want to work on that
actually creates a branch named like
that ticket so everybody who works on
that same issue creates the same branch
name so we can share and and interact
with that build test and merge fully
automated very often and always know
your code is running and failing or
broken builds don't make it to main line
so we have all that automated except for
the coding part we need to do that
unfortunately and we push into the repo
everything gets built I don't need to
type to build and merge and whatever it
all gets done by tooling and after a
minute I get an email if the build fails
other or pop up on my screen actually
and otherwise my changes get merged into
mainline and are in this staging staging
environment continuous delivery deliver
all the time
so what I've done before I coded I
merged it into mainline and now it's
about delivery and every successful
merge you see get into that staging
environment so that we have a web page
that has a total clone of everything we
do we can have multiple clones also but
but staging is the most important
preview it runs against a real clone of
the actual data and we have buttons for
for creative review promote to
production or rollback so there's no
manual intervention with anything we do
actually so what and these buttons can
be pressed by a marketing guy and this
is very important that it's not always
the developers that decide okay we can
go online no if all the tests pass and
if the product looks fine to the
marketing guys they are the ones that
wanted to feature of course they press
the button to to actually release that
feature if they don't press it I press
it yeah anybody can and so this is
standard deployments of each of those
what's that vertical lines are a
deployment and that standard first that
we actually deploy all the time and then
you watch I don't know something happens
or doesn't happen and and so we always
mark everything that's the
instrumentation part I talked about you
need to know okay we had this code
running and it had this impact on our
customers so maybe we need to change
something or maybe that was a good
change and let's party by deploying so
often we keep things unstable
but we reduce risk if we deploy only
once if month or only once a year or a
half year then the deployment gets
really tough and now we just deploy and
everything is fine
unless you do disaster deployment like I
did last week where I blacked out for
half an hour I think the whole product
but that was very special didn't happen
for years actually because usually we
have that but this is also the
experience nobody shouted at me when
that happened we just found out ok what
was the problem and how do we fix it and
how do we prevent it from happening the
next time it was my mistake I did
something wrong
but how can we prevent it in the future
and so what we want is that we actually
have the cue and it's running the deep I
playing is running and it says ok sorry
I can't continue something something
happened I don't know what happened here
but whatever and we are safe we have way
too many features to test them all we've
been working on this product I didn't I
think for nine years or something and
and it's just too many features and
sometimes we have long workflows so we
gather information and we export it to
different clients and and and we improve
the data we recycle it in and there's so
many workflows they take a while and and
they need to take a while and and we
have different formats
it just can't test everything and but we
do have a large for every core business
case so whatever happens we know so we
see we act we know ok and and if we if
we see we have a problem and we don't
have measurements yet we act so we
introduce measurements instrumentation
for that problem and in the future we
have something automated for it and we
have many alerts that shouldn't trigger
ok and we always know exactly when which
version of code was online so we have
our stats and we can always say ok at
that point
in time we had this revision running
very important I see that a lot that
people don't know they just go to
service to get pull so that they think
they're advanced because they use get
they do get pull server restart have no
idea what happens and yeah we have much
better things to do than testing our
code manually so I don't want to browse
our website all the time and and then we
have products that I don't even want to
touch too much because I don't know I
think I just don't like them and it's
good to have that automated and we need
to detect the errors as fast as possible
and stopped him from passing along the
value stream so even when I blacked out
last week I knew it within seconds and
that's very important and you know so
you can act quickly and and fix things
this is still markdown syntax be very
disciplined so if you want to do that
you and the whole team must be very
disciplined we we do we create strict 12
factor apps we don't ever do quick fixes
even if I know ok I could just log in
and change that line in nginx and and
fix some I don't know proxy path or
something and it would work we don't do
it
we create a fix we patch we commit we
release and that always has to be this
way and if a broken commit exists in in
in your tool chain that's the most
important part to fix because as soon as
you let your tools down and you start to
work around the tools and manually
install things the whole system breaks
yeah always use tools and if you can do
it you can script it but that's my
philosophy whatever you do it is
scriptable it might be hard it might be
hard to first-time it gets easier and
easier ok and very important is
learn all the time I read books all the
time I read articles all the time
there's not a single day I don't learn
something and I could say that for my
whole team nobody nobody ever lays these
down and says okay I know enough just
doesn't happen and communicate a lot I
mean it's easy for us
we're with less than the two pizza team
I eat one pizza and but it's easy for us
to communicate otherwise we're also not
in danger to have desires because we are
very close together we're still in one
office which is in one floor so it's not
not a big I don't know like unico
whatever over there we have huge
buildings and it's hard to communicate
so for us really communication is easy I
want to talk about failures things that
did not work I've worked at multiple
companies with multiple companies I've
seen things fail I failed I failed with
my team I saw teams fail after investing
hundreds of thousands of Euro into dev
ops what doesn't work
being half committed doesn't work okay
either you do it or you don't do it
halfway costs a lot of money ansible
or scrip deployments on pet servers
everybody knows what the pet server is
it's one way you know the host name it's
a server you like and never have a
strawberry you like okay Vicki playbooks
four deployments and upgrades I see that
a lot people think there's so smart
because they have everything written
down in Vicki and they copy and paste
every line and then create a new project
how we have got a new custom and
creating new customer takes quarter of
an hour
I don't know that three hours I don't
know copy-paste all the lines from Vicki
I mean just script that or make make it
micro service that create
new customer strongly wired Services
doesn't know it doesn't never work I
mean
we've fully migrated to my micro service
environments and initially the first
migration started with service a knows
exactly about service B and we can talk
to each other know it's like pet service
it's just pet software what didn't work
using KVM then or VMware in in our
deployments so for the software we were
trying to deploy it
those virtualization technologies work
very well to abstract hardware but they
don't work well to abstract
software for infrastructure yes but not
for the deployed product itself
delegating core services sorry to say
whoever outsourcing companies here the I
don't know DNA is hosting all these core
things that are needed for your product
you must do all that you know
outsourcing software development didn't
work for us nobody can outsource a
philosophy and it's the main thing you
do if you if you do software and every
company does software nowadays and every
day company mainly does IT nowadays
different aspects of IT but everybody
needs IT you can't outsource it
outsourcing says admins very bad idea
taking responsibility away from people
we tried that with people who didn't
want to dev up and who didn't want to
work in that strategy so we said ok you
just fix that little issue and then you
commit it and we cover for the rest
doesn't work you unfortunately I have to
get rid of those people multiple git
repositories didn't work for us we have
a lot of I don't know that
that company is seven 700 makes of
source code and we have it all in in one
repo and it's fine with Kate nobody
cares and if you have multiple
repositories you have to work with get
sub modules and stuff doesn't work so
well just use one mono repo and we do
that everything you do must always be
code and all truth lies in the repo so
if I die today
doesn't really matter because I mean I
wouldn't care and and otherwise anything
I've done even my talk which I just
rewrote isn't get anything not committed
has no value at all because it can just
be gone or broken or I don't know you
can't find it anymore especially in case
you run into a bus and or you get hacked
because we've got that Hecate server I
want to see or you want to change your
infrastructure which is the most
important point I mean that happens
frequently or frequently every few years
you want to switch from one provider to
another one if you don't have domain or
anything actually everything script
scripted you won't be able to make that
move if you have to manually set up
infrastructure won't work and thanks
very much questions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
