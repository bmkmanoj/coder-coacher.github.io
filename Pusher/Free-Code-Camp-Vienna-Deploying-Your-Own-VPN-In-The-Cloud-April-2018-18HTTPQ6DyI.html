Robert axelsson besides from organizing
this Meetup I'm also going to give a
talk to you today on the topic on the
topic of deploying a VPN every pn is a
virtual private network that enable is
it for you to connect to that server or
that network from your connection when
you are connected to the internet and it
gives room for you to encrypt your data
and also to bypass as a proxy if your
server VPN network is in the US it will
appear most probably for the person that
you are accessing the website at for
example cnn.com or whatever that you are
coming from the US and not from Austria
but let's get into the details and why
I'm mentioning this today what I'm going
to cover in specifics is outline which
is a tool that enables you to set up
your own virtual private network we'll
get to the specific soon my name is
robert axl since as I mentioned you can
find me at Rob Axelsson on most of the
things I didn't realize I put this in
here but I am actually on all the things
at on all the things as well I haven't
started using it actively but I have it
everywhere and it's an alliance for now
I might do something fun with it
but it was just available I'm at I'm on
all the things at on all the things I am
a software developer a meetup organizer
and a community enthusiast I like
creating and starting and organizing
meetups I now run three monthly meetups
as you know as I mentioned before yeah
if you want to learn more about mine and
also Corgan eyes with daniel deutsches
journey from learning to program to code
to getting our first developer job which
we did recently over the last couple
couple of years both me in him you can
look online at my website you'll find
links to recordings of that talk with it
ok enough about me
slides for this talk are already
available online in a repo
so have a look there also for the ones
looking at the recordings just head on
over there and you can look at the
slides together no need to take notes
what inspired this talk for me was
recently I think within the last week
there was episode YouTube at hack 5
which by the way is a great YouTube
channel a big shout out to them if
you're interested in security or
penetration testing or hacking be it
white hat - a hat or black hat have a
look at that channel they've been around
forever and there's some really great
stuff there down to beginner intros on
what to do in the command line to using
Kali Linux and all kinds of stuff so I
really really really recommend to have a
look if you have any interest in that
topic ok so before we get into the tool
that we're gonna use let's get a little
bit of see a little bit serious and
let's talk about a guy named John so
John a 27 year old journalist ever since
he was a young teen he learned about the
widespread corruption in this country
after experiencing it firsthand himself
he has been driven to stop it John from
an early age again he volunteered to
help with the school paper and he
learned that he had a talent for writing
it was only natural to him that he
applied to study journalism in the
capital in the university in the capital
of his country and he was ecstatic when
he got accepted like this is awesome
so John again after having studied for a
couple of years he graduated with flying
colors he easily got a job at the top
newspaper in his country and John he was
on a path he was really destined to be
to get a great career career but he
wanted something more
he's dis-ease there should have been a
dash here because it looks like he has a
disease so sorry for that but his this
is with a - regarding corruption has
never really faded since his teens but
his country had only a resemblance of a
free press
and writing about corruption was a best
friend upon still he felt repelled to
speak up then out of the blue so John
was suddenly contacted by an anonymous
source that had him introduced to John
via common friend and led to believe
that he kill help disclosed scandal then
involved highly powerful men and their
corruption in their country so John
agreed to meet a secret location was
really pond and they met and John was
both shocked and repulsed by the scandal
his source revealed but he knew he get
had to get a story publish the end
shortly after the meeting John
mysteriously went missing and John's
story was never published even though
this is a fictional story clearly
written by me today
mixing past and present tense and not a
work of great we'll get to that
afterwards nor the work of great writing
talent it tells the story that I think
the people behind outline wants to tell
and help mitigate to confuse you I'll
jump back in my slides because I think
I'm missing or there is also so outline
was released now in March of this year
by jigsaw which is alphabets cyber
security division supposedly by
TechCrunch stating it's their
cybersecurity division looked a little
bit into it it looks more like they're
an incubator under alphabet alphabet
owns Google if you didn't know so this
is Google backed that has to do with
geopolitical issues and how to help the
world or people better protect those
spaces so not strictly cybersecurity but
it definitely there
philately falls under that domain yes
that's jigsaw I wanted this talk to be a
bit again back to the title deploy to be
a bit interactive I want to state this
because I'll get back to it later
this talk is this YouTube video 717
minutes long and we'll cover some stuff
that I won't cover today what we'll
cover now together is going to the
website downloading the tool and then
installing it and setting up our own VPN
and hopefully the demo gods are with us
and the internet is stable and we'll see
if we can get this done so let's do this
our two links we need there one is the
website to download it the other one is
my referral link to the place we can use
us for hosting a VPS for hosting this
keep in mind if you use this link you
will get $10 credit I will get some
credit on my part if you prefer not to
do it it'll be apparent later on in the
talk where you can go to do it without
involving me I want that to be perfectly
clear because I'm not doing this yeah
for those reasons and I just a super
quick shout out we my company are
looking for both front end and back end
developers if you are interested here
are the details contact me email or
check on the website yeah I'm a
front-end developer in my team we use
vue.js javascript mainly have a look if
you're interested cool so let's do this
it's as simple as using the link going
to get outline org
they are framing this for journalists
but keep in mind you could use this
yourself you would have to pay for the
hosting we'll get into that as a monthly
cost but when you have set it up you can
buy click of a few buttons send a link
to your friend or contact whatever you
want to connect with via a VPN
encrypted securely and privately as you
can get there's always potential
loopholes and with humans involved and
attack vectors like I want I cannot
stand on state to say you will be
hundred percent secure but as secure as
we can get in this day and age and then
you can invite them and they'll be
connected via your VPN and you can
safely communicate with them one thing
to add about what we're going to do or
note the reason for using such a tool is
not just for journalists if you are
connected let's say in at Starbucks
which is notoriously one of the examples
for you shouldn't check your online
banking if you're a Starbucks or any
open Wi-Fi network because anyone that
just puts up a computer and no something
they can sniff the data and they'll
figure all this stuff out this is a
safest you can get by still being
connected in a public open Wi-Fi first
before you share anything private or
sensitive you connect via the VPN and
then you proceed to communicate what you
want it to be hidden or you log into
your online bank or you log into
Facebook or whatever you don't want
anyone else to possibly be able to snoop
read so that's also a use case besides
the journalism stuff so we just scroll
down and we go to get lot outlet
managers there's by the way also mobile
clients hak5 mentioned that it's not
covered on all the devices for me it
seems like so but there might be some
some caveats there but for our
demonstration now we'll just go and get
for Linux you can also download so you
can initially set this up we have Izzard
on Windows or Mac OS and we'll see why
that is the case it's downloading down
here now and over half the way through
so we'll just wait for that in the
meantime I'll get up a terminal
and will soon get going so for those of
you who aren't so tactical or you don't
even have to be technical to know to
understand what's going on right now but
I'm on Linux and what I do now might
seem esoteric the only thing I'm doing
is opening the file so and windows you
would just double-click the egg Exe file
and what would happen by itself a little
bit more complicated here but it's just
the couple of lines of code or command
line commands so I just have to give it
I won't go into details the one that
knows what this is knows it so now I'll
just execute it apparently not
okay
yeah
what
plus-x thank you shout out to however
spotted the error we got it now there we
go so hey we get it let's see maybe I'll
break it now yeah we cannot maximize it
so this is the biggest we get I'll go a
step back because I see it knows I
already started this earlier today so
I'll sign out this is what it will look
like for you when you just open this up
the first time it does expect you to
have an account that digital ocean
digital ocean is a VPS a virtual private
server provider they compete in the
space against the Amazon and Google
Cloud and so on they more are in the
business of giving you a dedicated
virtual server at them the certain
amount of power and then you pay per
month and you do whatever you want with
them and with it you can start as low as
five dollars a month and that's what
this is based on so you have to pay five
dollars to try this out first you do
create an account you can do that via
here or you can use the link I mentioned
rubley go do and you get $10 credit to
start this out right now I just have to
sign in awesome I don't think you have
to agree to any gdpr compliance and sign
any papers to see my email but this we
had a talk before let me just get my
mobile ready so I can do the second two
factor authentication here and I have to
change the password if this doesn't work
but we should be covered so you see you
see my second email awesome
you can hear from the way I'm typing
what my password is awesome awesome so I
just gotta get my one of my account
passwords awesome so so you create your
account and you just sign in now it
might prompt me for something awesome so
give me one second
okay so here's the magic and this is
where I found this really great for our
meetup today that with this digital
ocean you can choose a country that's
the server is in that's also on topic
today you can choose it to be in the EU
for example and also we're very close to
Frankfurt so that's awesome
then I'm pressing the button and I'm
telling you to set it up for me it is
doing that and this might take two
minutes it says while we're doing that
once this is done what we will see will
be inside my digital ocean account and
then we'll see that it actually has
created a new server and if you are
interested if you do this it's an entry
port to be able to log in to your own
server and get a little bit of feel
about linux is and system administration
because it starts with these small
experiments it did for me I was like
what is this VPS can i host besides
using Hostgator or one and one or one of
these hosting providers how much
knowledge would it need to do it on my
own
and before I learned to program the a
free code camp I took a course at Linux
Academy and learned to host via the lamp
stack limit Linux Apache my sequel and
PHP using these kind of tools online and
if I didn't want to use the VPS anymore
after a day I could just destroy it I
don't only pay for that one or two days
but it's a great way for learning these
kind of things now we see that there is
already so this kept going on in the
background I'm just going to refresh for
the sake of clarity what this did in the
background was that this is my normal
server and I'm giving you the IP address
this is awesome so you should probably
change that it's fine it's fine if you
know my domain name you can find this IP
address publicly available this is the
one on the server that it created this
is its unique IP address so if you try
to attack this IP address as a hacker or
whatever what you are just directing at
is the VP M
server that we just set up by clicking
above so it can be done magically easy
like this now the thing I won't go into
detail upon now is how you would share
this because the video that I mentioned
earlier then I have a link to goes into
better detail of explaining this and for
me to demo this on this desktop I would
need also to have a shared screen of a
phone or another desktop to show the
interaction what's going on right so
that does that much better we can do
that at a key part I'm not connected
okay get connected connect this device
okay
it gives us some stuff to install so I
won't do that now with you because
that's to doesn't give you anything the
only thing we see after this is done is
that I can click a key to share with
someone else but we have done the hard
part already believe me so we're almost
done we're almost true but keep in mind
that you can use something like
digitalocean to do these kind of things
on your own either for a VPN and you can
be ready in a second or you can do it
for different services if you want to
host WordPress on your own if you're
interested in trying out Linux if you
want to do something like you've heard
about this ghost alternative to
WordPress or you want to set up instead
of github you want to set up gitlab for
yourself for your team if you want to
play around with my sequel there's a lot
of stuff that are already there for you
with a click of a button mean stack for
example is MongoDB nginx angular and
nodejs so on topic for free code camp
it's a Java Script paste and if I click
here now so I've chosen that one I can
say I want the minimum one I want to
have it in Frankfurt and I want to have
ipv6 and
I want to add my HQ always a public key
is fine and I can give it a name and
create and it goes through the same
process again and I'm gonna done with
this I get an IP address
I can SSH into it that means that I can
connect to it from my laptop and I can
be in an environment where I can do
start from the command line to put stuff
on my server to host stuff create an app
and already have it available in IP so I
don't have to just have localhost on my
computer so there's tons of
possibilities but that starts by being
curious about what virtual private
services what Linux is and how you can
do these things on your own and believe
me when I say anyone can learn it I
could I got it working and digitalocean
to top it off also has a great
I can't further find a link to it but
they have a great article base or they
have a lot of how to use on how to do
these things step by step really step by
step anyone can do this and you can also
use these tutorials and I really
recommend it even if you are not curious
about digitalocean at all if you're
using something else I would like to use
another provider they have a great
reputation for having really top-notch
articles and I go to them off and just
if there's something I'm curious about
myself and oh how do I do this I often
first go to digital ocean so enough
about them but I really mean it when I
say have a look there if you're curious
and to end the talk here are the links
not here they are and thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
