to talk about product and development
and but luckily in quite a different way
to the way that Sharon talked about it
in fact I think your talk is basically a
list of things to do for me so that's
actually quite a quite well timed
personally I'm going to talk about what
it's like to be the sole developer on a
project on a product actually and then
kind of transition through building a
team and then turning into a product
manager so I guess kind of what you were
suggesting that people could do so first
bit of context and so we are a software
company we build digital publishing
software which powers and things like
national newspapers weekly monthly
magazines education staff internal comms
anything where you want to like publish
a bunch of content on a regular basis
and we've spent the companies like five
years old we've spent the first fake
three or four years doing client based
projects and in fact one of my clients
is in the room here say okay I'm not
gonna be read about clients fee and yeah
so we're doing lots of custom client
projects and and we realized after a
while that actually people generally
don't want to be supporting custom code
and have to do loads of development just
to get a relatively simple publishing up
out there so we started creating
products that that work out the box and
can effectively just be colored in and
then used and so we started with the
native apps and then we moved on to
looking at the authoring tools to create
your content and also distribution
service to actually get your content out
there which would also look after things
like analytics and your CDN or what kind
of stuff so completely everything is
done for you I'm going to talk about the
authoring part of that today because
that's the the product that I work on
and and that is called pug big express
it's an authoring tool that allows you
to create and publish beautiful
responsive content for your app
them and and this is a super simple
diagram of the the structure of express
so it allows you to create different
types of content and you can import them
from a different place as well and it
also allows you to customize that
content so a non-techie person can go in
and select from an array of skins which
is like the look and feel of a content
they can pick highlight colors they can
do all kinds of stuff like that and then
with a bit of development skills you can
add custom fonts custom CSS and do some
custom layouts so they're like different
levels of customization that you can
apply and it's built on WordPress to
WordPress and um because it's there it's
kind of a familiar tool to lots of
people ready and so some of your
training some for you there's a good
plug-in ecosystem out there so lots of
things already done for you and of
course it's free ah and so it's become
pretty flexible and it allows you to
create cities were three of our current
clients and cyclists on the left and
that's just a completely out of the box
template John Lewis edition magazine in
the middle and their guy the looks after
it as a developer so he does some custom
stuff in there and then on the right
here this is a yachting magazine it's
really good read actually like their
loads of yachting gadgets you just would
never knew existed like you can visit an
inflatable swimming pool so if you're
out in the middle of the sea you can
blow this thing up and they it like make
like a five by five swimming pool in the
middle of the sea like I don't worry
word that you can okay um and so like
any good Tarantino movies very similar
don't hear me I'm gonna start mystery
not chronologically but in the middle
sorry at the most traumatic part which
happens to be the middle when everything
sucked and this is a bit of an awkward
thing to say about your job and
especially when you still work for the
same company and your clients are in the
room and
and then also you decide to do a
run-through of your talk the day before
just so you can make sure it's going to
go okay and then you realize you're
saying this in front of your colleagues
um but yeah so why did everything suck
and this was at the point where the
product was in full full swing for
development swing and and when I look
back now with hindsight i can see that i
can see why i started feeling like this
and it was because i was working on the
product of my own um and I didn't have a
team around me like I wasn't working
with developer other developers or
designers or anything like that I think
maybe I was a product developer because
i was driving the product and developing
the product I've just learnt that phrase
now me gay oh right cool I'm gonna use
it uh and this so i found and i think
this is probably applicable to anybody
working on a project of any kind on
their own for a long time and or maybe
not maybe that's just me hardly but so I
found it was easy I it was easy to get
bored and therefore lazy and I think
this is because I didn't have
interaction with other people on a daily
basis there weren't other people who
knew the product like I did and and who
I could go to with questions and have
discussions about really easily there
was this kind of barrier between
everybody else because they didn't know
the ins and outs of the product and
there were no deadlines the difference
in working on kind of client projects
and working with multiple clients at a
time on relatively short time scales and
at certain times there's like a really
fast paced environment I imagine a bit
more like an agency to then suddenly
work in one product the whole time on my
own just seemed really stark and I had
to do my own time management basically
and it meant that I had to plan my time
and then actually follow my plan to get
 done otherwise I just didn't um I
had limited resources because it was
just me as no one to ask and nothing
changes
you go on holiday for like a week or two
and you come back you ok base is exactly
the same as it was when you left
nothing's been fixed and nothing's been
finished and you knew that because you
didn't hand it over to anyone when you
left but kind of hope that maybe the
like code fairies would pop in and just
like fix that reg ex so you know no one
ah you didn't and yeah sorry but yeah
just making it up making it all up and I
think it's easier to make it up with
other people and on your own and so
that's the dramatic part but it wasn't
like that in the beginning and so
there's a little time on the bottom here
but I realize now the bottom isn't the
best place for it you can't really see
it but we're at the beginning now um and
it was really exciting and the idea of
building a product was really exciting
and I'd been working on similar types of
things for a few years so I felt like I
had the expertise to do this well and
making decisions was easy because and it
was just me and I was you know kind of
able to do all this kind of stuff which
meant that it went really quickly so
because I could make the decisions
immediately I made fast progress and I
wasn't faffing with JIRA sorry ponete
managers I just had her to-do list it's
nice and no designed by committee and I
had control over the whole code base so
it seemed like this really nice thing
that I owned and yeah it's going really
well and then it kind of dawned on me
that I was making a product that people
are going to use some people are going
to see and they're going to do that for
it for a long time hopefully and I
realized how naming things is really
hard like I know we all say that no me
thinks is hard anyway it's really hard
when you know people are going to be
looking at those those words that you've
chosen to describe this product so I
mentioned the skins earlier and so this
is part of the customization
functionality that you have with an
express and so you can picture the scene
we're like building towards be one and
we have a bunch of partners and clients
that have come in and we're presenting
to them about all the stuff that we're
there what we're the changes that were
making product and very exciting things
that we're working on and i'm talking
about how Express amazing expresses and
everything that it does and the day
finishes and that's lovely and we get an
email later that evening from one of our
partners and he says it all sounds
really good but you might want to think
about making one more skin you know
build another skin because people don't
really want to hear about four skins all
the time I was so humiliated I can you
cannot believe how many times I said
four skins like I know I'm saying again
and I'm doing it to myself but it's
ridiculous yeah apparently no one around
me nature's died their wishes I don't
know whether to believe them or not
maybe they're lying to me I'm not sure
but anyway yeah my CA wasn't super
payable and that's not the only problem
on this slide they unfortunately I
didn't if you can figure out the other
thing that might be wrong with this when
we talk internally about em this part of
product we because it's you know part of
our day to day we just refer to the
skins by their name so clean brand
whatever when other people talk about it
like our clients and stuff they tend to
save the whole phrase so clean skin
brown skin dark skin I was like what
yeah really awkward insensitive terrible
like that yeah sorry bad so that's
changing name but it's the kind of thing
that you don't realize you don't hear it
when you say it yourself and when
someone says it back to you suddenly
realize well you've named your product
yeah and everything's is really hard and
so we're back here in the middle now
when everything starts it starts really
well things kind of progressed we were
doing presentations and stuff and but
then I was working my own for too long
and everything start to suck so I did um
what I recommend everyone should do when
this happens and I went on holiday said
yeah sorry i was going on the limits i
went on hill Dana did some yoga in front
of the sea felt much better and it also
happened to coincide with Grayson our
team so we hired to junior and
developers and that meant then we
rearranged the seating plan so he
actually made a nice table of like
front-end design server we had a good
mix of people and and people had
actually gone live on the product by
this point so there was kind of
excitement about what people are doing
with this stuff that we've made and how
they're how they using in all that kind
of stuff and so the logical step at this
point was for me to step away from the
code so spend my time kind of figuring
out where the product should go and kind
of helping other people work on it and
learn the code base and figure out how
things should go and I think that's so
right I suppose this is the key point
this is the point when I kind of shift
role from being a full-time developer
that's all I do just a developer and
people saying it to being a like techy
product manager developer II kind of
person and helping these juniors get
going and and doing all that kind of
stuff and I think what helped with that
role shift was the break because I think
if you go home on a friday at six and
you comment on a monday at nine ish you
is going to be really difficult just to
do a completely different thing and and
while i was away luckily everyone had
got stuck in to the code base which
again is a bit of a funny thing because
when you have been writing something for
ages and you finally finally let other
people look at it it feels a bit like
someone's going to your bedroom drawers
without you in the room and it's the
crate from mark jones
daily I couldn't be here yeah it's just
really weird and you know you know
because it's going to be like when you
look at somebody else's code and you
pick out all the crap bits and you're
like why do they do like that and you
also know in your code where all the
terrible things are and you know the
like horrible function names and all
that kind of stuff and yeah so something
just really weird about people kind of
looking at it when you're not there but
so for me the big changes that I noticed
when and I kind of made that role shift
but that I had to start coordinating
things so people in work matching the
right people with the right bits of work
sewing out releases which I had been
doing anyway but now other people's code
is going into my releases so I'm like
mmm it's bit weird and coms about the
new features so making sure everybody
knows what is that we're doing a release
thing we're going to be doing next and
what kind of stuff handling feature
aggress and future planning feature
acress come from anywhere like CEO
creative director project managers
anyone in the company and then of course
clients as well and yeah and actually I
think it's really nice i really like
getting feature requests but i suppose
the thing that m you have to learn is
how to say no how and when to say no and
what to plan in and and for me that's
the i suppose the kind of process that
i'm going to be now just figuring out
how to sort through all of that and
feedback that I'm getting shining I get
to introduce shiny new things so if I
decide that we should do a different
workflow then we get to do a new
different workflow which I like and
saying now I already mentioned and I now
spend my time in different tools so I
just felt like I had to have some code
in here because otherwise they would be
weird so there's a little bit of a HTML
with some massages so rather than
spending my time in sublime I still do
spend time and survived by also spent a
lot of time in JIRA faffing
and yea and things like Trello for
roadmapping I don't know what kind of
tools you use for a my thing but we're
the men were using Trello which is
pretty cool and slack I'm on slack a lot
answering questions asking questions
figuring out what the question means all
that kind of stuff and finally we're a
team so it's really nice to look back
now and see that recognize that low
point and kind of just be able to say
that actually I wasn't having a very
good time because now we're a team and
it's going really well and we have the
kind of well so we've introduced a bunch
of stuff this is how I was feeling
before and this is that what the kind of
thing we're up to now so where we've got
a proper workflow we're doing pull
requests for doing code reviews all that
kind of stuff we do regularly releases
as much as possible and and we are going
to try and what where it was continuous
development we've got visual regression
tests and we're working on unit testing
so it's kind of all becoming real a
space and we're looking into creating a
user community as well and which if
anyone has ever done I'd be really
interested to know what you use and how
it went and things went out because I've
never done that before and yeah be cool
and so my conclusions are after telling
you my tail working on your own is hard
holidays are good and products the best
when they're made by many sorry
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
