looking at this room it's all white man
nearly not quite all but nearly enough
that it's a problem it's a problem
because if we are creating the future we
will fix problems that we can see and we
can't experience the world in any way
other than as we are so it's not my
fault that I'm a white man it's not my
fault that I think like a white man but
it's my fault that there aren't more
non-white non men in our community to
experience the joy that is software so
it's up to all of us to improve things
but I if I could believe if I could
believe that
the fact that I only spend up speaking
to white men is do to me that would make
me so happy because that would mean that
it's only me that's got to change
and that's manageable but seriously we
have a problem in our community we need
to do something about it and that's up
to all of us okay rant over I'm getting
quite used to doing that runt everywhere
I cave now um I'll be running a bit more
tonight though because I've had an
interesting day on Stack Overflow for
exactly this reason and I thought we'd
I'll go into the slides in a bit but
before that I like to sort of find out
what your experiences of Stack Overflow
have been like I'm assuming that most of
you have used Stack Overflow even if
it's just lurking and seen some search
results yeah okay um have any of you had
a bad experience on sec overflow okay I
may be preaching to the choir then and I
don't know whether you are see churches
have choirs we don't tend to do them in
Methodism much I was at a wonderful
carol service yesterday that my kids
school was putting on and I seem to be
the only member of the congregation
singing my heart help but there we go
entirely to a different
um so my problem on psycho flow was
three questions today one about xml and
numbers one about someone in java having
a problem with a scanner which is a
terrible terrible class in in java you
can tell API design and where it's gone
wrong by the kind of the kind of number
of questions that you get on Stack
Overflow and the third was about reading
a from a deflate stream and I won't put
up the questions partly because you know
you might have a look at the user in
question and in each case and things but
the first one were saying I get a number
x 10,000 when i read some data from xml
here's my code and there were 150 lines
of code or so that i think even from the
start didn't compile because there was
right here's a class and here's the
constructor and here's a method no end
of the constructor didn't have a closing
brace or anything so this clearly wasn't
the whole code and right here's the
another class that uses it and this was
clearly in the middle of some asp.net
application or similar so there was
nothing that I could start I said could
I have a minimal complete verifiable
example and after a about twenty minutes
he said there you go that's still not
going to compile it still doesn't have a
main method and there's no data you've
got a problem in your XML and you're not
showing me the XML how can I possibly
reproduce this we went through a bit
more banter and here have a look now no
I still can't copy/paste compile run see
the problem Oh
try now no there's still no main method
what they're gonna be running Oh deleted
the question posted a new duplicate
question about 10 minutes later why are
you doing this I believe the problem was
in one line where he was calling double
dot
I'm passing in a string the fact that he
was writing that to sit her to a CSV
file later completely irrelevant the
fact that he was getting some XML from a
web service the web server is completely
irrelevant the XML completely irrelevant
a minimal example of that would have
been using system class tests static
void main string text equals string
literal double D equals double dot parse
text and then either console dot write
line D or something like that like I can
say it quicker than I could have read
his question before so that's sort of
what I'm talking about tonight is how
how we can get to genuine minimal but
complete verifiable examples why they're
so important and why if none of you have
had problematic experiences where you
ask a question on Stack Overflow and you
get a load of people saying you need to
fix your question if you haven't had
that experience then you're you're on
Santa's nice list but you need to help
the rest of the community because
there's clearly a problem sock overflow
has been getting a bad reputation as
being a nasty place where you know all
these horrible moderators come and close
any interesting question I know we just
have quality standards and it's not for
me it's not really about keeping stack
overflows quality high this isn't talked
about Stack Overflow
it's about developers and developer
practices because when I quite often I
can see a question and I know the answer
but I will force someone to go through
and get a better question because the
process of doing that is more important
than the answer the answer will help
them today it's that that whole teach
someone to fish business and that's
where I can't possibly do that on my own
so at this point I will actually go back
to my slides um these were slides that I
have presented twice from my shared both
times um I work from home about four
days a week
I work from my shed people keep telling
me that I shouldn't call it a shed
because it's it's a garden building and
I should really have a picture of it but
basically you look down my garden you
see my office bit there and then there
is a bit that's got lawnmowers and stuff
in but my shed has an ice-cream maker
and Joanne Miro pictures and surround
sound and things so it's these sheds go
it's quite nice but I've presented this
twice from my shed once to a sort of
live audience around the world and once
just being recorded to then be shown so
I've never given it in front of a live
audience live and in person
so I want feedback as we go along
well feedback afterwards about what
could be improved but also interaction
as we go along if you're quiet the whole
time this will be a lot less interesting
I won't say it'll be deathly boring but
it'll be a lot less interesting than if
you do pipe up if you see I've done
something wrong or well why didn't you
do that bit first or whatever that'll be
where actually everyone else will get a
lot more outs of things right so where I
was coming in was where you fit in with
me doing this talk I'm on a bit of a
mission so I had a mission from about
2009 or something to sort out date and
time for.net and now I've gone about as
far with us as I think I can in terms of
you know a time it will make your life
better and that's a whole other talk and
yeah if if we get through this one by
the time pizzas come I can just talk
about no design for the second half
it'll be fine um but my mission for the
next however many years via blog posts
and speaking and getting other people to
chip in is to improve the world's
diagnostic capabilities and I'm not
talking about anything really difficult
and ground there are there are cool
things out there I saw Microsoft
announced recently something that Google
cloud platform has as well in terms of
diagnostic debuggers not the kind of
debugger where you step through but
where you've got a service running
across hundreds of No
and you know that sometimes something
goes wrong so you put a breakpoint
snapshot point whatever you want to call
it on a line of code and if that happens
on any of the servers
it doesn't stop but it captures all the
information so you can get diagnostic
stuff later on so I'm not talking about
that kind of stuff that's that sort of
401 or I don't know how all that the
American one o ones and things work but
that's that's how about stuff and the
world needs that but not nearly as much
as it needs good old-fashioned knowing
what you're doing to start with so I'm
trying to do my best here but I can't do
it all myself I would like you to spread
the word so that will be in your
companies if any do any of you teach no
or go into schools and give talks
occasionally no okay well you could
start doing that for one thing
and likewise universities I gave a talk
in London Metropolitan University early
this year maybe last year I lose track
of time about things that you don't
learn in a computer science course but
that you need to be a software engineer
so I'm firmly of the opinion that there
are far more people doing computer
science degrees than need computer
science and there aren't nearly enough
people studying software engineering
seriously in order to be software
engineers so we should have more
software engineering courses but anyway
if you're going to be a computer
scientist wouldn't it be good to use
source control and know about unit
testing when I talk to a roomful of
computer scientists I think one person
was using so there are sort of 40 or 50
people one person using source control
about three people doing unit testing
what
it's just that makes no sense to me we
need to get the word out there are these
things they're useful you get isn't
exactly friendly but eventually you can
at least learn by rote the commands that
you need for and then find someone who
you can turn to when it all goes to pot
I was there for a while I'm now you know
I use ref log effectively sometimes
these days so we need to spread the word
and I fit in by spreading the word to
you and you will go out from there um
the point of this light if I remember I
remember my notes rightly is that unlike
some talks that I gave the idea of this
certainly isn't that I come out looking
smart okay there will be there are talks
that I gave so I look at the features of
c-sharp seven you've never seen features
like this and by demonstrating them
magnificently yes you can learn but I
look good and that's the main thing to
come out of the talk okay not really but
that's very very much not the point of
today the point is I will show you some
code and doing really obvious stuff to
code and you will go that was really
obvious I'll say yeah it was wasn't it
but why don't people do it why do people
persist in saying that's a complete
example when stuff won't compile that's
a minimal example well you've got a load
of stuff talking about a logger when
that's not really you we don't need is
logger enabled if you want to write
something out for the sake of the
example then console dot write line is
your friend
if you don't fine but there's no need to
conditional eyes it and try to talk to a
web service and stuff okay so there are
four things to remember techniques to
remember which are on here and you
probably guess the rest of the talk the
main thing is divide and conquer I
talked before about this this first
question I've just realized that I
haven't talked about the other questions
at all I'll spread them out over the
course the talk so he was I believe
making a web service called that
returned him some XML that he was also
using the old XML document API which is
just horrible anyone having to use that
still instead of link to XML link to XML
rocks it's it's awesome yeah either I'm
sorry particularly he had to do stuff
with namespaces that's really really
painful with XML document I'm really
straightforward with link to XML yet so
he was making a web service call
getting some XML back parsing the XML
and creating some objects and then
writing stuff to a CSV file okay so
that's some very distinct stages the
point of the divide-and-conquer
technique is you've got a problem
somewhere in that giant array of things
work out which initially very
coarse-grained is the problem something
to do with the web service I can get rid
of that by saying let's imagine that my
web service returns this file that I've
got on the hard disk and you can fairly
easily mock that out it kind of helps if
you've got a decent architecture as well
but I can get rid of all the web service
calls I look the problem still happens
therefore it probably had nothing to do
with the web service okay well is it to
do with writing out a CSV file if I just
look at the values in the debugger do I
still see the problem yes okay so kill
the bit that's writing out the CSV so
I've got some XML that I'm parsing and
then I'm creating the objects well
what's the bit that's parsing the XML
okay I have you extracted the node from
the value and when I create the object
it gets the wrong value
okay so throw the rest of the XML away
or two steps let's have some minimal bit
of XML with just the one field or
actually whatever you want to call it
that is parsing incorrectly instead of a
huge great document yep I can still see
the problem with that minimal document
what am I doing with that document I'm
extracting one string value okay well
let's throw away the document here's a
string let's parse the string oh we've
got a problem
so that's the divide-and-conquer bit is
just working out at a course level where
the issue is
and then honing down it really is as
simple as you having the problem size
each time picking your environment I
reckoned that this person was writing a
an asp.net application I love web
applications I love mobile applications
I'm not an application developer and
maybe if you are those are the places
you're most familiar with and you can
start a debugger
most easily in a web application or a
mobile app I find it amazing that with
xamarin I can have my laptop hooked up
over the network to a Mac Mini that's
talking to an iPad and I can hit f5 in
visual studio stuff will happen
magically and I can step through in an
iPad that's really cool but unless my
problem is something to do with xamarin
and iOS I probably don't want to be
doing that I want to be using either
just a local unit test or a console
application I'm a big big fan of console
applications so you can really easily
whip up a console app you know I
described the sort of nine line
reproduction earlier on and unit tests
are awesome as well when you use unit
tests and when you use others I'll talk
about later on challenge challenging
assumptions basically this is a matter
of knowing that if something isn't
working as you expect it to then you
don't know where the problem is and that
sounds sort of a truism
but then you find well I know the
problem isn't here
people post this fortunately not
terribly often saying I'm a hundred
percent sure my code is correct but it
doesn't work I'm pretty sure your code
isn't correct now there are there are
degrees of assumptions and there are
assumptions that are useful to make
knowingly say for the moment I will
assume that my compiler works and that
the dotnet based class libraries work
and if they don't I will be able to test
that later on but I will test one thing
at a time and assume that that works and
that the problem is somewhere in my own
code because it usually is and I'm not
saying that in a generic way so much the
problem is usually in my code
and yes it will be in yours but I'm
certainly not mean and I'll show some
interesting assumptions later on that
you might be surprised about keeping a
log this is relatively new to me not the
idea isn't new but I have started doing
it more partly as a way of spreading the
word is when I've started investigating
something interesting I now start
writing a blog post and I literally say
right step zero here's the context step
one I will try to remove this part of it
and you're showing the
divide-and-conquer but the great thing
is if you keep a log of what you've done
and what the results were then you won't
forget it
your memories may be a lot better than
mine my memory isn't what it used to be
as far as I can remember but it's it's
really easy to be utterly convinced that
you tried something and it still didn't
work or that you tried something and it
did work so the problem can't be over
there particularly if you've got that
nagging I reckon the problem is in this
and everything I've seen confirms my
theory so far so I'll just make very
scant notes about what I'm testing
because I kind of know where I think I'm
heading and then later on you find ok it
definitely isn't where I thought it was
do you have to start again from scratch
and say everything I've recorded is now
worthless or can you go back and say
well there are these two other
possibilities which of them is also
corroborated by all the tests I've
already done
now I mentioned console apps and unit
tests if one of your ways of diagnosing
things is to use unit tests then you can
keep those along as a kind of a log of
what you've done
if you want to keep them passing or keep
all but the one you're working on
passing then feel free to keep just
changing what the expected value is
until it matches reality and that will
at least show this is something that's
true which is probably the
anytime I've only just realized it
saying about it but any of you use X
unit versus and unit I'm personally a
big n unit fan we use X unit at work and
the whole fact vs. Theory thing leaves
me cold but in this particular case if
you are recording facts then that makes
sense the rest of the time no it's a
test for goodness sake so keep a
detailed log of what you tried and what
happened and try not to cheat it's
really really hard not to cheat it's
very rarely a straight line when you're
diagnosing things you didn't go aha I
will learn X I then learn why I then and
then I'm done
no you sort of learn a few things and
then oh well I thought I'd learned that
but actually it was something subtly
different and things go go wrong and if
you're talking to a new programmer
because it's it's typically we've learnt
this through five ten fifteen thirty
whatever it is years of programming
we've learnt the hard way and it would
be really nice if not everyone had to go
through quite that much hassle and in
some ways the the struggle is part of
the benefit and that's where you're
taking some time when writing a stack
overflow question is really important
that that struggle is how you get the
answer out but you don't need to make we
don't need to make it look like it's
always easy and that we always get the
right answer because that just puts
people off if they see where they are
and they try something and you know the
first three things they try fail if
everything you've shown them always
succeeds first time then they're gonna
think it must be because I'm rubbish I
will stop bothering and ask a bad
question on Stack Overflow instead or
leave the industry or whatever it is
okay divide and conquer I've talked
about making your environment I will go
back to console apps versus unit tests
because someone I was thrilled yesterday
day before someone tweeted saying I
follow John's advice and written a
console app to try
diagnose a problem and I got to the
answer and didn't have to ask a question
on Stack Overflow it's hey yeah and
someone said sounds like you should have
written a unit test instead okay thanks
for the encouragement they're really
positive community the unit tests are
great I certainly wouldn't talk against
unit tests at all but I find I
personally use them for either code that
I am writing at the time or have already
written you know sometimes I will
genuinely write test first code usually
it's tests alongside oh I write the
tests before I commit so it's yeah same
kind of time I don't find for
exploratory work which isn't for
exploring how I can use an API that's
great for TDD if I'm exploring something
is wrong in this big ball of mud I don't
always find that unit tests are as easy
partly because I can't do it from the
command line let me show you how I
normally answer a stack overflow
question this probably isn't great to
see at the back but oh here we go so
this was looking at you might learn some
scene shop after all tonight um let me
just put this in notepad instead so I
don't use notepad normally but it's
easier to get that in black on white and
up the font a bit yeah it's the UM
syntax highlighting is nice but but big
letters good and I can't be bothered to
start Visual Studio so normally I have
Visual Studio for actual projects and
throw away stuff for little
investigations I've come up with
something in between which I'll show you
in a minute but I was trying to work out
what this would do right so call a
member name is part of c-sharp 5 so if
we say we do let's let's change this to
new base ok anyone now want to guess
what this will print it will print main
those of you near the back will have to
trust those of you near the front in
fact it'll print false let's print the
actual name as well there we go it
prints false and then main so call a
member named as an attribute says it's
only useful if you apply it to an
optional parameter of type string and if
the caller doesn't provide an argument
then the compiler helpfully pops in the
the name of the member calling it so
that's fine here because we're calling
it from main if we call new derived what
is calling the base class constructor
derived but but we haven't got any
members in derived you've got a default
constructor so what do we think the the
output will be it's null when using CSC
let's see if I've got mono installed I
have who write if I know run tests it
prints it all yeah so it's it is the
derived class constructor that is
calling the base class constructor but
in fact the the c-sharp the microsoft
c-sharp specification actually says it
won't it won't pass it won't fill in the
name for you the ECMO standard that will
be coming out Oh
fairly soon I think doesn't explicitly
call out this I hope that the the
c-sharp six specification might say that
this is the right thing to do because it
it feels really weird that adding public
derived that should be a no op right but
it's not if I now use Rosen again
oh no oh okay
that wasn't no up
that feels like it should be a no op but
it's not who so that was interesting C
sharp fact that I happen to be
investigating and wasn't it easy to do
you can see all the code when I'm
compiling and this is probably why I do
things from a console app rather than a
unit test I don't need to specify any
other assemblies it's just CSC test CS
what I do these days is I have an issues
directory that is now segregated into
many things and so if Google cloud net
this is work stuff this is all on github
so these are github issue numbers so I
don't yeah I've got Visual Studio up
that's got my main solution in and I
don't want to start polluting that way
the unit test code because it'll be a
slight pain yeah I can get reset it
afterwards but it'll be slightly
annoying so what I tend to do is I would
do something like their self Coast and
donate new console and that creates a
project file and that's half the problem
with starting a new application in the
new project in Visual Studio was just
going through the new project wizard
took far longer than typing dotnet new
so here we are and now I've got you know
I I'm now in a reasonable state and then
it'll save her the solution when when I
exit this way of saying well I just want
to start something where I'm exploring
and we're up we're running yeah we can
debug that and it'll print hello world
that's really useful without having gone
anywhere else and I don't know why it is
that when you run without debugging you
get this press any key to continue or
I'm pretty sure it's how it starts the
process but it's it's kind of annoying
that there's that difference between
debug and not so if you prefer to use
unit tests that's absolutely fine but I
would request
and request that you pass on this
information unless the problem is
something to do with a unit test
framework which sometimes it will be
I've got an example of that later on um
if you're going to write something on
Stack Overflow this is better than an X
unit test why because not everyone's
used X unit it's better than an unit
test because not everyone uses n unit
there's one other change I would make to
this which is one of the nasty things
about Stack Overflow is it's quite
narrow namespaces are pointless in short
but complete examples that is now ready
to post on Stack Overflow you could make
it shorter by putting braces on the line
or whatever but no keep it so that it's
idiomatic for someone reading the code
they're not going to care that there
isn't a namespace but they will care if
you start calling things P and you're
giving nonsensical variable names method
names etc so at this point if I'm trying
to investigate a problem then it's
really easy to hit the debugger and I'm
away I don't use despite the name
diagnostic tools I hardly use this
window at all I just haven't been
bothered so I've made it my hotspot is
now up I will just briefly if if there
are any questions that happen to work
with this then let's go for it
as a live demo ddddd malformed data's
nothing is screaming this is going to be
a really good thing to demo what I might
do is have another look see that that's
probably not a good diagnostic one there
could be interesting stuff but it's not
a diagnostic one what I will do during
the break is see if I can find one it's
just pretty buff net is not my Protoss
compiled a bit I like this
already it's got a fairly complete
missing using directives but that's not
too bad and it's got some useful detail
bah-bah-bah yeah I will probably upload
that later on so it won't be a good
example of what extra diagnostics to
give because it's already kind of in US
in a shape where I feel that I would be
able to look at that even though I
haven't used protobuf net for a long
time at least I would be happy to look
at that because the questioner has given
me enough information that I can
probably reproduce the problem without
any extra knowledge that's a really good
thing not just for getting an answer but
for anyone who later comes along and
thinks well I may have the same problem
or not and if you've got something that
lays out the problem really clearly then
you can tell right that was pick your
environment and various other things
challenging assumptions I mentioned
earlier on some assumptions that you
might have so as before assume that your
code is the one that is the the code
that's broken next if you can't find
anything wrong in your code it may well
be something in that third-party library
that someone emailed you the DLL that
feels more likely than that you found a
bug in JSON net which in turn feels more
likely than you found a bug in asp.net
core or maybe it doesn't I don't know on
those those both feel more likely than
you found a bug in string which people
will say string dot index on is clearly
brokered because this bad code no and
the compiler now I love finding bugs in
the compiler very few things make me
happy that sounds really really sad
there are many things that make me
happier than finding bugs in the
compiler but it does make me kind of
happy
almost as happy as finding a bug in the
spec which happens as well so bugs in
the in the compiler do happen but
they're pretty rare but it's not just in
terms of your code that you or the code
that's running that you should be
thinking of things to be skeptical of I
don't know how long how much of your
time
you folks spend in the debugger I try
not to spend very much time at all
partly because the debugger lies to you
it lies in really obvious ways if I
still got this yes okay let's give a
simple example I could find a hundred
questions on Stack Overflow that looked
like this okay
and I'm gonna say I don't want double
backslashes in my text so I'm gonna do
text a text dot replace and if you're
really lucky someone will post this much
code and only this much code and look
we've just replaced all the double
backslashes but if you can see nearer
the back trust those near near at the
front it's saying text is see colum
double backslash users double backslash
John well we only started with one and
just in case there were two we've
replaced two with one what can possibly
be going wrong it's like the debugger is
lying to you um the debugger helpfully
escapes things for you and I can see how
that could be useful if you've got a tab
in there it's kind of nice to know
that's a tab backslash is this is evil I
keep meaning to have a word with Dustin
Campbell and the like and say can we
please do something about this every
time there's a stack overflow question
that is someone not not understanding
that the debugger does something there
should be a little counter going off in
Microsoft for a little bit like the
build is broken this has been a problem
for years and years and years and these
days enough people do know about it that
when a question is asked like this I am
often not the first person to say I bet
you're looking at this in the debugger
aren't you
because they won't see if they got as
far as console dot write line text if
they were writing a console application
then they could see an the output of
thing with single back slashes but
they're not they're saying the value of
text is but not saying how they're
seeing it so they don't know yet that
the debugger is lying to them um the
other thing that the debugger has is the
immediate window now when I do use the
debugger
I basically use breakpoints the coalsack
and the local and watch windows and
that's all I never use the immediate
window but I gather there are people who
find it really useful and that's fine so
long as you realize it lies to you or
eight sometimes execute code in subtly
different ways and the ways in which
it's subtly different to code that you
write in your main program they've
changed over time subtly as well I think
with Rozlyn it's actually closer now
than it was because it's I think using
the scripting engine so things like over
low resolution should really be pretty
close but I have seen it do very odd
things with conversions and things like
that so it's not a case of don't use the
immediate window it's be aware that if
you start seeing something funny it may
not be that the actual value is funny
but that the problem is in the immediate
window so at that point put that code
into your program and make sure you log
it somewhere somewhere that you know
what's going to happen strings are funny
things as well I've I've mentioned the
string that you see in the debugger what
I should really do let's we'll notepad
handle this demo code using c-sharp
dr. Nunes yes right so let's pop this
little beastie into Visual Studio so
we're we're convinced we're not going to
look in the debugger anymore we're just
going to print out the value and this
will be fine so oh we've got a question
mark well that's interesting because
they didn't seem to be a question mark
in our original source code but at least
it's one question mark if I'd done
something else we might see nothing and
get two question marks or maybe see one
character and get two question marks out
and if we print the length of text this
is going to print that it's got a length
of eight where as we can see seven
things so one of the nice things about
the windows console is that it's fairly
rubbish at doing anything non ASCII nice
in some cases what's less than line and
infinite infinity positive infinity
what's this going to print to the
console eight
there we go look 8 it hasn't got an
infinity sign so Oh we'll just turn it
on its side no one will know the
difference I point this out
not just because if you're trying to
debug something and and you're getting
an error that something's much much too
big ok I'll print out the actual value 8
hmm what the hell do I do now in fact I
think if you options
oh you can't change the code page there
if you let's run this code from here
this will print 8 again eventually if I
do see HCP 6 500 1 whoa infinity sign
very small but it is there I promise
that 6 500 1 that's the windows code
page for utf-8 worth remembering so if
you're seeing weird stuff in a console
then get to a stage where you can do C
HC P 6500 1 and you'll be away but I
want to give you a better tool for this
so this is something to actually
remember that I don't think I've put in
the slides but it's easy to remember if
you go to tinyurl.com slash unicode -
explorer you come bit that come to the
only bit of JavaScript that's on the web
that I have written
I'm not good at JavaScript I'm not proud
but this it's just it's in at the end of
a page that's all about Unicode and
c-sharp and stuff but actually this is
the most useful bit of the page if you
paste some text in there it shows you
every character and the unicode value of
it and it's utf-16 representation and
it's utf-8 representation the these two
will differ for things that aren't in
the basic multilingual plane
someone shout tails an emoji I knew I I
I was having a little bet with myself
eunuch a pile of poo
it had to be so if you if you already
know what the character is then file
format loss info is great but if I has
it got something that I can copy can I
copy that yes hopefully so if I copy the
Unicode pilot to there we go so it's
saying that the Unicode value is 1/f for
a nine and the fact that it's got five
characters here means that it's not in
the basic multilingual plane that's
represented as a surrogate pair no
surrogate followed by hi surrogate and
in utf-8
it's those four bytes the number of
times I have found this page useful when
I hadn't expected it to this was mostly
for my own benefit but I've seen Stack
Overflow posts where someone said this
code doesn't compile it's saying there's
an error in the middle of that method
call that method name and you put it in
you copy it put it in here and it turns
out there's some non-breaking zero width
non-breaking space or something that's
particularly evil I will show you what
the character is that's in here just to
give a bit of trivia it's really nice
having more time so when I've previously
presented these slides it's been a
one-hour slot and I haven't been able to
go over so having sort of an hour and a
half fish is great so this character
here Ãºnico 1-800 every saw from the
Unicode consortium runs an adopter
character funding campaign I have tried
several times to adopt the Mongolian
Bell separator and failed it's my
favorite character because of it sort of
done the hokey cokey in unicode
characters categories so in c-sharp
there's identify a sort of normalization
so there is Unicode kateri called
formatting characters where you can have
as many
all matching characters within an
identifier as you like and then it will
still be the same identifier as one that
doesn't have those formatting characters
all good so far
so I will tell you that at the moment
the Mongolian Val separator is a
formatting character so this identifier
and this identifier are the same in an
earlier version of Unicode it was a
whitespace character at which point it
would be string X and it would be
introducing a new variable called X and
not changing the value of the field at
all
in an earlier still version of Unicode
it was a formatting character it's done
the hokey-cokey of unicode character
categories now not only that that's sort
of bad enough to start with but what
version of Unicode does c-sharp use
anyone happen to know so the Microsoft
specification says it uses Unicode too
and that's the version that used to ship
with the old native CSC compiler let me
just check oh no sorry three not two
three
so it was there as a formatting
character the ECMO standard said no it's
fall so you could have this this program
is valid c-sharp under both the
Microsoft specification and the old ECMO
standard and it would mean different
things in the new ACMA standard that
I've been helping to standardize and
what Roslyn does it's some version will
just it off no because the reality is
that Roslin uses whatever dotnet
provides it with you Rozlyn is running
on net which has a version of Unicode so
it will call char get Unicode category
or whatever it is so it's whatever and
we've made sure that the standard says
it will be some version of Unicode but
it's it's just so joyous that it changes
and the specific
and sender don't match up so you get
this weird effect okay enough of that
silliness let's get to some more Salinas
but I must remember to do that in okayed
that fix that file I didn't have a
chance to look over Stack Overflow over
the break so we won't be trying to find
something else do another question to
answer however where are we strings
floating point um so I've shown how
strings can be wrong it should be of no
surprise to anyone that floating point
is a bit more complex than you might
expect I blame the c-sharp language for
defaulting to double I reckon if when I
typed 0.1 that was decimal people would
use decimal a lot more than they use
double and they would be confused a lot
less of the time because double is
almost never the right thing to use in
business applications at least but the
console output shows you a value I can't
even remember in Java it's really
precisely said that double dot to string
shows you the shortest representation
that is unique so if you've got fourteen
point one it can show you fourteen point
one because there is no double value
that is no two double values that are
distinct we'll both show fourteen point
one so it must be the closest one to
exactly fourteen point one I have
another bit of code that is on the same
C sharp in-depth website that you may
find useful I generally keep a copy of
it lying around in my test directory
called double converter which I should
really make slight easy to use at some
point but it's a piece of code I wrote
many years ago that the only interesting
bit is that it has two exact string that
takes a double and if we write some code
that's going to use it
I'll put this in notepad in a minute
double D he calls should we go with not
0.1 should we see what not point one
actually is double converter dot two
exact string see this is where I should
make it an extension method or something
like that right so if we bring this up
in a more readable font that's not too
bad and then we do need to include it
when we're building there we go right
and so that will show you the exact
value and it's worth being aware of and
this is sort of just general
floating-point knowledge that not every
decimal value has an exact
representation in binary floating-point
but every binary floating-point value
leaving outside Nan's and infinities
I'll tell you another bug in net so
every normal and D normal floating point
number has a precise decimal
representation so this double converter
as long as you give it something that
isn't nan or positive or negative
infinity will always spit out a sequence
of digits and a dot that is the precise
value of that double there's no
approximation so a double is not I get
frustrated where people say our doubles
an approximate type no it's not every
double value is an exact number it's
just that when you write double x equals
not point one that conversion from the
source code of not point one to that
that's an approximation and when you do
addition or something like that that
will probably have to do some rounding
but it's all well specified it's not
kind of the idea of all their
approximate types makes it sound like
they could be just anything really no
there there are exact values that when
operations are performed you might lose
some information just like no one would
say integers are approximate
but if I divide 7 by 3 then I don't get
the exact value you we expect that they
will be rounding going on and no one
says that either 7 3 or 2 are just
approximate values there are
approximations to the actual value of 2
and 1/3 but it's still the value 2 is a
precise value trying to see how double
is broken just actually broken I only
found this out quite recently doing some
pretty buff stuff so mmm ok let's hope
that this works
double 2 in 64 bits 1
it convert a dot inches four bits to
double D - sorry - plus one okay and
hopefully these will both be nouns I
keep talking about Nan's kind of
assuming that you all know something
about them is anyone going I have no
idea I might as well be reading Twitter
at the moment so nany is not a number so
things like what's the square root of
minus one well it's not a number because
we don't have complex numbers let's just
check that we're good so far yes they're
both nuns so what's going to happen if I
write D one is d 1 equals D 2 so we we
reckon there's the the single person
who's happy to do that said false what
about that one false okay how about that
one
pulse how about this one trick okay and
how about I'm not expecting exact values
here I'll be quite dumbfounded if you
can predict the exact value and if it
happens again I'll know there was a
plant from this time so okay let's let's
see what happens let's um as as the
actual results are this mouse is not
obeying me properly right okay as that's
bigger is that still readable even
though it's white on black at the back
yeah okay so we've got that there Nan's
false and false yes the Equality
operator on nan it's a bit like null in
sequel it isn't even equal to itself
however when you do equals well we said
false and then true no one nan is equal
to another so in in I Triple E 754 the
floating point standard there are
there's just one positive infinity and
one negative infinity one positive zero
and one negative zero but there are lots
and lots of men's there are what are
called signalling names and quiet men's
the idea being that in certain
circumstances a signalling nan might
effectively throw an exception whereas a
quiet man wouldn't but there are many
many bit patterns that throw it and I
was fortunate that this is just a way of
saying well I'll take two bitwise
representations that are only one bit
apart if this hadn't worked I'd changed
that to a minus one and then I suspect
it would have done because it's it's
something in the top set of bits that
counts so they are equal to each other
but look at this they've got different
hash codes that's
not allowed out of it huh no it's too
much hassle to put this Internet core I
think this was fixed in some version of
the.net core CLR I think but yeah bit of
a pain I won't show you the other weird
thing that I found although it's a great
example of Diagnostics yes I will I'll
find it just the blog post so I've said
I've been blogging about Diagnostics and
I think the most recent one that I did
was very very odd and a JIT compiler bug
so yeah I did say assume that the
compiler works in the runtime works in
the base class library well just
sometimes no it really doesn't and this
was a weird situation so I'm sure I
didn't actually introduce myself by John
but I worked for Google and my job at
the moment I used to have to come and
say I'm not representing Google at
Google I do Java whereas I'm doing a
c-sharp now I now work in c-sharp all
the time it's great making Google cloud
platform rock for c-sharp developers so
that's that's the sales pitch and I work
particularly on the libraries so if
you're trying to talk to any of our
amazing services your vision and speech
recognition and video intelligence and
all kinds of things then come use my
libraries it will give you a lovely
experience which previously our API
experience has been sometimes adequate
but certainly not delightful I aim to
make it delightful so I've been working
on campfire store and I had some unit
tests that were only failing on Linux
and these were really quite naughty
looking unit tests where I would create
we've got a struct that's zero point
which is just the latitude and longitude
um and I was having units here saying
well I expect that when I pass this from
a protoplanet protocol buffer or
whatever that it will be equal to this
and
it's simple code it really should work
it works on windows doclet portable it's
all it's all fine it failed on Linux so
sorry it also failed on it worked on my
local machine including my did it work
on one of my Linux boxes I think but it
was failing on on Travis and these days
now one of the one of the things that
was pointed out to me and this is where
I appreciate this kind of thing so I
have a separate Linux box and I have two
little Intel nukes called bag puss and
Gabriel for those of you who Android
bypass back in the day the idea was that
bag puss would be running I can't even
remember which CI system it was and all
the others would be agents and when bag
puss would go to sleep all of his
friends would go to sleep but it was
just yeah a nice naming convention and
they run my notice home benchmarks
because I don't trust cloud machines to
always be of exactly the same if you're
running micro benchmarks you really want
to make sure you've got the exact same
environment ideally the same chip well
when I've got two of these that have the
same at least the same model and I can
make sure that nothing else is running
on them at 2:00 in the morning and 3:00
in the morning I'm as close to being
ideal circumstances for a benchmark as I
can get so that's why I've got them but
it's also handy during the day to be
able to occasionally run bits of code
someone else said but hang on you've got
a Linux box already is that one hey
that's my Windows box yeah but you can
run Linux on it that the not your
booting or anything the Linux subsystem
for Windows managed to reproduce this
and I wish I found that out which I
thought to try it before I'd started it
all because it is the it's the Linux JIT
compiler for dotnet so when I'm running
bash on here
it really is running the dotnet core
build for Linux with the Linux JIT
and so it shows the problem so yeah that
would have made things much much simpler
so I first kept firestore but made it
into a console app so I kept my this was
my production code but let's get rid of
X units because I know that X unit is
going to be doing interesting things so
I will introduce my own assert here
which doesn't have very much yeah
doesn't fail or anything this is the
nuttiest unit test framework that you've
ever seen but that's all it needs to be
so I'm creating two Gio points that are
the same 1.25 and 2.5 as the last
student longitude and then what I'm
checking is that when I call the
equality operators via reflection that
they should give the right results and
did you do I get no it's not and so
we're already in a situation of I've
gone from a solution with many thousands
of lines to 33 lines of code
I'd gone from including references to I
suppose at this point I've still got
references to G RPC and all kinds of
services I'm not calling any of them but
for my peace of mind the fact that I'm
working in a smaller codebase is useful
so that's where I have a bias against
unit tests for this exploratory work
just because you're you know if I've got
20 different files that are tabs in
visual studio and I know I'm working in
thousands of lines of code even if I
know that half of them aren't being used
it makes me nervous
whereas by the time I'm in a console
application where either I've started
off by copying a load of code and then
deleting half of it or I
fer to build up from scratch then I can
take more notice of I know exactly
what's running and if I've written mein
then I know there isn't any weird stuff
going on behind the scenes with you know
xunit having to cope with asynchronous
tests and maybe having some extra tasks
in the background and going via a visual
studio plug-in and then maybe back out
again and all kinds of things but unit
test frameworks do to be really helpful
most of the time so having reproduced
that I then wanted to remove firestore
entirely and this is where I made a
mistake and this is where I want to log
that I'm making mistakes so I did too
much what I should have done is copy
geopoint
which was a really simple structure it
hardly did anything I could have copied
that straight into my test project and
then removed the dependency and all
would stand reproduced it that was the
right thing to do do one thing at a time
and log it but no I'm too clever for
that I will come up with a new structure
of my own that has a single double value
say one point five here and it doesn't
do much else you know it's this code is
really just comparing the the the values
all of the test code is was it what it
was before but no this doesn't reproduce
it silly John so it prints true three
times it's actually testing equality
three different ways so once testing it
not with reflection once testing it by
invoking invoking the method directly
with reflection via method info and the
third time sorry that's the third time
the second time it's having what am i
doing oh yes both times it its invoking
the method but once via a delegate so
I'm clearly at some point had the full
that this was something to do with
delegates okay so no no luck there let's
go back to two doubles and this now
reproduces it so this is really similar
code to the previous one so we've got
two doubles here instead of one so at
this point I'm on very much scratching
head grounds I'm thinking this is gonna
make great bug report at some point and
I'm pretty sure at this point that it's
really really not my fire stall code
that's wrong they're having assumed that
it was my code to start with I've now
proved pretty concisely if pretty firmly
that it's not yeah if this doesn't work
but the same thing with only a single
double does work there's something very
weird going on I tried it in a few
different frameworks and environments
and it was fixed in right so true means
it's working true false false means it's
failing so this was showing that it was
failing for net core app 1.0 in both
debug and release and working for net
core app 1.1 in both debug and release
and that's just a little bit of the
exact details of what I got installed
because by this point I realized I
really need to be logging everything in
quite a lot of detail so I then start
putting some extra logging this is quite
dangerous I'm slightly well I'm relieved
that this did show the problem but there
are times where it might not have done
because by using console dot write line
I could have blown up any chance of
inlining I could have fixed things there
are times where the JIT compiler can use
larger represents 80 bit representations
of floating-point numbers so
long as you don't need the 64 bit
representation for something like a
field so there can be times where you
can have the exact same code but
sometimes it's using a field and
sometimes it's using a local variable
and they will give different results
because the field really really is only
64 bits wide whereas the local variable
that's probably in a register somewhere
that can be the extended representation
of 80 bits that's fine and it gives you
different results when you do some
something that would otherwise have to
round so I was really relieved to see
that this gave completely bizarre
results so the when we call the
comparison directly we see that the left
and right hand side are both one point
five two point five when we call it with
reflection we hit one point five and
there some random crap a very very small
number so it's one with 316 zeros in
front of it well at a point I seeing
that I'm only halfway through the the
blog post I will let you go and find
that this is on code blog John skeet UK
let me just check I think if you just do
code blog John skeet yes okay you'll
find it it's the second or third post
that's up the point is this took me two
or three hours investigating this many
people would have asked a question on
Stack Overflow without trying any of
that and I was chatting to someone over
the break about what the purpose of
Stack Overflow is and I'd like to make
sure that you all know what the purpose
is so that if you talk to someone I'm
really glad that no one had had bad
experiences but if you talk to someone
who's saying our stack overflows
horrible it's run by
control freaks who don't want to help
anyone new it's just that we understand
the design of the site is around the
purpose which is not to help you not to
help the person that's got a problem
it's to build a repository of hike
see questions and answers so if you ask
a question really badly that I happen to
know the answer to and I give you the
answer you go away happy and you leave a
stain on the site okay that does not
help the site's goal and that's why it's
certainly why I can end up looking very
passive-aggressive and contrÃ´lÃ©e
when I say please improve your question
I'm thinking I know what's wrong I knew
what's wrong
please improve your question and there
are two benefits from this one is
hopefully it helps them do work that
next time they will do before getting to
the site at all they will become better
developers by doing it and the other is
by the time you've got a good question
then okay you may have found the answer
but it's much more helpful to someone
else and that's why it's so important
and it's not that we're all control
freaks and that's a message that's quite
hard to get over to people partly
because there are some people who just
get off on saying nasty things yeah we
Stack Overflow is on the internet and
strangely enough there are trolls on the
internet who'd have thought so some
people have had bad experiences that
aren't their fault a lot of the time
it's because they don't understand the
site they've ticked through so when you
first go to ask a question you have to
go through a page that says this is what
the sites for here's how you ask you a
question look there are links on the
right - how to ask a good question which
I'll give you another link another tiny
URL link stack
- hints goes for another blog post of
mine from 2010 long time ago but this is
all still basically right or right in my
mind about how to ask a good question
and a lot of it goes into the kind of
thing that we've been talking about so
that's linked from Stack Overflow and
you've got to tick a box saying hey I've
read all this before I can ask a
question and of course a lot of people
do
scroll down scroll down tick right
here's random crap my program doesn't
work I think the words doesn't work
should be banned not quite but if you
say my code doesn't work without giving
any more detail that's like saying to
the doctor I'm ill what's wrong with me
I need a bit more information I'm afraid
doesn't work doesn't cut it
is it an exception does the code not
compile does it compile and run without
an exception but give you the wrong
result what is the wrong result what is
the right result why do you think that
is the right result all of these things
are reasonable things to expect and I
will go back to my slides to get some
sense of structure back very briefly we
haven't had time to go into a single one
of the other demos I've got a whole
solution of demos for this talk none of
which we'll get to because I've been
busy doing other demos instead this is
an important point though I've said
about how some people get bad
experiences on Stack Overflow that are
their fault even if their their fault
because they didn't read the site those
people are still people and deserve to
be treated with respect those people
should be treating everyone else with
respect as well and I get very cross
when someone writes a rant on meto
stackoverflow saying how horrible
everyone is to them and you look at
their comments and they're they haven't
treated anyone with respect this goes
way beyond Stack Overflow though so the
techniques in terms of Diagnostics and
braking problems down etc I use all the
time for bug reports so a good question
on Stack Overflow and a good bug report
looked very very similar you might
include a little bit more environmental
information on a bug report but
basically I treat them as the same so if
I'm filing a bug report typically with
Microsoft for something like that double
dot nan I make sure I've got a short but
complete example if at all possible
these days if it's a dotnet core project
I include the project file as well so
you know even if you don't want to copy
and paste just the c-sharp you could
copy and paste c-sharp and the project
file dotnet run and you're away woohoo
it will bring in all the dependencies
you don't need to do anything else it's
great wouldn't have been feasible back
in the old CS progeny but with the new
dotnet core SDK it's great um but how
many of you have filed a bug with an
open-source project cost you just not
use open source or you happen to use
open source that doesn't have any bugs
or you're too nervous to like let me
know what that open source it I fell
bugs and people file bugs on Notre time
and it's great open-source maintainer
love getting bug reports from people who
are respectful of the fact that they've
done you put their code up there to
start with and their time in
investigating things so when someone
files a bug it's great if it comes like
a stack overflow question and with some
collaborative aspect say if they say I
really like to help fix this if I can
fantastic if they say I need this done
by Tuesday because my clients is getting
cross well sorry that's not my fault and
we had a very bizarre or we have a very
bizarre situation with someone who
didn't say that they did say we have
clients who are running into this but
they're using serialization on things
that aren't marked as serializable by
calling stuff by reflection and things
like that's never gonna work just just
just don't do that please
and but yeah I do think that the world
would be the software world would be a
much much better place if we can
remember that every time we wrote an
email or files bug report or responded
to a bug report this is an actual person
who's going to feel bad or feel good
depending on what we write have some
demos if you're still stuck do ask on
Stack Overflow so um
I have mentioned that you'll often find
the answer by doing all of this stuff if
you do you may be able to think of a
good stack overflow question from that
if you had to do something non-obvious
that makes a really good stack overflow
question because someone else is going
to be in the same position and by the
time you've come up with the short but
complete example that's 3/4 of the time
that you should be spending on a stack
overflow question is doing all that
diagnostic work translating that into a
good question should be reasonably cheap
and assuming it's not a duplicate it's
likely to get uprooted and I think it's
a shame that question up votes are only
worth 5 when good questions much rarer
than good answers I'm seeing the Stack
Overflow focus in February I think I'll
have a chat with them about that maybe
say it on the podcast if I can and this
is the stuff to take away because I'm
running out of time
mostly spread the word because none of
this was particularly difficult
I didn't demonstrate the
divide-and-conquer encode as I would
have done partly because it sounds like
you're all very intelligent folks who
kind of know they know the procedure of
sometimes you just start deleting codes
sometimes you start from scratch but
show the people that you work with
particularly if you are mentoring junior
developers it's really valuable when you
get stuck on something or when you start
getting stuck you when you get that
feeling that this is going to be an
interesting bug you know that feeling
yeah and you know it might take half an
hour it will be really it will be the
most valuable half an hour of a really
junior developers day if you say come
and help me let's look at this together
and pair program on it because that's a
great way of seeing oh hang on you've
assumed that as like yeah your eyes are
just skimmed over it completely so they
may well be able to actually help you
but you will be able to help them by
giving them this experience of
diagnostic work the URLs there
don't bother remembering it because
we'll make sure that you can get copies
of the PowerPoint I would give you a
link to the PowerPoint but that's kind
of self referential thank you very much
have swag we have time for any questions
if people have questions it was a very
rambling talk which I kind of apologize
for but it's really nearly Christmas
it's oh yeah um so someone used that uh
lots of people said how how much time do
you spend on stackoverflow and my normal
not entirely glib answer is how much
time do you spend breathing it's just a
background activity it's something I go
you know open stackoverflow open CNN
open 538 open BBC News that's kind of
the tabs that I have always open and
just keep checking every so often right
right so yeah these are all just
different ways of logging so for one
thing if any of you blog a diagnostic
process tweet it at me and I will
immediately retweet and link to it from
my blog and whatever so that can have
effect but otherwise it's just what what
gets you there so I make the point in my
notes that I wasn't reading from that
you know start a word doc or a Google
Doc or whatever and write down whatever
is going to be useful to you it doesn't
need to be pretty one of the bad side
both sides of writing a blog post is
you're constantly trying to frame it
thinking oh well I I've got people who
don't have any of the context so I've
got to write a paragraph here and I sort
of get slightly out of the zone don't
care about that right right just a doc
that captures it reality is normally I
write it on on paper which won't be
readable by me the next day probably I
said I don't anything else and but
that's where I start if I'm if I'm doing
benchmarking I will write down the
results
as numbers just just there but yeah unit
tests are a great way of capturing that
and version control commits create a
branch create as many branches as you
need and put copious notes in the
commits and know that you can just
delete stuff later on it's great anyone
not using version control and trying to
do a diagnostic work is really trying to
do it with one arm tied behind their
back and and hoppin yes yeah mushrooms
are always great how can we help to
change it right so I need to I'm seeing
Hamilton on Tuesday but I've got until
then so hiring there are many hiring
practices that I'll take step back I
generally genuinely both of those don't
think that most people believe
themselves or try to be discriminatory
so I will say I'm racist because I
probably am but I'm trying not to be
it's understanding unconscious bias and
you know women can be as sexist as men
against women and it happens unconscious
bias really sucks and I know that there
are there were some tests for it that
have been discredited somewhat
discredited but I think there's also
sufficient evidence that the unconscious
bias does there still come on so look at
your company's hiring practices and see
what you can see where you can tweak
that for best practices and I can tell
you a little bit about Google's hiring
practices which is that there's no such
thing as a diversity hire in Google but
there is such a thing as I don't think
we say diversity candidate now but
candidate from a and historically
underrepresented category
and I know pigeonholing people is also
horrible but the idea is if you're
you're trying to get everyone has to
meet the bar because no one wants to
hire bad people
that's bad for everyone involved the
person hiring the team that they end up
with the person being hired etc but if
there are people who you're not sure
about if you've got a line out the door
of similar people then it's probably not
worth putting in several hours to find
out whether actually they are over the
bar yeah if there's a couple of areas
that you're not sure about if you've got
a queue of you know there's someone over
there if I if I really reach out to them
then it's worth putting in a bit more
time to see whether actually they're
good enough and you know we haven't
properly tested that that aspect so
making sure that your hiring practices
reflect that and that everyone knows
that because even if I think it still
probably still happens in Google
sometimes that we can say this is what
our hiring practices are but can you
imagine going into a team and say oh
you're the token girl we've hired makes
me so mad
so everyone needs to be aware of why and
what the practices are that's a little
bit about hiring for community events
code of conduct making sure that the
making sure that you good folks talk to
other people in your community and
encourage people and say right you may
have heard bad things about user groups
in general but Devco South East is
really good etc Devco South rather sorry
alright yeah
I don't know itself some combination of
dev self encased I don't know where the
yeast came from at all but yeah we
should I was reading a blog post today
by someone saying how they've been
sexually harassed at various conferences
it's just got to stop it really has
there has to be absolutely zero
tolerance and you can tell that there
still is tolerance this this woman's
writing saying here is a well respected
academic who is also well known to have
harass people they shouldn't be well
respected anymore that behavior does not
deserve any respect I'm sort of losing
the plot a bit partly after a couple of
hours of speaking I tend to go a bit but
yeah it's got to be a cultural thing
that we've got to all except the titties
important to get diversity that we will
end up in a better working environment
have more fun get better products you
know I use far more technical products
than I build so why would I not want the
best people building technical products
and if you immediately discount half the
world's workforce you won't get as good
products is self-explanatory so we've
got to all take that on and make sure
that everyone is supportive of that as a
goal yeah I wish I had better</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
