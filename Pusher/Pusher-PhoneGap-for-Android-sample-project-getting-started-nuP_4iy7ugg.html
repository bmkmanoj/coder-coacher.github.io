fisheye I've just created some project
demonstrates have to use for sure with
PhoneGap I manually better team you
support quests about this some people
have done it no problem we do our neck
thank you on it but it just provides
some pretty thin cells so this is now I
start the project it should make getting
becoming much easier so this is the
project github.com / push up / push it a
height and fungi
Android so you can close project you'll
see about it going to test run here okay
let's cloned so you'll also need the
Android SDK and the phone can pass the
SDK that's all mentioned it's all
mentioned live in the evening so we now
open eclipse and what we're gonna do now
is is import project that we've just
pull from github into a workspace and we
may get some errors will see any the
information on on the areas that you
kind of get the Germany are based on the
location of the Android SDK or the
PhoneGap SDK although the PhoneGap jar
the Cordova jar is actually included in
the project already so if I employ an
existing project going up Android and
put that okay let's give it a minute to
to build so it's loading day for the
Android 4.1 and every one time so that's
good target in time so if I look at
project properties and
go into Android you'll see here 4.1
selected this is great that's one of the
problems I've seen in the past when you
pull this down fresh then it might be so
like that
we'll see build fast we've got caught
over jar which is already included when
within the libs directory so if we have
a look at the source there's a WebSocket
wrapper which exposes webshops object to
the JavaScript layer via jar so because
Android internet browser the standard
webview and the minute doesn't support
WebSockets we need to make that work in
some way now we could use flash fallback
but that's not a reliable because the
device might not have Flash installed so
by adding this WebSocket wrapper it
means that you can guarantee that any
the web shoppers will be available to
the webview so there's a wrapper there's
more information in the readme so if I
just look at the basic and for that
basic application we are extended from
Jorge gap on create we're loading
index.html and we're also exposing a
WebSocket factory now that's used from
another library JavaScript library which
creates the wrapper floors so if you go
into this word static bomb yeah you'll
see this creates a WebSocket object
which means that when the pushy
JavaScript library loads there are
worlds of object object is available it
will travel back to fly a ship net will
use this bridge between JavaScript and
so I'm go right back so we can have a
look in index.html you'll see that we
include the hood over Java library in
PhoneGap library we include this
WebSocket wrapper include the pusher
JavaScript library jQuery for health and
Jess
now in up Jess we're using jQuery to
load but then we also wait to see when
the
when the device is ready when the device
is ready grab some information about the
device and put it to the to the screen
we also connect the pusher we bind to
state change events on the connection
and we display them in the UI the view
I'll show that in a minute
and we subscribe to my channel that
Channel and we bind to the subscription
succeeded event display that so in the
view you'll see here we've got two
placeholders for connection status to be
updated and subscription status so if we
so hopefully that covers the basics of
this and what we can do now is if I
click a by just clicking one actually
what's interesting now is switch over to
the debug mode and logcat you'll see
that the applications running there now
it's gonna ask is which Android emulator
we want to launch now if you choose a
2.3 then you're gonna see a crash
now the problem there is that with the
emulator and with the emulator there's a
bug that means that the JavaScript to
Java Bridge doesn't work properly and
can crash within the emulator
so your best for development using a 2.2
or a whole version of the M&amp;amp;A to run
this so little kick off the emulator now
this can take a little while to load so
if time jumps I may cut this a little
bit of this load time out and because it
does take a while we go over here what
we're doing is waiting for the emulator
to launch and then I'll install the apk
the application
one things point I hear as we wait is
that I've been immunized to be a little
bit temperamental sometimes you'll
launch them and it doesn't seem to kind
of tax to them properly so when you if
you try and rerun the application that
will create another instance of the
emulator and now that's not ideal but
eventually once you get one or if I'm
running it
Germany kind of works okay so I'm going
to pull things now and I'm going to
start again once activated okay so the
Android device is again loaded up see
you down there it says it's installing
but shell PhoneGap okay now if I click
and drag I'm seeing in the background
here it's starting the emulator and this
is this is useful so look at it's kind
of where you find out all the
information if your phone goes off
you'll know about this sort of stuff
already so there we go
there's all sorts of information here in
terms of connecting subscribing so we go
back here you'll see we do have device
information are we also are connected
and subscriptions are succeeding so what
we'll do is if I jump back into the
normal Java perspective and I first
create a label and just say
what I will do is I'm going to output
some bad information into that I'm
surprisingly so I'll go to a my event
channel just output the information see
that and I'll just share the information
to Jason so you can see what comes
through ok so if I relaunch this yep we
want to use the existing one which is
great
so this is where because the emulator
purloining already kind of template see
things speeding up a lot but let's just
check the view we're installing the new
version of the library so you'll see
here it's disappeared but this is the
new version launching
and so we're just waiting for event info
all right so now what we need to do is
if we jump into the pusher dashboard we
can go to the event creator and we know
here that we're subscribing to your
channel for my channel and we know the
event we're binding to is my event now
we'll just send some big data so what
I'll do is I'll shoot over here and then
if I click send event sent successfully
okay so if we look in here the Jason
object doesn't have a string fine no it
doesn't it has a you publish outing at
me when I was typing this it has a
string if I don't as method so again we
realize that
okay over here that the oblongs been
killed anyone's launching yeah we're
starting to be connected and we've
subscribed so we're waiting for event
invite so it might jump like the TV
don't create to again some just an event
we get hello world so that shows that
we're connecting subscribing and
receiving event information in phone
capture so as I said this project is
available in github so you hope to get
started with PhoneGap and android in ten
minutes let's say maybe I'm Jeremy
laters
okay I'm so felt like is at legged run
Switzer or you can email me fill out
pusher calm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
