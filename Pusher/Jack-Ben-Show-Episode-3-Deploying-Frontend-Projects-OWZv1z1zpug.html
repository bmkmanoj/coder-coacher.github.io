world had the best JavaScript web
application I don't care the Hanging
Gardens of Babylon hey there I sure yet
been this is jay absolutely we're going
to talk about deploying static from 10
sites and different things we like about
that so yeah yeah I think this is
something there's lots of things out
there for like back end of you know and
heroic you type things but sometimes
when there's a front-end project can be
a little more you know things like a
Roku don't work for that so there's a
few other options week and we can use so
I think my favorite thing is get out
pages right like this is just super easy
to get started and very open and come
back you can use all the requests to get
you content yeah and one things I really
like about get our bigger side with my
blog on github pages and every any kind
of so the main blog is on github pages
but any other kind of test repository
that I've got you can access as a sub
directory of my blog yes so as soon as I
put up like food as a repository if I
haven't H pages branch lap and activists
at desa that's really cool ya sure ya do
it yeah I see how that works cool so for
instance if I've got this repository
called pages bash them over on my my
blog the angle / pages / devil food i
smell I get that content and what's
really cool is as soon as I push up a
change so I can edit it in place here
and some changes to bar and then commit
those changes as soon as those changes
get pushed up they go into my github
pages yeah after a few minutes so
sometimes it takes I can maybe about
like 20 30 seconds this will update the
bar look at that look at that that's
really cool and it's just I really like
lightweight flexible way of doing it
yeah I think I didn't get how pages
along yeah I heard my blog in it too and
it's great for I've had a couple of
people contribute posts or fixes to blog
posts and the way they can just pull a
question to get hub is it's brilliant
they don't charge for getting pages and
which is amazing
even for larger sites they don't they
don't kind of ask for money or anything
yeah it's amazing my favorite we get is
a really great tool for trapping content
right like not just cold so the ice so
no expect to see how some content has
changed over time yeah yeah we use our
crab or no yes you've been using yeah
this is a new thing I've come across
called surge which I think as a tool has
been around for a little bit not too
long and all this is really easy way to
just take a folder on your computer and
just chuck it at some random URL and
that's it in a nutshell so doesn't use
get it literally takes whatever folder
you run it in and just puts it on a
random URL and that's it so to sleep
like yeah really really lightweight cool
so I mean I'm in this directory called
foo it's just got an index.html file it
just says hello world in it and if I
want I want to put this online I can
just run surge which is you just install
through mpm I just sign up for an
account bits and tiny Frida's do so I
haven't give them any card details or
anything I hit surge so it fills in my
kind of email and stuff and then it asks
me for the path for what folder on to
deploy so I just used this current
folder and I hit and it'll pick a random
domain but you can give it your own name
if you want to but now I've done that I
can just grab this URL here and copy it
and go into chrome and paste it and I've
now got that site up right now which is
just amazing and really quick effortless
it's not even get so you don't see the
get commits and stuff and and and also
if I you know if I were to just change
that file all I have to do is rerun
surge just use the same domain name that
I've already used previously and it'll
just overwrite so it's it's kind of like
dumb copy and paste if you like but it
works perfectly for kind of front end
only projects where there's no sirven as
a bunch of static stuff highly recommend
at surge SH to get started he should
yeah okay sorry yeah get started three
eggs them one of the things I guess is
cool about that like I find with github
pages when I'm transpiring from whatever
to something else you've got to commit
it into your jammies whereas research
because it's just a for you I guess you
can have your right
yeah absolutely that's what I've done
you build into a subdirectory which is
the the thing you push on to surge yeah
let's ring I see ya and you're going to
translation start right transpiring and
bundling and concatenate minifying all
of them I love it yeah yeah because as
we having the discussion earlier we
can't write plain old JavaScript anymore
apparently not right yeah but you're a
fan of kind of keeping it lean and not
transpiring yeah like so we both like
Buble right like I mean I think that's
really kind lightweight transform thing
I like knowing by telling transforming
arrow functions until I yeah any
different syntax and stuff but as soon
as it gets like beyond that I I kind of
feel like I've lost control of my cold
or something yeah or I don't know it
just makes me feel uncomfortable I think
so you've got you've got Buble which is
the lightweight compiler transpiler by
rich harris which does a very kind of
defined subset of the es2015 so Babel
can be configured to transpile
everything ever and everything ever and
it does things like generators and the
more complex he has 2015 features
whereas Buble is just a very defined
kind of the more I guess we call them
straightforward transforms like our
functions into just function expressions
and D structuring into and so on and so
forth what's really cool actually the
moment as well as we're seeing in
certain environments we don't need those
tools anymore like chrome support for
yes 2015 is pretty good edge your
support for yes turn 15 is very good as
well so we're getting to a point now
actually we're yes if you want to just
blindly use every feature without
considering the Browns that you should
use Babel able but if you just say if
you like really like our functions which
I know you are a particular advocate of
then you might be in a position soon
where you can just use them because they
use as your targeting on the browser's
they're on may well support it like
we're not quite there I don't think but
you know we are edging towards that
direction which is really cool beer and
then then you come on to bundling which
is just another thing to deal with you
got like webpack browserify roll up
pulse by rich heiress JSP em there's a
ton of options you're not
there's a new version or something yeah
there's a Jess p.m. northpointe 17 which
kind of the next big release which is
currently in beta which I'm talking on a
couple of events coming up soon but Jess
p.m. is kind of the aims to be the one
tool you need to do all your bundling
and minification and package management
on client-side applications so it will
install things for it for you and then
kind of hookup babble so the translation
just works for you and then it will
bundle those all together for you it can
do basically everything it aims to be in
this world of people getting dragged
down by like 20 different tools they
need to build their website Jesse Owens
aims to be that one that slots in I
think it's really cool i'm sure i'll be
blogging about it soon it's it's still
in beta the new version so there are a
couple of rough edges but the non beta
version has been around for a good few
years now I've used it all previous
projects and it's it's really nothing to
look into if you don't want to have to
like compose lots of tools together and
just want one thing to build your client
setup with I think Jess p.m. is a really
good choice cool what's your what's your
go-to I would like that and I think I've
always going to go on with the way that
you cannot define those transforms or
files like I feel like it kind of makes
quite a lot of sense so I tend to use
that a lot of products but then again as
we're talking about a while ago it's
just like I I really dislike the amount
of stuff I have to install just to kind
of convert a sass file into a CSS yeah
we know it's like when you've got all
these different plugins and former full
of dependencies yeah no huge fan but
yeah I think that's where people get
stuck with web pack as well because web
pack is it's very very powerful and it's
great but it does everything and web
pack will do javascript will do CSS or
do images will do absolutely everything
employees so it's very easy to kind of
put yourself into a corner with web pack
where you've no idea what's going on but
if you build from scratch and web pack
is a really good tool especially with
the like live reloading and watching and
small builds kind of rebuilds built-in
cool and one of things I've been going
into zai using package scripts like so
impacts Jason to find script things and
just saying just using
really basic commands to kind of getting
stuff across and think of that so that's
been something I think that might be a
nice alternative possibly i'm still not
over there yeah i think i'm a fan of
that too but then you get back to the
problem of having like seven different
things installed just to have this
combination of scripts that will build
your entire project like yeah we're not
quite there yet like you go if the
things if you pick one tool that does it
all that's great until you need to maybe
configure it slightly differently but if
you pick lots of little ones you have
full control but then you have more
chances and breaking and they're a bit
more brittle and then you have to do a
bit more work so it's it's whichever one
you're more comfortable if I think and
what level of control you need you
usually have an HTML file in development
that might load in a few different
script tags and a few different CSS
things because in development you don't
care about the extra requests and stuff
you just want to kind of build your
application then in production you're
probably gonna take those like four
script tags and merge them into one and
you probably going to take your for CSS
files again show them into one or
whatever you might do and then so what
you need is you then need another HTML
file that you'll actually push to
production that has the script tag just
to your bundle JavaScript and similar
for your CSS or maybe your inlining some
successors will will come on to and you
can just manually create this this new
HTML file but then the problem is if you
add say a new give to your development
HTML file you have to remember to
replicate that in your production HTML
file because the two need to be in sync
other than the the scripts and the CSS
is that being bundled during deployment
so I built a talk with HTML disc which
can manipulate HTML files basically so
will include a link and love any
feedback on it but effectively takes one
HTML file you write a kind of config
file that that can transform it into
another so it's a way of automating the
HTML sign of your deployments as well as
your JavaScript and CSS it sounds great
like oh yeah well I've checked out right
ladies gonna think it's quite
interesting a promise to yeah thanks
yeah so I guess when they're having some
you may difference is a in line in CSS
or whether it's less like I'm one of the
kind of classic ways or using your own
process to
your front end whirlpool is usually per
semester request rate smell and then
they can start looking through that and
they'll find the style with three and
they have to make another request to go
to do that yeah but one way of reducing
that extra round trip which can cause a
lot of lag is to kind of inline that CSS
from that file yeah so that's something
that's kind of cool with Bill processor
I guess that changes HP to potentially
actually I think people addy Osmani
refers as the critical path CSS same
kind of idea yeah but rather than the
whole style sheet that critical path
approach is taking busy rendering your
page seeing what's important and taking
those styles and enlighten them it's a
lattice I think yes yeah so Anna meeting
room on the CSS which okay pipe in some
HTML and then it will kind of find out
which selectors are used Oh pulsing pull
out from your CSS file which is nice
that's really cool yeah alright so the
round off we're going to do our any
other business part of the show and so
do you wanna start John do us yeah yeah
so I've got a couple of bits of it any
other business yeah and first of all
school and ventricle where we're both
involving usefully were and REM having
fury and the videos are now online so
those are some awesome talks there so
you should definitely check those out
yeah it was a great couple of days yeah
it was a great couple days and like that
properly special yeah yeah and yeah the
other thing that I be working on at the
moment is so I earn this helper in a
series of events of an awkward cold
summer pass and these are like half
these we run in the community and
they're brilliant either really great
day since we just put summer hacks a new
person slight cold new version with new
events for this year and that's really
great nice sort of hats Ohio quit and
tickets a bizarre up tickets are going
fast I have a tiny bit of any other
business and I want to give a plug to
addy Osmani talk at Google i/o which was
in the last week which was on
progressive web apps but across all
framework so we seen a lot from google
on this progressive web apps idea but
very specifically normally building like
a small apple using like polymer which
is a you know google product but in this
talk addy takes an existing web app
though in react then one in ember and
then want an angular 2 and turns them
each into a progressive web app so it's
really great to see like i think people
kind of hit progressive web apps with
the stick of well this only works for
new applications that built-in it's very
specific way but addy very well you know
does a great job of demonstrating that
that's not the case at all so yeah
that's that's what we've got to say on
that so yeah you got any comments or if
you like have anything to add yeah or
let's put any more links in the show
notes and yeah drop us a message and
yeah and yeah just we'll see you next
time oh yes you know yeah on this show
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
