don't know left Padawan
so we're across the canal from the
pressure officers and the cafe I'm here
and Ben and this is jay hey hey so how's
it good yeah I'm good how are you yeah
super gay yes super gay fantastic so I
think this week we've been thinking
about the the left pad debacle or left
pad gate as i like to call it so if
they're unaware this is the the module
left hand on NPM 11 lines of JavaScript
that was dependent on by a bra and react
and loads of other stuff whose author
unpublished it from mpm and then
basically half the internet broke as far
as we can tell and for a good few hours
nothing worked no mpm installs the
depend on Babel which is nearly every
java project out there and none of them
work they were broke to the point where
mpm eventually unpublished the module
running back online and fixing
development as we know it which I think
really is just got to thinking about NPM
and dependencies generally in JavaScript
language so yeah he's a really
interesting thing right like so I guess
over the last few years we've our
front-end dependencies have become
dependent on NPM to such a great degree
wait yeah and like i canna figure you're
you're the kind of guy who likes lots of
little mini dependencies it plays right
now how did you guess yeah yeah I'd you
ever feel nervous about that yeah it's
it's interesting because basically the
hope the whole approach of loads of
dependencies works really well until it
breaks and then everyone starts thinking
about if it does actually work well or
not and I myself a guilty of finding a
package online that does what I need
however small that piece of function
might be and just kind of chucking it
into my my own app really the issue then
becomes who do you trust to so all these
these modules and who can you depend on
if you pardon the dreadful pun I wasn't
on purpose cuz actually you know and I
think the question here it should share
projects that a large like babble like
react like all the other ones that broke
be depending willy-nilly on modules
about vetting them to some degree this
module the left pad module was
11 lines of JavaScript hasn't like 10
stars on github I wouldn't describe as a
prolific module but then you know you
say people saying what they should have
been posted up themselves which is fine
but then where do you draw the line on
implanting stuff yourself you know I
mean so like is there any way you can
check over every pet beds in you have I
mean I get this thing like as soon as
i'm starting a site and i'm like i
wanted to take my sass making CSS Oh
written golf puppet and the egg suddenly
I've got like a hundred different
different sub debate exactly and is this
is a left-hand module on its own
something that we should be encouraging
that kind of size of a package it's a
bit of functions that would be pretty
straightforward for you to infant
yourself developer would be able to I'd
imagine so it's interesting and you know
I think we're at stage where front and
development we're not really used it's
getting more complicated all the time
like a few years ago we didn't have em
p.m. really we didn't have client side
JavaScript applications our jobs to it
was as much as a little jquery carousel
or accordion i pine for the good old
days but we have all these dependencies
front-end development is way more
complicated now by necessity you know is
the real issue here nothing to
dependencies at all but more the fact
that npm lets you unpublish packages so
for I the author have published
something like left pad and then
whatever reason I decide to take it down
should I be allowed to do that just at
any point this doesn't that break the
entire the whole point of NPM is that we
can freely dependent now concerned and
worried ranking so on one hand is a
massive problem because that's gonna
have that effect that you have like
yesterday or wherever yeah but in a
lower point so you're actually using
that dependency and yet you're trusting
someone else to serve it to your
something yeah you've not paid any money
Ted ya know so I like I think this part
of it is like a responsibility to
yourself how you can have go about
develop and have that like sort of stuff
like having a kind like
like storing your fences locally or like
kind of commitment and honestly you have
access them as independently I think
there's a commitment solution I don't
get I don't get Falls entirely on
anything yet no some companies got
around it by having their own private
NPM so as developers in the free world
are we we relying too much on NPM like
do we take far too much for granted
should we be more grateful for our NPM
overlords right I actually cannot be i
dunk the way that Bauer works right jit
you don't make powered if you've dug the
way the bow yeah okay yeah okay well
okay convince me you could use Barrett's
gonna keep things in check but
ultimately you be changing stuff in your
own cultures yea rather than theirs inna
kind of switch with that and of two more
than a traditional dependency system
where you don't have that controlling
yeah we don't check no modules in where
exactly did check Falcon before that
Bauer it's not it's more the bower is
fitted around that way work okay yes
we've kind of transitioned away from
yeah somewhere so the file system isn't
the source of truth exactly not exactly
I I'd kind of like it if it was yeah
yeah yeah and that's her okay yeah place
cancel yeah yes so that the point here
is if if we did check node modules in
then this wouldn't be such a big deal it
would've been annoying because a fresh
mpm still wouldn't have worked but you
would have still had everything locally
you know the biggest one was deploys and
see I servers and stuff we're breaking
because most of malaya NPM install first
I think it's also important to note I'll
there was that this was a big problem it
didn't take any websites down yeah like
you know so I think I'm less concerned
about depending on things like this I
don't know a massive deal I think if
you'd say okay left pad as a function is
it's too small to depend on variety
ourselves you have to draw a line at
some point and this problem it happened
to be in this case the module was left
pad which was 11 lines long but it could
have been a module that was 200 lines
long or 500 lines or
load more that you would never think ok
Jung has been a day right as myself I
think you know we're still learning how
best to do this stuff on the client side
npm will improve as a result of this i
expect that they'll get stricter on how
and when you can unpublish think that
they ultimately course this issue I
think once your modules out in the wild
after particular time period and is
dependent on arguably shouldn't be able
to get rid think I'm rubbishing is there
a few published showing the security
floor a massive problem and you can
quickly get rid of it again but a long
term I don't think it's a solution and I
think that breaks the whole ecosystem
enough people to do that and longer term
with tools like roller web pack 2 and
its tree shaking and dead code
elimination all that this one this won't
be as bigger problem so that's what
better than I think we love to hear your
