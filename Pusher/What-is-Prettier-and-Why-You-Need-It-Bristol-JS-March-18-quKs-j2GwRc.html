something you may have used it it's only
been around for about a year so it's
quite new I'll go in a bit more about
what it does in a minute so I've just
started a relatively new role at a
company called immersive labs we deliver
cyber security training via an online
application we are hiring so if anyone
is if anyone's a JavaScript developer or
even a ruby developer and/or a ruby
developer then please do you come and
pester me afterwards or give us a
message at some point in the future this
is where we start the fight I have to
polish it there may be an excess of cat
gifts in this presentation as well I got
a bit carried away with deciding how to
how to do it so yeah we're gonna have a
bit of a battle first
so tabs versus spaces and single quotes
versus double quotes in one line versus
multi line let's have a little show of
hands who would format this a and who
would format this piece so let's have
the A's first let's have B okay maybe
one of you would go B that's so cool
this you all correct this is everyone
wins
there isn't a C option as yet no
semicolon yeah okay interesting okay how
about oh sorry oh how about this one we
got so all on one line at the top and
you know all your options on multi lines
at the bottom let's go
okay that's true that's a little typo
there
eagle-eyed I like it let's pretend there
is four although actually it's a valid
entry an interesting point as well there
are more at the bottom so would we
format it differently if there's more or
less so but for the sake of argument
let's go with option a and option B okay
interesting so I mean again we've got
some of the differences there as you
know there's a trading comma at the
bottom on the last option there's not a
trading comma at the top they do all
have semicolons we've heard about not
semicolons already so you know again
we're having all these discussions and
and we're yourself down
so you know we've been fitting a single
multi-line we didn't really talk about
parentheses so would we have a space we
know within the parentheses within the
OREA we know within the curly brackets
as well before the curly brackets after
the curly brackets there's quite a lot
of options so we could talk about terms
tabs versus spaces me and Adam briefly
had a little discussion about before we
started this and then you know if you go
spaces do you do two spaces do you do
four spaces single quotes or double
quotes there's quite a lot of decisions
to be made as we're going along and of
course the magic option C which we're
all thinking about really is who cares
right this stuffed actually just isn't
important but that's interesting you
know it doesn't actually matter right
this is a very exasperated cat he's been
dealing with a lot of the workers all
day and he's you fella for all the
arguments about tabs versus spaces so
what if we're not going to care about
how our code looks what should we be
caring about and really it's how it
works it's the impact to the end-user
it's time efficiency every time we stop
to think she'll I put a new line here
should have her they be putting a space
in the parenthesis should I be using
single quotes or double quotes
should I be tabbing or spacing setting
up my AR editor to do what the rest of
the team are doing it's all just wasted
time we're slowing ourselves down
writing code that at the end of the day
is to clearly declared turned into ones
and zeros for you know machine code and
you know that comes down to really what
I kind of referred to as keeping our
flow well you know what to be focusing
on just writing code that works well and
souls problems fixes our tests you know
our test suite we shouldn't be worried
about how code looks I mean that's
ridiculous right if we spend all day
looking you know think about how our
code looks we're not gonna get anywhere
we're not going to end up you know
writing code that works how it looks
doesn't have any effect on our
functionality and as we've seen we yeah
we can end up talking about this all
night we could you know we could be
talking about we should be using single
quotes and double quotes and if you've
got a team maybe even the size and
number of people in here who've got a
big team that's a lot of discussions to
be had with a lot of people and you know
we could end up wasting wasting days so
ah missing a cat gif
sorry I can see it at mine there's a
nice little one of ugh man hurting lots
of cats into spaces they're herding cats
it's my favorite one and it hasn't
worked but there we go
so within a team code consistency is
important and within a big project you
know if we're opening lots of different
files anytime we come to that code it
should look the same and that's why how
code looks is important that's where it
really is important if you've got 20
developers working on the same code base
when you open it up you want it to look
the same for one developer is another
developer and you want everyone to be
used to how that code looks so what is
prettier I haven't really talked about
this thing prettier which is what my
talks about like I say fruit has been
around for about a year now just over
their number one goal is to stop this
discussion about code formatting and how
we should format code you know single
quotes double quotes all that sort of
thing it ensures all of your code
conforms to a standard you know style
guide so that it always looks the same
and I mean not only really talked about
it in in terms of JavaScript it does
actually work on all sorts of languages
so JavaScript flow typescript CSS less s
CSS graph QL markdown and like I say
it's early days for this programming
language so I think you're just need to
continue to get more and more support
it's an opinionated code formatter and
that word is really important
opinionated it essentially a pines what
your code is gonna look like it takes
all of the decision-making away from you
your team anyone else involved it's up
to prettier how your code looks so so
you know why would we use prettier well
it's fully automatic so I'll come on to
something like here Flint in a minute
but I don't know if you use that but it
has got a fixed method but it's not
always automatic and I'd say they spend
time going back through formatting code
to get it to accept my arguments it's
supported in lots of text editors as
well you can you can install plug-ins
for atom
phim vs code visual studio it's great
for onboarding as well just think if we
stop worrying you know when you've got a
new developer on board or or a junior
developer on board who's only been you
know learning to code for a few months
as soon as you take that stress out you
know just this team do single quotes
double quotes should I be putting
everything on one line two lines should
I be putting you know extra spaces in
here should I be doing
you know spaces within parentheses or
not as soon as you can say we don't care
to do what you want you've taken that
level of stress away I made onboarding
much easier for any developers you get
into a team that's much easier for
anyone that's new to developing that's
much easier it's really easy to
integrate to your to your workflow and
none of this changing a formatting has
any effect on your functionality so
anything for a few does to your code
it's not going to break it you're not
suddenly gonna have you know bugs
creeping into your code because it's put
something on a design that shouldn't
done it's you know intelligent enough
not to introduce any weird characters or
odd markup that you shouldn't expect we
haven't really shown how it works and
this is just sort of a quick gift I
found of someone using it so you can
essentially see he's doing some
refactoring here he's moving a function
to his own you know out of the render
function he's writing some really pretty
awful code there's no consent formatting
and then prettier turns it into you know
one line there he's putting it back in
and it's saying that's you know doesn't
it right so it's putting it like that
and another one this isn't the biggest
gift so Paula G's for my beard to look
but again you can essentially see this
just automatically rearranging I load a
bad code to a much more readable much
more consistent form of code so how do
we use it well
like I say you can put it into your text
editor you can install a plugin for a to
more vs code and you can write the code
her v1 you
single quotes double quotes but spaces
where you want them new lines where you
want them and when you press save it
will go through an and format it that's
not actually my favorite way of using it
but it is a quick way to see how it
works and kind of get a feel for it I
find that if I every time I press save
my code formatting changes it gets a
little bit distracting and I can lose
where I am you can do it for a get hook
and you can set this up with I use
something called husky which is an NPM
module that the managers all you get
hooks so you can you well I mean by get
hookers you can say pre commit or pre
push say before I do a commit or after I
do a commit do a thing and that thing in
this case would be prettier so you can
just write your code however you want
get it working really ignore how your
code looks don't worry about your new
lines whether you've got tabs you know
your indentation all that sort of thing
commit your code and then when it
commits it'll pretty all go through and
automatically just rewrite your code for
you without you having to look at it and
then just next time you come back to
your files they won't look how they were
when you left them they'll be formatted
and just hearing that you might think
that's really annoying and it kind of
can be it can be a bit weird coming to a
file and not recognizing where you left
it off be quite quickly get over that
you can quickly get used to the way that
pretty is going to format things and
what's really important is that
regardless of whether it's how you look
how you remember it when you last left
it its how the other people in your team
are gonna see it so they've never seen
the code you've written before but when
they come back to a bit of code that's
been formatted by prettier it's going to
look exactly like they would expect it
to look there's gonna be spaces where
they're used to seeing spaces there can
be new lines where they're seeing gliese
you're seeing in your lines and it's
gonna be indented how they're used to
saying it being indented and that's
what's really important just kind of
talk about get hooks just for a little
bit more like ice I use something called
husky and you can do things pre push as
well I run some tests if I just sort of
pre push that no one can push stuff to
the repo they shouldn't
and it it just runs there's another
package called lint staged
and what that does is it will only run
those commands on files that changed
since your previous commit so I sorry
files you have staged for commits
essentially so if things haven't changed
it's not going to run your test suite or
prettier on all of the files in your
project it's going to run them on the
files that have changed that you've
staged for the next commit which is
usually the files that you've changed
but you can also be selective about that
as well an es Linh so most people have
probably used es live before and iya
Slim is really handy I've used it for a
few years I suppose and it it handles
functionality very well so if you've
forgotten too if you've got unused
variables if you've left console logs in
your code you can actually set it up to
format if you've left to do's in your
code any sort of functionality es lint
is really good at finding those issues
and telling you hey there's a variable
that you left in your code that's unused
and you get rid of that before you
before you commit it you can set up to
do functionality and over the years you
know yes limp has grown to a point where
it's set up to do formatting so you can
tell Ethel in there I always want spaces
before parentheses and that sort of
thing or you I want tabs or or spaces or
whatever but what you are doing there is
you are pushing your opinion into how
the code should be formatted and if
you're just writing on your own that's
okay Priti does it better but if you're
working within a team all of a sudden
you're being you're dictating how that
code should look and also I've certainly
in a situation where they've been very
stringent rules within
and we're not committed my work it's
been you know taking sort of 10 minutes
going back through it making sure I put
all the spaces and new liens where it's
asking me to before it will allow me to
commit and that's just Co slows the
whole process down so you can set up
prettier with es limit very easily and
you just leave the you know separate the
responsibilities essentially yes lien
will look after the functionality of the
code and pretty will look after the
formatting of your code and they play
really nicely together configuration so
you can dictate to prettier how it
formats your code you can tell it that I
prefer single quotes or double quotes
you can tell it to use spaces in
parenthesis but the ethos of prettier is
essentially you don't do any opinions
you don't put do any configuration
there's only a few options in there it's
not exhaustive like like es linters I
think probably some of them they're just
what about pressure essentially I would
argue you shouldn't the one I would
change if I was going to something like
line length so it will automatically
when you get character a TA will try and
put things on to a new line so that it's
most readable currently I've left that
how it wants it to leave it but
sometimes I feel on a big widescreen
monitor like it's a bit a bit tight so
you can before we shouldn't live any
been using the forty months a little bit
I might play with some configuration I
might not I probably won't and suggest
you don't everyone hates it equally I
think that's pretty quite a good way to
look at prettiest so it reformats all
your code and that can be annoying but
if everyone's off the set on the same
page if everyone's working from the same
hymn sheet then then it's not such a
problem and when I further yeah the
first couple of days I used it I was
like I'm not sure about this and
developers I introduced it to you're a
bit like you know maybe but actually you
get used to it very quickly
and the best thing is you know you
stopped hanging onto your but your
preferences
things and it really does free you up to
stop thinking about how you're
formatting your code is you're going on
writing which just frees up your mind to
worry about the bigger problem which is
how your code is functioning and if
you're the boss you know pretty did it
it's not your fault you didn't tell
anyone how you know the code should be
line you set out it pretty does its own
thing and you know it's not your fault
you can work your hands clean of it and
that's that that's it that's me lapping
up the applause so
