stories of how debugging went wrong
between API is and the browser and what
can we do to make it be a little bit
better or faster to debug so the first
story is about a bug that took me 3 days
to solve I'm going to use this app to
illustrate this isn't the real app of
course but this is an app with animal
photos you can only upload any more
photos so imagine that you would receive
a pop-up whenever a new photo was
uploaded and the pop-up is coming see
this was work
pop pop up comes up what okay why is it
closing have no idea so it seemed like a
really simple thing to fix you just
needed to find out where the pop-up
closed it wasn't that simple so first
thing was trying to find out what was
opening the pop-up and the public was
being opened properly all the parameters
were being set correctly it was opening
okay there's no problem that's all
so what's closing it's there's no close
to the close function at all it's not
there's nothing closing it's the only
way to close this pop-up is to press a
button or press outside the pop-up
there's nothing programmatic in the code
that will close the pop-up so these I
just ran through the entire code for for
one two days trying to understand what
was happening because it was quite a
complex application this was probably
something of it stupid to do because
after some time I just thought okay I'm
going to debug the routing library
because what happens whenever the pop-up
opens it would create a new URL so it
was basically going to a new page so you
could come back to the pop-up whenever
you wanted and yeah there was a race
condition and I go straight what was
happening but I don't think this is very
easy to understand because even I don't
know exactly what
what's happening so it starts here
somewhere in the codes completely
unrelated to the pop-up there was a
promise somewhere something was waiting
to happen and then it would go to a page
and the variable that was set here was
for some reason and defined this this
was a bug in the actual application it
was a completely different bug and then
in the meanwhile the pop-up would open
and it was called the same function go
to that page and it would go to the page
and the page name was said so it would
continue what I wanted to talk on the
pop-up but then in the meanwhile this
promise resolved it tries to go to a
page called undefined and
it enters the routing library and there
is a function in there that's checking
if the page exists and you can see here
that we are trying to go to a page
that's undefined so the page doesn't
exist it returns the code was a bit a
little bit more complex than this but
what happened is when when it returns
there was some side effect that would
return to the previous page so what
happens is when this condition was
called we were on a page called list for
example and in the meanwhile the pop-up
would open then it would open the page
and then these resolved and then it
would come back to the previous page
which which was least because when this
was when this was when this function was
instanced the previous page was list so
the pop-up would close yeah so the
reason why I could I had so much trouble
debugging was just because this wasn't
throwing an error at all it's just
returning there's no warnings there's
nothing so how can you possibly know
what is happening so I guess that's a
lesson to take from this just yeah throw
errors whether it's a warning or
anything
even if you want your function to
continue executing or if you just want
it to exit in a really soft way you
don't want the application to break at
least through warning at least in
development so it makes it easier to
find out what's happening but we all we
all do this I mean I do this every time
but shouldn't and the second one was
really bad and intended consequences so
I don't know if any of you are familiar
with swagger it's an API documentation
tool it shows you a list of available
available endpoints for an API and what
methods you can query and it also shows
you a list of parameters and you can
make calls to the API from there so I
wanted to call this API and it had this
design point had this parameter called
sort by and I wasn't I wasn't sure if I
could sort by multiple parameters right
because nothing nothing anywhere said
that I could do this but I wanted to try
why not let's see can I put the coma and
try starting by two parameters just
tinkering why not I try I submit the
request
it gives me an internal server error
okay fine maybe the API is just not
working but suddenly after a while I I
start looking around me and all the API
developers are running around and what's
happening what's happening the server is
down
yes yes so this still happened a couple
of times because I tried again because I
didn't realize what was happening so
yeah basically an exception wasn't being
handled and this had microservices
everywhere and this particular service
had lots of other micro services
connecting to it and they didn't work
because they couldn't connect to this
API because it was down it's a nice
story so I guess the lesson to take from
this one is catch your errors even if
it's just in a generic way just catch
them somewhere is just trying to have
like a generic place that catches all of
them so this kind of thing doesn't
happen I guess I'm going to talk a
little bit about fronting now just to do
something to show you something similar
in the front-end so for example these up
here
so I've got this list here and this is
the final this baby elephant photo was
carefully crafted so the idea doesn't
exist I'm going to try if I click here
for example I can see if the photo in
the list but if I click here it's going
to a fake photo
so doesn't exist the app blows over
there's nothing here so these are peas
using reacts for example but you can do
it with any with any other system with
any other framework react has distinct
all there are boundaries and you can
just surround your codes so this is my
code for my application you can just
surround it with a component called
error boundary and then it catches all
the herbs there isn't very good but
still it's showing you something so I
guess this is some this is something
that you can also take and the using API
is as well just show around the mirror
in this case you don't know what's going
to happen you don't know what kind of
problem you're gonna encounter so you
can just show something ok so the next
one so we built this form right and the
formants took away and it was being
submitted to an api as well and when
when the when our QA when our QA started
testing it everything was alright but
after a while they come to me ok the
form submission doesn't work on mobile
phase from submission doesn't work on
mobile what does it say it's through the
validation error but the validation
error was coming from the server ok
right so why is this happening so I just
look at it on my phone it works
perfectly I try on iPhone I try on
Android everything is working then I
pick my colleagues phone I type in my
details it works I give him the phone I
think it types
his details it doesn't work I look at
these little these things to be valid
doesn't make sense it has everything
that it just should pass validation it
passes our front end validation it
should pass the back end validation okay
then I go and try remote debugging it in
Safari but Safari doesn't want to work
it's always like that
all I wanted to see it was the response
from the API so I just went to the
inspector I looked here the response was
supposed to show here it's always it was
showing if I did bug the outside of the
phone if I did bugs on on my browser on
my normal browser it's just but here it
just wasn't working so what do we do
check the logs we didn't we weren't
throwing we weren't showing the
responses in the logs we were just
showing the requests and this happens
either in our we had a rough QL server
and we had an API and neither of them
was logging responses so we could
actually not see what the validation
error was I just wanted to see what the
validation error was so yeah I guess
I'll come back so the only solution to
these would be just to deploy both UPS
logging the errors and wait until the
apps were deployed and then we could
test again which is really troublesome
if we had a lot of the responses just
before it would have been way faster
because it was like this took like 2 2
hours to solve or something because back
and forwards oh my you try I try my
phone I try his phone so what was it
basically when you're filling in a form
and you and you blur out in a phone it
capitalizes the first letter in the
field and the backend the back-end API
didn't want the back-end API didn't
accept capitalized emails
and the front end is horrible so
javascript brings a lot of logging
options you can you can you can have
several types of vlogs and you can
filter them if you have if you're low if
you're saving your lock somewhere where
you can browse through them you can you
can filter them out so it's not it's not
a problem if you log if you walk too
much I guess unless you're running out
of money or something and there are
several logging services that you can
use these are some examples there's
others I think people have mentioned
others as well and you can do the same
thing that I mentioned before you can
catch whole you can cut to just random
errors that you get that you're not
ready to that you didn't handle and you
can lock them here yeah so we're going
to do a bit of life coding I'm gonna try
out how much time okay
okay so we're back to the up so this up
has a particularity you can upload you
can only upload photos of animals this
goes this connects to an IP I by
Microsoft and it processes your photo
and check if your photo is actual it has
actually an animal on it and yeah let's
look at some error scenarios that can
happen if you didn't handle your errors
so let's try one so this one will work
so let's see what happens if it works I
hope it works I actually didn't test it
off yeah it works
here's your photo it's a cut with a
pillow next photo this is a photo of the
London Underground's there's no animals
in here at all so it should fail it's
expected ok and you see here no animals
in here it's fine because we know that
there's no animals in this photo so we
actually don't really need more
information even from a user's
perspective but what if we try this one
so I don't know if it's big enough you
can see there's some monkeys in here
bathing in a spa so let's try uploading
and now we're going to get the same
error and now it's not really helpful
because you know that there's animals in
there and you want to know why there are
no animals in there why does it not find
animals in this photo so let's go back
to our code I'm using the graph QL
server here but you can use any type of
it can be with any server a REST API
whatever so you can see this is the
check it's just checking if the
categories and the tags that came back
from
computer vision like API if they have
the word animal condom in this case they
don't so we can make these are a little
bit better we can show the categories
and the tags that's were returned from
the server so let's just do it and it
should have saved no sorry okay this
Internet is faster than at my house so
you can see now the API didn't find any
animals in this photo you have the list
of tags and you have the list of
categories there's no animal in here at
all there is bear then there's men and
people ok just think there's people
bathing or something yeah but you've
seen that there it's not it's not it's
still not very it's not ready for the UI
because you don't want your users to see
these and you want to display you want
to display your error output in a
friendlier way you maybe you want to
display the tags in a different place
and you want to display a different
error message so yeah so let's do this
we can create a custom error that allows
you to have data on it and then we can
make it come back to the to the front
end and then it's and then we can
actually have a nicely formatted error
message for this particular situation
you can just join the tags but if you
wanted to join the tags with a plus or
whatever you could
okay this is not okay I'm not going to
show this in the app because this is
showing the right beat at the wrong beat
but we'll come back here doesn't matter
okay so now the next time there's just
another one
okay so we saw that type of error but we
only through we only through one error
and it's always it's always the same
error regardless of whatever happens but
so other things can happen it's not only
not finding animals the API the call to
micro to the Microsoft API can fail and
we didn't handle that so what happens if
we forgot to handle that so I'm going to
this one is clearly an animal you can
see that it would find on any move in
here so yeah just as this is from is the
worst type of error cannot read property
fantasyland map of undefined where does
this come from
yeah so some of you if you have used Ram
do you know that this comes from Randall
which is a functional programming
utility but it just doesn't tell you I
mean it's not helpful at all so where
does this come from if we look at the
logs there's some there's something here
speaking about you about ramza I'm not
going to go in depth with it and then it
says that it comes from this resolvers
file which was the one that we were
looking at before which is the file that
calls the API so it basically comes from
this function so at this point you have
two different types of errors that are
more or less related to the same thing
so we can just throw an error code I'm
throwing an error code for animal not
phones and when we call the computer
vision API I can throw another error
codes for that says there was an analogy
sir
just says that it couldn't actually call
the API for some reason and it sends
back the message from the API so when we
see it in the UI we will know exactly
what happened and now we can have I
think my checkout failed again
okay so now we can have a different
component for each type of error so this
is one that you have already seen but we
can also show something else for the
other error and we can show a default
default message if it's any other type
of error so let's do it
let's upload the thing again yeah we
couldn't analyze your photo if this is
big enough
we couldn't analyze your photo and the
image is too large we wouldn't be able
to know this before and that API also
throws its own error so you can use them
and throw your own yeah so I think this
is it so I think the moral of the story
is here is just fail fail just right at
the beginning but at least you feel
nicely throw throw a nice error message
so your user whether it's the user of
your library whether it's the user of
your API or the user of Europe just let
them know so it's like yeah the worst
thing about this is that when you have
errors that are not understandable
everyone will get stressed around you
it's not just you it's your colleagues
it's like it's not just developers its
products on rescue ways and sometimes
it's it scales up and people that just
just go crazy and sometimes it's just a
simple error just someone didn't type
the right message but this is really
difficult
yeah no questions because that's rough
sewers yeah so yeah if someone thank you
I think I might thank you to everyone
and thank you to my colleagues who also
list through these errors with me
there's a few of them in here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
