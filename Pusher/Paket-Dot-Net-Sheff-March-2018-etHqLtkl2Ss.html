several of the problems that github
gives it that new get gives us it plays
nicely with new get org and it's also
capable of managing other resources
other than NuGet packages so it's a
gives you more flexibility and where's
it come from it's come from the F shop
community there are several people in
the F sharp community very frustrated
with several of the shortcomings of
nougat nougat said hey we're an open
source project so they tried some
business and patches to it and new get
guys basically said no no that's not the
direction we want to go in so they
decided to write their own package
manager instead and packet is the result
who uses it
it's the package manager of choice in
the F sharp community pretty much every
open source F sharp project that I've
come across uses it
most of the frameworks install it by
default I think it needs so it's very
popular in the F Shot world but I think
it needs a bit more exposure to to the
wider dotnet community that there are as
I'm about to tell you there are certain
gives you several advantages over nougat
and you should seriously consider it so
why what's better what is better about
packet than you get well first off it
actively prevents you from having
multiple different versions of the same
assembly in your solution it keeps all
the dependencies for the solution in one
place and make sure that you can only
ever use one version at a time so it
will prevent you for example from the
JSON net hell where
you have three different dependencies on
different versions of Jason net secondly
it guarantees stable versions of all
dependencies so it tracks which current
version of all your dependencies you
have installed it makes sure if you read
download all your dependencies that it
gets exactly the set of dependencies
that you've told it that you want you
get has a habit of trying to guess and
then changing its mind so it tracks all
the dependencies including transitive
dependencies and all the versions there
it stores those in us in a a packet lock
file and that only changes when you
decide to update your your dependencies
so that means that wherever you build
your project you always guaranteed to
have the same exact dependencies every
time if you're using something like cake
or fake for anybody who came along last
week and saw not last week last month
and saw Gary you and parks presentation
about cake pack it works very nicely
with cake because you can tell it that
these are exactly the dependencies I
want for my solution when I build it and
cake willing and the annual builds file
will make sure that they get built it
gives you reliable palster dependencies
it doesn't store the version number in
the dependency path which is what NuGet
does again this is a godsend if you're
using build scripts because it means
that you can update for example
third-party tools that you're using as
part of your build script and not have
to update all the paths in your build
file so it doesn't store the version
number in the path it stores it in the
lock file
it hides all the transitive dependencies
for you you say I want this version of
some particular assembly it will tell
you it will work out whether that
assembly has dependencies on other
things it will work out which version
what the best version to have is it will
track that version and an update it when
it needs to if you need to find out why
you've got a particular dependency it
will tell you but you don't have to
worry about it unless you want to and it
lets you take dependencies on things
beyond NuGet packages you can take your
dependency on a whole git repository or
whole github repository or individual
files within those and you can lock them
down to the individual commits within
that particular repository
and the same with gist's so if you've
got a particular flow this is
particularly useful in F sharp because
often you'll have a whole what for
example a whole module in a single file
for f-sharp all you want to do is
include that one particular file you can
get the jib gist of it or the or a
pointer to it in a particular repository
and and you can guarantee that you'll
always get the same version of it you
can also take a nun version dependency
on any URL you like so you can just say
here download me this dll when I get all
my deposit all my dependencies so what
tooling can I use with it well there's a
plugin for Visual Studio there's part of
the F sharp
iein IDE plugins for Visual Studio code
there's a there's a there's a plugin for
that there's integration with msbuild
and the.net command line donate call
command line tools there's also support
for Atem Emacs xamarin studio and Rider
so pretty much if you're doing dotnet
development and you're using any of
those tools and if you're not using any
of those tools I wonder what you are
using then there's support for it so can
I rely on it yes it's in very active
development
there are usually two to three patches a
week at the moment so people are making
minor tweaks to it all the time the for
those people who got bitten by the
github TLS update the other day they had
a patch out for that within about four
or five hours I think it's self
bootstrapping so it always tries to
update itself the latest version and you
can always get it from chocolaty so you
convinced where can you get it it's at
theirs if you go to the github pages for
packet and follow the links it's there
and find it so that's all I wanted to
say I hope I've convinced you if you
want our slides there on my github pages
you can look at the sources also I've
put this presentation together with a
really nice tool called FS reveal which
is a nice F sharp front-end on Jas
reveal so if anybody wants to look at
the look at that
feel free okay thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
