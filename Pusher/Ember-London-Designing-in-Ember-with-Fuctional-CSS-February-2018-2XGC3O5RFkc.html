gonna be talking about designing ember
apps with functional CSS so we'll go
over what functional CSS means some
packages you can leverage to use it and
show some examples my name is Jeff and I
work at Tulare I'm here in London I'm
sure you're familiar with number
observers so if you go and look at your
options for your using styles in a
number app there are at least 100
modules things like sass are very
popular we also have CSS modules which
will scope your styles to a component so
that you can not have to worry about
global styles or collisions or
specificity there are lots of different
pre-processors there are lots of
different ways to write CSS but it's
still it's it's very challenging
everything in CSS is global
collaborating on a large team can be
very difficult you you might get
assigned a bug or feature and you can't
be confident that you're not breaking
something else in the app when you
change CSS having a consistent design
having it be maintainable and even just
the the developer experience of writing
CSS I think that's why a lot of these
tools exist so if we look at solutions
to this problem one that's been around
for a while is BEM how many people use
them before in their Styles yeah so
basically to avoid the global trap we
come we've come up with a method where
you can very specifically name your CSS
classes and not get collisions anymore
and I've used that in a lot of projects
and it works but you end up with a
scalability issue a more modern approach
that I think has come from react and
other tool chains is the idea of CSS
modules that through the build process
and JavaScript there
scope to your components basically it'll
generate unique class names for you and
do some other fun things but that still
has the same scalability and
maintainability problem in many cases
that's how you use it specifically an
ember but the the real problem is that
this complexity this global state it has
to live somewhere so in most of these
solutions were saying it's going to live
in our style sheets whether it's SAS or
less or something else whether it's CSS
styles in JavaScript we're basically
putting it somewhere else
and that can be a big problem
over time so as a reference I like to
point people to this essay that Adam
Morris wrote a few years ago he's a
designer and developer and he used to
work at Salesforce and if you are
interested in this diving deeper into
this topic I really recommend this
article basically he talks about reading
over the entire CSS code base for
Salesforce and the fact that no one had
really done that before you on board new
devs and no one's gonna take the time
like oh why don't I read through every
stylesheet we have in the entire tool
chain but a really interesting quote is
that refactoring CSS is hard and
time-consuming deleting unused CSS is
hard and time-consuming and more often
than not it's not work people are
excited to do so what happens people
keep writing more and more CSS so I'm
sure you've seen on your projects that
basically over time you have more CSS
the files bigger it's split into more
files it's just it's kind of a disaster
to give you a concrete example I don't
know if you've ever looked at Twitter
CSS but it's 2/3 of a Meg there's 17,000
declarations almost 10,000 selectors
somehow there's a thousand colors ePub
files for most novels are actually
smaller than the CSS bundle and until
recently that was to display and star
140 characters so they need more
information to describe how to look at
140 characters
then most people need to show you a book
so it it's a real problem real companies
are having dealing with this which is
why I'm proposing to have a look at
functional CSS John Gould also wrote a
very short but really interesting
article summarizing how it helps your
sanity to think of this way don't really
summarize it but it's just another thing
that I could share a link about so I'll
show some examples and try and explain
what functional CSS is I think this is
one of the earlier examples of what BEM
could be Nicole Sullivan took a media
object which an example of that would be
in Facebook when you have say a profile
photo and then someone sharing something
whether it's text block or multimedia
and this is one way you could build that
in BEM and then if you wanted to do that
in functional CSS this is what it would
look like so the concept is that
everything is global you embrace that
and you come up with class names to
basically do one thing so obviously
there aren't actually functions in CSS
but you're thinking of a pure function
that doesn't have side effects and is
very focused so ma2
is margin on all sides two units FLS
float:left so the idea is you're moving
this complexity to your templates and
you're coming up with a design system
where instead of having arbitrary pixel
values for things like margin and
padding you're coming up with units of
measure that will be consistent through
throughout your whole application
tachyons is one of my favorite tools for
actually using functional CSS it's it's
very small and easy to use you can use
in sass you can use it with post CSS you
can just drop the the built minified
version of it into a project and that's
actually where most of those classes
came from in my example so you don't
have to write your own you can leverage
existing tools this is how tachyons
would approach something like a
complicated flexbox layout
this does work really great with ember
through computed properties or class
names you can have these things combined
because really it's just a string of
class names the benefits are that it'll
work with your existing approaches
whether using BEM or CSS components you
can you don't have to go all-in with
functional CSS it can enhance what
you're already doing I think it's a much
simpler mental model when I've
collaborated with designers or back-end
devs using this system has given them a
lot more power to be able to get a
design eighty percent there and still
work within a consistent design system
it's being composable you think of
functions and its really obvious what
things do when you build these things
together and maintainable in the sense
that you're not writing new CSS the
complexity existed in your templates
instead so this is an example of a
documentation site for an add-on that
I've built using almost entirely takin's
so I realized it's a little minimal but
I feel like so record a little video of
me just kind of scrolling through it to
show I mean it's it's a fully responsive
site and I think it's pretty easy to use
and to read and it didn't take that much
effort by one person to get something
that I think is a nice default or a nice
starting point and this is the entirety
of the custom styles that I wrote for it
the rest is just all tachyons so I
realize no one wants to end up in a
situation like bootstrap where every
website looks the same so I guess an
argument against using something like
tachyons is that you'll end up with the
same values but they do use CSS custom
properties through post CSS and they're
now landed in browser so you can
customize any of these values really
easily so this is what the template
would look like again with some of the
composable CSS classes here's another
example where I was able to build a
photography portfolio site basically a
gallery
and again it's something like 90%
tachyons and and I think you can get a
pretty nice clean result by using this
approach who's heard of the ember map
guys before have has anyone heard of
them has anyone used ember mirage okay
so Sam Sela cough I think is how you
pronounce his name him and Ryan Toronto
it's a video course
so they're using functional CSS you can
most the time you can tell when you
inspect a website or app and you start
seeing classes like B G dark grey near
white f6 those are your functions even
segment is using CSS functions and it's
interesting to me as a counter example
because it works with their existing
approach so you can see through these
class names that they're they're using
some form of CSS modules or components
because they're unique generated hashes
basically but then if you look at the
footer
they've also seem to have a mix of
potentially bem but then also mt2 DB
they've got functions in there as well
so it's a nice approach that you can add
into what you're already doing and it
makes refactoring a lot easier just a
couple bonus things to show how I built
the add-on site and portfolio also
leveraging other member tools so the the
documentation site for that add-on it's
actually using the dummy app from the
add-on itself and you can deploy that so
using ember CLI deploy get it will
actually build the the test app in your
add-on and then deploy that to your
github pages branch so if you're working
on your own add-ons and you want an easy
way to have a documentation site without
doing something custom this works really
well and remember I guess is how you
pronounce it it's pre-rendering ember so
to deal with being able to reload a page
because to get it working on github
pages
you can't take advantage of the well you
have to use the hash URL so refreshes
wouldn't work this creates a bunch of
index.html files for you and then so
again this is the the output and this is
what it would look like using just these
functions for the for that site and
photography portfolio I found there's
new really easy way to get typefaces
into your project
someone's created NPM modules for over
800 fonts that are from google fonts and
other free sources and keeps them
versioned now that you can install
things from node modules very easily a
number CLI we can detect that and pull
that in your project so basically in two
steps you install this add-on and you
install the typeface you want and then
that's it you can use it in your project
it makes managing your typefaces a lot
easier you don't have to deal with
vendor files and so on
and the other one that I thought was
interesting just briefly talk about is
dealing with exif metadata so the the
order of the photos and the captions and
all of the the information about them
it's actually pulled from their metadata
so at Build time it runs the directory
of photos through this add-on and you
can pull out any metadata you'd like
about them so you wanted to sort by
location or category or otherwise and
that's it
