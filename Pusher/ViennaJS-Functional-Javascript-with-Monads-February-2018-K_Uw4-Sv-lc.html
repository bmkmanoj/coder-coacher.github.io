is Alex I'm originally from Ukraine I
moved to bones half a year ago it's very
long story how I got here speaking here
and I'm working in data art it's a big
outsourcing company we have more than 20
offices and eight countries I believe
and you can find me on using my website
and also because product names and
surnames are complicated take awaited a
mirror just with links to my social
networks so first of all I will say some
sad things just to make sure we are on
the same page that functional
programming isn't something new it it is
older than many of us here actually and
moreover your students use it just
because it's trendy so I will try to
give some skeptical talk about benefits
and ministers of Technology and I will
share my experience after half a year of
using monads intensively on on a project
so yes probably you can disagree with
those two points but I hope is not a
problem so I will talk about Mona's
monarchs are actually instruments which
are not something specific for
JavaScript monarchs like its Universal
approach and there is a stereotype
that's monads how to say aren't debts
very useful you know and it can be
iterated with this picture and yes okay
why can we need and why do we need
Mona's actually we need them for
functional programming we can use them
for reactive programming you might say
that it's reactive program in its
functional program and no and okay today
I'll talk about numbers how to add two
numbers with JavaScript obviously
okay but you know it's very old-school
brush everyone can do so and I want to
provide some really cool contemporary
code so I can do it like this with
current functions with aramta but well
it's better but it's it's still not that
perfect as I expected it to be these
models we can do something like this we
can split it in several sprints between
several developers and arrange our KU
enterprise process so I guess it is
perfection
actually I do this right is to give the
idea that using some technologies
everywhere regardless are they useful or
not it's not the best idea and yes guys
please don't over complicate things so I
guess we already originally in object
oriented approach we have a pretty basic
example how does the organization of
code works like we have some objects we
can call some methods on it they mutate
something inside the subject and in the
end and then we can do something with
all this data we managed inside and it
is pretty much good for a functional
approach it works well in functional
programming it works a little bit
differently so functional programming is
about functions function composition and
the idea of minutes to try to make
something like this and here we have
just three levels of functions but we
can have much much more and idea to make
something like this and of course I
wanted to notice that a B and C are pure
functions so just shortly they don't
access outer scope don't read don't
write and they don't mutate arguments so
using functional approach that example
from functional programming will work
like this one which isn't dead booth in
my opinion however is much better then
we call all those matters one inside
each other so monitor they are about
function composition and when it comes
to JavaScript it's the main problem they
so we don't have problems with strict
typing and for us it's just about
function composition I'm sorry in two
ways course or somewhere so known as
pattern it's pretty much simple thing
you can read its definition from
Wikipedia and but I hope that you know
when I first seen that I haven't
understood what what is it about when
someone talks about some features
usually you have some exception
like for example hi we got a sink of
eight Wow it's freaking amazing
I don't know we go through octave fix
it's cool we can use it and when you are
talking about technologies usually some
cool features have pretty simple
definition what they do but not this and
I decided to go deeper and find some
short definition that looks like this
and he'll not still he'll noticed it's
still not clear and event of our May
talks in YouTube and some of them are
pretty good however they go in too deep
in my opinion and idea if I'm staying
here is to give this idea as simple as
possible at least I'll try to and
already like this movie and everybody's
code so zero month ago my wife
demonstrated made this video like here
is good guy and he can recognize various
bow inside and I got holy I can use
it to explain monads
and I went to our workers took a camera
and made several photos so ever
demonstrated in pictures so we have a
value is just a variable and it is to
nothing more they have something box and
we place this variable inside the box it
has move in our example it is a ma not
now and process when we placed a value
inside the box
it's called from its unit function which
takes a value and places it inside the
monitor let's make it a little bit more
complicated we have several values like
this number and this candy and okay
candy don't have a number it's cast only
called color and here we have also color
and value and the idea is to handle
those two objects regardless what they
have inside and regardless was what type
of it so let's place those two values
inside the boxes and to make it even
more complicated we'll assume that we
have three values but one is empty it is
undefined so we have to Ramona's and the
idea is that we can apply any function
to them and make sure that it will work
safely it won't break it won't straw any
exception because we have some
unexpected datatype or something like
that and yes we have three Mona's and
okay let's first apply a function which
Mike will make all of them green okay we
applied its coats map mapping and we can
map any moment as an array however it
will apply like for the whole value
inside the monitor
okay we are added we still don't know
what is inside and we shouldn't care
about it so they can take an hour
method and apply it again and as you can
remind we don't have value number value
inside the candy but it doesn't matter
it will work anyway
it won't draw any exception so we are
quiet those two methods to all m units
and okay we can uncover them so we got
four and green sticker instead of pink
one this process is called flatten the
process when we uncover some Monat and
get some value you can merge the process
of mapping this flattening
it's called front map we'll go a little
bit further about flat maps however a
hope idea is quite simple so let's
uncover the second value it is a candy
it became green but we don't have any
color here so mana just executed the
first methods and validated that we
don't have a number here and well we
don't have any errors but we have
modified candy so what we got outside so
we got cover we got some value and for
empty box we still have nothing we don't
got we haven't got any errors swag oh
man you're trying to access some
property of undefined you can do it no
any problems so it's type agnostic and
it's safe however it relies on you to
write save metals we should use as maps
so let's go a little bit further by
definition monad can be described with
this interface so it has some value
inside candy or sticker it has some
value which will place our value into
the cup it has some flat map which will
apply some function and return well go
forward value or you can create a new
Monat inside that method you can map any
function you have and you can just
extract the value outside using water
method so again
we are placing value into the box pretty
much simple map we are doing something
without taking value outside the box so
we have what it does it gives us a point
one plane a value we return a pole and
value but our mana takes it's a pneumo
not again instead of failure and it's
called differently in different
implementations actually bought by and
chained wet map it's actually the same
and okay it means that we got some value
and modified it and afterwards we decide
we will return a point value and we will
return a new monitor instead so it looks
like something exists
sorry for capita waste waste waters here
and waton it's just extraction of value
outside the box so about flat map it's
not only about extraction the values
outside the box and making some changes
with them it's also about structure a
little bit for example we have something
like this let's just array with three
numbers inside and we will map a
function it's not like any mo not map
it's just rig or map on or a very boy
some function which will return a new
array for each of those values and if
you return number source number x 2 and
x 10 so they got something like this
here and this flat map we can actually
make this structure wet so obviously wet
and it also helpful when it comes to
real usage of Mona's also several words
a bit earlier about each a little bit
later and yes it's all about
infrastructure around because you know
it looks cool however it doesn't make
sense for
to numbers it still doesn't make any
sense parade in two numbers so it's too
useful because of infrastructure which
different why Burris provides us
I'm personally using several ones first
one is Monat it's a point why brief for
just Mona's it allows you to it has some
unique functions here unit does not
validate anything you draw inside here
you can do some great Mona's from some
specific data types like some it will do
something like we did on the pictures it
will create a mana from empty values or
any different values regard to as the
type we have we can create none from no
it's useful when we are using flat Maps
if we want to return any you mana
instead of old one we can use either if
we're working with several Mona's or
least I guess either at least familiar
for some of you and also they'll get
there a little bit waiter for example we
can map a new value here is just the
syntax of the Webber amusing so we
created a memo not out of number five we
can map any function to its and extract
the value outside it's just for
demonstration actually into a wife a
doesn't make any real sense however we
added one to five using Mona's it looks
like this one there are actually many
things which monitor provides you and
for example you can do some filtering
like you're doing on arrays however it
won't filter anything inside the monit
it will validate the value it's like
some conditional validation like instead
of writing Eve etc etc you can use
filter and it suits functional style a
little bit more so we can do something
like this and we have the same six we
had before on the previous white and I
filter ease and function validates is
the number began the bigger than ten
and returns what we have inside
regardless the type and we have now
instead of 6 because 6 has not validated
through the head here or for example we
can specify the default value it is the
same example we had here so here we had
now well here we can specify that if our
value does not suit the condition we can
return some default value ends here it
starts making some sense but not always
and here is some some example what we
can do inside wait we have some function
each what validates the number it's
bigger than 0 and if it is it returns as
a new-mown 'it is the same value or we
can return Amanat which is empty is just
a demonstration what is happening under
the hood or filters so you can write it
on your own to some flat map and see
you'll get the same result and one truly
makes sense it's in situations but when
you're working with unpredictable data
sources for example it might be some
third party API if you are working with
backends it might be API of your server
if it's not predictable or it might be
some user input in such cases it really
cool for for validation it it's really
reasonable it saves amount of code you
write in and here you can see just a
crate am honored out with some
properties like address name there might
be many many fields and I just specified
the set of rules how I can handle every
parameter I have there so for those
tasks it's really useful and there is
one example I have taken it for the ends
please raise your hands guys who used
rigs Jess
congratuations used moments because
erect jess is actually kinetic data
structure you can do map with me upon
them and they provide you a lot of
different
stop wish you can do this observables
I mean observables are monadic totally
melodic in rxjs however from the big
specification you have there like more
than 100 methods by oboe in there exist
most of them are about such patterns
called appliqué defunct or it's about
interacting between several monads in
the very beginning and I present that
you example how to add numbers and it
used the same patterns so it's more
about how you interact between your
observables you got several syllables
you want to unite them or you wanna wake
Hilter the way test results it's about
that pattern and actually it's pretty
much eat it alike to us answer any
questions you have and why I'm answering
