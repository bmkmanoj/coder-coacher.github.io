and today we're going to talk about
react state management with Mobile's for
obvious reasons of certain my name in
order for everyone to remember so I'm
gonna talk a bit about Who am I my
experience then we're going to talk
about the problem with state management
and react who well we all know that it's
quite over pain sometimes and after that
we're going to talk about the
alternative which is mobiles and how it
is going to help us achieve more
productivity and the right cleaner code
after that I have a quick demonstration
I'd like to share with you so about me
I'm a full-stack developer a trinomial
tsunami is the host of this event for
this month were basically in this very
nice building so problem with state
management react we've all been there
when we write a craft a react
application this is the proper model
where we have a parent that has two
children and one and tell - in that case
let's say that child one is an input box
and tie - is basically a label that
prints whatever the user has input in
the input box right now in order to pass
the value from cell one to time two we
need to have a function in the parent
which is basically going to be sending
to tell you one as a probe every time
we'd say in something inside one we need
to use that probe which goes back to the
parent rear Enders and then passes the
the state as a probe to channel two and
this is where you can actually see your
changes from your note it is a bit of a
nightmare sometimes because this is very
simple restructure imagine if you have
like something way more complex on that
so why möbius möbius is a state
management alternative which is quite
lightweight it
very simple one very easy to install you
don't have to deal with way too many
architectural changes a good example is
that if we compare it to Redux which is
another popular alternative Redux can do
many things but the problem is that you
need to integrate your application into
Redux not apply the fed management into
your application so obviously if you
have a very big application it's going
to be like a separate project by itself
and gonna take too much time to apply
that another good thing with so for that
reason mobile sees like very
straightforward you can just simply
replace the state with mobiles and if
you want to go even deeper it's very
scalable so it has functions where you
can force it to use all of the store
properties and use everything the proper
way as a statement state management tool
especially people who are familiar with
three dogs can benefit a lot with that
so this is basically an example of the
architecture of mobiles you have an
event which leads to an action and then
the actual modifies the state which then
updates the computed values and then
this triggers a reaction and then it
goes back to the action and this is the
cycle it's quite straightforward not
very difficult to apply that to your own
application without any big changes so
let's talk about the types of mobiles
Mobile's uses observables which are
basically variables that you can use
them anywhere in your application and
what is good about observable values is
that once they change in one part of the
application they instantly change in
every other part of their being cold in
order to do that we have axioms axioms
are basically you can see them as like
functions that modify the value of an
observable
then you have the computed values which
are basically you can think of them as
read-only function which takes the
observable values and does computations
and gives you the result without
affecting the actual observable value a
good example is let's say that we have x
and y both of them are observables a
computed value can be the sum of these
two values so then we have different
triggering functions like auto run which
basically you can you can observe like a
specific observable and every time the
value changes you can write the code to
do like something specific then we have
observers observers thing about them as
you need to specify that the files that
are going to be using Mobile's need to
be specified as observers again I'm
gonna talk a bit more in detail about
observers and all that in the code
example Mobile's comes with a quite good
dev tools which they allow you to do the
debugging process in a not so painful
way and yes if you are a big fan of
using state management like the proper
way Mobile's offers a strict mode where
basically you can force the code to just
use the redox axioms in order to modify
the state so this is an example of a
parent with two children written without
any state management tool as you can see
we have the parent which renders cell
one and cell two you go to child one you
have all this painful component will
mount company will receive probes and
basically in the render you see that
it's an input where every time you type
something and goes to this type function
line 31 which basically calls the probe
that is a func
coming from the parent which again if
you go to the parent line seven it's a
function that basically does a sets the
state with a current value and after
that it renders everything after you set
the state and you go to tie two with the
updated value which goes down to line 42
and basically when there is a new value
you'll know that this can be a big time
nightmare when it comes to more complex
files so this is the same example using
Mobile's the only thing we need to do is
initialize a store where we if you see
line five we have a class user store
which has a user that is a string and
then it has an action which is called
add user but basically it just every
time neither user types something it
updates the user then we decorate it so
I'm going to talk a bit more about the
why I use that logic in the in the
coding example and after that we just
like create a new instance of the user
store called store and then we go and we
write the code again as we did earlier
but as you can see the code now it's
much cleaner the parent doesn't have a
single function apart from render then
you go to the first tile which is the
input again apart from the value all the
rest are exactly the same when you type
something it goes to the type function
which basically calls the action from
inside the store updates everything and
then the properties of child two which
is user simply gets displayed there very
simple nothing very complicated pretty
straightforward just works so now time
for the demo I'm gonna show you how I
created this map which basically shows
you like places you've been if you want
to see more of the source code
just have a look on the github repos
you add it as you can see it instantly
changes the color of here Brazil so
that's it and now let's see how this all
happens in the code we have we have the
store which has one very one variable
called countries which is an array then
we have a maximum at country which
basically just goes and that's the
country into the countries list I've
added some code just to make sure that
we do not the same country more than the
ones and here we have a computed value
which just shows us the length of the
array in order to give us like a number
of how many countries we've been to so
now let's talk about decorate here if
you want to use the Creator so you just
do observable countries equals to an
empty array because I create this
application using create reactor and
created reactive doesn't support
decorators yet that's why I follow that
logic so after that we create a new
instance and the first thing I do is
that I have an array of all the Condors
up into which you can see here it's a
very simple array with all of the
countries and I just like do a loop that
basically populates here the countries
then let's go and see what is happening
in the first and component again here
very very clean code we have a render
function which has a drop down but has
the countries and one button that
basically at the country every time you
select a country we just go and we set
the internal state of this component to
have this country and then when we add
the country basically caused
the action of the store that adds the
country into the array after that what
happens is that basically you just go to
the map component things are a bit more
complicated due to the way data map
works and yes here is where the rest of
the calculation happened here we have a
total which shows that the computed
value another thing important to mention
is that mobic s-- has this new lifecycle
function which this component will react
with basically every time various
reaction to that component this
lifecycle function is going to be cold
so in that case if if the computed value
changes it instantly goes and andrey
updates all of the functions all of
their values in order to display the
right data in the map ok so basically
that's pretty much it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
