going to be talked about vue.js two
disclaimers I'm trying to keep it short
in brief I know we have some beginners
here that maybe you know as more than
enough learning JavaScript for now and
then we have some more advanced people
I'll keep it more beginner friendly than
advanced I'll try to cover some of the
things that makes you Jess you Jess I
won't go so much in depth but we'll show
look at some examples together the other
disclaimer is I'm on a Mac that is not
mine so if I seem like I'm fumbling
around that's why I'm think we'll we'll
make this work cool let's get started
just really briefly about me I'm a
software developer meetup organizer of
this free code camp meet up and also
view GS Vienna and also Vienna go which
is a goal-line meetup so I organized
three meetups they're all monthly and
obviously I'm a community youth and I'm
a community enthusiast because I really
love doing these kind of things you can
find me on most the things that Rob
axelsson Twitter github etc me and
Daniel Deutsch which is mic organizer
for free code camp Vienna which is also
here tonight we had a talk together
recently which you can see online head
over to my website and you can see it in
full it talks about our way from being a
self-taught programmer to getting our
first developer job so that's enough
about me what is view Jas a brief
history view Jas was created by Avenue
in 2013 while he worked at Google just
to give some context the first release
of react was also released in 2013 they
worked on it internally at Facebook
before but that gives us some some
context there's a quote from Avenue I
started view as a personal project when
I was working at Google creative labs
into the 2013 my job there involved
building a lot of UI prototypes after
hand rolling many of them with vanilla
Jas and using angular 1
whew I wanted something that captured
the declarative nature of angular's data
binding but with a simpler more
approachable API and that is how you
started I know this is hard for you guys
here in the audience to see but I can
sum it up really briefly with the
popularity this chart chart is supposed
to show that November this year was the
first month that was more than a million
downloads of UGS last year I think
October 2016 I'm not 100 percent sure
they had reached their first I think it
was 2 million downloads total so now
we're off to instead of total we're off
to monthly downloads and it's just
increasing in popularity also comparable
to other frameworks it has a good growth
rate it's not necessarily the only
reason or it's not the only reason you
should use fear jest but it's one of the
things to keep in mind this size here is
wrong but here are some of the benefits
it is now 20 kilobytes minified and
zipped the size of this framework so
it's quite light compared to some other
frameworks we didn't cover it but just
discovered now vue.js is a framework
it's not a library some people have in
the past and continue to call it a
library but it has stuff that makes it
more a framework with a lot of features
it comes to the feature-rich part part
there's a big API what a lot of stuff
you can do out of the box with UJS or
with build tools like web pack on top
compared to both react and angular it
has a gentler learning curve that
doesn't mean it is purely gentle it's
more like it doesn't have as steep of a
learning curve some other frameworks
might have a steeper one just starting
out it will still be you know some stuff
to learn and the could be quite a it
could be a steep ish learning curve if
it's your first framework I keep that in
mind the documentation is great we'll
have a look at that afterwards so we'll
get to that
it is reactive we'll get to that in the
next slide it is
has declared surrendering and it does
have two-way data-binding
but that's more of a default nowadays
like it's not necessarily something we
have to mention but if you're curious
that's built in I think I'll skip back
and just mention one thing that is not
in the slides for those of you who for
now either haven't used any JavaScript
or haven't really programmed much or
you've done something in JavaScript and
what you've done is using javascript so
vanilla JavaScript of JavaScript itself
with document.getelementbyid en self
manipulating the HTML Dom with
JavaScript and the reason you would want
to use vgs is to instead of having to do
all that kind of basic stuff and
structuring it out yourself you can use
few GS out of the box as well you kind
of get a bit ahead of the curve in terms
of people have already prepared stuff
for you that they've simplified so you
as a developer can get more done quicker
but it is more higher-level you want to
silly understand everything that goes on
behind the scenes but there's nothing
certainly a bad thing starting out keep
in mind that it might be good to look
into the things as you start working
with them how does this really happen
with with the JavaScript itself and
you're free to read the source code
because it's open source I just want to
get that out of the box feel free to ask
questions afterwards if this is really
Greek to you what we're getting into now
but if you want to start out don't be
afraid to skip ahead and try out Vijay s
if you don't if you're not so familiar
with Java Script because you still can
get stuff done looking at the
documentation at Blue Jays lorg so just
briefly the reactive part that you might
have seen that also react has as it also
has in its name is the fact that it
reacts to changes in state and let's get
to some fundamentals before we
but what makes it reactive vgs has a
virtual Dom and it is a simplified copy
of the HTML Dom but what is a Dom DOM is
the table jecht document object yeah I
was about to say module then I
second-guessed myself thank you guys
it's a document object model which is an
abstraction of what the browser is
keeping track of to render what you see
in the browser in a simplified way of
saying it
vue.js has its own virtual Dom which is
even more simplified which is its way of
keeping traffic what it's gonna hook
into in the browser what makes it
reactive then is that it's when you make
changes to the state in your app only
the affected parts of the page changes
and it does this by dipping so it takes
you make a change in the state and it
gives the change with what is in the
virtual DOM and it elite elegantly only
changes on the page what it needs to
change instead of having to re-render
the whole page so sometimes you click a
button or you do something on the
webpage if the whole thing we fresh is
for you to see something it's not doing
this so there is some magic going on in
the backend and that's what the reactive
part is about and it in fact acts on
when you make changes to the state the
state is as simple as data or stuff for
example you have a unique title for each
page you want to input your username
like stuff that is unique to you
browsing this site it is it stated let's
call this state this is what we are
calling State for example when you're
changing the username when you're
changing the title when you are clicking
a button and the color of something
changes that is a state that's keeping
track though and when you're done
changing the state it reflects into this
reactiveness these are simplified ways
of saying it and I'm trying to keep that
in mind the clarity rendering means that
basically comes down to it looks more
like HTML and it's easier to write and
read we declare how something should
look like with HTML and Vijay has
specific syntax and then the UJS takes
care of the rest for us the end result
is as I said easier and more
code and we'll look at this in the
documentation soon the two-way
data-binding means that when properties
in the model gets updated so does the UI
when UI elements get updated the changes
get propagated back to the model so if
we put if we for example have a text in
our page and then we have the same pack
text and input field if those are bind
together with two-way binding if we're
changing what is in the input field the
title changes instantly and again with
the reactive rendering without the whole
page refreshing for us we'll have a look
at that also now we'll get to some code
I'll use the official documentation as
the basis that also makes it easier for
you guys to look at it afterwards
yourself and continue on if you want to
before we get to that just very briefly
I work at step wise we are hiring this
is where you go if you're interested
right now we're looking for a full stack
web developer among other developer jobs
if you feel like the qualifications are
beyond you please just approach me or
still apply because we'd like to get to
know you better regardless that's it we
don't need to spend more time on that so
instead of demo time this time I want to
call it jsfiddle time because we can get
quicker to testing something out and see
the results together and we have
something saved for afterwards but let
us do this like so this is the official
VDS website if we click get started here
we get here it's as simple as that
it's the guide this is vue.js 2 by the
way if we talk about major releases
that's what where we are at now but it
hasn't been angular size breaking
changes so don't worry like that the
fiddle that I talked about is the link
that is mentioned here so I think we'll
just have a look
that let's get back to within a second
because all these things that I
mentioned now are explained well here in
the documentation the clarity rendering
is an example of it here you see if you
know some HTML from before this is HTML
with something here inside that we are
like okay this is what is this but let's
have a look this is a view instance this
is where the magic happens okay so we
got that out of the box or the yeah we
got that ready this is the same thing in
the browser
you could do this locally just remember
to use the CDN like this one to get to
view J's in imported or you can download
have it have it locally if that's Greek
to you ask me afterwards it's I will
read the documentation it's not so hard
to set up here is the output so this is
as if this was the web page that we have
created with these with HTML together
with JavaScript we are now importing the
whole view J's here we are declaring
this that id app is we need to clear an
ID and we need to tell view where it
should start to it's magic you do not
have to use V J's on your whole website
and on a single page on your website you
don't have to use v GS only you can use
it just in a small part for example
gitlab they are using components where
they are incrementally doing more and
more of you J's for their website so
they're having this approach where you
don't have to think about it as we have
to switch everything right now to view
yes you can do it iteratively or yeah
step by step so what is this this is a
reference to the state to the data that
we are declaring here this is a simple
view instance where we are declaring the
element that we're supposed to render
this view instance within so the HTML
element we are declaring only here data
and then magically with this syntax we
know with mustache braces or
curly braces we know to reference that
and we're outputting it this way it's
that simple
this is more an example of declarative
rendering let's get a little bit more
into other types of things we can do
let's take this example here let's just
let's do something fun here by the way
it is as simple as okay German keyboard
one second
there we go so if I now and this is
JavaScript if I now just say I want to
have this text maybe awesome cool nice
free code camp maybe I shouldn't write
so much awesome so I can now do this
right what you've come here awesome and
I can manipulate this as well and I can
say I shouldn't do this it seems that I
think that actually there is a plus
awesome
ah if I just have a look at what is
spelled on the buttons it seems to work
sort of cool so we can even do stuff
within curly braces to get even more
fancy now we can see an example of
conditionals and loops if you don't know
much a program and this might be
confusing but for those of you guys who
know some this is really handy this is
sort of like the angular style of doing
things now I'm only going to take this
but we're still doing the same and then
we need a button or something now you
see me okay let's just do it that's what
they're doing so this follows the state
of the seed object which has a key value
the key is seen and the value is true so
it's saying that if the value of seen is
true show it but if it's false don't
show it
that's the conditional on that level of
V if and that's a control statement but
we can go into loops and have a for loop
within our div then we can take the
state which is the list so we could just
say awesome not awesome okay then I
should just probably pop that back in
great awesome so
let's just create a list of to dos and
then we should have a should be an array
okay I'm going to copy paste because
this keyboard is not my friend but you
get the idea
so let's push this in so this is now an
object where we have one array of
objects and then we're going to show
hopefully all of them something wrong in
my copy pasting yeah awesome so we just
had it we changed this in attentionally
so I didn't know where to render so now
we have a list here and depending on
them data we're saying to do introduce
introduce is the object that we're
iterating over and then we're the same
way that you were dealing your mapping
over stuff you're for each or whatever
you however you handling you're for
loops and JavaScript you're saying that
this is the item within that object and
then you're iterating over that and then
you're rendering out it like this for
example you can also do stuff like this
then we can do an unordered list and
then we can say we want index and then
we can even do
okay let me just copy paste this
awesome
awesome so what's the wrong other way
around but you can even work with
indexes you can even have number numbers
and stuff like this but let's look at
something yeah let's look at two-way
data-binding
and then it's about time to mention
something of where you can go next as a
user if you want to look into more
because this is view GS at its core what
we are looking at now the syntax and the
VJs instance when you're getting more
advanced you'll use webpack or something
and you have a dot view file to render
it in single file components and then it
starts being more like the other
frameworks out there it's a bit too much
to cover in this talk but let's have a
look now a two way data binding and some
magic happening here
actually we took the wrong example we
can look at this though this is reverses
it for us the magic happens this is a I
didn't mean to cover this but this is a
an event handler with the click and then
we're having a we're invoking the
reverse message function and it takes
the message and it reverses it for us
and because this is reactive to change
that state changes and then the view
changes but this is more fun to play
with we'll take this code here and we'll
do this then we'll take this data so we
basically just need to change the data
right we could keep it but let's do what
did I copy/paste cool let's do like so
there's something wrong here right let
me take a step back then no it looks
good awesome so this is what we're
saying when we have to date with two-way
data-binding whatever i'm writing here
because the state is bound both to the
message and we're binding the v-model of
the input message to the title that we
are displaying or the message we are
displaying in the P tag it now changes
instantly as we're doing stuff on it I
think this is a good time to run out to
run up by saying that you take take this
to the next level let's have a look at
example first no let's do it like this
simple awesome
components that I briefly mentioned I
will look at a quick example and then
we'll round up is a system yeah it's an
extract abstraction that allows us to
build large-scale application composed
of small self-contained and often
reusable components in view a component
is essentially a view instance with
predefined options in a large
application it is necessary to divide
the whole app into components to make
development manageable there is a great
tool if you just look for a view CLI
it's maintained by the vue.js core team
that does this stuff for you is
literally install something when npm run
a command go into the directory and just
npm run dev for example spins up it for
you with backpack and you can have a
look at the code and it live let's have
a look at an example of a what that
means not the view CLI but here's an
example of how we are taking stuff to
the next level it's a bit more stuff
going on in one file but you can have
one file for each in component you can
have components within components and
you can easily build up a single site a
single page application you can even do
server-side rendering with with VJ s and
then you can put this into production
and do stuff but don't be afraid to
start out small and have hobby project
with plain view J's instances but this
is how you would do something bigger as
a hobby or you would go to production if
you're doing this professionally it
renders on top and inside the template
template tag is HTML specific we are
rendering it this way this script is the
day a view J's instance that we just saw
as an example of and then we're keeping
a style tag below here we can also use
sass or stylus or whatever in there and
then this together with the viewed pack
web pack build environment will then
render this into what you need to put on
your hosting or whatever or locally to
to see the resulting view J's in action
yeah
about it hope you had a better feel
about you Jesus I knew there was a lot
in a short time and only some examples I
would encourage you to just simply go to
again to the web page have a look at the
examples there's tons of courses out
there as well I can recommend some both
free and paid ones and play with it and
feel free to pay me if you have any
questions along the way yeah thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
