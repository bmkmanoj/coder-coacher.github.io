whole talk is it's about a really simple
way of deploying what are technically
static web applications but which may
involve that really very dynamic
behavior and modern JavaScript which I
find fantastic for small projects okay
three different microphones this is
exciting it's the most microphones I
think I've ever had
course so I'm gonna start with a little
project at hide so I kind of had this
idea like what if I could come up with a
little like ranking system for your
people's full stack eNOS so if I could
combine a sort of ante PHP prejudice and
various other random criteria so you can
I go to this website it's a full stack
you can find the URLs later but and you
can write yourself in various categories
and you can then get ranked in your full
stack eNOS it turns out in a ranking
system I invent I get myself quite a
high rating where did that so I'm the
unicorn apparently because of my full
stack knowledge but um I came over this
little project idea and kind of went
from the idea to actually a completely
deployed version with HTTPS and a custom
demand and something that people could
play around with I think it was
basically at one evening it was
certainly in a matter of a few hours and
why you did that is gonna be the subject
of this talk so I consider doing live
coding but that's that's kind of hard so
I recorded this video earlier this week
if you can when you're editing the video
if you can make it look like I'm live
coding that would be awesome because I
sped up some parts of the videos I'm
gonna be like you know in the films we
type it at foreign words a minute that
that's gonna be hackneyed at certain
points there so basically I'm going to
kind of talk over this video and I don't
have to catch up with video but
basically is good the main part of this
is a tool called Gatsby you install
command line client there are a number
of communities starter projects this is
one of them which basically provides a
blog starter project you initialize it
if there's got to be new you give your
project a name
and you give the gifts up repo for this
custom thing in just over two minutes
and the crappy internet connection I was
using I have a working blog you type
Gatsby develop and you have a modern
JavaScript development environment
locally so you've got all of the nice
things like errors nicely displayed in
the browser
hot reloading all of that stuff and
you've got this very nice starting place
so you've got all of the kind of things
like prettier flow etc everything is
nicely set up ready to kind of go and
get working efficiently on your blog and
this is making a static website it's a
bit weird to be using these dynamic
JavaScript technologies like react but
actually they turn out to be a really
nice solution and this this framework
does things like code splitting and so
on for you so you don't have to have to
worry about those kind of optimal
optimizing things in terms of data it
has this philosophy and make everything
accessible via graph QL so this may be
marked on files locally this may be a
third party API etc but you have this
it's built in console we can do
interactive queries and that's easily
available in your app I'm not really
going to talk about that but it's it's
nice to kind of know that's available
when you do need that par and this this
framework at husband uses the various
kind of really serious websites such as
the react developer documentation it was
recently been rebuilt using godspeed
this is kind of nice to know that I can
use it for my little project it gets
stuff done but also it's it you know it
works for you know world class kind of
websites so anyway it's to continue the
story apply this makes it laser dude boy
I set up a git repository locally set up
beginner compositor in github for this
you know do the usual stuff with add in
the remote machine there data to that so
I got this this on github and no the
deploy is really really simple I log in
to notify I add this site from github
and I click on the deploy button and
boom you know I've deployed this website
to the internet and it's it's like free
it's like done really nicely it's it's
it's also got continuous deployment
whenever I push an update it will also
be instantly deployed and that genuinely
in real time the whole process takes
like like 10 minutes they can sped up a
bit here Bates it's the crazily quick
I'm
never encountered another set of tools
that can deliver that result quite that
quickly here are logged into AWS route
53 I'm gonna add a custom demand M again
this is really really simple I just log
internet Liffe I have the details here
and this is the sort seem like a bit of
an advert for an outlet by Oh honestly
third they if they'd like to give me
money that's great you know but but but
they're not so you know you can add a
custom to manner this is this is the bit
which I find most magical to click SSL
you know you can make your site HTTPS in
like two clicks like that's just insane
but have you ever set up and it should
be a senator burr it's a nightmare this
is like two clicks this is now served
via HTTP I know so we've gone in a
matter of minutes you've gone from an
idea to something that's on the internet
with like a custom demand in HTTP and
all of that kind of stuff that busy so
the barrier for Scipio side-project
world is like so much lower so here
we're doing some customizations i've
thrown out there the demo data and
britain a custom article which is in
fact about this talk this is the first
of many mattr kind of parts of this talk
i know you know i've done a few other
customizations throughout components you
know I did a little photograph of the
Raspberry Pi because everyone likes
raspberry pies you know then when I push
through these updates to github the
continuous deployment kicks in natla
fire deploys the new version of the
website with customizations so this is
where we we started earlier today I'm
yeah I think this is really amazing and
if you haven't tried this you definitely
should try it so I've got a couple of
other little examples I'll share their
projects are done with this and I really
think these are things that I might not
have done if it hadn't been for the fact
that this deploys is so crazily easy and
productive so I have this react
narrative game called RGB logic and you
download it but basically I wanted a
nice way of like sharing games or bird
and also creating an interactive
tutorial so that's actually quite a
complex front end up in terms of the
logic for this game but it really
because of this deploy process and there
reusability write once run everywhere
it's not the right thing for a react you
know I was able to do this very quickly
so I got this interactive game that
people can play so you can be playing a
game on your phone and share that with
your friends on Facebook or whatever
there's also a little tutorial which was
kind of the original point of this the
other little project or one of the other
little projects I did of this approach
was a coding checklist and again this is
gets kind of matter because I had this
idea that there are these certain kind
of opinionated processes I might want to
share it's they're not really
documentation for a particular thing
they're kind of like my tick and how you
might do something so good composing
perhaps a web framework with certain
opinions and what you should use for
authentication but I added this this
talk here so you can now follow along
with the details of this talk in a nice
incremental check listy way and then as
you do the various steps you can check
them off I think I need to add like
ticks and make it look more like
checklist but that's kind of a fairly
minor point too destroyed the visuals of
it but again this is all of these
amazing properties of like this really
really nice world class deployed
situation you know continuous deployment
so if I spot a typo I'm not gonna be you
know there's a typo I should fix it at
some point and never actually fix it I
could just like Morgan to github and
make a commit directly to master of
course that's not where you would ever
do in a day job on a little side project
like this that that's a grid-like things
Illinois so let me just flip back to the
notes so this is guts PJs I have not
talked about the advanced stuff they're
stars it does some really nice stuff
around graph QL and how you can kind of
make custom data available I have to use
that on one project to be honest I'm
mostly just use it as a really nice
solution for like local development I'm
a good quality deployment and yeah it's
great for that purpose and coupled
networth I and you know wire up github
and so on there are links here just you
know as an aside of course there are
other solutions previously other
typically have used AWS is Esprit for
this kind of thing but it's kind of it's
an OK solution but it involves more
manual stats
and whenever it involves manual steps
and friction you're gonna be less likely
to do it no I think it's quite an
interesting tool in this kind of space
there's kind of like a one command
deploy but in in a way like this this
kind of approach of continuous
deployment is a zero command deploy I
push the code it gets deployed there's
other things like Serge and I actually
as a static site thing of course I think
that's that's mostly it you should all
go to the full stack thing and then the
current yourselves you know I know
developers you're probably going to do
pretty well because you can kind of
cover a few of the categories quite
easily whereas PHP developers are
explicitly forbidden from from actually
taking part
I'm also bond Java if you use Java you
have to stop it in the middle point or
an XML configuration that also cut off
yeah but yeah anyway my opinions thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
