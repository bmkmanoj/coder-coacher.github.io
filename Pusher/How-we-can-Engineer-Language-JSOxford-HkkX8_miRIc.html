at i work at elsevier now which is
awesome because it's actually my first
job in the tech industry thanks in large
part to jas Oxford and the community
here I'm very welcoming very helping
give yourselves a hand give something so
yeah everything's awesome and this is my
first ever talk at Jase Oxford I gave a
little little micro talk two times ago I
thought but this is should be the full
shebang okay great so lots of buzzwords
here we got bizarre we got latas
cathedrals Ferraris I'll explain all
that stuff later and kind of language
learning apps as microservices I don't
really know why I put that in there
sounded kind of good maybe we can figure
it out as I go along so okay I know
you're probably thinking right who's
who's this guy right me oh that's a
Christian Bale actually American Psycho
and yeah so who's who's this guy right
Adam you've probably seen me around ejs
ops friend I'm really loud I like to
dance whatever okay or this guy here
right it's a French flag I made that hat
out of duct tape supposed to be in
Napoleon or this guy you remember I was
given a talk had a hat on it was awesome
okay this is actually who I really feel
like I am ok so I've been or I had been
past perfect working as a teacher
internationally in a couple interesting
places and for about eight and a half
years but I've always kind of been an
engineer at heart I started out as an
engineer in my undergraduate but I found
out it wasn't very good at maths so that
torpedoed it pretty quickly but I've
always kind of liked building things
here you see these are some hoses Oaks
are some hoses connected with duct tape
to some funnels attached to the showers
in our dorm bathroom that I hooked up to
this thing here which was a fully
functioning effectively a hot tub it had
an outflow pump that kind of took are
not a pump it was using pressure you
know physics whatever not a big deal and
to come and kind of circulate the hot
water the cold water I've always loved
building things right
so I kind of thought like oh how can we
engineer language learning teaching
right I want to create something I want
to build something take something from
in here make it real okay maybe make it
as cool as a train app probably probably
can't do that but we can always dream
okay so the deal is Google and others
always kind of working on the stuff with
business implications the stuff I'm
talking about nobody really cares about
that much because you really can't sell
it really really simple stuff but so
Google's working on like machine
translation semantic analysis that's not
what we're talking about okay so
language learning students with the
exceptions of very high stakes testing
we're talking about the IELTS testing I
know oup does a lot of testing materials
that's big business that's what all what
I'm talking about okay undeserved me so
some current approaches exist we have
duolingo which some of you may be
familiar with and also memorized I
couldn't get the the word on that
graphic so it's memorize I'll talk about
and show it later what I want to say at
the outset is I know some people maybe
even in this room a shock really love do
a lingo and if you like duolingo and it
works awesome use it do whatever works
what I'm suggesting is more of an
additive approach rather than something
that should substitute for so again if
you like this stuff if it works for you
awesome okay so let's take a look at all
right so duolingo claims so we got 34
hours of duolingo equals 1 University
semester 11 weeks well that's
interesting okay they're claiming that
right well let's see what all await fine
print yeah right so this is the study
right that they did and the participants
took a placement test the beginning and
at the end Oh interesting so we're
obviously interested what's the test
that they took right is it a good test
is it a bad test okay I mean it's been
it's based on science right it's a test
right thank goodness okay but what of
this research what did this test so I
thought we could take a look at some of
the greatest hits of the end I mean it
is independent study I don't know why I
put that in quotes but right it was an
independent study but let's check out
okay ah so the main instrument it's this
web Cape basically what this means is
it's a test Ian you can check out the
specifics of it on this web
which I did and it was interesting to
note that it did not evaluate a lot of
language skills they acquired for the
two months of study so in that regard
recommend addition to the written
placement test to include some tests of
spoken proficiency haha so all this
research did not have a spoken
proficiency component well that's kind
of interesting so they're saying we
teach you just like a university course
except no speaking well okay that's not
exactly like a university course all
right oh and another thing in 2008 there
was a test for spoken proficiency but
not in the test that they're referencing
on their page that looks very nice and
pretty hmm that's a bit problematic okay
this is a sample of the questions on the
test so basically we have sentence
completion what we'd call a selection
type item because you already know what
the possible answers are so you just
pick the one that goes in there right
but I don't know if you can see that the
bottom there that Carol doesn't works
full-time anymore she teaches school
until twelve o'clock and then she goes
is that one word is it two words it
looks like there might actually be two
errors in this sentence so then the
student has only a statistically a fifty
percent chance of guessing the right one
even if they know they're both errors
right because tests usually have to have
one right answer so it's easy to grade
so we don't dispute gray and whatever so
that's kind of an issue this is the test
upon which they're basing the study upon
which they're basing the claims of
duolingo hmm interesting okay so flag on
the play all right that's an American
football references from Key &amp;amp; Peele
they're fantastic you should check them
out lots of dancing hingle
mccringleberry on the right over there
okay hold on let's take time okay quick
primer on assessment super quick and
assessment basically there are two
things we care about so we care about
content validity and construct validity
right and you can tell we care about
them because they're in red right so
super super fast content validity means
does it test what we learned or what we
need to learn basically is it authentic
is it realistic right so something like
this so maybe in class two plus two
equals four and then on the test john f
three apples last one what's the mass of
the Sun well you didn't teach us that I
don't what
how am I can't figure that out Oh F
you're terrible I'm a terrible student
no no right or something like teacher
covered chapter three but the exam was
all from chapter five well that's not
fair you didn't teach us chapter five
right or we had a spanish test the
reading had a bunch of vocabulary we
didn't learn well that's not fair
because if you're assessing vocabulary
in the test you need to teach the
vocabulary right I mean so oh and right
so in my jigga study Java applets but
nobody uses those so why did we study
them I don't I'm awesome at Java applets
cool i don't care can you you know so
right construct validity means does it
test what we claim its testing or what
we think it's testing right so for
example this is a notorious one all the
above if it's below none of the above
then logically none of the above is
included in all of the above right so
then you turn it into this can the
student outsmart the test and what
you're actually testing is critical and
logical reasoning and not language
ability ok very very key some examples
of this so as a speaking class but all
we do is copy sentences off the board oh
you have written down three perfect
sentences you are ready to speak oh yeah
well don't think so ok or supposed to
teach us programming but the test was
just questions about mathematical
theorems underlying different algorithms
which is interesting and applicable in
some sense but there's more to it to do
programming you need to do programming
so if that's all you're learning hmm not
exactly the whole story or something
like the international students I heard
this all the time are you stitute the
actual students are really good at
giving memorized speeches why do they
have so much trouble making conversation
I know they can speak english i just saw
them speak english for 10 minutes well
that's a slightly different construct
it's a slightly different target
language use task ok ok so let's return
to duolingo with this idea of content
validity and construct validity ok some
tasty screenshots oh that looks gorgeous
way better than the stuff I've made its
kind of I like it the colors nice
beautiful oh but wait a minute did you
already spot the problem let's zoom in
on it select the boy
if you are a human and you know what
things are you can you can pick the boy
without speaking a word of Spanish okay
so this one probably construct validity
because you don't need to know spanish
to answer this correctly okay also nice
beautiful flashy display colors we got
pictures we got buttons right shade it
on the bottom I love it but let's zoom
in on that okay so translate it porque
no comas fruta oh let's see well thats
ass how would i SAT english why don't
eat vegetables what oh no there's
something missing it's not possible to
answer that from the selection type item
you can't answer that correctly in
standard English so does that mean that
it's you get a zero did you fail do you
I mean what like that's a big big
problem big problem okay alright so i
took placement test for spanish nine
percent fluent put it on my CV okay the
trials I faced oh my god thank you
gracias Oh fantastic I'm now ready to go
to Spain and type things into boxes yeah
not they weren't all cakewalk so I had
to listen to this thing right el
Pinguino come in fruita oh we had a
problem though almost correct do you
know what I was missing a fever yeah I
was missing the little umlaut over the
you wait a minute is that a listening
tester is that a spelling test okay so
that's kind of problematic or could be
Oh type what you hear hey I know tokala
Carnac fantastic right oh I did it
perfectly I'm so smart but is that
something that I need to learn how to
say she does not touch the meat
okay interesting all right so naturally
I wanted to see how they drape me as an
English speaker right I feel pretty
confident in my English right it's
American English but please forgive me
that okay so oh this is wow this is
really legit really well designed Oh 92%
maybe I can do as well as that Oh
interesting oh wait a minute wait a
minute wait a minute wants me to pay
twenty dollars for a certificate hmm
about that but there's a quick test so
maybe I'll just do that one okay okay
there we go so literally a third of the
test was choose which words are the real
English words right like you do all the
time when you're interacting with your
friends right another selection type
item okay do you think I got them all
well you know that I didn't oh no wait
oh my goodness now you could make an
argument that that's not standard
English so possibly the students
shouldn't be expected to learn that but
it's to a larger discussion of who gets
to define what a standard word is maybe
the students want to learn about you
know watching YouTube videos like this
and they want to know what a winch is
okay nope okay Oh another one that I say
all the time the bishop has been opening
the restaurant early as he often does
right very hardworking bishop okay
content validity and oh yeah this went
to the entrepreneur drinks with the
chairman I don't know content validity
okay um so oh and this was the other
third of the test right selecting words
just like in real life have you ever had
that that experience where you go up to
talk to one of your friends and they
hand you a little tablet to select the
words that you're going to use to
communicate with them right I mean now
you could argue that this is a good
effective test possibly a vocabulary and
syntactic knowledge but does it
basically mean you are a competent
speaker or a competent reader or a
competent listener or competent writer
right okay Lea literally a third of the
test all right again another selection
item right okay oh my goodness one
hundred percent I feel so happy with
myself oh wait a minute can understand
virtually anything her to read even
intellectually demanding oh oh I'm ready
to study at a UK University right oh my
goodness because the thing is so many
times and I've seen this in not in my
classes obviously but some of the
teachers that I've mentored and say oh
we had the students listen to the
listening yes and I say okay and then
what say well no no they listen so they
they listened I was like yeah yeah but
we need we listen in order to do things
in order to listen to when it's part of
our conversation to talk or to think
about something and respond
appropriately or whatever you're usually
you're not just listening unless it's
for pleasure which we don't really need
to assess anyway okay same thing with
Reed but anyway I'm an expert in English
haha put on the CV and that stevie is
filling up so
go had some issues some issues what
about memorize okay oh that also looks
very nice very slick design beautiful
colors right okay oh we've got a little
thing here all right and these you
wouldn't see all three of these scenes
or these screens at the same time but
obviously I mean the fact that I can
come and point to this does this mean I
now know culture in Chinese and if so do
I know when to use it appropriately and
can I hear it when somebody says it and
there's so many more things involved in
learning a word what are the synonyms
what are the antonyms what does it go
together with what verbs can take it is
an object right so some issues there oh
yeah the chaps lang what do you forget
what the answer to this was but it's
something like what's the bouts Trinity
calls so I'm working on my chaps lang
but again a selection type item I don't
need to remember any of these words
because they're presented to me all I
have to do is sort of organize them
which it can be useful again for
syntactic knowledge things like that but
it's not exactly construct validity
because that's not how we actually talk
and communicate okay here I was like
what's even being learned or tested if
you know the word if you just know the
word for wine well it's process of
elimination none of those other things
have wine in them so you're testing wine
are you testing this vaudreuil this
would I mean what you know or even if
somebody said that is a possible logical
response oh you speak French very well
well sure I could think of a logical
situation where that would be is it a
response is a translation what is it
right kind of a problem okay it's not
all bad though this actually was pretty
nice so this was you listen and then you
tap the translation for what you heard
which still not 100% authentic but we're
getting there we're getting okay and do
a lingo this I kind of liked so duolingo
would give me the sentence that oh yes
give me the sentence that I would read
mmm construct validity and then i would
say it in spanish and apparently I did
it very well I was very pleased with
myself right but again very very short
sentences not contextualized a bit of an
issue but we're getting there that's a
little bit better okay to review both
apps essentially flashcards we've had
flashcards for a long time
ally quizlet is basically flashcards
which does have its uses I'm not saying
that like don't use it it sucks it's
awesome and it does have its uses but I
think we can do more so they focus on
language knowledge very discreet things
what are translations right matching
things instead of language use okay
their claims of teaching oh yeah this is
teaching and this is a language right a
bit misleading okay limited basic
language uses these could be done better
that's what I'm gonna pivot you okay say
what I'm going to get to the cathedral
factory right little Frankie a calm love
it okay that was the one with Pucci I
think anyone doesn't okay um so they're
essentially Cathedral approaches to
language learning apps this reference is
the cathedral versus bazaars which yeah
in essence it's do we focus on building
out a lot of features for something
that's really really complex or do we
kind of just build one little feature
maybe in its open source so we just kind
of ship it when it's ready and it
doesn't necessarily depend on
connections to all these other
dependencies and things like that yeah
or that's how I read it at least I mean
I didn't know JavaScript earlier during
Joe's presentation so I could be
completely wrong okay for the
metaphorical purposes Ferraris really
expensive things right now do a lingo it
is free but how long did it take people
to create that I'm assuming a lot of
hours okay what we need is latas is
really cheap Russian cars right very
cheap dumb things and I'll get to why
they can be dumb because we're gonna
tree makes them a metaphor I don't know
what do you think Obama oh cool i'm
making metaphors great again so yeah
they try to do everything like we will
teach you a language it's like well
there's actually a lot of things
involved in teaching a language so it's
a bit the claims are a bit overstated
from a psycho metrics or assessment
perspective they do very little okay or
definitely not as big as they claim it's
mostly not knowledge comprehension based
over-engineered electronic versions of
flash cards right and classrooms and
what I mean when I say classrooms is
another big thing in ed tech now is not
just the MOOCs but the sort of like Oh
we'll go into either
chat room or a forum or something and
the students will interact and they will
learn language but it's like you're just
reproducing the classroom when it takes
humans interacting with humans right so
that's good but can we move past that
right we've had that for a while okay so
we need pieces that are smaller more
module things that can be combined many
people working on their own small piece
this is sort of my vision of the future
I'll elaborate in a little bit we can
achieve complex things not necessarily
teaching an entire language that's
probably a bit beyond the scope of what
I'm thinking immediately but say for
example writing a research essay in
English by accomplishing and putting
together many many very small things and
many tasks can be decomposed into
smaller subtest right so yeah what a
students need to do in order to write a
research essay in English they don't
need to select little drop down buttons
on a screen no it's much more coffee yet
so let's take a look I choose relevant
sources take notes on the relevant
sections of the relevant sources choose
which section from the sources to
combine as evidence you don't want all
of them maybe they're not all relevant
right paraphrase the combinations
because of course you don't want to
plagiarize synthesize the common element
of each relevant section so you could
put together in one paraphrase
vocabulary considerations right tone
formality take notes on citation
information so you can include it later
we haven't even started writing yet
these are very very very complex tests
so they can be decomposed into a number
of very very small tasks and that's what
I'm going to focus on his academic
writing okay so this is now this is not
going to be all academic stuff but this
is what I'm talking about so oh look at
those colors oh so amazing right there's
four of them I don't know maybe five
okay so here this is all this does is it
returns actual tweets okay authentic
language so we do have content validity
and it is selection items okay okay
that's fair but you're selecting which
articles to put in the spaces okay very
very difficult thing to do in English is
to choose the correct article we're
saying a and n da okay very and very
very discreet task very small task okay
similar thing but taken from reddit so
here we have the writing prompts from
the subreddit and
click on one I don't know and it gives
you something like this now this is a
bit more contextualized so a bit more
authentic but still their selection
items so I wasn't I wasn't very very
happy with that oh the live demo oh no
live demo not finished well it is
finished but I didn't want to focus on
it because I thought that would take too
much time so let me just kind of show
you here right so here's same thing
we've got the writing the writing
prompts from reddit ah now here you do
know where the articles need to be put
back in right the little asterisk so it
is still sort of a selection activity
right but what if we don't have those
and we make it a supply activity now
what I'm arguing is this looks
fundamentally 100% authentic from the
point of view of the student when they
are writing their own academic essays
they don't necessarily know where the
problems are or what the problems are so
they need to attune themselves they need
to become sensitive to looking for the
markers that could tell them maybe
there's a problem and the markers
generally tend to be the singular
countable nouns they tend to cluster
around those right so what else could we
do how about auto generating materials
all that stuff auto generated the code
just kind of grabs it from reddit and
sort of auto generate sit right really
really simple stuff so fiction that's
what I did right full text research
articles are difficult to get but
abstracts I'm getting those with archive
or are heave or whatever you want to say
and those are those are easy to get and
kind of manipulate right to sort of
simulate writing a research abstract
because that's what PhD students have to
learn how to do right and news articles
API is really common actually both of
those their terms of service were not
good so I ended up using BBC business
but very easy to get and then manipulate
well I mean we're not talking about like
mapreduce and stuff like that this is
taking strings taking out one little
match and then you know manipulating
very very simple stuff right so the
problem is requiring a teacher or
anybody even the student to create
materials it takes time and usually
money right so if you're relying on that
you can't scale but for academic reading
activities
we could I don't know highlight tenses
by section very very easy to do right
not computationally or technically
difficult you could highlight tone
stance that's what Liam and I did with
the fields or something it's just is it
positive or is it negative and how
positive how- students need to be
attuned to this when they're writing
research articles research essays
because it can't affect the meaning okay
and highlight features I don't know
anything so for example if the student
is using because to show a
cause-and-effect relationship every
single time even though that is not a
grammatical issue and does not affect
meaning instructors will grade down for
that say oh this style it I just feels
bad so even stylistic issues we could
kind of target right maybe suggest
instead it because how about in order to
or for the purpose of her you know
whatever okay so yeah super super easy I
know they're easy because I know how to
do right so I know there's a practicing
revision you like that British spelling
of practicing Oh know your audience know
your audience man so strip articles
that's what I did change verb forms I
mean you just find the modal and the
Venge change it super easy right
highlight know it's like noun phrases
right how r do those look they're not
difficult right we're not talking about
deep text analysis or machine learning
or any of that right you say oh no
that's boring I don't care about text
rings let's do some cool stuff speaking
practice ah here's where it gets
exciting so accelerometers in your
phones have a predicted or sort of a
sensitive 2.1 millimeters I think that's
the rating they can sort of tell heart
beats so I'm wondering if you put it to
your throat can they predict a voiced
and unvoiced consonants I always use
this with my students you can touch the
top of your head too when you say like a
bee sound like a buh buh buh buh buh
vibrates when you say a piece sound Papa
Papa doesn't vibrate right so students
especially some of the I don't remember
where they were from but had really big
problems I know the Arabic students
traditionally have problems with the
peas and the bees right so they can
stand there all day and I say no you're
not doing it right no you're not doing
you're not doing it right but that's not
fundamentally helping them they need
some sort of visualization some feedback
where one they don't need my interaction
they can do it themselves anywhere they
want and two it's a bit more reliable
right instead of me saying no no no no I
don't mean that's not
but right a teacher reply user audio to
artificially stretch pitch contours so
this is a lot of time students have
trouble when they sort of speak in
monotone voices because where they're
from this signals politeness and respect
and everything but if you're giving a
talk like this it could be perceived as
maybe you're not interested you're bored
you don't want to be giving the talk so
these sort of functions of languages
right why are you talking like that it's
something's weird i don't know so some
students do want to work on this they do
need to work on this so I don't know I'm
kind of working on something like that
working on measuring it about yeah in
volume Peaks right so another thing with
with stress is it's sort of higher and
longer and louder so can we measure that
and if we can measure it we can have the
system give feedback on whether the
student is predicting the expected
patterns okay speaks week revolution as
an idea i had the Koreans would be
really into it where you kind of move
with like a Fitbit or something like a
dance dance revolution anyway some kind
of fun okay ah yours working its way out
there oh my god visual feedback based on
a mouthpiece right amount sort of based
on the place in articulation when you're
making the sounds right so the elves
right we call it a lateral approximate
because your tongue is touching here the
air goes around whereas an R is a
central approximate your tongue touches
on the side the air goes through the
middle that's very difficult for the
student to see right it's like no I'm
doing it rrrm I can't what and so if
they can't see it in me and they can't
see it in themselves more how are they
going to get feedback right so if we had
tongue position do some sort of device
piped to a visual display on a phone
they could get real time feedback
anytime instantly right an amount
laryngeal motion a neck piece I don't
even know if this would work it's kind
of an idea I had for sort of tones right
higher tones is like aa sort of your
Adam's apple goes up and down huh does
anyone want to hack on this I'd be super
keen to do that whatever that'd be
awesome things we are not trying to do
we're not doing speech recognition no
that's what I mean I don't know how to
do that Google's working on it and
that's awesome semantic analysis
Google's working on it let them do it
communicatively with layers or loot
losers what yeah man users right so like
pass the Turing test we're not i'm not
trying to do that right we don't need
super sophisticated apps we need very
very simple apps because the job of
teachers is not super sophisticated we
mostly just point at things right either
we're pointing at something the student
is reading like a material like look at
this look at this form here did you
notice this why is this being used or we
point at something the student has
produced why did you use this look here
does this have an article doesn't need
an article look here look here right
we're just pointing like I don't do
anything the students do everything so
if we can have a system do that for them
they don't need me anymore right and
it's way more scalable possibly she use
nobody's going to pay to develop that
and nobody even knows if it works
because I haven't invented it yet so we
haven't doesn't it across disciplinary
or understanding coding and language
assessment the issue is that from the
from the technical side I almost feel
like this stuff is too simple and it's
not like interesting for anybody and I
get that I definitely get that and
definitely there isn't really a business
case for like this super super simple
stuff right an ecosystem maybe but not
not one at a time and from the teacher
side I mean what I've seen like the
cutting edge of technology and learning
is let's make a powerpoint presentation
and then make it a video and then put it
on YouTube right and I'm like yeah we
can do more we can do more right so I
kind of know how to do this it's gonna
take me a long time by myself if anybody
wants to hack on something with me
that'd be super awesome I got business
cards right are you do a little thing
right cool so what's the end game right
we change the whole paradigm right we're
gonna change everything every maybe not
everything right we're going to move it
in the hands of users get them automated
real-time scalable feedback we're going
to make auto generate these materials
right obviously there will always be a
place for teachers but we can also do
things that maybe don't demand the time
of teachers so much and provide
instantaneous feedback okay like boom
boom boom okay will it work I have no
idea I don't know I'm going to find out
though because I'll tell you what what
I'm not doing I'm not going to wait
around and
keep this like business as usual it's
like ads we can do better we could
definitely do better and yeah I don't
know if any of this is gonna because
I've again I I need to get the ideas out
and show people and then maybe people
will kind of buy into it maybe I don't
know it might it may feel Titanic Lee
but yeah you know duolingo memorize
their just spokes in a wheel right
Lannister stark Baratheon I'm not gonna
stop the wheel I'm gonna break the wheel
their cars right take that Cal moro take
that Khal Drogo spoiler alert so anyway
yeah we're gonna change the whole thing
so that's it no code presentations means
don't ask me about code ask Joe about
code anything else is fair game that's
it
