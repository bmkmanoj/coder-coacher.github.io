that was basically just sharing a little
tip on console logging in arrow
functions and this week I'm just gonna
share with you another quick tip with
console logging because I love it
I think I might try make this a regular
like Simon's snippets feature I think so
I'm running here the Financial Times
article page locally and when developing
locally it's really annoying
when you get tons and tons of logs and
you can't see your thing that you wanted
so I've really as with anyone you've
probably done this maybe can people see
that yeah a few lines console.log
something or maybe this few new lines
yes good so what I'm going to do is pro
refresh this like there's loads and
loads of crap right that's that's being
logged out to the to the console but
really the only thing that I care about
is I want to know what the main image
property of this content is so I can do
a console log or this is why you
shouldn't oh my god I should have
learned my lesson last time content dot
main image nice about that right image
mmm I'm not convinced and so it's gonna
be starts I look that and i refresh this
right now where on earth is that main
image property that I just can't so
logged I saw at the same time you said
that Dan it so what I am found out
recently it was that you can add colors
to your console logs so I have little
snippets in I use vs code I used to use
at them so I've got little snippets to
log out these properties in colors so
I'll just uncomment these I'll call it
that one out again save that and so now
when I'm going through these at some
point there are some colors can yeah you
can see them so I've got I spent to be
cyan my theme to look me weird sorry and
green red and yellow
I've got there this is also Magento and
a couple of others and what I'm doing
there is I'm adding these uh a small one
it's basically your console logging the
stuff in the middle of these two comers
and these are and see colors which color
console stuff I might be wrong there but
something like that and the 31 32 33 34
35 36 are the different colors they are
red green yellow blue magenta and cyan
I did write all of this up in a little
gist here which I should probably update
because I actually changed some stuff
which show you what those are and
explains a little bit more about it it
also has the snippets for Adam and vs
code here if you want to use them it's
really handy you don't have to I mean I
like it you don't maybe like maybe you
don't that's it thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
