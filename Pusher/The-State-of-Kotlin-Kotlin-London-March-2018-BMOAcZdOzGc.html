pusher as a developer evangelist and
today I would like to present you the
state of Kotlin precisely I'm gonna
present you the results of a survey that
I've been running for the past three
months that a bunch of you probably saw
or even filled in actually let's do a
show of hands who filled in the state of
Coughlin survey about half that's good
thank you everyone who who contributed
who took their time to do it so yeah
we'll be looking at where we are at the
moment in the Coughlin ecosystem and
yeah so I work at the pusher which is
where we're hosting you today and Kotlin
is used for all new Android SDK
development here that's in products such
as chat kit push notifications and feeds
I played quite a large part to put it in
there as the original Android enthusiast
so yeah my background is Android
development I moved into SDK development
and currently I'm doing surveys jokes
aside I love Kotlin Kotlin is I think
it's it's a great language and more and
more developers I spoke to they
basically shared the opinion that it
makes us happy I don't know why but it
does so yeah with this survey I wanted
to learn I wanted us to learn about the
Kotlin ecosystem because no one's ever
done it so we didn't really have a
comprehensive view of what the ecosystem
is I also want to produce something that
can be used to promote Kotlin as a
language that can be used by the
community so something that you can take
to your team and try to convince them
that cotton is maybe the way to go
if you're doing Android applications if
you're doing native applications if
you're doing any web stuff anything and
yeah give back to the community
My dear wish was that we get a thousand
responses to the to the to the survey so
yeah start in December start putting the
questions together with a lot of help
from the community I've gone through
several iterations to kind of put the
survey into the shape that was then
released to the public and mid-january
to mid March it was it was live it was
running we're doing some promotion to
get more and more people involved we
even offered a prize which was a trip to
coughlin Kampf the premier conference
for Coughlin's developers this year is
gonna be in October in Amsterdam and the
prize was that essentially trip to
Amsterdam with flights hotel and and
ticket to the conference and we did a
prize draw at the end was completely
random and anyone who filled in the
survey after email and wasn't a pusher
employee or their close family member is
pretty much legible to to win it and it
was won by a person called nicolayevitch
from Croatia so if you're watching a
Nicola congratulations again
it wasn't a flowers awesome so let's
let's go on so I was hoping for a
thousand responses we got almost three
thousand which is scary and also super
exciting it's also ten percent off state
of j/s which is probably the one of the
biggest state off kind of surveys going
out there thirty three percent of people
who landed on the survey actually
completed it which my fellow marketeers
also tell me it's it's a quite a good
ratio and on average they took thirteen
minutes and 14 seconds of their time to
complete it doing some maths it also
means that people have spent twenty five
days filling the survey so yeah thank
you so much the categories we surveyed
we're how cuddling is being used how
people learn Coughlin's what are some of
the favorite features and how they are
used and also Coughlin's zeitgeist which
was a experiment I did to kind of grab
more open-ended questions open-ended
answers to questions and lastly I
checked about demographics so yeah
without further ado I would like to
present you the state of Coughlin's in
early 2018 let's look at the usage first
mmm
58% of people currently use Coughlin's
on a project it's quite remarkable
people who don't use it currently on a
project they've maybe used it for
learning or playing around that's like
17% of those and 13% of surveyed people
say they have no plans and they haven't
used it so far among the rest there are
people who plan to start using it or who
use it in past or who
only evaluated Kotlin as a potential
language to make their software in
people use Coughlin's in mostly in both
work and personal projects out of the
people who use it on a project anyway so
that's 66 percent of people surveyed
apart from that there are about 18
percent each only doing work or side
projects and out of curiosity how many
of you are Android developers that's
about right
a lot of hands went up because according
to survey 80% of people use Scotland to
build Android applications it doesn't
surprise me at all because it's very
popular in Android and the ecosystem has
been stuck with a quite a old version of
Java for a very long time so yeah out of
the work projects and to be honest it's
this graph is pretty much the same for
side projects 80% use it for Android
development and about 30 31 % each use
it for also server-side or SDK
development there's a few others who use
it for other type of things and yeah
surprisingly the side projects they
don't really defer like it's pretty much
the same distribution here among other
things people use it for scripting and
obviously also experiments and just
learning and playing around and I was
also surprised to see data signs there
people several people have mentioned
that they use Kotlin to do some data
sciences things which is pretty cool
next thing that I checked was what's the
percentage of people who who have kind
of Coughlin as their projects only made
in Coughlin
so and compare that to like people who
said they use it inside projects and
people who use it in their work projects
and the distribution is as seen so 55%
use have hundred percent Coughlin
projects in their side project so
they're there like if you're doing
something on the side they're probably
smaller more experimental things and
like a lot more people who are more
comfortable just having full-on Coughlin
there versus 25% for people who have it
in their work projects which is also
quite a nice number
I guess pusher is amongst those 25% yeah
so in work projects you see 25 and then
about 20 to 15 to 20 percent in in other
kind of distribution so 75 250 percent
to 75 and so on 1.4 percent people said
that they only use cotton intest in
their work projects in their side
projects the distribution is quite
different because you see that it's
heavily skewed towards full-on Coughlin
or 75 to 100% Coughlin in android
I think the 25 percent ish is probably
xml for views yeah and a lot less people
use it for tests on android apparently
okay other programming languages because
it's usually not the only program denies
that you that you work with no surprise
here Java is massive because it's kind
of did older cousin off Kotlin anyway
and so is Swift which is the super
similar but not quite counterpart on iOS
JavaScript and node are just big so
that's why they were quite often
mentioned and lastly there was Python I
was quite surprised to see Python there
so prevalent I'm not sure whether it's
related to the data science or it's just
people who do django and flask and other
things or even scripting but yeah these
are the few most popular other
programming languages for Coughlin's
developers another interesting feature
of Kotlin is how close it is to java and
how easy it is to migrate java code to
Coughlin so we looked at how what kind
of how many people decided to do this
conversion so 87% of people migrated
some Java code to Coughlin it also means
that 13% of people didn't do that maybe
they just started out writing Coughlin
directly maybe they just created new
classes and Cortland I don't know and
yet those people who had done the
migration a vast majority use the
Wizards to convert individual classes 66
percent 56 percent of people used did
the conversion manually and 47 decided
to convert only snippets by that I mean
Android studio and IntelliJ allow you to
if you copy Java code automatically
convert that into Coughlin if you copy
it into Coughlin file which is pretty
cool
there's also 10% of brave souls who
decided to it's a good idea to convert
the entire project and 20% all of people
who done the migration decided it was a
bad idea I imagine it went something
like this
so yeah I asked about the reasons
dependencies were a big reason why the
migration didn't go as planned so as
reflection a couple of names popped up
on Android it's it's dagger it's green
Dao its realm there may be a bit some
tricks involved to getting this migrated
correctly in the early days it was also
spring and we can't just look at
technical reasons because there's also
the organizational reasons they might be
corporate policy at play too that
prevents you from convert from just
migrating to a completely new
programming language so yeah these are
quotes if you see slides like these it
means that there are direct quotes that
have taken from open-ended questions so
someone made was made to revert it due
to organizational rules or another team
took the code and they didn't want
Cortland sad on a more technical side
migration triggered a number of changes
in the Java code especially when you
have a bunch of statics and it kind of
breaks your API this is what can happen
it's also that the wizard migration does
not provide a dramatic Kotlin and it
puts a lot of null assertions which can
be considered code smells which means
that you might want to rethink this and
do some conversion manually as opposed
to using the wizard so yeah that was
usage of Kotlin moving on I decided to
look at how people decide to learn
Coughlin's what they use and when do
they learn it so what's interesting is
that this is a pretty much hockey stick
graph it started in 2011 with very very
small amounts so on
nil 0.1% of people picked it up in 2011
and exploded in mid 2017 after Google
i/o when Google obviously announced that
cotton is now officially supported
language for Android applications so 46
percent of all people surveyed said they
started using Coughlin's after Google
i/o another important spike was in 2015
I can only speculate but there was also
the time when Jake Wharton a very famous
Android developer used to work at square
now he's at Google released a white
paper originally internally at square
and then publicized it it was basically
an evaluation of Coughlin as a
programming language that Square can
pick up and it was released as a Google
Doc and it obviously exploded there was
also a bunch of talks starting in 2015
so that's probably what helped the
explosion of kosslyn and popularity hmm
so yeah reasons why people start
learning it Google support in Kotlin
officially on Android it's definitely a
big one so is JetBrains
so big companies like that big
respectable companies when people see it
that's kind of their idea to just kind
of believe and trust those companies
tooling is also important
luckily Coughlin has JetBrains behind
them which are in my opinion the best
IDE makers in the world
so tooling is there and then there's
community our already mentioned jake
wharton and there's also Christina Lee
and Antonio Leyva and a lot of others
who especially in the Android space
helped to popularize Coughlin and on the
JetBrains side there is Hadi Hariri
Svetlana Zakharova and Andre brass love
and many others who also did the same
thing one person who answered the survey
also said they were introduced to Kotlin
by their friend Leo so Leo if you're
watching
thank you you're a good person
so yeah among other quotes and reasons
why people picked it up is the
popularity of Coughlin in a short period
of time we've seen the hockey stick
graph it's really astonishing Java was
very verbose and Coughlin is just love
and happiness I guess I think that was
like Java being Java was one of the
biggest most often repeated reasons why
Kotlin is so so popular so for instance
this one it's like Java plus plus
although I don't think I don't know what
to think about this so yeah the
resources that people used to learn no
surprise Coughlin Lang dot org the
official website is almost 90% of people
use this to learn Coughlin and followed
by different talks at conferences and
resources like Kotlin cones the the most
prevalent Community Supported projects
are I would say Kotlin weekly which is a
newsletter which pushers has been
sponsoring for the last couple of months
and the Kotlin for Android developers
it's a book by Antonio Leyva it's been
around for a while he published it on
lean pop I think at first and then it's
been quite popular and then yeah
different blogs different courses I
would also like to pay attention to the
Coughlin Academy which is a publication
on medium currently it's had four point
eight percent of respondents say they
kind of picked it up from they learned
Coughlin from it but I think given that
they're producing so many great pieces
of content it's gonna be a lot more
prevalent in the following iterations so
yeah developers who learn Catalan come
from different backgrounds
mostly Java Android
unsurprisingly but also front-end
back-end desktop development other
mobile they may come from Swift maybe
maybe Swift developers decided to hate
they have a cool thing on androids as
well let's pick this up yeah three point
eight percent of people decided hey I'm
just gonna learn Coughlin from scratch
which is great I want to see what this
what this changes to in the in the
following years so yeah this was where
people come from how people learn and
what people used to learn but let's talk
about the features because it's it's got
some pretty amazing features null safety
is by far the most favorite one so
eighty percent of people say they they
love null safety this was a multiple
choice question so they could people
could say they love all of them I try to
encourage them to pick only three follow
the following null safety you've got
extension functions Java inter up in
data classes which which are favored by
sixty something percent of people then
followed by higher-order functions and
type inference about 40 ish something
and lastly you've got the newer features
like multi-platform support and
co-routines which have been introduced
in the later versions of Kotlin at 20
something percent before to be precise
among other favorite features you've got
the when key word you got the ray fide
keyword and you got sealed classes and
lambdas that popped up often during the
the comments there was also a blooper in
the original iteration of the of the
survey I must have come from the
screening of the last Jedi and then
writing the writing the questions
because I confused higher-order
functions with first order functions and
if you follow Star Wars first order is
the are the baddies of the new
trilogy so yeah bit of a blooper so yeah
if we look at the breakdown of different
function of different features of
Coughlin's 77 percent said that they've
used extension functions extensions are
you can easily add what would otherwise
have to be
static utility classes static utility
methods in Java to existing classes
they're used to reduce Android
boilerplate they're used to kind of
replace utility classes as I just
mentioned a lot of people mention
conversions so strings object things
that get from API is they just can
convert them and dsls what people say
about them we felt like going overboard
with them now trying to find happy
medium they're not the best thing but
because because they can easily be
easily be abused and overused the most
important use case is lambda parameters
for dsl style builders and for clean
code because they make the code more
readable because you can just name
different things on things like strings
integers any any given object you can
just call them different on the other
side you have cortines introduced more
recently and only 20 well not only but
29 percent of people have used them
mostly for threading and any i/o UI
based operations and also as a
replacement for our X Java rx Java is
the reactive extensions for Java it's is
the library brings us observables and
the reactive paradigm but most people on
Android mostly use it for for simplified
threading and scheduling things on
different threads so coroutines because
they're just that are probably gonna be
taking a bit of limelight from Java or X
Java in that
since there's also a bunch of people who
said they come from the C sharp
background and they've missed the async
and await keywords so they've used that
so yeah some people also say they have
used it with arrow because they use it
for four comprehensions I've got back
over there in the audience who's one of
the main contributors to arrow if you
want if having error questions please
ask him
someone said they stopped using
co-routines because they are
experimental fair enough they actually
are and someone used them fully in
production for a FinTech solution any
munzo developers here no okay
they also provide a very funny API when
used to wrap J's promises I have no idea
what this means another popular thing in
Kotlin are the non JVM features
targeting being able to target other
platforms 26% out of which 15% are
excited about coffee native so the
native compilation target for Kotlin
there's going to be possibility for
doing writing Coughlin to be executed on
iOS and native as well Coughlin jeaious
with 11% and lastly multi-platform
Coughlin with 7% of usage outside of
features I also asked about build tools
so what do people use to built Coughlin
projects no surprise here again Android
studio is with 75% clearly in the in the
lead followed by IntelliJ at 65 and
Gradle at 62 they're all used for
Android development so no surprise here
I
quite surprised and disappointed why
cobalt the native Kotlin built system is
only used by 1.1 percent of people
honestly I haven't used it so it
shouldn't surprise me that much but yeah
other tools included basil and Griffin
and also buck apparently there is
support for buck as well in for Kotlin
41 percent have used a DSL in Kotlin
prevalent is anko with 23 percent anko
is the UI declaration library for for
Android actually it's 24 percent Kotlin
Gradle the ability to write Gradle
plugins in Kotlin is another one with
about 17 percent and lastly you've got
cotton XHTML the Dom manipulation DSL
with 5.6 among the others they're mostly
homegrown DSL
because 24 percent have actually
developed a DSL themselves what for it's
mostly used for a lot of people have
mentioned Jake Wharton's again Jake is
getting boring
Jake Wharton's testing robots it's it's
a it's a blog that he wrote about nicer
testing on Android with write by writing
a DSL a lot of people write UI
declarations and custom data structures
dsls but there's so many use cases from
banks to AI to to all of that so people
have mentioned pretty much everything I
was really interested in this actually
it's you've probably seen that a lot of
libraries are replacing sees with case
so there was category which was spelled
with a k
there is inject with a k' again so I
asked like what do you think about this
do you like it dude don't most people
are indifferent but 32 percent of people
say that it should be compulsory and 10
percent of people say that KD did it two
decades ago but not not everyone is so
enthused the survey started with a
button saying comments with a k' so
someone didn't like it
classic Dylan so yeah that's enough for
features let's look at the zeitgeist
what people actually think about cotton
why do they what do they miss what do
they like 29% of people say they are
missing things in Kotlin most dearly
missed
is the ternary operator at least for the
for the server itself s a.m. for Kotlin
classes is also a big one and yeah
there's like a lot of people miss new
things all the time
syntax sugar someone missed link so must
be all the c-sharp developers out there
apparently I've heard there is actually
a alternative to link in Coughlin but I
haven't I'm not aware of it it's
interesting because a lot of people who
filled in the JetBrains survey called
Coughlin future features they asked for
collection literals and they weren't
that often mentioned in
in my survey so yeah more things that
they're missed so custom operations
support for view a single multi-platform
IDE
I think jet the IntelliJ does it for up
to an extent and there's also Swift's
guard statements so like all the i/os
transplants would be missing the guard
statements from Swift 21% of people
don't like certain features in Kotlin
they don't like companion objects
because the way it does this kind of
interacts or kind of counteract statics
in Java some people don't like it sold
public by default even though it's also
quite immutable by default someone says
it's not a dynamic language not sure
what to think about this but yeah but
yeah what is the best ones though what
people like they're like the features
they're like the null safety they like
the core routines they like the they're
like Java interoperability they also
like it's a modern programming language
again too Swift typescript and others
they like it's not a Java they're like
it's fun pun intended because functions
in Coughlin's start with a fun are
declared with the fun and platform
independence was quite often mentioned
obviously it's also a very functional
friendly programming language so that
was quite frequently mentioned - my
favorite quotes about this was it can be
read like a story I think that's just
nice and another one I smile again when
writing code that's just poetic isn't it
and the language does not get in the way
of getting a job done
it's pretty cool and my favorite one
actually yes
to combat the programming language I'm
not sure whether that means the arcade
version was better than the home console
ones but yeah
honestly if anyone has any ideas I'd
like to learn what what that meant so
yeah that's the Kotlin zeitgeist and
lastly we've got the demographics we
learned that Kotlin airs live everywhere
on earth that is we haven't detected
anyone coming in from outer space yet
most of the surveyed people are employed
or in being students but there is also
others like CEO startup founders interns
all sorts how long have people been
working as developers I think this is a
pretty standard distribution honestly I
will when we release the report we're
gonna compare this with the Stack
Overflow one just to see how how it is
all stacks against each other number of
people in your organization has there is
a big spike with 10 to 50 people and
quite a large spike with the freelance
but nothing nothing scary there is quite
a uniform distribution across the other
other size of companies so imagine the
10 to 50 people are like small agencies
startups that are quite eager to try out
new things quite flexible to move move
quickly and how many developers are in
the organization's a big spike at 2 to 5
developers it probably means Android
themes working on Kotlin that's my my
hunch because that's kind of the size of
a Android team 3.7 percent of people
have more than 50 coffee and developers
in their wards so Google JetBrains the
likes
sector's no surprise here Tech is Dec is
leading the charge and pretty uniform
distribution unless you're working in
government or insurance so yeah that was
that was a demographics and I would like
to ask you what do you think about the
future of Kotlin and the future of state
of Kotlin if you have any questions that
you would like to see asked and the
future iterations because there will be
more what would they be
get in touch please and let me know and
we can make this a great experience and
use this to kind of just grow the
Coughlin community further that was
state of Cortland and I am zan Markin
