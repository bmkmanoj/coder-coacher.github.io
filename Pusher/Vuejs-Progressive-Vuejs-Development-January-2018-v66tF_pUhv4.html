today mmm and special thanks to up for
organizing this Vienna we had a few
cheer sweetheart
that's how it's called but you know
friends we like to call it UNH yes
that's why I've have written down the
slides today mmm
I think you know what we mean by that my
talk will be split into two parts on
part 1 I will cover the basic UGS
features and in part 2 we'll have a look
at the comic component-based
architecture provided by Fuji s so if
you want to get started with futures
let's ask the audience have you already
worked with futures and how advanced was
your usage of the framework so who has
already seen a hello world okay pretty
much everyone and who is it in
production not so many who created a app
for private purposes or something like
that okay
so there are some advanced users here
and other some users here who call
themselves beginners and want to know
how to get started with you Cheers
okay so this talk is for you I will
really cover the basics of you chairs
and how you get started into app
development by starting with this hello
world seen on the screen so and in in
this code we can see the most important
concept of futures already which is data
binding view takes data from our data
object and binds it to our application
this is the most important feature of
futures I would say and like nobody else
before we have the idea of creating a
to-do application I think it's very rich
you know
and we do it almost life and stage so
started from the hello world we saw
earlier we created to do application and
we start by creating items and rendering
them as a list so this is another
important feature of futures we can use
v4 to end our items in a list another
thing we see here is event binding so we
can use key up enter to bind the enter
key of the input field to our callback
at item and also we can use at click
event on our button to bind it to our
event and we also have two-way binding
to a from our input element to the
variable new item which means it doesn't
already bind it from the applications
data object to the view it also binds it
from the input element to our data
object so it's both directions why is it
marked okay
if we want this applications we see here
we get this we get a list of items we
can add items and it's almost like a
tool to do application but actually
that's nice but we also want to make our
mark items as done and we can do this by
first adding component very second
property done to our items which we can
use in the view so if the item is done
we render it as stripe and if not we can
direct normally so this is another
important concept conditional rendering
we can use if-else inside the template
yeah I see your port I've
you already know the most important
concepts we can add items here and it
goes on so now we get fancy and add some
more advanced features we can use style
and class binding unlike this
so in this Bacchus bar we define the
width of the bar by calculating how many
items are already completed and that's
another interesting thing we can use
computers to dynamically calculate how
many items are already completed
computed power that's right and if you
look at this example it's already more
fancy we can also use the check box to
toggle the to do state and we can remove
and add items dynamically and I think
you recognize the progress bar which
updates automatically so these are the
basic features of futures
let's sum it up we have data binding
we have two-way data binding by the user
free model we know how to win the lists
and we know how to bind events by using
EFT click and death Kia and also we know
about style and class to bind style and
class properties to our dom elements so
we started from a very basic hello world
application and built it into some kind
of small application just by adding more
and more features to it but if we go go
on this way it might end up into a big
huge pile of application with more
spaghetti code and so we should think
about structuring our code and this is
where we go to part two
where we have a look at their
component-based architecture if we take
the code for my first example we can
split it into three parts the CSS the
HTML and the JavaScript so by structural
code we could just put down into three
separate files it would be more
structured than it is now into one file
but if we look at it differently we
could split it into a progress component
which was the bar we saw earlier we
could define a to-do item which we
render in a list we could also packed
the add item component the input field
and the button into one component and we
have all we have a application around it
that backs it all together so if we
visualize it on a tree it could looked
at this we have all smart components
starting from the app component we have
the bogus to-do item and edit them in a
tree like structure similar to the Dom
as we know it and the bogus bar is just
its only purpose is displaying the
progress bar that to-do item displays
and changes to to-do items and the added
component is responsible for creating
new items and vue.js offers us a very
powerful feature by single file
components we can put any component or
feature we want into one signifier
component so what are they good for we
can create small and reusable components
we have the HTML and CSS and JavaScript
of each component individually come
combined into one file we also have
scoped CSS because in the other example
we only had one global stylesheet
and that's maybe a bad thing but we need
a compiler to pack it all together which
in Alice terms enables us to use eco
script six typescript SPSS or Aris so it
can be good or bad
let's have a look at file structure we
have very small index.html we have app
dot view file and our components are in
two separate few files and we have a
main J's file for the entry pen entry
point for web pack for our compiler but
you can also use another one the
index.html file is very small we just
give container with tidy-up and linked
compiled JavaScript file and you know
main.js file using ActionScript 6 I only
define route instance of a few GS model
which loads dieppe dot view file in our
app dot view file we now get started by
importing components so the components
we create get imported we register them
as components so we can use them in the
HTML like ordinary HTML text and now
this gets more structured because in our
app we only have those three files and
it's much more smaller than what we saw
before and another important thing is by
using components we need to best pass
down properties which is looks like this
so by passing down items property the
progress bar can use the items in its
own component
the doodoo item looks as follows and
here we see how to define properties as
we saw before the to-do item gets the
item property and by decorating it here
we can use it as it was in our own data
property so we can display the item in
our template in the progress bar we get
the items and we can calculate all the
stuff as we did before but now it's
combined into one component and not in
our routes application and we also get
scoped CSS which means by adding this
keyword the CSS styles we define here
are only only applied to the elements in
this template so if you have another
class progress somewhere else in every
application the Styles defined in here
won't apply to them which is very handy
if you got last names you don't have to
define unicron's for the new item
component is very small and
straightforward here we have own data
property for private data so this data
is only used by this component which is
handy in this place because this new
item is mapped to the input field and we
pass it to we use it to create a new
item and we set the value afterwards so
this property isn't used somewhere else
in the application and we emit events we
can emit custom events like this add
item event in this case to tell the
parent component that this event
occurred and this is how
components communicate with each other
in
component-based architecture the parents
based on properties and the child's emit
events this is basically only from
parent to direct child but it works in
the tree also so Dana gets passed down
and emits get events get emitted upwards
so in the talk I told you that we are
progressively advancing our application
and if we go back to the application
code I showed earlier we can spot a
thing which is not that good in terms of
component architecture because we have
already listed at items methods in the
app itself so this could be packed into
a component as well so that's how what
we do we could change our tree we saw
earlier by adding another component to
do list which combines you to do add
item and to add item component and this
methods we can apply every time by our
application so it it actually close with
us the new app that view looks less
follows we only have two bogus bar and
newly introduced to do list component
and we remove the new new items in the
two items and in the new to do list
component we render the list and add new
items of component and list manipulation
is only handled by this component and
the rest of the application don't have
to know about it because it does the
rest of duplication doesn't have to care
about it so starting from our world
hello world application we developed it
into a small application and now we
further
mmm improved it into a structured
component application and that's how you
can use few GS for component-based
architecture and we can incrementally
improve our application as it goes with
us Thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
