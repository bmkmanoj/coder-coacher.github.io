he already gave away half of the
information about me i work as a
developer advocate for progress if any
of you is on twitter you can follow me
i'm Savita
which is basically the first four
letters of my first name and last name
easy to remember so I just want to start
with the first thing just for any of you
that doesn't know what's native script
is basically are no persons for open
source framework that allows you to
build mobile applications using
javascript and you can use angular you
can use view or you can use just plain
JavaScript or type touch script and then
as a result you get a mobile application
with native UI okay so that's pretty
much all you have to remember and yeah
it works for iOS and Android okay so the
goal for today of my talk is how do we
achieve this scenario where we can have
one project that gives us Android gives
us iOS and a web application okay so for
me the secret sauce is this combination
of using native script and angular as
one thing so native script gives us
access to Iowa's and Android development
and angular itself gives us basically
ability to build web applications okay
but also angular gives us like code
sharing friendly architecture that
allows us to actually achieve this goal
so let's kind of have a look at some of
the items of angular so I'm not sure if
all of these familiar with it so one of
the things this is the data binding
mechanism in angular right it's just
basically the syntax that we used to
communicate between your template which
is what you see like on a page and the
data inside your component or any
actions that are within a component so
for example we have a set of property
bindings that allows us to basically
hide away the communication between the
Dom and your angular component so this
is how we actually use a property
binding to display a value and a passing
to the DOM and then also there is a set
of event bindings so if if you click on
an item or
I don't know slide or do any of the
other events and then you basically can
use the brackets to call a specific
function and then with this one which is
called by us a banana in the box which
is how you actually do two-way binding
so that's a combination of the property
binding in event bind and the really
cool thing is that is just basically a
standard that works pretty well for you
and you don't even have to think about
what really happens on the Dom side okay
and then the other thing is actually how
the render is structured in angular so
we have our component our template and
the render has a set of functions this
is not the full list but there's a bunch
of them and then basically the template
and component they're connected with
will be children Priestly and they talk
to the renderer okay so in the case of
let's say we want to create an element
angular will hide this away from us or
take care of it for us so when when we
try to create a component the render
will go and then execute a specific
command on Dom to create that HTML
component for us and then return that
element to us in angular so that we
always kind of work with the element and
then automatically as a result we will
get something in a web browser right and
then obviously the renderer implements
all those functions for pretty much all
type of components so that's how it's
done for the web out-of-the-box but this
was actually the opportunity for us as a
native script team to kind of say like
wait a moment what if we take this
renderer and then just replace it with
native with our own render so at the
time when they angular what some people
call angular 2 came out we kind of said
like this is actually a perfect match
for us so we already had a renderer that
was working on iOS and Android we just
basically had to do put it and make it
work with these functions so in this
case we basically found a way that we
could implement create element that
would perform something on the mobile UI
layer and then this would return a
native element and then as a result we
could get a mobile application so the
whole thing
like okay so all that templates and
property binding and event binding
that's available to us right now out of
the box we just had to take care of the
render plus a couple of other things but
this is this is what it is in a nutshell
so we pretty much look at this scenario
this is a component in angular right so
I called my component for the lack of a
better name and the component has my
name and my Twitter handle okay also the
component has a function say hello so if
I call it with anybody's name then
basically will say hi
anybody okay so this is my component and
then property binding for a web I could
use for example double moo-stache to
bind the name and Twitter to display
those values but also when somebody
clicks on the button I will call they
say hello and say hello web right so
this is how I do on a web application in
native script I could use pretty much
the same thing so the difference is here
is that we use different HTML tags
however in that case for example when
you have the first label I can bind to
the text property and then I can print
the name value again to Twitter value
and then when I have a button instead of
click I'm actually binding to a top
event but I'm also calling say hello
mobile and you see like the important
actually parties like let's just compare
compare this part binding to the event
with just around the brackets and my
calling function this is just a
difference is the name of the event but
the syntax and the way we achieve that
is exactly the same same way and then
another thing is I only have really just
one component implementation because it
works for both approaches which is the
beauty of it the next thing that is very
important for the culturing story is
dependency injection so it's basically
depends the injection is an ability to
take a certain type of service and then
rather than passing like you inside your
component say hey I want to create this
service so that they can do so and so
you can actually do it at the root of
your project so whenever you want to get
that service you're like angular engine
by itself already knows like oh yeah we
have that how about I give it to you and
I now explain why it is important
this is this moment when I want to make
some sort of HTTP calls either on a web
application or a mobile application in
order to call some web service to let's
say get a list of cities right that you
guys might might want to visit or
countries that you visited right and the
problem is that the syntax of the API
for HTTP on mobile is different to the
one on the web but in reality we should
be calling exactly you know the same
functions to let's say get a list of
countries or goodness or countries
visited and dates etc whatever dates so
what we can use that depends injection
for is basically when we start a web
application passing the HTTP module from
web and when we do it for native script
we do it we pass in the other one so
I'll show you a quick example so in
angular there's the concept of ng
modules so those are responsible for
managing the resources for your module
your component so in the case of a web
application we will pass the HTTP client
module and then we passing in imports so
that my web application knows where is
the module that can perform the HTTP
calls the web way and does the client
for native script we actually just have
native script native script HTTP client
module so underneath it performs the
operation in slightly different ways but
it exposes exactly the same API so if I
have so I can use basically these two
HTTP modules and then in my actual
application when I have my service that
can take care of the data what I do is I
am just importing HTTP client from
angular common HTTP and this is the same
client for both web and mobile it
implements the same API and then in my
constructor you see I'm using dependency
injection so in here I'm saying
private HTTP HTTP client so here's the
moment where angular goes okay so you
want the HTTP client and if I'm in a web
project it would give me the native
script HTTP client module if I'm sorry
the HTTP client module if I'm in the
native the project you will give me the
native script one right so and but me as
a developer
that works on this specific service I
don't really care right and then as a
result if I have a function that calls
get data I can actually just call this
dot HTTP don't get and I and I don't
worry whether this is gonna work with
native script or web or whichever
approach we taking all the time so this
is very very powerful because I can
really isolate myself of what is the the
target at the moment when I'm writing
the service cool so let's get into the
actual code sharing and what are the
sort of the approaches this this few
approaches but I want to talk to you
about one specific approach and that's
basically I call the mono repo or the
shared project structure so the mono
repo project is basically where you have
your web and mobile files in one place
okay so in this case for example if you
know angular you have a bunch of pipe
services directive night navigation and
so all the white boxes are the shared
ones the blue is the native script the
red is web okay and the idea is that we
would have all those for example the
data services that can pass the data for
us or allows us to work with the HTTP
you will be completely shared we could
also share such variables if you want to
manage the themes for our web and mobile
applications but then we would actually
have two separate CSS for web or mobile
then our components so the type of class
this is where our business logic of the
a pair of the component set however the
HTML code will be split into two
separate files so have a web HTML and a
native HTML and then obviously with
modules the modules they can combine a
bunch of components underneath the
module also can manage navigation etc so
what component and what navigation you
use within the modules that they all
share it is pretty much the same code
but then ng module for each of those
modules will be a separate file and then
once we have this project structure like
this what we need is some sort of build
process that allows us to take this and
then convert it into applications so the
build process if we try to build a web
application
should be able to take all the white and
red boxes and then run lets angular CLI
to build a application for us or if you
want to build a mobile application take
white and blue boxes and give us a
native scrip application that's kind of
the approach we going for so that was
pretty much in theory and so how do we
do it in practice so one of the
approaches which is pretty popular at
the moment a there's this seed project
that is available on github that you can
just clone and use it as a basis for
your project and that's done by the guys
from team miles - it's called angular
native seed
I recommend check it out and hour later
do a demo that is based on this specific
project and the way this specific
project works is if you have your
project inside the mono repo project
over there to build a web application is
business as usual you just call ng serve
and then this will trigger angular CLI
tools and would will give you a web
application if you want to build a
mobile application using this mono repo
project then in this case we're gonna
call NPM run iOS or NPM run Android and
this will work in two steps
so the first step it runs gulp and God
basically goes like oh let me find all
the blue boxes and and convert them into
white boxes so it kind of recreates the
project like the native script project
ignoring all the red boxes okay and once
we have the next project the second step
is this NPM Ramkumar
script so if we have our component so
for our target class that is that is
shared we'll have for example name dot
component of TS and then we have two
HTML files so the web one will be named
at component dot HTML the native script
one who have the dot TNS dot HTML so
this dot TNA's is how we actually
separate web from mobile if you're not
styling and have two different CSS files
then you have let say sass file for web
and then dot Enis let's ask for mobile
and to be honest if you added additional
file which would be called name that
component dot TNS tortillas there then
you could even split this to you
in two separate there might be a case
where you might need that but that's
kind of like the idea I'll see this kind
of leads you to a place where you have
to create a lot of files to do that so I
created a small tool that you can use
with native script CLI so it's an
extension so if you call instantaneously
Bangalore CLI this will allow you to
generate already shared component or
generate shared modules so you generate
all those files and and kind of put like
the hello world pieces in there so
they're pretty much ready for you to go
so it does pretty much what angular CLI
does for you and that works specifically
for the tea master project there's also
some challenges that you need to look
into when you do coach sharing but it's
because there's a lot of problems so the
first time I gave this talk that was
like an hour and a half session so this
is really trimmed down version of it so
one of the big challenges is kind of how
do you deal with different versions of
api's so I wanted to do to create a
comeback I want to create a demo project
that was using angular sorry that was
using firebase and then on web I was
using angular fire two for native script
there's a native a firebase plugin and
in theory all sounded pretty easy rights
like okay firebase is easy I've done it
on web before I've done your native
script the things I forgot some small
small small differences in the different
that the way the API is structured here
and there so the moment I started trying
to implement those like the guys that
implemented these two libraries had
completely different concepts of how
they should be done so angular fire was
done with observables the native one was
done with with what was it with just
basically listeners so the whole
architecture was complete different so a
solution to that one of the solutions to
these kind of problems is when you have
two different api's you could for
example create a common service
abstraction so for example if you're
looking on the plugin that has
20 different commands but you only need
two of them to put them in your services
so what you can do is actually create
two versions of your service so let's
say you have your data dot service dot
TS and data dot service dot TN s dot TS
write these two files and then inside
those you would implement the same logic
twice but calling the these two
different api's however you'd expose
them under one common interface so
they'll both have exactly the same type
of commands so that your components
could just call directly those services
it's not super a reusable because you
always be very specific to your angular
services that you're using for that
application the other approach which are
actually took in my project is when you
when you can do an abstraction on top of
your plugins not services but plugins so
in this case you have both your plugins
and then you create like a web plug-in
wrapper and a name skip plug-in wrapper
which they interfere like provide the
same common interface right so if you
have like 20 different functions in each
of those you basically make sure that
they both return the same thing and
those wrappers take care of the
differences so what I did in my case is
basically I took all the listeners and I
converted them into observables it's
pretty simple stuff as well
and then as a result you can just create
one data service that uses dot use your
your wrappers and then that communicates
with your components and then
additionally I can actually take these
wrappers and drop into any other project
that I use code sharing with firebase so
I'm gonna do a quick demo so let's see
how it works so you can also check it
like it's on my github so at Saboteur
slash pet browse so it's a pretty
serious application so before I even
show you the code I'm gonna just run it
so I'm gonna run the web application and
I'm gonna run the native script one
so npm run iOS ok
so the web app is about to come up why
is not coming up yet oh yeah by the way
I am NOT a designer so do not oh come on
I mean give me some credit
right no no seriously I can see that the
thing is that I actually used angular
material so it is not a complete
disaster so it's kind of decent ish so
this demo project is based on in in the
u.s. they have this service called pet
finder so all the shelters in the US
they advertise the pets that they have
and then you can use pet finder API to
find animals that you would want to
adopt so there's like a bunch of animals
so basically on my home page I have all
my favorite animals that I selected and
somebody already adopted Oasis
interesting alright let's let's make a
search so I can go let's say in Boston
and then I can search for a small and
furry anymore any age let's find a young
one then I can go find pets so the duck
is a default picture if there's no
pictures but you could adopt marshmallow
let's cross one broke donut ello that's
the serious stuff let's find some yeah
flash and pumpkin they're pretty cute we
can add them to favorites what else did
we have there why is it slow and then
maybe you can add ecology and you could
pretty much like search for any or and
other animals you know Christmas coming
can search for pigs to adopt right
it's a bit slow or maybe there's no pigs
in Boston we can definitely find horses
there you go so we can add Reina so if I
go back to home yeah right eyes here so
in the meantime my mobile application
built as well so I'm actually starting
with a login screen and you could
probably even notice that I even decided
to have different type of navigation but
what's behind that the navigation routes
and etc is pretty much the same I'm
using the same firebase instance I can
see the same animal so you can see
peaches there mrs. snake right - here so
I can click and then you know get some
information and wait on the horse itself
and then I could also use the search
functionality so I could search for cats
because why not I'm not a cat person but
hey mark is ok that's at him and he
shoot up here he's over here so
basically I have the same application
for web and mobile like side by side
that are based on the same code he looks
vicious I don't trust him
go away so let me show you the code now
the interesting part so one of the first
things that we have I'm gonna kill the
build process so one of the first things
that we have is the navigation itself
some using authentication guard so if
you're not logged in you always
automatic it and navigated back to the
login page if you logged in then
automatically will push you to the home
page if even if you come back to the
website
additionally like I have my navigation
so if I want to navigate to home you
will use lazy loading to load the home
module or for my pet search page again I
navigate pet search it will go and lazy
load all the components required to show
my pet search page
etc some are pretty much using just one
set of navigation itself when it comes
to my services where are we
I've got my user service so my user
service pretty much the place where that
allows me to sign in or register or log
out my user I can also use it to kind of
say I go and get me my existing favorite
pets or if I'm adding a pet to my
favorites then basically I can use my my
observable to kind of uh push into that
object which automatically sends it to
firebase so if I just if we just
consider on that so I have my signing
function and maybe log out and register
so that's just one service that works
for both web and mobile and then if I go
for example to my login component so in
here I'm using again
dependency injection to get the user
service and once I have this user
service I expose a login function a
register function and a logout function
that basically use the user service to
perform those operations and then when
I'm looking for example at the HTML
itself let's start with native script so
I'll have a couple of buttons so one
button on top event will go and call
login and then pass in some parameters
in order for me to validate where it's
okay to call it and then another word on
top event we call the register
we also bind to for example the password
item or we can bind to email where as
email there we go so I'm using ng model
to bind to email the order obviously
when we here then the HTML for actually
the web application so I'll have for
example a button
can call register so that register will
go and then automatic check whether we
valid but it calls exactly the same
function and then if I find the other
click event it also calls login in
exactly the same way so I didn't have to
implement my component twice just the
HTML twice and then also in my input
form so when I have my input field for
password which is required and it's a
dish again using the ng model model to
bind to to the password all the email
value so the only real difference is in
in this case is the HTML but my
component my services they're all kind
of the same and I also have a wrapper
around my my firebase but I don't want
to get into that too much because that
was a bit of code there we are
so actually create a whole bunch of
wrappers and then I expose them pretty
much as as an angular module so inside
my angular module which is the core for
web and for mobile I'm just importing my
firebase ng model which does the
abstraction for me so that's kind of the
example project I'll definitely
recommend you to check it on github to
kind of see the code and you can always
pick me pick me on Twitter but I have a
few more slides I want to go through and
maybe another small demo I want to show
you so obviously that's kind of the way
we've been doing code sharing so far but
we have some pretty ambitious plans to
push it a lot further
so around mid-march which is pretty much
around now and we already have some
results that I mean the real target for
us is to have everything ready for
ng-conf so I'm gonna talk about what we
gonna have by that so we created a new
shared project template so the team
master one we're gonna replace it with a
new one and that's going to be managed
by our team directly and it's gonna be
very similar to that the team has to see
it but there will be some differences so
at the moment I didn't show you that at
this time but you remember when I
mentioned that we were
gulp to recreate a project in a separate
folder that's not gonna be happening
anymore we're not gonna use gold at all
so we at the moment with the team s1 we
had to separate no modules and to
separate package essence so you kind of
had to manage your dependencies
separately which wasn't great and then
this is going to be supported by native
script so the new project will have just
one node modules which and we will be
using webpack to do to those code
splitting and also will be using webpack
and you know tree shaking so that if
there is um no if there's an NPM module
that we need in web but in not in native
script we only gonna use it in web but
not data script but you could pretty
much install all of them in one place
the really cool thing is that if you
let's say updating your angular version
from 5.2 to 6.0 are see like it's the
current version you do just once and
then you update it for both web and
mobile right so it's really really cool
so some of the things that we working on
so at the moment so TLS is basically the
extension for native script CLI so we're
looking at plans where if you call
something like Tina's create my app - ng
- shirt now create your straightaway a
shared project with the name of my app
and if you go into that project you can
basically run TNS run iOS or Android to
build a native scooped up or call ng
self to build a web application and I'm
gonna show you how that actually works
in a moment obviously we're doing
something implementation to web pack
built how it works so the web pack is
gonna work with life things so you all
know like web can take quite a while
sometimes it can be a minute or two
depending on the size of the project so
we've added like sync support so rather
than waiting for a minute is like a
second or two to kick off the refreshes
so it's it's pretty smooth and pretty
pretty sweet although if you don't like
dotty and as extension you'll be able to
change it to whichever you want and also
you'll be able to add your own extension
to web files maybe you don't want have
at home dot component or tears maybe you
won't have how
dot component dot webbed of TS forward
twice and dot TNS for more for mobile so
that's definitely configurable we won't
use gob anymore and we also looking at
integration of angular CLI directly so
so far we always been using native tip
CLI but for me my vision is that you
should be able to do everything just
using angular CLI so if you feel at home
building websites using English your
life
so should you with native script that's
pretty much what we were heading for so
we're looking at things like and this
already a possible right now today you
could for example use ng generate or ng
G and then run ng generate components or
module etc and we over we have a reading
how you generate the component and more
module because there's slightly
different for native script but this so
basically those generated generators
take care of it
but then pipe services or any other
things they work exactly say and then
this is pretty much possible thanks to
schematics how many of you actually
played with schematics so far you have
to play with commodities not just an
angular thing it's it is pretty amazing
it's a tool that allows you to do a
scaffolding or generate files in a
really easy way I approach show you an
example in a second so the other thing
is that we're working on and I already
have half of the journey done is project
migration so it's all good if I tell you
here's a project that you can use as a
template and you can build from scratch
your web and mobile application but then
you say like what about my existing
project right it's like I've been
working like six months there has to be
a way to migrate ok so this is what what
I've been working on recently so there
is a scenario imagine you six months ago
you run ng new my app to create a web
application what I'm saying is that you
should be able to call let's say TNS ad
mobile and then this will run a special
schematic that would take your web
project and then convert it into a code
sharing project so at the box is not
going to convert all the components or
modules but you recreate redo the
structure of the project so that you
could actually be able to call either ng
or TNS run okay that's the idea or vice
versa if you create it before a native
script project and you want to convert
it to a culture and project you should
be able to run your TNS ad web and then
ng sir and then Tina's run so this part
of the story I already finished and now
we work in the migration from web to
mobile this the other part is once it
converted the project structure then you
could one by one start converting your
components and your modules so if you
have an existing component
you could run something like Tina's
compared component home so my home
component we're converting it and then
this will go and then basically move
these files and then create the
additional ones for you so those will be
still pretty empty so you still have to
re-implement the what goes exactly into
HTML into your sass files but at least
like the managing of the files will be
done for you automatically and then if
you have a module that has a lot of
components inside you could for example
run here as compared module menu or the
name of it and then we recreate all your
components then pass move on your roots
and your common bits and then split your
modules so there will still be a little
bit of work where you actually say what
actually happens when those HTML files
and generate but the structure will be
handled for you which is very very
powerful and this has potential for more
so recently so yeah so we're looking
working the angular angular team to be
able to actually create native script
projects directly from ng CLI so at the
moment there is a schematic called
native script schematic so you could
actually already do it where you could
say ng new my app and then you could say
at native script schematic and then this
will actually create your native the
project using angular CLI but we're
looking whether we could actually have
something like - - mobile as a flag
angular see like they just added a new
command which is really cool it's
it's called ng art so ng odd is
basically something that allows you to
transform your project to add additional
bits to it so you have a project and we
say you wanna add mob X which requires
to install it and then maybe do some
structuring of your project right so you
technically if the guys from the mobis
create a schematic for it
you would be able to cause something
like ng Atomics and that's um that's
what I'm working on so that migration
process that I was talking about you
really should work by calling ng at
mobile and then this will convert your
web project into a culture and project
it's just matter of a couple of weeks
until we have it ready and then also
within that we're looking whether we
could actually do the conversion of the
modules and components like we're
talking about and also we look into a
way so if you heard about architect
which is a kind of way of structure and
build process within angular CLI which
is actually not even specific to angular
CLI they just happen to use it there
we're working with using architects so
that you could actually call ng serve
that's just mobile and then this will
use angular CLI to perform the build
process of mobile applications for you
out of the box so pretty strong
ambitions but we give ourselves couple
of weeks they should be there
Wow maybe not the architect part that
would take four weeks so some resources
that's a pretty long link but if you
google my name and code sharing there's
like a really lengthy blog post that I
created has a lot of pictures of
garfield's if you love Garfield I
recommend it or if you want to learn
about culturing I gave a pretty nice
talk on it so if you search for natives
of death day and my name you can find
additional talks which I where I go in
more depth also what else yeah the
extension I was talking about natives
being in a CLI that's on github and you
have like a couple of other projects
that you can look into that so my
Pedro's project and there's another one
that is actually supported by my company
engi to dashboard cidade uses even like
a kendo UI library for the website and
then native script for the mobile
application so it's worth checking it
out so yeah thanks for listening</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
