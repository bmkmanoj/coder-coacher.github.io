performance and to narrow it down
because it's such a broad field
specifically page load speed so how fast
is your website till it first opens
roughly why how and what to consider the
first one is why why do we need that
it's cool that's actually not for most
developers like yeah if you need some
reasons to tell your your boss or some
marketing people there are loads of very
clear statistics post from Google Amazon
and others which show that a lot of
people disappear if you have a bad page
speed so if your site special mobile
takes a long time to load they just go
away
yes also one second delay can mean up to
20% less conversions so lots of money
for big sites and yeah there are many
more statistics like that you'll find
lots of reasons how to convince here
your boss how to test so there are many
many different tools one of the more
famous ones is Google PageSpeed and you
can use it online or you can also use it
as a Chrome extension so in the chrome
developer tools there's an audit app and
it leverages the page speed to give you
feedback on your current site it ideally
looks like this it gives you some
statistics of what to optimize and how
to optimize so if you have a page like
this it gives you a score here it gives
you a score for mobile and for desktop
and it tells you here what you should
improve and it tells you here what do
you already have improved there's one
very important thing here consider all
these
as recommendations they're not
necessarily true I'll go into details
more they are things you should check if
it's good or not they might be fine
then there's HP test it gives you so you
enter a URL you get a result it runs a
few times
the ones at the top give you a rough
idea if everything is good or not so
good there are flaws to this one which
is especially if you have a video if you
have a video on the site at the top the
whole statistics about low time and
interactive or up because it
considers so the video is always moving
so it doesn't know when it's finished
and also it waits till the whole video
is loaded till it's considered loaded
even if you stream the video so that's a
small caveat yes this is a very general
easy look to check you can the low time
means basically how long does it take
till your website is fully loaded the
first bite means how long did your
server application need to actually
figure out what he wants to send you
start rendering so the difference
between first bite and start rendering
is your CSS and JavaScript mainly and
first interactive is also very strongly
connected to JavaScript we'll go into
details later
so yeah mentioned it doesn't work if you
have videos also one very good resource
is if you use Google Analytics or pivec
or one of these tools I use Google
Analytics as example it tracks real user
there so you can actually see how it
behaved on real users and and yeah which
is also interesting because it doesn't
give you only your use case but it runs
on Bill users also there is a new tool
from Google called
winning on mobile which gives you
test data from from Google Chrome so in
chrome if you say share my my data it
will use this data to tell you how fast
some websites are it's called winning on
mobile I don't have any slides talking
about page speed but I think it's by my
notebook the better is quite almost
empty yeah it's called Apted if you
don't sit here just winning on mobile
it's I think it doesn't do anything here
yeah and it gives you real user data
this is also already integrated into the
PageSpeed
so if you use PageSpeed on a domain
where it has data it will show it to you
in the top so this part here where it
says how long your site takes compared
to others and and this one here where it
says unavailable in in my case this is
the data from Google Chrome reports post
on mobile and on desktop
yes and so how to optimize I'm
mentioning a few things on the server
but we're not server guys will not talk
about that's too much the first thing is
you need to send out static HTML so if
you have a react app if you have a angle
app something like that you somehow need
and there are many tools out that you
render a first version on the server and
send out some HTML and then the
JavaScript should kick in and makes it
yeah interactive the second of course
you need SSL everybody who yeah
you need SSL and you should consider how
often you redirect someone before
actually see the first page so many
times your Enter
I don't know example org then you get
redirected to www.example.com l so users
to redirect and that's valuable time
actually most pages are redirected so
this is very bad try to avoid it as much
as possible and also try if it really is
necessary try to do it on a server level
like nginx or Apache and not on the
application layer damn it
my battery yes and the next thing this
you you should leverage browser caching
so you can configure how long resources
are cached and that usually should be
above one day so if you deliver CSS or
JavaScript or images they normally don't
change so put in long headers it's even
good to for images or things like that
to make like a week or a year or
whatever you can do and if you have your
code if you have your images on
something like Amazon obvious or Google
Cloud every time you change the image it
creates a new URL anyway so you can
cache it for as long as you want and if
you use something like type kits it was
an example here many times there's an
optimization to say use long caching
times and here's the great example of
why Google pitch spades peach spade only
gives you suggestions because it
actually triggers often on their own
code so here it tells me that the Google
I fin frame API should be modified it's
not you'll also get a warning that
Google Analytics should be cached for
longer than two hours and it's on the
cache for two hours so you can't really
do things about that that's why you
normally will not
hundred percent score in Google
PageSpeed because there are other
dependencies same with bmail and many
others you'll you can change their
servers right and use a CDN it's quite
cheap already you can pay 10 20 bucks
per month and get a good CDN and it
improves your page speed as well so
front end the first obvious one because
it's so much
data size optimize your images early it
was easy you just compress the image and
you're done
but we have these small and so
you need to you need to use responsive
images there are two ways of using
responsive images the first one is with
sizes and source sets we actually find
many different sizes of the same image
and the browser just figures out which
one it needs so here if I I'm defining
that the the size of the image is always
50% of the browser width and the browser
itself knows how big it is so it can
divide that by two it also knows if it
uses a Retina display or something like
that and it automatically chooses the
right size of the image and then you
just give it many different options of
image sizes and your browser uses the
right image that's easy to optimize if
you want to show different images on
mobile and a desktop you can also use
the picture element which allows you to
do art direction I'm not going into that
too much because I actually gave a
lightning talk about that already if you
have an image with this full width on a
browser you should have at least six
different sizes for that image I
typically use the biggest size around
2000 pixel it depends a bit on how much
you care about quality versus speed but
you need a lot of different image
variations
and each of those images also need to be
compressed so this is normally either
your workflow like grunt gallop or
whatever or your server and also you
should use bad P but P is a kind of new
image format it's pushed by by Google
and if you use it if you use for example
Google Chrome
you should detect that your your server
should detect that and deliver bappy
images they are way way smaller and yeah
many many services give you that out of
the box if you use something cloud
filler you just make one check box use
that P and you're done and coming back
to Google PageSpeed Google PageSpeed
expects you to do very very aggressive
image compression and if you have some
design focused websites you might not
want to do it that aggressive so really
find your own balance here if you do it
like Google will be very very aggressive
which comes to
no I don't have it on this page on some
pages it triggers because it expects the
image to be really really strongly
compressed for videos to compress the
video just use a tool called handbrake
it's very easy just use the default
settings and you'll be surprised how
much space you can save and normally
deliver them them as mp4 that cow goes
almost every browser if you have really
big size big sites you might need four
backs but the optimal solution is mp4
always provide a poster image so the the
browser if you use the the video tag and
you define a poster image what the
browser does it first loads that picture
and shows it till the video is ready
which is really helpful and to optimize
videos which are actually running on
automatically if you set muted to true
and autoplay the true it can run on your
mobile phone so you you can have videos
running on your mobile basically every
modern mobile so no need anymore to use
these compressed chief formats which are
three times four times bigger than video
the next one pretty obvious for you
developers reduce the amount of
resources you use and magnify JavaScript
and CSS this is a trend of how big site
a websites go and you'll see right now
the typical size of a web site is around
four megabytes and it should be between
one or two typically so there's lots of
improved possibility for yourself to
position yourself as a fast web site
yes here it gets a bit more difficult
Google heavily focuses on limiting
render blocking code render blocking
means if your HTML is fully loaded is it
able to show you something or is there
some JavaScript in between some
JavaScript in the head or some CSS in
the head which blocks the rendering
until it's loaded for CSS you normally
need it because you need to have your
CSS before it renders the page for
JavaScript
the first rendering should be able
without JavaScript and you should put
your JavaScript in the footer or define
it as async which is common best
practice yeah you should prioritize
visible content that means if you have a
list of I don't know hundred entries
only the first one should load the real
images and then usually lazy loading or
use some just hundred kilobyte images
and blur them so your page loads faster
and inline CSS is something which is
very very effective and it means extra
effort for you the basic idea of
inlining is that instead of having a
separate CSS file which you link to you
you inline that sees us and if your page
is bigger
you should only inline critical CSS
inlining critical CSS can be very
complicated there's a PageSpeed module
for those Apache and nginx which will do
it for you out of the box
um just make sure it really works for
you there are some edge cases which are
not covered but that's that's an optimal
solution another good solution is to
totally inline all your CSS which works
if if your CSS is in a reasonable size
but try it out in your browser yourself
and see if it gets actually faster or
slower
yes so that was a very high-level talk I
would like to have your feedback if I
should go in one of these topics in
detail I could talk about each of these
topics probably for 20 minutes
as a more high-level consideration you
always have to find a way to tween
features you want to support the
development time to make that fast and
the page speed so it would be great if
your website loads in one second and has
a huge amount of features and it doesn't
make sense in most of your projects
because you're not Google right so just
try to find a balance but make sure your
website loads below three seconds if if
it gets above three seconds you should
really consider taking more time on the
speed and less time on the features and
also figure out some metrics in your
company they might be different from
company to company if you have news
websites you need it faster if you have
a website where people load it once and
then spend half an hour on it it might
be possible that it's slower but find a
metric and then really stick to it so
have an automatic test when you break it
it doesn't deploy because that's the
only option that you really take the
time to me to optimize for speed
all right thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
