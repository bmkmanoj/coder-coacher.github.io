can look at the next version of
JavaScript es 2016 along with the new
process for the new yearly releases of
the language if you're interested in
finding out more check out the links
below there's only actually two new
features that are going to be in the
language which is actually quite nice
it's quite nice to see we're moving from
this big bag of these are much more
smaller incremental improvements so we
have the include method on arrays which
will let us check to see if an array has
a particular value inside it which is
something we've been doing for a while
but having be able to do is come it
nicely and succinctly we also have the
exponentiation operator with lettuce too
like 3 to the power of 2 in JavaScript
for example so the process for proposing
new features into javascript is is kind
of much improved it's also now entirely
public and kind of it on github so
anyone can see faithfully anyone can
propose a feature to the standards
committee and that goes in as a stage
naught proposal on that effectively
means it's a it's a very first draft
proposal then goes through from state
nor through to stage 4 where stage 4 is
will be included in the language so the
two new features of es 2016 go for each
stage for by the deadline for being
included in the next version of the
language what stage 4 means is that
there are two implementations out in the
wild that means two browsers say Chrome
and Firefox Chrome Internet Explorer or
whatever they might be how both
implemented the feature and it's past
the spec it's entirely compliant the
best thing about this plug-in approach
is we can actually see if ideas turn out
to be good in reality so often you can
have an idea that senior really good on
paper by actually once you start to put
it into practice and use it it becomes
clear that it's not quite exactly what
we need or there are some places where
it doesn't quite fit as we'd like it to
so what this means is rather than having
everything as an idea that very few
people can test we can actually put it
into the hands developer and just see
where it falls down effectively and see
if what sounds good in theory is
actually good in practice and then
because of this kind of four stage
process we can refine the proposal
update the plug-in as we go so people
can play with the newest version of the
proposal and hopefully that means by the
time it reached Stage four only do we
have actually
mutations in at least two browsers we
also have had lots of developers using
the feature via the plug-in so at that
point we're pretty confident it's going
to be a good addition for the language</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
