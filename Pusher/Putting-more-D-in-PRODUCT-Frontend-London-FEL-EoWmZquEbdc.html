listening in advance and a couple of
things before I got here I didn't
realize that someone else had cleverly
picked a very similar topic so it's a
little bit two for one tonight but
hopefully in a good way minds perhaps
more of a intro and the other ones a
sort of retaliation in how it really
should be maybe but more on that later
and I guess the other thing to mention
is anyone who read the title of my talk
earlier it's been discreetly changed for
obvious reasons if you read the earlier
titles so please don't judge me I'm
right let me just quickly and i guess
some developer to product is kind of the
title of what i'm going to talk about
but it's more about sort of putting the
elements of developer into product and
kind of the other way around for the
mutual benefit of both so that's sort of
the tone and hopefully it's useful and i
guess i had a quick question before i
start which is how many developers among
you I mean I presume most of your
developers but how many would sort of
describe yourself as a product developer
rather than a sort of pure developer
okay cool good just some gauging how to
pitch it so and ok I'll get going and I
i woke up lumen wild I guess that's the
other bit of context um I'm Sharon
obviously I'm head of product to bloom
and wild and then what that means is
that i'm sort of responsible for tech UX
and product and when I tell you a bit
more about what I think sort of product
is that would kind of make sense but I'm
probably a bit more text than most
product people so yeah and a little bit
of background and blooming wild and for
anyone who doesn't know who bloom WADA's
which is probably most people because
we're a really tiny startup and we are a
florist essentially but a kind of modern
florist in that we use technology to
make it easier to buy flowers and a bit
nicer and a bit more cool and actually
makes the flowers a bit better as well
because we speed everything up and we
put them in boxes and they go to your
letter boxes and that's the kind of
floral bit of it which is not
my specialism and there's a whole lot of
technology behind the scenes that powers
that there's there's a website which is
a front end probably probably front end
interest more than the rest of it which
is a JavaScript app and angular single
page app that does the majority of our
sales it's sort of an e-commerce
platform and we've got a ruby API Ruby
on Rails API behind that which is sort
of see on top of various bits of
technology that do things like
deliveries bookings orders and all the
sort of tech inside the actual flower
place where they put the boxes together
we've also got native apps for iOS and
Android so we've got quite a range of
technologies we've got nine people in
the tech team out of 25 in total so
we're actually quite a tech focused
business and but distinctly floral as
well as I'll try and communicate a
little bit of purposes ok and before
that I've worked for zopo which is a
peer-to-peer lender so much more techie
I've worked for cancer research which is
charity and I've also worked for golf
okay and a bit further back in Australia
for sort of a maybe a bit of a lower
level equivalent city of Melbourne so
I've done all sorts of different sectors
but the consistent thing is the job of
products and tech and so I think I'm
well-rounded but i'll let you judge that
and ok so i should have done that before
that's that's kind of what I just said
I'm a bit about the tech team I guess
the thing I didn't mention actually is
sort of a bit about our room how we do
take a bloomin wild which i think is you
know I think we do it pretty well I
probably would say that the little
centres at the end is our kind of mantra
or I don't know what you want to call it
like our mission statement and coded
with care compiled with love and shipped
with pride and it's a little bit a sort
of a tech version of the bloomin wild
statement which I'm struggling to
remember because I'm nervous but it's a
sort of terrified version of that and it
basically means we we really care about
the code we really care about the
product which is get the flowers and the
customer experience and we really you
know that permeates through everything
we do we make sure the processes work
for the people in the team we make sure
we pick and choose the right tools for
the right reasons
the decisions we make kind of take these
these values into account and that's
definitely going to sort of permeate
through the tips or things that I'm
going to talk about which around you
know how can you be more product focused
if you're a developer and you want to or
how can you work more easily with
product managers if that's what you want
to do or how can you understand product
managers a bit more if that's your
position as a developer so so first
thing what is product and if I'm
teaching people to suck eggs sort of
wave at me or throw things at me but I
thought it was well worth trying to
explain it because it is a bit sort of
miss Steve mystical it's kind of a lot
of things but you know bringing them
together perhaps is the best way to
describe it and you sort of sit in the
middle of primarily things like you x
tekken business and by business i mean
kind of hard goals corporate numbers
that sort of stuff i think everyone
knows what UX and tech kids so i'm not
going to talk about explaining that bit
more and around those things there's
other things like marketing and
operations and customer services and
flowers in our case and other things in
other cases they're all important too
and they're all part of it but this is
sort of the epicenter and it's really
about coordinating those things to get
the best kind of product out at the end
and to a greater or lesser degree you
probably focus on one of those things as
a product manager I think for me if I
was going to put myself on that diagram
I would be at the top between UX and
tech but obviously I have to get the
business bit as well but if I had you
know if I had to pick a favorite
probably it would be the top two and
what product is not is Gantt charts and
project management and kind of
traditional IT structures and all of
those sorts of things I'm that's not my
background I've never worked in that
kind of team and those teams exist and
they do great things in many instances
but it's not what I would describe as
product and I think quite often product
managers probably struggle in that
environment because it's quite different
it's quite regimented you have very long
lead times you have very slow release
cycles you don't have any agility or any
of the nice things that I've come to
enjoy in the places I've worked
so that's what I think product is but
very open to challenge on that and
anyone who wants to talk to me about
product i'll happily chat over beers for
hours about it and so why should
developers be interested in this and I
mean you have to work with them right so
much as you hate product managers if you
do hate them you have to work with them
so that's that's one sort of very kind
of hard and fast reason and but some
more positive reasons you might be
interested in it you might be interested
in becoming a product manager or doing a
paps half-and-half job where you're a
product developer maybe or something
that's sort of in between or aux
engineer I think the boundary start to
blur quite a lot when you you know when
you have interests and bring them into
your role and have the freedom to do
that you might be a founder or a future
founder I think increasingly people
learn to code because they want to start
their own business like it happens
happening everywhere particularly in the
startup scene I feel like it's a massive
trend it might be different if you're
not working in a start-up I don't know
but I think it's a massive thing at the
moment and you could be a UX focus
developer and I think particularly front
Enders like this is almost obvious right
you can't really avoid it if you're
designing and building interfaces like
they're going to be used so you you have
to be interested in it hopefully you're
passionate about it as well and again on
this perhaps on the negative side you
might be a bit fed up with tenant being
told what to do and you've got some
project manager or maybe even a product
manager who's saying just do this here's
a spec off you go actually you're
thinking well I know the customers
better I know the product better I know
how to build this technology quicker
more efficiently I can do it better I
think you know hopefully try it and the
final one I guess I sort of mentioned
this already actually the two go
together I guess if you feel like you're
doing it better than the person who
should be doing it oh sorry if you feel
like you're doing it better than the
person who is meant to be doing it yeah
I think that's that can be a big
motivating factor to go and perhaps
dabble in the dark arts of product
management again I kind of mentioned
this but I think for front-end visits is
much more common you so much nearer to
to the product to the kind of the
usability the purpose of it the
customers the bits that they actually
use the buttons they click weather
it's you know what whatever that kind of
interaction there is so I've got ten
slides now ten things that I think you
could look into if you wanted to learn
more about product in any of those kind
of for any of those reasons and i just
mentioned or to any of those degrees so
the first one is the roadmap which i
think is kind of everywhere like there's
always a roadmap even if it's a rubbish
roadmap there's always a roadmap and you
know i think most people know what it is
but if you don't find out because you're
not really going to get very far until
you do that get to know it ask questions
you know if there's if there's not
enough detail ask for more detail and
product managers really like being asked
about the road map because it's their
pride and joy it's kind of the summary
of all their hard work they toil over
these analytics and this user feedback
and this kind of business direction and
all these great ideas and they all come
together get shuffled around and out
pops a road map hopefully so I think if
you ask a product manager about the road
map and they don't want to talk about it
then something's really wrong and I
guess the other thing is you know after
why and Challenger if you think
something shouldn't be on it or if you
think something should be on it that's
not on it tell the product manager or
tell the person who owns it and I think
yeah it's a good thing I wish developers
in my team now and in past teams that
I've been in did that more and it's good
for me to be challenged I might disagree
with them and I think that's fine I
might agree with them that's even better
I guess and but I think it's a good
thing I think asking why and challenging
the person who's making these decisions
is a really positive thing I can't
promise it always go well though not all
product managers a good product managers
it's it's like anything in life they're
human so the next one metrics I alluded
to this on the road map and you know get
near to them if you're interested in
products look at numbers don't just kind
of make assumptions I think that's an
incredibly frustrating thing for me as a
product manager to see in developers
that I work with you can be a great
developer but if you're making
assumptions that inform the decisions
you take when you build something it can
be really dangerous
get some data it's always there and some
companies do it more than others so it
might not always be there but it should
be you know use numbers or qualitative
data which is obviously the opposite so
you know words and pictures perhaps mix
the two together go for the one that's
easiest the most relevant but you know
find out why things are happening and
then what to what degree and you're
probably not going to get very far
challenging someone about the roadmap
unless you have numbers or something
other than your opinions back it up
unless you're the CEO and that's yeah
it's kind of their privilege but really
they've probably got the numbers they
just might not look like it I think it's
you might be in a horrible situation
where you've got someone who's saying
right no not listening to you is my
decision and they're not based on data
that's probably a terrible place to be
and but i think it's like such an
important part of doing the product
roars it's kind of your second brain
almost like it's you know you just have
to rely on this thing to help you make
your judgments because otherwise you'll
stop going off on tangents there that
could be completely disastrous for the
company or yourself or if you're the
owner and I really were before at the
top there and metrics are really
important when you're planning and
putting stuff on a road map and and
after as well so after it's kind of
different because I think you'll use
something you're built you've built and
you then go and measure it so it's
perhaps a little bit less scattergun
it's a bit more focused and but equally
important and it also powers the road
map so you build something you hopefully
are interested in how its performing so
do it yeah do that more and I think
interesting thing to add here this is
this is something that is usually like
pushing an open door developers love
stats like I think if you're technically
inclined it's generally the case that
you like data and know how to find it
and process it to a degree product
managers generally don't have as many
technical skills as developers so if
developers come to them and say look
I've found this data I want to help
build this stuff up and give you this
insight and work with you on it it's
going to be like pushing an open door
and it's going to make you a much more
effective team
the other thing I was going to mention
and again this was I was sort of judging
how to push how to pitch this but some
of the tools that we could use to do
this and this might be just like
teaching suck eggs but an insight into
how we work at bloomin wild we use the
obvious ones or I think they're obvious
like Google Analytics and obviously our
database that's full of exciting data
and but things like mixpanel user
testing the whole range like we kind of
are quite lean because we're small and
young but no I think you know we can go
to town and there's all sorts of tools
that will help you find the data that
you need and it's a case of picking the
right one most of the time is the
biggest challenge because there are so
many you could spend your whole life
kind of running around in circles food
number four hopefully I'm sorry I am I
tactically added in animated gifts to
this this afternoon when my team told me
that it was too black and white and
boring so sorry I keep forgetting to
press the button and they do have a sort
of coin meaning and what's that one
reward for the team that was that i
haven't mentioned so yeah so date is
great because if it if it's going well
and you prove it's going well everyone's
happy and it's like a cat high five next
one I get to know the customers and
actually I of most of the places that
I've worked as a product manager
developers more than most people seem to
really value the custom of you and I
don't know why particularly I mean I
think it's a good thing right I'm not
saying you're questioning the value of
it but more than teams you know the you
know the teams that you have my
marketing operations i'm not going to
suggest which ones I think are good or
bad other than that I think developers
January are really good at this they
want to know what the customer is doing
the thing they've built and you know I
think the more we do that the better
it's a really really good thing it's an
extra pair of is an eyes on the sort of
outside world that's informing the stuff
that you build in the future so knowing
how it's used what works doesn't work I
guess this some this is a the next one's
a bit of a luxury if you happen to have
a bit of spare time which I don't think
anyone ever does but it might be a way
to sort of find new ideas and
opportunities that you
even know existed that he isn't
listening to customer calls and they're
talking about something that just isn't
even on the roadmap wasn't even in the
product and that could be something that
you get from there and again I kind of
alluded to talk I think this is probably
a little bit obvious and I think one
thing that actually is worth mentioning
at bluemoon wild we always listening to
customer calls and when I say we I mean
the whole team so there's 25 of us
across all disciplines 9 Tech and the
rest marketing operations etc and
obviously a customer services team who
do that full time at some point each
week we all spend at least an hour doing
some kind of engagement customers
whether it's answering emails or being
on the phone and I think everyone has
taken a call at some point which is
easier and harder for some people I
quite struggled with that I joined them
while didn't know anything about flowers
and had to talk to little old ladies
about roses and peonies and ya didn't
know what to do so I found emails easier
but whatever way it is I think it's
something that is really worth
championing as a product manager and as
a developer if you say to someone that I
want to know more about what the
customers are saying it's a it's a
really good thing that one's not
animated that's a dog and one of our
flower boxes that's what our customers
do with our flower boxes they kind of
take photos of them when they land on
the doorstep it's an interesting
observation it's not influenced our tech
yet but we'll see this one get to know
the problems and this is kind of flowing
on from the customers bit and the kind
of date a bit when you've got all this
data and you're sort of hearing all this
feedback think about what are the things
that are actually stopping people from
either having a good experience or maybe
even stopping them from using your
product it could be something like a say
a button is broken on a website and that
stops you ordering I mean that's not
going to happen because that's a major
one someone would find that but
something that stops people actually
using your product is is really bad and
it's an obvious problem so you know
identify it and enlist it that's yeah I
think internally and externally you can
have have problems that you know that
you can find out about and potentially
help solve as a technologist and whether
it's processes that are going to slowly
or
too much manual effort going into them
yeah can be all sorts of things and as a
developer you're in probably the most
powerful position to be able to solve
these things and tech businesses their
whole kind of business is is digital and
you know if the digital thing has
problems in it oh sorry yeah if there
are problems you know developers are the
people that end up fixing them so if you
can help identify them it's a really
positive thing and I guess from a
business point of view which I'm always
aligned with the UX and tech more than
the business it's a good thing because
it things move faster and people are
happy and you know in the end of the day
the business that you work for whether
it's your own or someone else's is not
going to do well unless it moves quickly
and become successful so you know
whether you like cold hard numbers or
not you sort of have to acknowledge them
and it's a big part of what you do and
the other thing that i would add here
and the reason i keep banging on about
problems is our roadmap is really a
series of problems and it's sort of
loosely based on this theory or approach
to working called jobs to be done and we
don't follow any processes religiously a
bloomin while we're too small for that
way we've just kind of have to muck in
and get stuff done in the most logical
way possible and but this idea of
focusing on things to solve rather than
oh I'm going to build this feature or
I'm going to do this other thing works
really well for us because we have to be
focused and we have to do things really
quickly and efficiently the next one is
kind of similar but different subtly
different and if you have problems big
list of problems to solve on the back
logo or wish that you know essentially
where wherever you store this kind of
to-do list when you actually come to
work on it focusing on it is really
important and it can really damage your
kind of impact as a developer if you
don't like everyone has their passion
absolutely and I think that's really
important whether it's these cats going
to move and whether it's CSS and you
know as a front end or whether it's
JavaScript whether you know whatever
element of development is the
your passion is it's worth remembering
that actually you're solving a problem
because you can go go to town build
these most these beautiful frameworks
you can make things consistent whatever
the thing is that you really want to do
isn't actually going to help the
customers sometimes it's a big challenge
I think and I struggle with it as much
as anyone I think it's just go it's a
really good skill to have and it's
something that is really worth working
on if you're interested in product and
being more product focused and the way
to approach it that works for me is have
things that are clear problems i just
mentioned in that backlog is really a
series of things to solve or things to
tick off in things to solve things to
conquer and and if they're clear that
helps you to focus its i guess a sort of
very lightweight version of having a
spec and if they're clear their testable
and all the hypothesis that you've kind
of formed to solve them are hopefully
testable and ultimately it's about scope
I think if you let the scope creep you
think things are harder to test things
take longer to build and ultimately your
product suffers from it because the
slower it take the longer it takes you
to build something and actually get it
in front of a customer the less impact
it has and the next one I mentioned
business get to know the business you
have to be in you have to be bought into
it i think you know you can have your
own own agenda in your own interests but
ultimately the thing you're building is
for someone whether it's for yourself or
for another business what are the goals
of it and what where is it going and you
know find out find out what the sort of
number we're with its number goals or
something aspirational like all we want
to go to the moon next month and why has
stuff been planned who does what who's
doing it you know why is it is it a
marketing thing is it a operations thing
I think in bigger organizations this is
probably more of a problem I think at
bloom and wild there's 25 of us there is
absolutely no way people will not know
what our goal is because we talk about
it every day together if you're in a big
place that cancer research with us 5,000
people it can be really difficult to
know actually what are the big goals
where
where are we all going and and be nearer
the numbers and ultimately if you've got
goals they should have numbers attached
to them sometimes they don't which can
make it hard but if there are numbers
then get near to them pay attention to
them see how you're doing and which ones
are you moving specifically so i'm going
to use bloom while as an example because
that's really all I can think about at
the moment for obvious reasons it soaks
up lots of my time and we want to sell
more flowers that's a very vague goal
and I think an individual person working
on an individual task is going to find
it very hard to relate to that as a very
big goal but we can do a whole load of
little things along the way that's not a
moving car so we can do a whole load
little things along the way that make it
easier to do lots of flowers we can make
our supply chain slicker we can make our
website work faster we can make our appt
load quicker we can reduce friction in
the conversion funnel we can make our
homepage look nicer and more friendly we
can make it work on more devices we can
make it more supportable so that we can
evolve it faster and adapter stuff like
there are so many little goals in there
that add up to sell more flowers and so
think about the ones that you know that
relate to you and just keep an eye on
them and make sure you're actually
moving them because I think if you're
not it's probably quite demotivating
number eight next one what's the best or
the right solution I couldn't decide
what the best word was there so all the
right words so I chose both and when you
were solving a problem or building a
thing there's usually many ways you can
do it sometimes there's not but
generally there is and the amount of
time it takes the amount of effort the
quality of the thing is it an MVP or is
it a polished thing is it going to go
out and phases or are you going to build
it and then that's it it's going to be
like that forever and you know that's
all really the adds up to be in the
context and make decisions you know take
into account all of those things I think
as a product manager one of the thing
you see do all the time is juggle those
and kind of judge right what is the what
is the thing that I need to build right
now is it is it going to be a skeleton
or is it going
be something that's really polished
sometimes an MVP does need to be
polished your home page on our website
probably needs to look really good you
can't just put out a skeleton but a
little feature that you're trying out on
a small proportion of users perhaps
doesn't need to be so flashy and
beautiful and don't be precious and you
know I think and you everyone can be
pressed everyone wants do precious about
their own area whether it's UX whether
it's JavaScript whether its product
management even whether it's the roadmap
you know do it does the roadmap need to
look pixel perfect and have little
capital letters in the right places and
does it need to have the right fonts
like not always now in fact probably
never sometimes you precious when it's
important the numbers in the roadmap
probably need to be bang on and the
priority needs to be right then you
apply that across whatever your precious
thing is but I think having the
pragmatism to know when to be precious
and when not to be is a really important
skill and as a product manager I've I
find that's something that I have to do
all the time and it leads into the next
item the next word that I've put there
which is empathy and appreciating other
people's sort of precious thing and
because if someone you know if you might
upset one someone by saying well no
sorry you cannot spend four months
putting this new CSS framework into our
technology stack at the moment because
actually it's not going to help the
customers with the problem that they
have the person who loves the CSS is not
going to like that and so you have to
kind of have appreciation for that and
find a way to deal with it that isn't
going to make them walk out the door
because that would be even worse and I
think that's probably the hardest bit of
the job that I've found from doing it
and people are unpredictable they're
humans you can't always tell how they
feel you can't always tell what the
precious thing is actually if they don't
tell you so I think okay balancing those
two things and figuring out what's the
best solution whether it's the solution
technically or the solution in how to
deal with the situation is really
challenging I've been alluding to this
one sort of gradually more as I've gone
through and I really didn't know what
suppose
title here without sort of sounding like
a kind of graduate scheme awful person
which is not what I was intending but
the people bit of the job I think is the
thing that really makes a product
manager different from someone that's
more focused on their trade as a
designer or developer I'm not saying
that as a developer you don't have
people skills like absolutely you do
what I'm saying is you're going to have
to use them a lot more if you start
working as a product person and you
actually can't avoid it I think
everything you do involves people and
you actually you may end up doing a bit
of people and a bit of your trade still
but probably the people but is going to
be the bit that really gets you the
winds and you need to get stuff done and
you can't do it on your own maybe you
can to start with but ultimately that
will have us there'll be a shelf life
for that and it will it will stop and so
you therefore need to find other people
to work with you whether it's people
that are going to deploy your code
whether it's people that are going to QA
it whether it's I know people that are
going to help figure out what the best
solution is and actually get the
customers using it so operational type
stuff getting those things all working
together is pretty tricky and I think
you need to have the right skills to go
to deal with people to do that and
patients as well I think his is a really
important skill and another one I
struggle with like I think in instant
gratification is definitely my style and
if I was going to be a photographer I'd
use Polaroid rather than film sort of a
traditional film but I think you can't
always get things done straight away you
might think I can do this on my own
right now I'm going to do all the things
that's not scalable you need to accept
that perhaps it won't take as long that
someone's got to do something else first
there's numerous situations where
patients becomes a really really big
part of your job that little gif is cat
herding which I thought was just better
splained visually visually than me
trying to inarticulately describe the
other element of what I do every day
there are lots of cats even at a small
start-up and cats don't heard they just
go where they want
unless you find some way of encouraging
them to all go in the same direction not
something nice okay the final one and
this sounds really cheesy and when I
talked through this these slides of the
guys in my team earlier I kind of got
them to proof read them for me and they
absolutely tore me to pieces and one of
them kindly gave me this gift oh no
sorry my cats which I thought was quite
cute and i asked him actually which
one's the product manager and which
one's the developer he said not sure
i'll let you imagine which ones work and
make friends with your product manager
or a product manager if you don't have
one is my last kind of bit of advice
they're doing the job they might tell
you don't come near it it's absolutely
horrible or they might give you some
advice that inspires you or they might
give you some tips for how to get into
it and i think anyone else who stood up
here and said the same did the same kind
of presentation would tell you a whole
stack of different stuff they might say
a few of the same things but there's so
many different elements to it that you
know you kind of have to apply it in the
place that you are so i would say go and
make friends with your PM or a PM in the
place that you work and the other thing
they laughed at me about earlier was
when when you look at that list it
actually looks like a kind of
instruction guide for stalkers and i
don't suggest you do all of those things
on one person at one time maybe pick the
one that's most appropriate some people
like being asked some people don't some
people would prefer you to fact just
follow around and keep an eye on them
listening asked lots of questions asked
how you can help i figure out which
one's the best one but i think if you do
some of those you learn a lot very
quickly and hopefully get nearer to the
product and if if your thing is wanting
to be a product manager then I think
that's the best place to start the
health warning that goes with that and
this is a great gift it's bear in mind
they're busy they're always busy and
that may mean that they're snappy and
they don't want to talk to you may mean
that they know the things that I just
talked about you know cat herding all
the different things you coordinate
stakeholders whatever you want to call
it they're really busy so appreciate
that and you know don't expect them to
have hours and hours and hours they
might do what that cat does and the next
thing they rely on your help like if you
if you're in a team and you have a
product manager in that team and you're
developing that team or a designer or
whatever are the role they really rely
on you like don't underestimate that you
can't as a product manager you can't get
anywhere without the rest of the team
doing their thing so be excellent or
what you do still be excellent or what
you do keep being excellent and then
offer to take on more responsibility
because it's not going to work if you
kind of dropped the day job too soon it
might sound really obvious but and the
last one I sort of made this point
earlier but the softer skills but the
patient's the people but i think is the
hardest bit and i was really rubbish at
it a few years ago i'm still not amazing
at it I don't think I'm anywhere near
perfect but I think if there's one thing
I've learned and grown up in the past
two years is that bit you can be an
amazing UX designer or a great developer
or a great business person and you can
keep refining those skills but the thing
that will really make you win and
actually get stuff done you know get
decisions made which I ultimately mean
the thing gets shipped and becomes a
success at cetera et cetera is is the
soft a bit i'm utterly convinced but if
someone has said that's me a couple
years ago i've probably laughed at them
and smirked and said night I go home so
and and that's it that's 10 things that
I would suggest doing to get near as a
product and very open to challenge I
think it's incredibly subjective I think
it's different in every place you work
and that yeah hopefully interesting I
did have one sort of cheeky last slide
which is the obvious one that we are
looking for more developers so come and
talk to me about that as well as product
but mainly about apartment
