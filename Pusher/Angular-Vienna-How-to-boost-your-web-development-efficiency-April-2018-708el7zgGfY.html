to boost your web development efficiency
some of the stuff was already set by
Martin before because we have some
overlapping topic called
lint staged but as I'm sure you will
still have some value out of this
presentation what I did is I tried to
compile all the most important tools
that I use in my web development and I
also have like my settings my
configuration objects directly in the
presentation and everything is linked to
online so you can check out the slides
after the talk and you can do the
configurations yourself so the first
topic is already lint staged so lean
stage this basically a wrapper around
get hooks so it makes it more easily
usable for you and like a good hook you
could imagine it like being an angular
lifecycle hook so like engine in it and
she on changes whatever and it's
especially useful for doing a pre-commit
hook so let's say you you and some
colleagues of you fight over the code
style and there's always like he leaves
some white spaces in there and you
remove them again and it's like a
constant back and forth so with like a
pre-commit hook where you say okay we
use this tool to format our code and you
can always be sure that you only have
really clean code and only changes that
are relevant another possibility would
be to use a pre push hook so let's say
you want to push something online and
you want to push it to your CLI and you
always fear that your pipeline gonna
fail your pipeline gonna fail this would
be one way of maybe avoiding it so you
would let your unit test and your enter
in test run before you push it yeah so
this would actually be a package like I
you can also make like a lean staged RC
config file to have it encapsulated but
I implemented here in the package Jason
first settings I used here is concurrent
for subtest concurrency one this is used
because I had the problems that because
this linters run at the same time that
sometimes the format I went over it and
changed files but it didn't add them to
the to the actual commit so the commit
went through
and then there were some leftover
changes in the in the actual branch
so this refusing only suppress
concurrency one it's a wallet that
problem yeah for HTML files I use the
auto format HTML script you can see it
down here it's using TS lint with the
fixed flag so the fixed flag already
tries to fix as many issues as possible
that it can do by itself and then also
it takes the project white configuration
that is convict a Singh and T is Lin
chasin for the t's neutrals for CSS and
chairs I just use prettier because that
was seemed like the obvious and easy
choice to make and for the typescript
and I use something that is called clang
format so this might not be the obvious
choice like we heard before you can use
prettier but for me it seemed that
prettier like it a pretty also wants to
be like easy and it doesn't give you
many customization options on purpose
but I was like okay with the typescript
with the typescript project I want to be
able to change everything to my own
needs mm-hmm yeah and then it goes
through and uses the lint script and
yeah I already explained this and what's
also there is like the ignore so for
minified files of course you don't want
it to be reformatted into an unmeaning
fide version so yeah about Auto
formatting type script like prettier
typescript format clang format these are
free could be free possible options I
looked at them and for me it was obvious
to use clang format it's actually used
for C++ and C sharp formatting but it
works perfectly fine for typescript what
I did here is at first I started using
Google style and that was the the base
to work with but then step by step I
started being not happy with it and I
basically rewrote everything here so
this is definitely oh I have this one
this is definitely not necessary here so
I could at some point I would probably
clean this up a little bit to have only
the
Cerie rules what I also like about Clank
form it is studied in sorts your imports
by specific criteria what I mean with
criteria here is that's going to be s
code here in my main browser TS you can
see it easily
so what Clank format then does it's like
when you have the four module import it
puts them at the top of your file then
it leaves a blank space then it imports
your dependencies out of the package
jason and then like down below here it
would use your relative import you are
so you can always be sure where your
imports are or you can see it usually on
with a single look and yeah i wrote your
showcase time so i prepared already
staged changes so I actually made my
file it's this readable for your sugar
yeah sure which one - no this one
oh yeah much better ok so yeah you can
see a factor it up pretty good I
it up here I yeah the constructor stuff
is an indented and here for example
forces on the next line the the closing
place of the if is on the same light of
the line of the code stuff like that so
it's quite horrible and whatever to now
is like used actuals it's the actual
script so I would say Auto format ts
goes for the tree and the I flag is for
interactive replacing it back in the
editor you would see here I have now my
changes here and if we're lucky it
should be yeah it should be back in its
place so nice and clean everything again
and like stuff like this here for
example to credit relief wrap aligned
underneath which other was a pain in the
ass so it was a work it was quite a work
to go through this clang format and look
at all the options that there are yeah
same of course we can do for the like
here we have a detail
an HTML page and you see that the h3
here is wrong and this one is just in
the same line and also really horrible
so therefore we have the HTML formatting
yeah it outputs also unchanged files but
it should have fixed this one yeah you
see now the h3 is aligned on yeah sorry
who I didn't try that out I'm not using
any inland templates but that would be
interesting yeah but I guess it probably
won't work because you're looking for
the wild card ts so probably not but
here you see it's back to normal and
should be fine
and then also have here my shame CSS
file and it also is you know what a
shame CSS file is okay yeah so you have
a lot of stuff here also have been wrong
wrongly intended and stuff oh sorry so I
would go back here again and do it with
node modules been prettier right single
quotes true print with hundred and then
the path to the actual file and it
should be everything else is also again
back in its place where it should be
nice and clean and oh sorry so what we
can do now is I'm just gonna check out
the changes here you see we still have
this free modified files and now if I
say git commit let's just call it test
commit it starts running lint staged
with husky and here you see auto format
blah blah blah and it's also pretty fast
except for the linting four of the TS
files but other than that it should be
result in a really nice clean commit
here you see still it's the changes are
still there because it's not yet added
again to the stage changes let's see if
it's true yet No
okay now it's true so yeah everything is
nice and clean now and we can verify
this again to this page so yeah
everything is nice and clean committed
and that's what we want that's what we
expect yeah so for the HTML I use Ches
beautify it's called so I was like what
the why is this library called
sheís beautify when it does stuff with
HTML but that's something that vias code
is actually using on their own like when
you format something to be a score it's
using chess beautifier so I thought why
not stick to that and yeah the most
important feature that I like here stats
is this force aligned here that leads to
stuff being really clean being really
clean like the properties and the eight
attributes are always like a line like
this so especially when you have a lot
of stuff like that it's nice and easily
readable still so that's what I like
about this yeah and since we're talking
about HTML there's also Emmet probably
most of you know if you don't know about
it it's already implemented by by via
scope as a standard and the way you
would use it is let's say I want to
write a container like bootstrap stuff a
container with row with three calls and
then with the text hello angular meetup
I would do it like this the dot is a
class then I call the class container I
would make another class called row and
then I would say call four times free
because we want to have like we're
always thinking in twelve twelve steps
and then in there I would have h2 with
the content hello angular meetup and
when I expand this now you see it nicely
creates your HTML tags that you wanted
and this is also really really nice when
you let's say you want to have a lot of
allies so you have a on of allies
now so this is definitely something to
keep in mind and to also work with it
and use its power yeah the next topic is
already
autoprefixer in working together with
browsers lists so here on the right side
sorry on the right side we have an
example of how it would look if you
would need to respect all the vendor
prefixes that there are and then
sometimes you also don't know okay what
what the hell actually what Prosser to
our support and and since when is this
flag required or since when is the
vendor prefix required and since when
not so what other prefix it does I used
it here for the only for the production
model because in the development panel
you should not care what because you
work in Chrome or something useful
elsewise so here it's like loading the
assess files then it's using
autoprefixer on this and then it's
converting everything to CSS and what is
results with is is depending on what you
have here in your browsers list array so
this is not what you use here but it
could be something like that so you say
please add all the vendor prefixes for
the last one meter per meter version of
all browsers worldwide or here you could
say okay
only browsers please that that have a
usage of 1% or more and here you could
also even specify it for every browser
individually and what we have at work is
something like less to major versions to
make sure in case someone has updated
and with the rolling release browsers it
should be no problem and then also add
support for the list for Internet
Explorer Explorer versions but that's
not something to be proud of yeah next
topic is cleaning out unused CSS out of
your production bundle I think every one
of you knows ok you use some kind of
library like Foundation or bootstrap or
something else and you get this big
boilerplate code and you probably only
need some of it so you will never really
use all the capacities of all the
already predefined CSS styles and the
way you do it is you would have your
main content hash bundle CSS so this is
already basically you finished bundle
and then you would let purify CSS run
over all your HTML files look for
classes or IDs if it finds it it keeps
the classes in
the actual bundle and if it doesn't find
it it would clean it out and you can
already think okay this is probably a
problem when you have dynamic
dynamically created content so here in
the purifier options whitelist you could
specify which classes to always ignore
and in this case you see I have some
routes of stuff here and so actually you
have to go for your whole web
application and see what pricks and what
doesn't but with this with this couple
classes I was already able to make
everything runnable and be fine and here
you can see that I commented it out it's
a very boss true flag and this would
actually tell you how much percent
percentage of your bundle got cleaned
out and in our case this was about 30 to
40 percent so this is definitely
something that you want to do and what's
also very handy is that purifies users
also is able to minify your CSS bundle
are there any questions so far okay so
what the terminal back workflow I see a
lot of people just using the plain old
fashioned it always pains me it always
pains me when I see that you have to go
through the history and you don't know
maybe you'll find this command or maybe
you will never find it because you typed
it on some other laptop or something so
I'm a big fan of the set shell some of
you maybe know it it's quite popular it
has like 68,000 stars and I put like the
installation guide for you on there and
also installing the Oh message framework
what the framework actually does is it
gives you the options to have different
themes very easily and gives you the
options to use a lot of custom plugins
and for example you can see here what I
use is the Moran theme and what I like
is when I like for example I'm I really
like to see the whole path of where I am
actually right now and what I like of
course is is that it shows me the git
branch and it shows me if I have changes
in my git branch and I'm just really I'm
really quite happy with this and what I
also did here is same with your bash RC
you have here
said she'll our sieve and again here my
theme is it says here my phim and the
link also goes to all themes that are
out there and there's a on of them
so you can definitely find something
that you will enjoy I want a light one
oh I think there's light ones oh yeah no
I think there is no light one actually
but this depends of well this trip
distance well well it's feeling the
functionality of it so I guess you would
still like me I set it to background
Ubuntu star so that's it and also here I
have like some examples of the plugins
that I use and their kind is linking to
all the plugins that are out there
there's also stuff for daca and get
aliases crazy stuff and what I
especially like is this called VD it's
called buy warp directory and the way I
use this would be I type VD and then a
tab and I get all the possible war
points that I saved myself so this will
bring me to the desktop and let's say I
want to go back into the project I would
type via front end behavior front end
and I'm back again on this on this one
or like vs the back end so in this case
I would go back to via and the other
thing that's very convenient is called
last working directory so when I make a
new tab I'm always back into what is
open in my other terminal window so
these two things I really appreciate a
lot and what I also have here is says
set shell auto suggestions and syntax
highlighting and the way you can see it
here let's say I write get status it's
fine it works but if a white get status
it's already highlights it me in red and
tells me you don't have a global library
installed that's called get and then of
course it flows to the command not found
and what I also like is let's say you
have this really long commands like this
one so you already see in the like the
history auto completion is in line
basically so when I put the red arrow
key down then you you have it expanded
and you can use it
so this enables me to really easily and
fast firstly see what I have what I have
written so far like you see here I can
go basically to or my things easily and
don't have to type in the history and
look for it or whatever yeah and I set
my like suggested style to yellow but
this can already or this can depend on
what kind of background color you have
that is nicely for you yeah because I
don't like typing dr. Campos up and
built I wrote like this you and TCP into
the CH RC so this is also something you
could do like work a lot with aliases
and make some commands easier that you
use frequently yeah you probably saw by
now I'm using dishes to decode and I'm a
big fan and I don't know why there's
webstorm licenses today what I like
about vias code is that is really nice
and transparent like you can find
anything you want on the github
repository and they release monthly
iterations of updates to their vs code
and here for example we could look into
the one for April and it and you can see
here what they have planned like all the
check boxes here what they plan on
adapting and improving and they always
take a lot of feedback from the
community and like for example if you
notice when you do changes in in Adam
you always get it higher when you save
it you have it highlighted in yellow or
when you add some stuff to quit ignore
you have it in grey like rate out and
this was not the Aaron vs code up until
probably half a year and they said that
the community said okay we want this
definitely and they made it work so they
really listened mm-hmm to what the
people actually want and you can of
course also look into the iteration plan
always and see if there's something
coming up that you're really interested
in and in case you definitely don't want
to wait there's the insiders version and
basically you could always build a new
version as soon as they push a new
commit into the master branch of theirs
so you could install the vs code
insiders version and always be up to
date but this could also lead to
breaking breaking things so this I would
only recommend if you want to
file back reports for them if you want
to contribute to to the via Skype or
something like that yeah so these are my
settings so far in visuals to decode so
if you want to install it blank and you
want to have something up and running
already I would give this to you so I
will suggest to you something that I
like or that I think is necessary
by default Visual Studio also gives you
angular 1 suggestions in the HTML so I
disabled this and also here like again
it's the force aligned what else is
there yeah for example what's also I
think this is not very long into envious
code yet but you can actually use your
views code capabilities to type-check
JavaScript so that's really convenient
so it will tell you you have a string
but you should use a number stuff like
that that's also really nice when you
work on a back-end project and you
discover what errors they have in there
and what I also like is for example
let's say you're working that you have
your development branch open or your
master branch and then in the meantime
they have there were a lot of changes so
this one like it auto fetch it always
gives you the newest version of it
yeah and one thing to keep in mind if I
brought like a hint here this files
exclude on the top here so for me it was
annoying to have some files to placate
or you you only want to if you want to
if you search for index at email you
don't want to have the one in your
compiled panda stuff like that so you
only want to have the extra files that
you want to work on but what this also
does is it hides it in the file tree of
years code so what the problem I had is
there was a package lock that always got
committed and I was like where is this
package locked because I had it excluded
here and so that is for something to
keep in mind not to do yeah here also
listed for you all the plugins that I
have the extensions and yeah this is of
course opinionated so maybe you don't
need PostgreSQL or you don't need Apache
something like that and the way you
could install it is just write code
install extension flag and then the
author name and the extension or you can
just do it
with the offer name or the extension
envious code itself yeah and one thing I
like especially much is this setting
stink it's called mmm so when you have a
key topic count you can upload your
local settings and this s let's say you
work on your laptop here and then you go
back at home and then you can easily
download all the settings again so it
has all your extensions or your settings
or your key bindings and you have it
nice and clean through a gist on github
yeah some other resources that I have
here for you is angular start the
boilerplate so yeah I'm not we're not
using the angular CLI what angular start
the boilerplate this is it's like the
most most supported I would say like ten
thousand like there's a lot of angular
repos that stopped putting out new
content and updating them because of the
angular CLI but this one is still quite
popular I would say yeah eleven days ago
so that's fine and now there right now
working on upgrading it to angular six
and web pick for this of course is like
a big change again so if you want to
depend on an external boilerplate
template this would be a good one and
you had a France app I saw actually at
the door that the guy from France is
working in the first in the upper floor
so I'm a big fan of what it open it I'm
actually a big fan of the France app
what this gives you it's not really
related to web development but you could
definitely improve your workflow with
all your social with the services you
use so let's say you have a slack
channel let's say you have a Trello
board or your work email something like
that you could have fit easily in one
electron window and switch tabs on the
on the left side here and always be up
to date with something happened and you
don't will not miss your emails or stuff
like that because I always had to open
my Gmail in a Chrome window and then in
your chrome window in your chrome window
we actually want to develop stuff and it
always gets tangled up so this is a nice
clean way of working or having it
separately yeah that was my talk thank
you for your attention</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
