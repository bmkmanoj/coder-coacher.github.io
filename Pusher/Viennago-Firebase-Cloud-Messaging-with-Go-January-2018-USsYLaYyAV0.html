messaging raise your hand if you reduced
it before anyone okay four okay great
with an Android app and okay great
so what five basic out messaging is is
it's a service offered by a firebase a
cloud company sort of that lets you
deliver messages to mobile devices and
and websites so we'll start with a
little history because there have been
multiple versions of this service in
2010 there was android cloud-to-device
messaging it was focused on Android and
Chrome extensions later on they renamed
it basically to Google Cloud messaging
it's the same service also for Android
and and Chrome extensions the first
service doesn't exist anymore
the service was shut down in 2015 or
something Google Cloud messaging still
exists but all websites now link to
firebase cloud messaging which was in
yeah announced in 2016 at Google i/o and
it sort of didn't way with the fees you
had to pay for sending a certain amount
of messages because Google Cloud
messaging you have to pay until once you
reach the certain limit of messages so
yeah what can we do with it so first of
all we can send notifications so they
are just a title text and that's
basically it and they automatically
display it on the on the device and yeah
so that's it that's basically just text
you can also send simply data so you can
send your own structure basically and
have it contain whatever you want which
makes for limitless possibilities what's
also important is that not only can you
send whatever you want you can send it
to whoever you want you can send it to
individual devices identified by their
tokens you can send it to certain topics
so users can subscribe to topics like
politics and you can send messages to
everyone who's up
tribe to politics you can send it to
certain apps because you can have iOS
apps Android apps web apps you can have
multiple of those and you can send it to
certain platforms so you can choose
which platform gets this all right I
think there's a slight missing okay so
the way we send a notification is that
we can do it via the console where we
just enter information about what text
we want to send and when we want to send
it into which app we want to send it and
it simply received by the by the Android
iOS a web app so that's the really
simple way to engage with your users
through a firebase cloud messaging all
right so really love examples is we
could use it to write an app that lets
your users know if their friends are
nearby so you can send a notification if
your server finds out that the distance
between two clients is I don't know like
15 meters and they're friends and yeah
you could let them know you could build
a chat app and notify the users if
they've received a message and you can
also notify them that their favorite
series has a new season available when
to use it so that's mostly what I would
personally recommend you should or could
use it if you really want to have easy
development if you don't want to invest
too much time in making your own
implementation basically of this and
having a connection between yourself
between your client and your server that
you have to manage yourself if you want
battery efficiency because the firebase
calc messaging service uses a single
connection for all apps that use it so
that's a connection that's basically
initialized once and it stays open and
has a heartbeat that lets you know if
the connection is still alive and yeah
it's just a single connection and yeah
so you also have lower data consumption
because of a single connection when not
to use it is basically just if you
really need to have to control because
it's out of your control if the services
are down it's out of your control if
anything changes about the firebase
Scout messaging service it's out of your
control
or if you
when the messages arrive or if they
arrive at all so you can't do anything
about it if you don't drive that's yeah
bad luck so a little overview about how
it works I'm sure some of you already
know that concept it's basically just it
starts with step one that the mobile
client registers with the firebase cloud
messaging service it gets back a token
that that identifies the to the firebase
cloud messaging service it can send that
token to your own server that's that's
us and we can store the token in a
database in release or just in memory if
we want to and we can then use this
token we have to send a request to the
firebase cloud cloud messaging service
and send it to the client with that ID
and the service of firebase will do the
rest basically so we don't have to do
too much so how would we go about
implementing this so first we have to
start by creating a project we have to
define a name and we have to choose a
region for our project yeah then we add
our app we can choose an iOS app an
Android app web whatever and we have to
define the package name of that Android
app so it can be identified later on we
have we can give it a nickname and we
then download a config file that can be
added to our Android or iOS project and
that lets the the library that you use
for using firebase on the client-side
lets it communicate with the firebase
service through this config file so next
we have to get an API key so there are
three API is at the moment for firebase
Cloud messaging there's an legacy HTTP
API there's a new HTTP API and there's
an XMPP API so for this example this is
the old HTTP API because it's a lot
simpler and you don't you only need a
single token for your server so you can
get this token through the firebase
console and you basically use it in your
code to identify that this is the server
and
you're allowed to send messages to that
kind so ingo itself we would define a
message as a struct give it the fields
it needs to send messages to certain
kind so this is all you need basically
you could even leave out the two field
at the very top and just get away with
the string string array and put in the
data as the IDS you have the tokens you
want to send to and the data you can use
you can put in whatever you want you can
you could replace it with anything so
yeah you have a lot of freedom then we
create a HTTP request we put our data in
send it to the firebase URL you can get
that on the through the firebase console
and then we add the the authorization
header at the server key we got before
from the firebase console and send off
the request and the firebase servers
will do the rest and deliver the the
message it's I think a hundred and
twenty milliseconds at most for 99% of
messages or something like that so yeah
I have an example prepared with an
Android app that receives notifications
and the server where we can send
notifications so we'll start by running
the server
all right now we have the server running
it's basically just an HTTP server that
has a single route where the client can
register and once it does we have two
token and we can send messages through
the input here so we'll just restart the
Android app which will then call the HD
HTTP server
route and register or token gonna make
this alright so this is the app it
should now have registered with our
server it did so now we have to talk in
stored in this case for this example I
just started in in memory basically in
in the map and yeah so now going to tap
a message it sends out the message to
all the tokens I have stored in memory
so in this case just one and we can do
hello Vienna go meet up and you get a
response from the server that notifies
you if your message was received if it
was if it has failed and why it may have
felt in this case it was successful
yeah so this is here you can see the the
entire message that sent off to the
server which contains the token we
received from from the app and the date
that we have and now if we switched oops
if we switch the app we can see that we
have received the message so the thing
is that it's really simple to send
notifications through the service the
alternative to this is of course you
can't have a TCP connection a WebSocket
connection that you initialize once with
a background service for your Android
app and sent these messages yourself and
keep the connections alive to the server
but it's a lot of work for something
that you that others have already
implemented for units free so it's also
the recommended way from Google for
Android at least and the Android studio
has has an extra tool basically for
putting
Android firebase cult messaging into
your Android app and right let's
continue yeah that's it so if there any
questions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
