line scripts with nodejs yeah so have I
and they're a right pain in the ass to
do because you have to use this thing
read line right those of you don't know
about this check it out read line it
allows you to write command line scripts
and the reason why it's cool to do this
instead of things like bash scripts is
you write them as nodejs scripts and
they'll run in any platform so they'll
run on OS X and Windows as well as Linux
II just write the one thing so I've been
I've been working on some scripts for
installer scripts for the stuff I talked
about last month and the trouble with
this stuff is that it's asynchronous
which is fine if you ask one question
but as soon as you ask multiple
questions you know you're into callback
hell and figuring out how to do this and
particularly if someone makes a mistake
and you you know that you've got to
validate it and you say well what want
to ask a question again and I was just
getting sick of this and what I want to
share with you is something I literally
discovered yesterday which is what I
want to do this where I suggested this
to Adam and that is this guy does anyone
know about this red line sync it's
bloody marvelous fantastic yes now I can
write sensible command line scripts
which if you think about it and when
you're running a command line script
you're the only guy on the process right
you you know concurrency isn't an issue
on this so why you write in asynchronous
and synchronous is so much easier for
this and the guy who I don't know who's
written this but he's a genius because
he's done things like it's not just a
simple question that you can ask he's
written all these things for email
addresses and passwords and file names
and file paths and they're all like
built-in and they just work and so let
me see if I can show you one running
here great it's all resized
this is a script I've been writing so
here I am requiring read lines sync and
I'm asking for a filename and I say it's
a file name not a date you can ask for
directories with directory paths or
files so this is question path and this
exists as false this will say that the
file mustn't exist right and down here
I'm asking for a password so I used
question new password and I want to have
a default for it and so on I just want a
simple question here I want to ask for
an integer a port number right and again
here and this look at this this is a
check list so I want key select so it'll
use this object right so let me run this
guy so a run builder so I'll is asking
for the file name if I put in one that
exists then I'll say already exists and
it'll just keep asking the question so
I've got to say one that doesn't exist
now I'll ask me for a password and if I
put in something else you know it's all
built in it's fantastic it's just
marvelous so
now you get through to the boat you get
the idea the trouble with a checkbox
this guy is you can't even break it
can't control see it what do I do
Christ it was all going so well I can't
remember and anyway I checked check this
out read line sync just don't enter
passwords that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
