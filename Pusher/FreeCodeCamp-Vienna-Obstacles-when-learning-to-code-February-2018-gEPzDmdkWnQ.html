can find me on most of things that Rob
axelsson I'm a software developer by day
by profession I learned to code mainly
be a free code camp meetup we are at now
is for free code camp dot org and I also
organize meetups this meetup here and
also of IANA Go Go like meet up and view
jazz Vienna when I really love being
around the open-source and developer
geek community so I keep doing this
because it's ultimately fun if you want
to learn more about mine and Daniel's
journey to going from learn to code and
getting a first developer job you can go
to my website and there's a link to our
talk there okay so let's go straight
into it the first obstacle that you
might meet and to preface it these
obstacles are mainly based on my own
experience and talking to people
fellow coach students this is by no
means as of this talk an exhaustive list
so please feel free again in the
questions section to ask we'll leave
room for questions after the talk so
when you're dealing with time the time
might be an issue because I think
starting out is easy to think that oh
you know I'll put like three weeks into
this and I really focus and maybe I
learn a lot and then you realize after
three months that oh god there's so much
to learn so there's different ways that
time can hit you in the face but I think
there are some things to keep in mind do
not get too overwhelmed or too impatient
one thing is to accept that learning
takes time yes it doesn't take too long
to learn the basics of programming
that's one thing that I struggle with on
the opposite of time was that I thought
it would take both the mind of a genius
you know what's it called prodigy or a
really really long time and math skills
to learn to program but I kept having to
face that myth or misconception and I
gradually learned that no it's easier to
learn I thought to learn the basics
but once you have the basics what you
really need to focus on is repetition
repetition and getting better and just
doing a lot so things will take time but
to get the basics and get up to speed it
doesn't necessarily have it takes a long
time but just manage your expectations
and that learning the code it's not
something to do on a whim and you need
to be ready to commit maybe you know
several months a half a year a year
depending on what you want to get out of
programming if you want to learn to code
definitely think longer than two weeks
in learning to code you can also get
trapped into spending too much time on
stuff that might you might realize
afterwards weren't giving you as much I
weren't as beneficial to you so you
should instead of forcing yourself to
stick with the course you found you
should rather try and try different
courses different books different
different learning formats and see what
works for you and what some of the
combinations of resources and courses
and curriculum and teachers etc might
speed up things for you so don't be
afraid to experiment again realistic
time frame we already talked about and
it helps to form helpful habits so
instead of sitting down and forcing
yourself to learn for two hours if you
have habits in place and routines where
it's not an issue it's not a struggle to
get started it makes it easier it's not
easy to form habits it takes commitment
in the beginning but once it's habits it
makes it it's a habit it's much easier
just to get going daft
is one thing that you can be faced with
I think especially when you're thinking
about applying for jobs even when you've
got your first job or when you've
started study like I had a wall after
like three four months of starting if we
go camp I was like god dammit can I
really do this there's so much left to
learn
I loved eating success stories for
breakfast I still do there's tons of
success stories and free code camp the
medium publication if you just google it
online there's so much stuff out there
just talk to people
the audience today and just remember
that everyone started somewhere so even
the most you know accomplished developer
out there or even the most accomplished
speaker such less persona and whatever
pick your programming language stage
started somewhere some people yes
started when they were almost starting
to walk in us like four or five year
olds but most people started later in
life and there's tons of success stories
of people starting when they were twenty
thirty forty fifty there was recently a
great article by Quincy Larson the
founder of free code camp on just that
topic even for experienced developers
Google is your best friend so if you're
doubting how to do this someone else
probably have also asked the same
question can I really do what I was
tasked to do right now or what I chose
to create so don't be afraid to Google
all the time the only entity haters it
depends a bit about on your family and
your friends I've been blessed to not
have so many people questioning why I
was learning to code or what what's why
have you learning to code and stuff like
this but I know some people had that
issue and it's not easy to just ignore
them if their important part of your
life but don't give them too much that
their opinions too much value and yes
you can we have again success stories
tons of stories here today of people
that have dealt with doubt and still
have overcome and managed to learn to
code resources mentioning this it ties
into some of the other things we've
discussed when you are faced with doubt
or time constraints also in the
beginning but when you are hitting a
wall and feeling like oh free code camp
this may be not for me or you're doing
another online course or you're reading
a book and you're getting stuck don't be
afraid to question the resource that you
are using to learn to code I
supplemented free code camp first with
eloquent JavaScript a book and then
gradually more with udemy video courses
but just don't be afraid to experiment
this tons of free resources there's tons
of cheap courses
so the main focus on how to deal with
resources is don't be afraid to test out
things and switch it up but on the other
flipside don't get too fragmented like
there's the shiny object syndrome of
course you might try to buy every new
fancy course and think that that's going
to be the blue tail that's going to get
you from A to B in two weeks doesn't
work like that but find something that
works for you and when you find
something stick with it
it can also help to have a mentor it's
not always so easy to find an absence of
that Co students can be in my experience
really good to just meet regularly at
meetups take an initiative to meet
people for coffee and some talking about
code to you know give each other
feedback and to have this social sort of
pressure to when you meet someone the
next time oh I should have completed
that JavaScript calculator let me just
do that before I meet them tomorrow and
their programming is worth trying if you
haven't there's a lot of online
communities where you can meet people
and pair program for a session you can
also meet people in real life pair
programming is sitting together with
someone else and coding on the same
thing on one screen normally just to not
bore you too much I took in a bonus
point here an obstacle we're learning to
code can be vim if you don't know what
women is it's a code editor in the
terminal spin around since the beginning
of the UNIX times or not so long but
it's been around for a couple of decades
and it's infamously infamous for being
hard to exit out of so if you just open
it up and you don't know how to exit out
of it you probably will not figure out
and you close your terminal but this is
more of a joke than a real obstacle if
you want to know how to exit them this
is how you exit them just to have that
included
so you literally just to escape to have
the command section and then you have :
q an exclamation mark but you might be
normally fine without the exclamation
mark it sounds simple but on the other
hand it sounds may be unnecessary when
you just gonna exit something so let's
get back on track distractions it's
another thing as we're emitting in life
especially with the infamous Millennials
and all the distractions we have these
days it's easy to sit down and you were
going to learn to code today and then
two hours later you've been checking
everything on YouTube and all the latest
JavaScript news or whatever it's a bit
tricky one because again for me what
helps the most is I realized the one
thing I haven't put here I'll mention
that but its habits again if you manage
to do stuff for the right reasons and
also form the habits that you need to
have the routine that works for you like
every Friday like every morning for 20
minutes at lunch or in the evening
before you watch your favorite TV series
or whatever that you just stick with
some routines and routines and follow
them I like really the routine of just
sticking with free code camp and getting
the points and getting the brownie
points if I help people at free core cam
torg via the chat room you get brownie
points with people thank you I'm just
kind of kept like wanting that
statistics of my points to go up that
was the motivating force one thing I
didn't put up here is that it helps to
know I got distracted so I forgot what
it was so we'll get back to that and
then again to the better resources I
think that's the theme of this talk now
but if you get distracted it might be
because the course is not the best fit
for you maybe you would do better
reading a book for an hour than for
following something video or maybe
tutorials we get to do stuff as you go
along is better for you and so on and
also one thing yeah that's actually it
is here but just didn't realize the
thing that I forgot is work on your why
so
you feel lacking motivation or being
distracted too easily it might be
because you're lacking motivation we
need to learn to code you might rethink
why you're learning to code and if it's
really the right thing for you now maybe
it's a better fit in a year to be honest
something happened you're like oh no I
need to do this for other reasons but if
you don't either have the passion for
programming code these kind of things or
you have the right ways to do it it will
be harder it's just a fact so you can
still do it you just need to figure out
how to work on that for you I've been
blessed that I've been loving computer
since I could walk and tap on keyboards
I just didn't get into programming until
the last yeah recently well both will
say the questions were after because we
are filming so it's not so easy to take
the questions during the filming but
just keep them if you had some getting
stuck again we've covered this sort of
and we've covered switching up one thing
I want to focus on is that if you feel
like you're you were committing to a
course or a material and you're like
yeah but I can't give up I'm so invested
in this for whatever reason it's fine
you can just stop try something else
and it might work you might even return
to where you were because you learned
something from a different perspective I
had that experience with eloquent
JavaScript reading that for several
chapters and I got the same things that
I were explained in free code camp
curriculum in a different way and it was
like aha now I felt more equipped to
tackle the course afterwards
debugging is a thing where it depends on
what you're coding in it depends a bit
on you and how strict you are on
debugging with debugging tools in the
beginning or not there are different
opinions on this but whichever way you
are debugging with your language with
your tool set of tools
it helps getting better at figuring out
why your code is not working right now
Google again as we talked about if
you're doing front-end
the chrome developer tools and getting
better at breakpoints and debugging have
a debugger as a as variable name or like
a method that you hook into your
JavaScript and it stops in the browser
to give you the to stop in time where
you are debugging and those kind of
things help if you don't know much about
this and I've had problems coding look
into debugging just google it what helps
for me sometimes and there's been done
Studies on this if you are coding and
you feel stuck and this could be
professionally or learning to code it
might be good with the context switch
where you just force yourself to be like
but I mean in the middle of this I can
make this work and then you're an hour
later I can make this work and you're
like okay stop just take a break 10 to
15 minutes go for work do something
entirely different and you might be like
but now and then you go back to it or
just the fact that you had a break you
go back and you look at it through fresh
eyes very often helps ya Google again
okay so for one of the last points I
think it's the last obstacle we're going
over today is deflation you might be
like Oh goddamn it I've I've been trying
to learn to code for like one week three
months half a year or more and you feel
like yeah you need some motivation
you're like maybe it's not for me or
whatever in my experience it helps to go
to meetups or to socialize with others
again about that also are learning to
code sometimes it might have to be
proactive for me and also no Donny
Danielle it helps to look at
motivational talks documentaries I love
these kind of success stories again or
seeing like how this you know seven year
old kid that was a programming prodigy
got into college early and just conquer
the world with his iOS apps and those
kind of things and I'm like if he can do
that I can certainly get further in my
course material and stuff like this
yeah and ultimately your why so if
you're if you're kind of stuck ask
yourself why am I doing this
maybe I try to do some self motivation
cool just to make this talk even more
exciting we are hiring at my company I
mentioned this before but we're still
hiring a front end / full stack
developer we are also looking for a
back-end the profile for both is a bit a
little bit more experienced because yeah
that's the general gist I have a look or
send us an email if you are interested
in if you feel you don't have enough
experience
feel free to still approach me or send
an email or look at the website it might
still be worth a look for you yeah I
worked there I yeah do JavaScript
front-end stuff with VJ s mainly at the
moment cool I think yes I think that was
it before we end I want to reinforce and
I'll follow this up with putting a repo
in the comment sections because I want
this talk to be something that people
can contribute to I realized giving this
talk that there's a lot of
repetitiveness and there's some stuff
that I could maybe when I talking about
it could want to add myself if people
have stuff they would like to add or
feel they can contribute with help on
how to overcome obstacles you're free to
help with this talk for the future thank
you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
