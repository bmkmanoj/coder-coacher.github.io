the room hi dad once had a go at me
saying Jess every single talk you've
ever given is a very very happy voice
talk about how everything in technology
is terrible
so please enjoy some spoilers so my name
is Jessica rose I'm originally you may
be able to tell from the state's a long
time ago and I'm working at futurelearn
now it's fantastic if you're a front-end
developer and you love developing for
the front-end
I hear that made by many may be hiring
if you want to do sort of some op C
stuff instead and you want to learn new
things around that maybe come and chat
to me afterwards see me after class and
the first thing I want to talk to you
about is what's fantastic about working
in technology working in technology has
a lot of things especially when you look
at other industries that are glorious
the average software engineer makes
$70,000 a year
that figures garbage that figure is
absolutely unhelpful this the average
software engineer makes $70,000 a year
has nothing to do with our experience
hey if I'm in San Francisco and I'm
giving this talk this is fine this is
not San Francisco I want to talk to you
about what's great about working in
technology here in London here in London
the average software engineer makes
about 43,000 pounds
do we feel okay with that anybody want
to read some out raised eyebrows Oh see
this isn't fantastic for everybody not
all of us have our own sports cars but
this is 10,000 pounds higher than the
average salary here in London it's the
last question right before we broke was
saying do you know what there are so
many developer rules unfilled one in
four tech roles here in London are going
to go unfilled this year the official
national unemployment rate is four point
three percent but for young people which
we've got a bunch in the crowd it's 11
almost 12 percent relative to other
industries
we're incredibly lucky in technology
remote work who here gets to work
remotely Oh some of the time all the
time is it great oh that's great because
the person had a hand I was just like
who here has a dress code oh is it like
we're close generally speaking a lot of
us can rock into work wearing
essentially whatever we want the
opportunities start your own business we
aren't in San Francisco there's not free
money on every corner is there I'm
getting a lot wrong here there's a lot
of people who are like no there's free
money there's this but we do have a lot
of opportunities for investment you've
got a weird opportunity to do something
you genuinely care about maybe you work
in accountancy software and maybe you
don't dream about accountancy software
but with one in four tech jobs being
unfilled and with open-source projects
with side projects you genuinely have
the opportunity to either spend some of
your free time building something that
legitimately changes the world or you
have the opportunity to get paid for
something you genuinely believe in this
is glorious you meet so many engineers
so many techies who've really
internalized that you say hey I'm really
lucky I must be great I'm a genius I
deserve all of this everything's
wonderful quite and it's tempting to go
that way
working in tech for many people not for
everybody is pretty good relative to
other industries it's fantastic and
talking about that it's incredibly easy
to overlook that a lot of times tech
doesn't work for everyone and working in
technology isn't always well-suited for
people working in tech isn't always
designed for the way humans like to work
who here works someplace that has don't
raise your hands especially if your
co-workers here just like it
sarcastic eyebrows who here works
someplace that has a ton of crunch time
you get a lot of it's not unpaid because
there's a beer fridge but there's some
overtime right who has ever encountered
burnout oh oh there's like actual hands
going up or you can raise your hands if
you like as well who here has a
difficult time with work/life balance
within technology we often have a
terrible terrible time with that and
within technology discrimination
harassment or active problems that exist
so as the spoiler said everything in
technology is terrible but great
relative to some other things and it can
be really overwhelming you say
everything is terrible forever I'm just
gonna flip my table over I quit
there's nothing I can do it's a huge big
problem rawr and it is a big problem and
there are big problems and I've been
thinking about what we can do that small
and measured that has immediate impacts
who here knows about progressive
enhancement it just make a loud murmur
well good progress on the count of three
please yell your favorite one sentence
definition for progressive enhancement
one two three no no we're not laughing
at you were laughing at me thinking that
was gonna work one two three
y'all are terrible I'm talking about
progressive enhancement for the way we
work your workplaces and maybe slowly
for tech as a culture are we okay with
this fix what you can when you can do a
little more when you have the man with
fix the stuff that probably won't break
things
you're a lot too you're up here when we
were laughing at me so I'm gonna talk
about things we can do as individuals
that immediately make our working lives
better and then I'm going to talk about
things we can do as company
can we maybe maybe eyebrows instead of
raising your hands so nobody jumps on
you who here is a manager or a boss who
runs your own thing y'all are terrible
and not raising your hands you're just
like you as individuals we have a
fantastic opportunity to mentor tutor
and champion if you're for coming into
the industry and you're brand new and
you're asking how do I find a job how do
I learn this what is networking like
having somebody willing to step up and
walk me through this can be an
incredible wonderful experience taking
the time if you know about what's going
on spotlight the people who are doing
great work taking the opportunity to say
hey do you know what I'm working in the
elixir community it's fantastic here are
great resources here great information
hi I've been working for this company
I can unreservedly recommend working for
them that's okay this is an immediate
positive thing we can do that costs us
nothing wherever you can and wherever
it's not a huge cost do outreach beyond
technology
who here has family that thinks that
you're a magician you're like oh what
what is such-and-such do o computers but
websites but not talk about what you do
and the talk about the opportunities in
technology in ways that are
understandable for folks who don't work
in tech it's really tempting to make
yourself sound very very clever and
important what do you do huge pile of
technical jargon I mean your blowhard
auntie at Christmas yeah go for it but
if you're talking to folks where you
want to say I do this I help build
websites for cultural institutions I
help build learning tools I help speed
up the way people use the internet
talking about things like that in
accessible way is talking about how you
got into it can really help grow the
pool of people who got into tech for the
first time who here had a traditional
computer science degree you went at
who here self trained or got into tech
through weird way is amazing
just by saying here's what I do in real
understandable ways you're giving new
people opportunities to join you and
you've got the opportunity as an
individual to make suggestions you can't
do big company changes on your own
unless you're the big boss but you can
say I'd love if we could do this
there was a really angry woman giving a
talk last night who told us to do that
there are really fantastic opportunities
to you for you to steer not just your
company but the tech communities you
exist in and I've helpfully color-coded
the stuff you can do with no risk and
light-blue I've got a couple slightly
higher risk ones you can as an
individual working in technology you can
clearly set and enforce your boundaries
hi I need you to work late again tonight
you know just crunch time it'll be just
three four more weeks
sprint and a half that's fine one in
four tech jobs is unfilled you can
absolutely say no they're probably not
gonna fire you but by that probably has
a lot of wiggle room in it but by
setting and enforcing these boundaries
you're immediately making your life
slightly more difficult there's gonna be
some conflict there's gonna be some
pushback but you've got the potential to
make your own personal working life a
lot better and if you're clearly setting
these boundaries you're making things
better for your co-workers as well libel
laws a this the same way I want you
spotlighting great places to work great
communities to work with and great
people to associate with whoever has
worked for someplace that you wish
someone had warned you about so I was
again hoping for eyebrows before like
give people a gentle heads-up you don't
have to do this in a way that it could
expose yourself to legal liabilities you
can infer quite a bit
oh you're interviewing with company X Y
Z X Y Zed I've heard things about them
good things things you're tapping to
people who are fairly smart give them a
heads-up like oh you're getting involved
with this community I hear they have a
lot going on use judicious eyebrows and
where you can challenge inappropriate
behavior
don't just warn people you might not
want to hang out with that person or you
might not want to work for that company
saying very clearly and in a calm even
tone that's not the way we do things I
wouldn't expect you to speak to someone
like that
having your having your employees work
overtime every week isn't cool it's not
appropriate you're getting a really
fantastic opportunity not just to set
your own boundaries but to set the
expectations of what you have for people
around you those very excited people who
are like I've got my own company I can
do whatever I want here's what I would
like you to do set very clear policies
around working hours and overtime there
are absolutely times where you need just
a little bit more you've got a deadline
it's inflexible this has to happen be
very clear with your employees and very
clear with your teammates about why
there's X expectation you need some kind
of consensus yes this is worth it to us
and make those times rare and beautiful
you can't just say I want everyone to go
home at insert arbitrary but appropriate
time here as leadership you actually
have to do it as well
you have to turn off slack you have to
stop answering emails you have to set
the
example that you want your employees to
lead you've also got the opportunity to
do outreach into communities that are
not currently represented in your talent
if you look around and everybody at your
table looks like you and sounds like you
and things like you not only are you
probably not getting enough ideas enough
diversity of thought as it were but
you're also really limiting the pool of
opportunities to folks who think like
you and share your ideals a couple years
ago I was incredibly pleased with myself
I hired the only all-female develop
developer relations team I had ever seen
there were four of us we were hanging
out it was fantastic we went out for
drinks after work when it slowly
horrifyingly dawned on me that I had
hired a bunch of Jessi's we all like the
same thing we had all gone to pretty
much the same kind of school we all got
along fantastically and I had done a
terrible job in hiring make sure that
you're looking for where other
developers where other technologists are
and what kinds of opportunities you can
make more available to them it's
incredibly difficult to quantify what
you mean by doing a good job but make
sure that you're hiring and make sure
you're promoting people based on very
very clear formula if you're
interviewing ask P ask everyone the same
questions and score them we really like
to think we're logical people following
logical processes but if you have
interviews and ask folks whatever comes
to mind oh wow what did you do in your
last project how is this huh you're just
making a gut choice on like well that
person was really cool I'm gonna hire
them they sounded really good ask the
same questions and give people the same
opportunities to interact with you audit
salaries for fairness whoo and you can
eyebrows a raise your eyebrows if you
want who's ever left a job because you
found that you were being paid less than
someone else I know right your talent
will absolutely leave you
if you're under paying them and they
deserve to leave you if you're under
paying them if anybody here is getting
paid less than your co-workers like
please meet me for a free beer after
class where possible and where you can
seek out and remove the bad actors
does anybody know about the missing
stare concept cool it's saying the
missing stare concept is the idea that a
lot of times in families or
organizations or social groups we get
really used to working around bad actors
say well don't go to such and such for
feedback because they'll just yell at
you go do this instead go do that
instead instead of having difficult
conversations and doing the difficult
thing of removing people that are
causing damage you caused entire
organizations to work around them
wherever possible listen to people ask
for their feedback and deliberately pull
out those people who are making other
people's lives more difficult offer
support and training if you're an
employer this has immediate benefit
you're teaching people more things
you're teaching people to use a lick sir
or whatever it has an immediate positive
benefit for you when you talk to
developers and you talk to technologists
about why they left their job I found
out I was getting paid less than someone
else so-and-so was a jerk or I wasn't
learning anything are the reasons you
hear again and again this is fantastic
for recruitment this is fantastic for
retention but it's also the right thing
to do and these are all little tiny
things you can do as individuals or as a
company to make your lives
immediately better in ways that slowly
contribute to the tech culture feeling
better you don't have to give up your
entire life and dedicate your life to
the cause but some people absolutely do
some people see the things that are
broken in their company or in their
community or in the tech industry and
give everything up they go and do this
full-time that's also fantastic I don't
mean to sort of convert any of you and
send you rush
to dedicate your lives to making things
better but if there are people doing
that support them where they can this
has been a kind of depressing talk about
how everything's terrible but it's also
great it can be legitimately great not
all of us it's not evenly distributed
but working in tech relative to other
industries we have either incredible
privileges or incredible opportunities
for that but we've developed our
industry in a way that's not always
healthy and doesn't always work well for
people but as individuals or as
companies we can make very very tiny
steps that almost immediately make our
lives less crushingly miserable and
these teeny tiny steps have an
incredible potential to have an overall
cultural change that sucks less things
aren't always fantastic
we don't always work in ways that let us
be the happy geniuses we'd like to be
but they can get a little bit better a
little bit at a time thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
