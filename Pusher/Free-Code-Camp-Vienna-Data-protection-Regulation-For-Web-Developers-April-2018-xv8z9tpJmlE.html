about new this new regulation which i
think is important for pretty much
everybody who interacts with a computer
or some kind of a mobile or IOT
connected device louder okay thank you
right quick quick info about me so maybe
I'll just start with the question who
has heard about general data protection
regulation all right excellent that's
that's actually really good news a
couple of thoughts about me so I've just
started coding
I have also literally I'm on day 96 if
mine 100 days of code challenge I am
since last week the the data protection
officer for the company that I work for
Zimmer Barnett where I work as a
business analyst I in principle have
nothing to do with code but I do handle
the IT infrastructure over there you can
find me on github or on Twitter the
reason why I thought this would be an
interesting topic is is as you clearly
will know is the fact that this new
regulation comes into being in May right
at the 21 and 25th of May and this is
quite important for for all companies
from from the smallest ones to really
like for self-employed from
self-employed to to huge companies I
mean Facebook comes to mind immediately
I think when I say big companies and
data protection let's let's let's just
go right into it so the the the the the
GD P R has been created in order to get
up to date with today's technology right
because there has already been something
in play right if you read here the the
aim is to protect all the you citizens
from privacy and data breaches in our
increasingly data-driven world which is
different from the time when the 1995
directive which has been available until
now
right it's vastly different today the
world we live in today from compared to
that who does it affect this is also
quite important this is it's not just
about companies who are active and
operating in in the EU area but also
companies outside of the U who in some
way collect or process any data any
private data from citizens within the EU
as I've said it's coming into four into
being with the twenty it's going to
start being enforced with the 25th of
May there have been in the media for
example some alarming figures running
around huge fines up to four percent of
your of a company's what's the word the
turnover annual revenue thank you
I have to say that related directly
related to that the the training that
I've attended in the training there have
been different ideas running around so
it's not as strict as it sounds this is
more of a scare tactic there can be
massive fine so if you are Facebook yes
you can you can see something in that
direction if you have a data breach but
for a regular company who for example
has a data breach in terms of losing a
laptop which contains some some private
data of some some customers or some end
users or anything like that I have been
given the example that a fine is around
five hundred euros so if you fail to to
to register this this breach with with
with authorities right
how do we hit about knowing more about
yeah knowing how how to implement this
and actually I'm gonna I'm gonna pass a
very what I think is a very good
checklist so maybe you can have a look
at this this has been downloaded from
the privacy officers website it's in
it's available in German and in English
I'm gonna have the link in the end so
there are some austrian websites which
are which are very well set up and they
have very good information including
forms including how to's and best
practices but generally it's very well
documented on an on a you level so if
you can think of the best documentation
for your favorite let's say programming
language I would say it's on par with
that right so so so just google it and
you will you will come to you will come
to some answer what are we talking about
in terms of data processing so we have
in the programming world is the concept
of crud I would say instead of create
read update and delete we would we would
look at collect read update and delete
so it would start from from gaining a
say access to data all the way to
deleting the data and we will talk more
in more detail about that in a minute
and everything in between what is
personal data this this this is
basically any kind of information that
directly identifies a person regardless
of their role so be it somebody in there
literally role as a citizen or their
role as a employee of company X or Y
this is this is not important this is
irrelevant what is relevant is they can
be identified by it there will be some
differences between countries for
example I've understood that in Germany
a person's work phone and email is also
included in the GDP are so so if you
access to their work email or their work
phone then it is to be treated with with
this yeah regarding the same kind of
rules and regulations I'm not sure if
this is the case in Austria but but it's
a better safe than sorry
idea I would say that's best applied in
this in such cases if we move on
straight like in concrete to talk about
concrete examples regarding the
development web development or
development in general area we have
identifier x' on line so we have IP
addresses we have cookies and I'm sure
you can immediately think of five other
examples if you if you take your
concrete because I've seen many hands in
the air when when the question was asked
who is already working as a web
developer so let's just make this
interactive and see who can think of
other examples from their experience
already at work what can be private
personal data which can be used to
identify a person and they've come
across it either by them realizing oh
we're storing this in our back-end we're
storing this in our cloud database which
which we don't even know if this company
which is providing the cloud database is
compliant with the gdpr
we know we are but we don't know if this
company that is our third party supplier
let's say is or is not so does anybody
have any ideas of concrete examples
maybe from day-to-day work
okay right right okay I yeah I thought
it's it's easier to make it interactive
because because then it's the the
subject the the topic is so dense that
there's no way I can make justice to it
within half an hour or or less or
whatever I don't know how much time I
have
so basically interacting and getting you
to maybe think about it is is actually
better than than just presenting maybe a
quarter of what I what I could present
and then at the end you're left only
with a corner if nobody can think of an
example I'll just move on so I have some
some some some cases here websites right
you're gonna have to have a privacy
policy this has been the case so far but
the way the privacy policy has to look
as different nowadays
into in terms of the GDP are the privacy
policy has to be in simple English if
anybody has read a Wikipedia article in
simple English so it's it has to be
understandable on on any level not just
people who have a degree in law for
example or let's say our masochists and
want to decipher whatever it is that
you've tried to hide in the end in that
in the in the privacy policy terms
registration forms right so so this is
this is the point
the simplest example that I could think
of where you could you would be
collecting the data at that point you
you already have to start thinking about
the entire process right so if you have
a registration form you're gonna ask for
a name you're gonna ask for maybe you're
gonna ask for an email address you're
gonna ask for a phone number this is
enough this is sensitive enough this is
where you have to start thinking okay
what am I going to do with it
so the purpose is very important because
the GDP are on top of what has been
existing so far says that the
documentation of of the data is very
important the documentation of the of
the purpose of the collection of the
data so if you don't have a purpose for
having that data don't don't ask for it
not only that you have to have a purpose
but you have to have you have to be
aware and document how long you're going
to keep the data so you cannot have it
indefinitely if you've fulfilled your
purpose the one that you've already been
stating in your documentation you have
to delete it there is there is there are
a few cases few exceptional cases where
you can actually keep the data for
longer pass the moment of your specified
purpose if we stay with the registration
form right let's say you you're within
your purpose timeline but you've gotten
a call from the person and the person
has asked what kind of data do you have
on me this is the kind of right that the
person has you have to be able to answer
within a specified time line if I'm not
mistaken 72 hours if for some reason
you're running such a huge database that
you you are not able to process this
this request within the 72 hours you can
get a I don't know another 48 I'm not
sure and that's about it so it depends
on what kind of database you're running
but this is where you get to another
point I would say this is a back-end
issue you have to have the technical
means to process such requests within
the required time line if you don't have
the technical means you have to let's
say get them you have to put them into
place
so oh my database does not allow for
such quick processing of such requests
that's that doesn't fly so that doesn't
work I don't know if it worked until now
but it definitely doesn't work starting
with the 25th of May
right so a person asked for the data
let's say that's a simple case what if
they want to transfer their data
whatever it is that you've been storing
so we go let's go on to mobile apps and
let's think that you have you have some
users and one of them is calling you and
says look I want to have my data from
you everything that you've been storing
and I want to download it from you and
move it over to this other provider of
the same service let's say you have to
be able to do that so if you think in
terms of CSV is JSON XML this is the
kind of medium that you're going to have
to provide to be able to provide so that
they can actually port their data to
another system and then what else do we
have so the data Portability deletion
that's a big one because deletion I mean
it affects everything right I've got
backups here the user calls you you tell
him we have your address your phone
number and let's say your your your
surfing habits right he says deleted
please not only are you gonna have to
have a process in place in order to to
perform this this data destruction
properly you're going to have to dock
you to be able to be able to document
that you're gonna have to be able to
prove this - - to whatever inspection
comes your way but you're gonna have to
deal with your backups so again I'm
gonna ask a question if nobody comes up
with a quick answer I'm gonna move on
but who can think of a way to properly
destroy data including that the backups
because yes this is necessary so backups
are not excluded when the person says I
want you to delete all of my date
alright I'm gonna assume that nobody's
in charge of the decision-making of this
of the infrastructure and because
otherwise I imagine you would have
concrete examples of what I'm asking
right now
one example that I found online then
because I definitely don't have any any
I mean IIIi am in charge of the backups
with my company but but only marginally
one example that I found is that you
could have encryption if I understood
correctly you could have an encryption
key first of all when you delete the
data you you should keep the ID of
whatever it is that user had on on them
on a separate file right you have you've
deleted 100 users you should keep their
ID and you should also be encrypt it and
the moment that that they want their
data deleted you should you should know
hold on I'm getting confused now I just
realized the idea sorry but but an
anonymized record because otherwise you
you haven't been yes just the ID I
realize now that the example was
concrete was correct but for the wrong
thing so the reason you keep the list of
ID's is because when you restore from
backup you're gonna have to read elite
that users data in case you haven't gone
into your backup and deleted when he
required when they requested it it's
it's it's a very much a great territory
there because so theoretically you it's
very difficult to delete from your
backup right to go and delete from your
backup everything is possible but
technically and then time wise it's it's
it's quite difficult right so one
possibility is you don't delete from
your backup but you've you're keeping
this list of IDs and the moment you
restore them from your backup so that
you don't run into the trouble of oh
I've got the data again which I have
away which I was supposed to have delete
it you use the ID and Yury delete the
data which is you know related to that
ID and there was another concept about
encrypting and then basically deleting
the encryption key I'm sure you can do
more with that than I do what else do we
have device theft right so I don't know
if this this this is a direct influence
on on somebody who only it works on the
on the on the software side of things
but this is this is a serious data
breach right because the device theft
means you're gonna get access to a
database you're gonna get access to some
systems you're gonna get access to a
hard drive even forgetting about you
know VPNs or whatever if we're talking
about device theft we're talking about
encryption right so I'm gonna I'm gonna
skip over to keep concepts data
encryption for everything if as much as
possible right
because if it's encrypted the moment you
you you present a data breach because
this is how it's gonna supposed to
happen after after gdpr is in place is
in play can I saw did you I thought I
saw you looking at the time how much
time do I have I have no idea okay right
so
where was I encryption right if you have
stuff encrypted you the moment you have
to use the moment you report your breach
you are let's say in a in a much better
position then if you had no encryption
on whatever device you were working with
whatever databases you were programming
setting up and so on and so forth
because if you say there is encryption
even though they have access to the hard
drive it's more difficult or impossible
to actually get to the data that was
stored on it I'm gonna I'm just going to
go back because this idea of mass
monitoring I think is important
mass monitoring the simplest example is
a like a time logger when you come to
work right that's that's a form of
employee monitoring because let's not
forget the I would say the most
important private data that you you are
gonna handle is gonna be your own right
we we immediately think of that those
other people that we gather data on but
actually your own is gonna be equally
important if not more important so when
you go to work you're being monitored in
in theory any form of mass monitoring if
there's any kind of camera at work in
any any any corner that's going to
require starting now with the GPR it's
gonna require a form of risk assessment
and only based on that is it gonna be
possible to move on with with with this
form of mass monitoring and then moving
on to profiling this is super sensitive
profiling is basically any form of
automated decision-making any form of
automated data processing and then
decision-making so if there's no person
literally standing between the the
information and the decision based stop
based on that information then you have
a form of profiling it's it's a whole
different problem basically
ideally you should you should you people
should should should shy away from that
I had a I had a thought in mind and
maybe maybe Daniel actually can help
because I know that he his specialty is
law but let's say the most basic example
of what I would understand as profiling
you have a form where based on let's say
age you filter people out right so that
when they've tried to register as users
you filter everybody under 16 years old
right but you're gonna do that in code
right there's no person saying he's 15
but based on whatever else I'm gonna let
him through so do what are your thoughts
on that hot is that a form of profiling
is that I also thought that it is but
since it was my own example which I
could give myself with the little coat
that I know I thought maybe maybe that's
not a form of profiling but so you take
from there and you go up to machine
learning which is like definitely
profiling let's say if you if you use
any kind of private data to to to feed
and and teach a machine trainer machine
yeah you you have a whole bunch of
things to think about and to to treat
accordingly right key concepts obviously
the consent is is very important so if
you think of the simplest examples in
terms of like people accepting your
cookies it has to be as far as I
understood it has to be an active it has
to be active so if it says if you
continue within the next five seconds
with I'm just making this up with
surfing our webpage this for us means
you've accepted our privacy policy that
is a no-go so it has to be an act
of opt-in right so octane instead of
opt-out for for for me for newsletters
right up until now there were definitely
many cases where the opti the the the
check box was already ticked you're not
allowed to have that anymore absolutely
not it has to be a positive affirmative
affirmative action in order for the
person to agree to be part of whatever
it is that you're gonna process their
data for right consent should be
withdrawal from the users page I'm sure
everybody can think of at least one
example of some webpage where you could
not find how you can delete your users
like your your profile that's again
that's against the law maybe it was
until now
probably it was but definitely this has
been specified right now data protection
by design right before you even start
right coding in your in our case in your
case you're going to have to think about
the entire flow of data and you're going
to have to plan for it so logging of
personal data that's that's in principle
a bad idea if if you do have logs
including personal data the GDP are
states that if it is provable that is it
is in your company's interest to keep
those logs you can do it but you're
going to have to have a very good reason
for it data minimization this is also a
key concept right do not ask for
anything that you do not need to have if
you have a form if you have a
registration form and you're gonna ask
for their income if you're gonna even in
you know bracket it if you're gonna ask
for any kind of superfluous information
better not and this goes back to the DP
by design right think in the beginning
what do you truly need because you have
to think about how long you're gonna
keep it you're gonna have to think about
your your goal and so on and so forth
and all of this if you get an inspection
you're going to have to present with the
appropriate documentation with the
appropriate processes in place pseudonym
ization this is the best way or one of
the easiest way best I'm not sure if
it's easiest but it's definitely one of
the best ways to ensure that you have as
little headache with the gdpr as
possible right if you have if there's no
possibility of identifying a person with
whatever data you've stored then you're
in the green you don't even you don't
even need to worry about the
documentation right and about the whole
process it's probably easier said than
done but it's it's definitely something
to keep in mind
transparency I've put this in because
the easier it is basically for the
end-user to get to know what it is that
you're storing on them what it is that
you're processing and what you're doing
basically with their information the
better it is right the more transparent
you are data encryption for everything
opt in instead of opt outs and H checks
for children under the country's legal
age if I'm not mistaken in Austria it's
like the full ended fully ended
fourteenth year of age you're gonna need
adult permission to gather that their
data right so think about you you're not
you're not screening them you're right
you're not screening the kids in your
registration form but if they are under
15 years of age right how do you get
this adult right adult permission
parents actually adult discs is wrong
it's the parents permission and I was
reading online there was a funny example
of you're gonna have to have a selfie
with the parent because if one thing was
I think one example was the email from
the parent of the parent should should
send an email you know with their
consent but of course the kid can easily
create an email address and and and fake
the
parents permission so stuff like selfie
with the parent and so and so and so
forth there are areas where the GDP are
is is is rather vague so that's why
people are thinking about how to how to
get this done
right sources maybe this is the wrong
order so the official website of the GDP
are would be this one they have like
bullet points on on what has what is
different what has changed I would say
very very useful is the privacy officers
because this is a fine if I'm not
mistaken it's the word for for I'm a
nonprofit organization right which which
is but is is is made up of counselors
people working in law and they provide
there's a forum so they provide answers
to questions and I think they also
prepare forms and and you know
checklists and the steps that are needed
to become compliant and then there is
the dot in cockpit and this is a website
which has been put together because
there is for every big company this I
would say influences you less unless
you're in charge of creating this which
could also be every company is supposed
to have a so called register the fatalis
so far it there there was a central
register where or the all the data had
to flow in terms of this privacy
information that the company stored now
it's it's no longer centralized it goes
into the responsibility of all the
companies of each company individually
and so now most of the companies all the
way down to the self-employed people
they're gonna have to have this kind of
register which documents what do they do
when somebody asks them what kind of
data you have on me or what do you do
what do i do as a company when somebody
asked me to delete their data or what do
i do when they ask me I want to port my
data to Facebook give me whatever you
have on me
so all this documentation with all the
all the you know the the reasons why you
store everything and everything that
we've been talking about all of this has
to be in one big file database in
principle is recommended and they Dalton
cockpit is trying to offer like you know
a solution for that a pre pre like a
ready-made solution for that they're not
they're not really yet fully operational
but I think they will be they said
beginning of April so I'm expecting
anytime now
right yeah I'm done thank you for your
attention I hope I did not absolutely
kill them who here and yeah any
questions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
