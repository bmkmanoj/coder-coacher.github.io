know working like this or all right yeah
yeah so it's not the African or yeah I
mean it's somewhere it's somewhere but I
mean it's really nice sunny place Please
Please with it so yeah so this talk it's
it's pretty much about me I mean how I
ended up here in Vienna in this Meetup
so I mean it'll go a bit back and you
will learn how I ended up here and I
mean for me the last three years step in
the let's say most intense years of my
life and especially this year I mean
this year I I went to like eight to
eight countries I still have one country
left I gave like 20 talks I look I'm
still learning German I'm kind of and I
learned a lot of things I experienced
more than introduced before so it just
does something or at 9-year I'm kind of
writing my third or fourth book at the
moment I got this out earlier this year
it's really heavy book I mean you can
use it as a weapon about job about
against zombies or something but I mean
it's like my final kite is about web
pack I have to popularize the tool I'm a
part of the core team I received my
first award this year I mean I did a lot
of things in three years and the point
is to kind of show how I did it I mean
it's a lot of things I would have loved
to know three years ago before I started
because I was a said a lot of time so
now I'm sharing this I'm trying to share
this wisdom with you so let's get
started
so actually the whole thing started by
by by the fact that I found a blog post
about webpack I was ever ever of the to
lie
I knew the tool but I mean that
documentation was really awful I mean it
was like let's see if I can find it I
mean the point was that you went to web
backside and there's this cube and then
there is this picture and then there is
this code I didn't understand so the
plug post it kind of made me understand
a little bit more and then I understood
that maybe result right kind of cookbook
right back so I mean I started this with
Christian and phony and I mean at this
comment I I was just like we shall do
something about this and it kind of went
from there so I mean I made one comment
and because of that I'm here so I will
discuss a few topics like a
intrapreneurship lifestyle and this
person outside because these are kind of
intertwined because I'm speaking about
personal lifestyle business and what I
learned in the process so let's start
with entrepreneurship I mean this is
really support in Fitness it's great to
use it means trying so when you're an
entrepreneur in Finland you're what one
who tries it tells a lot about the
mentality we have so I mean is just try
and try a bit of my background I mean I
did vocational studies I studied
electronics I mean this is like 2004 so
I went to university the point was to
study more electronics but they quit the
program or whatever so then I went into
software engineering 10 in 2005 there
was this course course in university and
it was about computer graphics I didn't
want to learn Photoshop I didn't want to
learn 3dsmax or something so I started
looking in this open source options like
the Kim or blender I mean blender is
like the whim of trades which it's
really difficult application to learn to
use but I mean I managed to learn to use
it and then I figured that maybe I can
improve this application because I
already know how to program in C and
then I figured that yeah this has been
written in C so I started writing these
little patches for the correct I mean so
I became a maintainer of blender so if
you use blender you have bit of my code
in the application then after University
I ended a free in the free laughing so I
started doing these little gigs for
local clients it didn't work out well
because the pay wasn't good and I mean I
didn't know a lot about business and
then I did some collaboration with
startups that didn't go well I mean I
was kind of stuck so this was like a
dead end for me so a sane person at this
point would have gotten a job
I mean you just go - I mean interview
like today there was this position
you're going interview and you get the
job I mean you get one job I mean 300
types or whatever and they get the job
but I mean the up didn't feel like
something for me so I was like let's do
products let's write books because that
has to be easy like because it's only
writing right so you write and write and
and put it out and hope that it works so
I was like let's do this so I mean of
course it doesn't go that way I mean you
can have just write books and expect a
sell but I think I got a little lucky on
that but I mean on the background why I
decided to start writing I mean there's
the taste comment I made and there's
also this trend because if you look at
JavaScript it's everywhere so it's it's
on most sites on the web NPM exploded so
I mean we have like 500,000 models I
mean in three years we have 1 million
moles so it's a crazy amount of packages
for it for JavaScript and yeah there was
this blog post that's where the book
idea started and then I started kind of
with this week eating I started pitching
it to a publisher they said no but I
made more on that later about background
as well I mean this is what I saw in the
markets earlier so this it was really
confusing because I mean you have lot of
these new solutions how do I survive
this or how do I deal with this I mean
it's like this is really famous person
in Finland but you don't get referenced
but I mean it's like what's the point
so I mean yeah so because if you write a
book you cannot write a book about
everything so I was like let's choose a
couple of technologies I chose react
because it seemed like a good idea at
the time
nobody used to react yet as chose I
chose webpack because of the blog post I
chose Babel I searched flow easily these
little tools that seemed to go well
together so stem I started writing about
these topics so when it comes to
business I decided that maybe I can do
something about the mess because we are
in this huge mess and people are
struggling so let's help people delay it
deal with the mess so let's just write
these books or kind of do whatever it
takes to help
a bit then I endure for this brand
I mean I had domain from years back this
survived tasted calm and I was like yeah
it's not that bad so let's use it in the
book in the first book I wrote the point
was that because I knew Kanban from the
past it's this process management thing
that you make these lanes and then you
have these tasks I figured that this is
like small application I can write in
the in the book so you read my book and
you learn to write this it looks really
simple but it actually takes quite a bit
of time to get it done because you have
you have some complex state but I mean
it was enough enough for the market at
the time you can say that how I I moved
with the book so I have this kicksled on
the first one it was 2015 when I get got
the book out I mean I was just let's
test the market so kicksled there was no
order on the book to cover because I
wasn't so sure if it's good idea to put
the name on the cover if if the
continent that great so I mean the point
was is let's let's put something there
then I was like nobody understands this
reference because it's kicksled nobody
in the world knows what the kicksled is
so I mean most people know these San
Francisco Brits so let's try that then
it started evolving I mean then I got I
mentally I I got courage to put the name
there so yeah then I got some cover and
then someone said that it's it's
depressing depressing or something or we
cannot use this so I found something
more happy I have this happy cover I
mean really really black metal cover I
went to this stock photo site and I was
just going through the images and I
found this site I really like the shape
it's like this turbine turbine thing and
I was like this is really nice it's like
heavy metal thing so I will use this so
the natural step then another friend
told me that it's too dark you cannot
use this so I gave this stock photo I
gave it to the friend and the friend
gave me a logo back so that's how I got
my logo so I mean he took the shape and
he turned it into something nice so this
is what I use at the mall
and the point is I can just at these
things that the logo here it's just one
important points it was like one book at
first it was book about because I
started writing about wetback and then I
realize that I'm writing a book about
the epic and react so just one book
about webpack and react but then time
went on and on and I realized that I
have two books in one so then I split it
up so if you bought my first book then
you got two books and actually now then
I realize that I have this wetback book
here it's like 500 pages or 400 1998 is
because 500 to be too much so I realized
that I mean it's it's it's far too much
so what I started doing and I'm still
doing this I I'm doing a new book that's
like I took a part of the old book and I
did another book and I crew it into kind
of I took like 50 pages from the old and
I added a lot of content I'm still
adding content so now I get new book so
I get like three books out of one book
and I might do another book based on the
big book because it's too weak so yeah
this is how I write so I write too much
and I split and I have more books but
yeah about publishing so when I was
starting out I was pitching this idea
that yeah it's all it will be a really
good idea to write this book about
webpack they were like nope
we won't do this but I was like this is
good idea so I will do it anyway so then
I went through this lean parting at the
point is that they give you this
processing flow I mean you write write
your book in markdown and I will process
the markdown into PDF epub and mobi and
they will sell the book for you you will
get 90 percent so I mean derailed is
nice and tonight went to Amazon at one
point so I have this you can buy this
book I mean that soft cover version not
this nice one
you can buy it from Amazon so yeah I
mean you can write paper books really
really easily these days I mean it's
just amazing
once you can do but this wasn't easy I
mean it wasn't easy to get for me to get
to Vienna so I mean the first three
months I made thousand dollars in three
months it's it's not a lot of money for
a lot of work so then someone found me I
mean this was Rodriguez from Spain I
mean he saw that I was trying I was
trying really hard I was pushing
releases all the time and so so he saw
that I was trying and he decided to help
so we started going to the content he
was like my technical editor he kind of
taught me how to write so he gave me
this kind of he helped me to improve my
style and I think it it was kind of the
thing that made it work for me and I
also had to think about this publishing
model because I was giving out the
content for free and I was still selling
something so if you have something free
maybe you take the free thing instead of
buying buying the thing if it's free so
I think about this as well but then kind
of things start to come together and I
was in the right time in the market
because reactor still growing so I ran
into this problem that I mean you have
this open and closed approaches like if
you think about traditional publishing
its closed so that you you get the you
pay first and then you get the book and
the point is that yeah is it makes sense
to pay in this case but I mean it
there's it's it's more difficult to
collaborate in this case and you also
need money for marketing so I meant this
because when you start writing nobody
knows you they don't really care so I
chose open approach how this works is I
have this book site I mean you can find
the content online I mean this this
brings people do we they find my content
they find my name they find my books
they get some trust I mean I because you
need trust to sell so I mean I mean so
late I get they feel bad because they
read through your book they start
feeling bad I mean the content was good
I still pay so that's how I make my
money here by making people feel bad
yeah this another thing I learned
because I mean if I go alone I can
travel really fast but the problem is
that I end up in some weird place I
don't even know if I want a decoder so
then I figure that it's good to have
some people around me so actually in the
book side let's say you need help you
click this button yeah I need help and
then you get to get get to talk with me
so you can chat I mean you have a
problem and then you open the chat and
you ask something
so I mean I started gathering these
people around me and I mean sometimes
it's overwhelming because people ask go
ask questions all the time but I think
it's kind of the price you have to pay
but the interesting thing is that it's
more fun to do things together than
alone I mean I don't know why but so it
used to be so there's this community
aspect so there's at website you can get
the content there and there is discuss
comments and I'll show you so let's
let's go to this web back book will
here's a free person or like composing
so I have two chapter and in the end you
have comments so people have problems or
whatever and they're like yeah this is
good but I'm not going to test it I mean
this is too complicated no water or
water I get feedback and I can improve
so I mean it was really important for me
to get this feedback loop going because
if you don't get feedback you can't
improve so yeah so I mean this was one
of the smart things I did I set up the
book side and I set up chat and discuss
comments and wherever I and also half
get up so let's have like this is for a
new book my newest book so I mean you
can fat the conv here and then I have to
get up issues so here are all the things
that have to have to happen or have to
be done the manga to me content down I
would write a pull request and then I
get a long discussion on if it's good or
not and I get this I get feedback here
so I mean this allows me to get better
so I like this process a lot I mean
github it's not only for coding it's
also right for writing in terms of
technology there is I mean it's marked
down I mean it's mostly nice it's not
always nice but I mean it's quite good
and yeah you have the kidnapping and I
wrote my own tool you think using the
technology I I wrote about this
something based on web a can react it's
like web pack for static sites I mean it
has one user I think I'm into users me
and wetback site I don't think know
anybody else who uses I don't want that
you use it because I don't want to
support it so I mean don't use this much
don't use my tool use something else I
hosted on github pages I have CloudFlare
on and this bits in front yeah I get
your disgust because I'm by my heart I'm
a developer so I when it comes to
releasing books I think like a developer
so because I had this past in open
source I decided let's do this fast
light releases so maybe we publish
something every month or every week or
whatever so I added this versioning for
e-books
it's like bit like semver before books
and when I active I mean and I I'm
really writing this seems to work so
when you just push and push the convent
it gets attention and people like to
take it to get new content I rightfully
it's not in my blog I'm sure that one of
the good things I did I interviewed a
lot of people I don't know if you heard
about this relic sting but I mean in
2015 nobody knew Redux I did this
interview and it's it exploded in
popularity so maybe that was coincidence
or not I don't know but I mean I did I
have done a lot of interviews so it's
always always the same questions and you
can go go through these interviews and
you can learn amazing an amazing amount
so I mean sometimes the people I
interview they are not famous yet but
some and then some like here or two goes
and there are temporary famous so it's
it's
about helping people I mean it's not all
about business but yeah the key part
here is that release get feedback
release improve but marketing I mean you
can again write a book but if nobody
knows you it exists it doesn't matter so
yeah I've got site and then I have
something else I have Twitter I don't
have facebook because I don't like
Facebook but I mean I have to feed her
and I mean this is I think this is
enough for me so I just push something
every day and people get costed content
and I can push my releases to release I
also have a mailing list yeah interviews
big why I did this interviews I mean it
just just a random thing someone
proposed to me that let's do interview I
think it was missile missile from Mobius
and we did one interview I was like this
is a good idea let's do more so now like
70 interviews or something like that so
it's some effort for me because the
point is that some people they have
great ideas but they take em up right up
well or taken up edit that well so what
I do I propose this interview very
collaborate a bit I improved the content
I put it as positive as far as I can I
pushed the quality I get it through
people so everyone is happy in the drive
but the others more than marketing I
mean you can have a nice book you can
reach the people but if they if there's
no reason to buy or if you don't do this
right it doesn't work but so you have a
cell and you have to think about P
suppose so for me I mean ice
I started from books and it was kind of
successful because I mean the to this
date I have sold well over 4,000 books
myself
I mean soft published books it's it's
like hundred thousand dollars which is
some wonderful money but I mean yeah
writing books it's fun but it takes time
so maybe there's something else so I
tried contracting at one point so I had
this table library someone found it on
internet and from somewhere from San
Francisco that means money so
yeah so they gave me money to develop my
own product my own library so I added
this reactor power thing for reacts it's
more like a type of framework I think I
could monetize this better I'm not
making a lot of money out of this but I
mean people like the component people
like to libraries so I mean it's
something for reference at least but the
problem for me is that I mean yeah I got
some nice money short term but I met I
mean I was sacrificing long term success
and then I realized that yeah I have
this book and a lot of important people
read my books so maybe I can use this
market as a marketing funnel so I mean I
have this huge net huge reads and I can
sell something more valuable to these
people so I kind of find in the Coulson
thing I'm training business so this
means that some big company they have
some specific specific need they want me
to come and help them for a week or two
and they are willing to pay so I can do
that and I've done this to mama tomorrow
amount and I think it's a good model
because you have this big big net and
then you have this really expensive
thing that you offer on top of that so
it seems like good compromise so you can
make really nice money for our little
while and then you have something basic
that makes a little bit bit of money and
it's like the safety safety in in life
so at the moment I'm somewhere somewhere
in between so I write when I have time I
write when I get good contract I go to
the client and I help the client so yeah
books and upsell everything else I go to
one more thing I go to courses but I
mean other I don't have time for
everything so I have to kind of choose
so results I mean the fact that I'm here
it's one result another thing I mean if
I did this all alone let's say I spent
one year like hiding in my cave writing
the book and published I don't think
it'll work I think it's important to
have that feedback loop because that's
how you get to call it that's how you
get what people want so yeah some books
some trance place
paper books and yeah there's some
readers I'm actually paying readers I
don't I mean doesn't that was more
uttered outside I mean just three
readers freeloaders whatever so an
hundred more than hundred contributors I
mean more than hundred people gave their
work back to me because I'm done there
I'm doing good thing in the open they
want to help me to improve the content
so why not
and earlier this year in May
I got award I mean I got this block of
wood they gave me a block of wood for
for my efforts and I gave me this title
finished called ambassador so it's like
the Oscar of software development in
Finland so I got this distinct this year
I mean it's not it's just more like
recognition so I mean it's like yeah you
did a good job here's a block of wood
thing kind of thing yeah and I've been
touring I mean I started touring this
year so I've seen a lot of Europe I met
a lot of people and I have a had really
good interesting lines and we did any
pandal I mean this was adding PD dis
twice the point was that we can everyone
on their own thing and reads only one
slice of the market so the point was to
get like six orders together and sell
something for a week I think we made
like $40,000 in one week because we were
in the right place in the right time
so again just something for marketing or
something to keep in mind because if you
can collaborate it's always better but
this missus thing I started like I
started understanding how business goes
how I can make money and how I can
publish prediction so but I mean I
wasn't really happy happy person so I
was like I think I had to I mean this
year I got this offer by reactive conf
that let's do a tour so that gave me an
excuse to travel in April and I'll tell
a bit about that in here because it's I
mean it dis led to changes in my
lifestyle with this element
fine in Finnish which means the way of
living yeah so I will move from business
to the lifestyle so how I used to
Labour's like this so let's wake up
around 7:00 and maybe I'm like terminus
in bed because I don't like to wake up
let's eat some breakfast check check
some email let's check out RSS what's
happening in the world let's do some
work let's go for a quick run on a
treadmill because I mean it's winter
it's dark you cannot go outside because
it's my own story so yeah I heard
treadmill and then let's put some lunch
in the microwave eat it fast
let's do again let's do more work let's
go for a quick run on a treadmill let's
eat some dinner we ate at 5 so that's
important now if you go north be it at 5
then I have some chill time so let's
play games let's go to Sun I mean sound
is important that's one thing you go to
Finland you go zone
yeah and let's go to sleep and here we
go again so I mean my life was like this
for all of mine of course there was
exceptions I was really lazy during
summer so I mean summer is like it's
soap right I mean you have like 20 hour
days so I mean it seems this kind of
you're it says everything so yeah but I
mean I had to escape so I went to nature
and I did strong thing but yeah I mean
winters they were really really tough
for me I mean if you want to become a
happier person go to Finland spend one
winter because you will never complain
up one complain about winter if you
spend one winter there so I spent 30
winters so I know something about
Turkish I mean it's not the cold is a
darkness so I was living this minimalist
style life if it's good anyway so I got
things done but I mean is there more to
life than this I mean again I can live
like this I can make money and I can
just kind of go into this cycle but but
yeah then I started like I got this
opportunity because someone found my
book and they were like we can use you
we can use this person for marketing so
let's do this and I was like yeah let's
let's do this because it's good idea
we do see the Europe so we spent like
April just going from place to place we
did like Berlin and we did check and we
did Slovakia at last season it was in
Vienna I mean it was really kind of
random thing because I was supposed to
go to London but I mean the longing
cancelled so I end up in Vienna it was
kind of a chance for me to do something
I had not done before so I mean I was
living in this little bubble so I was
like let's go a bit outside of the
bubble so sometimes you have to go
beyond what you are and it does kind of
because the plan must spend one month
and then go back home and go back to old
life and it didn't go that way because I
I left Finland like end of March and
since then I've been back to Finland for
two weeks because I mean I was like I
did this first tour I went back for a
week and then I did another tour then I
went back for a week and a liter tour
this is my third tour I'm going back for
a week in in like a week but it's like
it kind of changed the way I think about
how to live a life because when you when
you see what's outside of your bubble
maybe you don't want to go back to the
bubble yeah so but I mean why we Anna
why why not Berlin or why not
London or something else let's say I
made some friends I made some new
connections and I was like this is I
mean the city likes me and I like the
city so why not you can read my story
about this I mean I won't go into this
data detail but I mean again we'll do
later and as it happens we ni Slyke in
center of Europe if you want to travel
it's a good place to travel I mean you
can get to Barcelona for 80 euros it's
like so cheap and it's so first but yeah
now my life I don't have the schedule
anymore
I sleep as late as I like then I go to
office hang with my friends I mean I
just doesn't work then we have one hour
lunch like Vienna style
it might be to other lands you know
because we are not so let's say we are
not we are into a life here instead of
doing this microwave lunches we go for a
proper lunches and yeah
I still get work done and I'm happier I
have let's say a personal life so it's
not all about fun and games but the
thing is I I got little successful in
business and then it led to change in
lifestyle and it kind of it was a really
good thing but then you get questioned
like now now but now you have this
chance to change the way you live your
life so what kind of lifestyle you
actually want is it good to travel
around or do you want to stick with some
CD or whatever what so this is like the
thing I have to figure out but yeah so
you have the business thing the changes
that changes your lifestyle and life
start it starts to change your personal
life because now we get this lifestyle
and then you have to person inside the
business this really is about 10 o'clock
afternoon yes so yeah it's personal so
let's say you run this personal
lifestyle business so you're literally
the business so this means that whatever
you how you feel or how you're doing it
affects your business so based on this
logic it makes sense to kind of optimize
your own happiness or you have to be
kind of in a good shape I mean in mental
terms in physical terms because it all
affects the business so I have this
business and it affects the lifestyle
its effects personal side which affects
the business so you have this tiny
little loop because if you're really
depressed and not happy with life you
don't get anything done and then it
means business is bad and you get really
sad because this is bad and yeah you
cannot maintain your lifestyle and but
you have to get in this positive cycle
so this business is it's not about
making the biggest amount of money it's
more about enabling good life for me
because it's really kind of its business
for me it's not for someone else is it's
just enabling my life in a way
so this means that I can invest into
myself I have to think what what makes
sense in I mean so that I can grow as a
person because then I again get more
done with the business but there's a
risk so let's say your personal life
doesn't go well then business is going
to suffer or let's say business is going
to it's not going so well it's going to
affect your personal life so I have to
be a little careful with this but I mean
personally I grew this business but then
I realized that I had some limit because
I can't go on with this far so I have to
change but the thing is it it seems you
cannot your honor never ready so I have
to learn new things
like every day what essentially happened
for me is that I was in this Sun box so
I was in this situation I mean I was
like kind of stuck in life so this meant
that I had to change myself so I had to
learn a lot of things I never knew about
and I'm still kind of doing this and
there's actually Viktor Viktor Frankl
Museum I don't know if you see that name
but there's a Viktor Frankl Museum in
Vienna it's quite close it's like two
kilometers west little coder because
it's going to change the way I think
about life so just like logo tip
effectively I went from no life to life
I started understanding what no life
means so I mean it's like it's really
kind of it's fun to notice that there's
more to life than what you already know
so I step bubbling so we have this
bubble and you get outside of the bubble
when you pick your bubble so maybe one
day I go outside of this bubble and find
him a bigger bubble but I mean we'll see
so you know this so we friend went from
Apes to something else and then we went
to computers I don't know if there this
is progress but I mean it's more fun to
be here than here and this for me so
what I learned lessons learned of it
really really simple yeah
so yeah running books is hard but I
think anyone can write a book I mean
writing is not the problem
you can get some kind of book done but I
mean it's the marketing and selling a
script that are really hard you can
write something but I mean if nobody
cares nobody cares nobody will buy so I
will say it's at least as important to
put the thought or focus into marketing
and selling maybe it makes sense to find
the customer first and develop the
product based in customer and for me
personally I mean it's the program croch
because you have to be able to learn and
change it's it's surprising I mean it's
pretty hard but I mean it's something
you have to do when it comes to business
I would say every business in the world
is it's based on trust so before you can
get the big deal you need a lot of trust
and it begins from something simple so
for me it was having that sight and
making allowing people to find me and
build a little bit of trust that gives
kind of opportunity for me to gain more
trust and gain gain deals and so on and
also this value thing you have to
provide something malleable for people
because otherwise they won't care and I
think for a lot of programmers they are
in this doing thing they are really good
at doing things but they're really bad
at telling things so you have have
really big fat value like I don't know 1
million or I don't know 10 millions
times 0 which is 0 you won't have any
luck because if you do great things and
you don't tell nobody cares we also have
these people that don't do anything they
just dealt yeah I have this great idea
let's do this and it's like they won't
get lucky because they're doing actually
anything they're just telling things so
annek you need bit of both so you need
to be doing things so I mean for me it's
writing and in need to be telling things
so just a marketing marketing thing when
you do both you can actually get lucky
so I mean you get opportunities so like
one friend put it what I did I built
opportunity machine in my for myself
and there's always something new around
the corner so now you get good at
writing then then you have to get good
at something else
so never run out of things to learn I
just want to end this in the one little
idea so I mean you have to be able to
dream so maybe you want to make your
life better somehow so you have some
dream and then you have to be yeah you
need courage to go towards that
direction and you don't have and you
have to remember not to give up too
easily because you could be going to the
right direction but if you give up then
you never get to the destination so I
think that that's it for me I think I
will end this here and then we have
questions in the end so thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
