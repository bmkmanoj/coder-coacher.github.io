developer evangelist at pusher this is a
short video just to demonstrate how to
get connected to pusher okay so when you
sign up a pusher will create an
application for you and create numerous
applications here we've got a video
application within there you will be
given a key so this key identifies your
application so that when you connect you
can access that application you can then
if I go to J's bin and I cleared out you
then need to include the push your
script tag version and you then create a
new push to object and you pass in your
application key over on the right
believe it or not we're actually
connected so how do you know you
connected so this is where push your
tooling comes in really handy and makes
it easy to build these up sort of
applications so you can give the debug
console what I'll do is I'll check this
over here we can see the app on the Left
we should be able to
there we go okay so if we change the
contents of that we'll see we've got a
disconnect does the page we there's this
frame over here we loaded and we got a
reconnect you can do the same again
we'll see a disconnect and the reconnect
as the page reloads so we know we're
connected we can see that in the debug
console on the right the other thing
that's really useful is if we open up
the JavaScript console there's a push of
log property you can bind to or you can
assign a function to and if you sign a
function to it it's passed a parameter
every time that something happens within
the JavaScript library so we can then do
something like console log and then we
can see debug information about down
here that says we were initialized and
we're connecting and then this is where
we're connected to WS to push back on
and then you'll see where I stay
connected the other thing that's useful
here is pusher focuses on events so
events within application where we help
you build a vented architectures and
apps so
pusher has a connect they push up
instance here has a connection object
which you can bind to now you can bind
to a bunch of different if I going to
the dolls you can bind to a bunch of
different connection states so you can
bind to a state changed event which
tells you any state change or you can
bind to specific state change in so for
instance connected so we can bind to
connected
an exit function down here we could find
that function and we can simply oh we've
got a document we've got an idea of
their of hello
and we can set the inner text of that to
connect it there we go connect it
awesome so include the plus your
JavaScript library create a new push for
instance passing the application ID if
you want to you can bind to a connected
event or state changed events so that
you are aware of the connection status
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
