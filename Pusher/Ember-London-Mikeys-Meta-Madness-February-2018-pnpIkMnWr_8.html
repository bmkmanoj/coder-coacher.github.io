and we can only have a weird way that we
had tags to analytics for our pages so
each page requires a page name as page
section and a page type and depending on
the URL or what's happening you apply
this page name that way we can
automatically filter all related areas
of the site so we know where people are
going but the problem is if we have to
add that to each and every route that we
have you'll be going through loads of
routes trying to put the data in and
it's just nightmare to maintain cuz you
never know what's tagged and what's not
so the problem we want a a good way of
adding data to a lot of existing routes
and any new routes it's currently really
hard to keep track of what routes has
data and what doesn't so you end up
losing a lot of part of your analytics
so you realize that our journeys not
being tagged or whatever a last one is
I'm really lazy and I hate having to go
through each and every route and
changing every little bit because it's
just annoying so what I do is as I
believe every good developer should do
is be the right kind of lazy where you
spend hours and hours and hours over
engineering a solution when you just
don't want to do the tedious task so
well the key points that I want from
this it needed to be clear what hasn't
hasn't been tagged if you'd like to move
it needs to be really convenient for you
to add all your data routes and the data
needs to be easy actly easily accessible
like something that you seed a state so
when you're adding a route you don't
forget to add it to a random config file
that's just in in the ether and you hope
that someone updates it and you know one
dev isn't going to update it so that
leads me to try and create a solution
where should the data be currently we
propose we have a system for breadcrumbs
in which we have this giant ugly
JavaScript object that if you ever need
to get any data you just reference it
from the Rooter but it takes up like
half the file and it just makes the
whole file look messy but I do think it
should be in the Ritter so I'll show you
an example what we currently have so
this sits just above the Rooter and we
have repeating names and an issue you
have is if someone types the name wrong
of the root then that day is never there
so I looked at potentially adding it to
where we define the roots so this is
like a mock-up of meta dot set where
inside the function you could set the
matter that way but I thought maybe we
could go one step further because that
she's gonna add extra lines and it's
gonna make it look messy still so that's
where I came up with this really
terribly name to add on I'm open to any
suggestions so this dot root you need
this sort root to define any root so why
don't we add extra data to it so
currently the second parameter is
reserved
well maybe not reserved but can be used
for page data page ID
but it doesn't seem to use anything else
anyone can correct me if I'm wrong than
that but so I thought how about we just
use this subject to add extra data like
page name or section and that way when
you're defining the route it's just
there so you there's no house or
anything and it just also compiles puts
into a service that you can later use so
there's an initializer that runs this we
save the old route from Ambo route to
DLS we once we save the old route we
override the route by calling it and
then simply we check the second
parameter if it's an object and not a
function and if it has any extra tater
we register it to our service and then
on destroy we make sure we say it back
that way there's no problems if for
every reason you don't need it or during
tests so it's good it's got four main
methods that suppose that is to be used
get route which is simple forgive the
Java like syntax but you just put the
string of the route that you want pasty
and it'll give you all data related to
that route but for us we had a bit of a
specific thing so because some routes
were in or pages were in sections
churches my account section we didn't
wanna have to write my account for every
single route that was related so the
idea of being able to inherit things
from its parent route was really good
for us so I create another function
called get metadata by route it takes
the string and then it takes another
optional parameter so it'll either take
the default attributes that you
typically would want or you can specify
which attributes you'd like so if you
only wanted page name instead of page
name page type section you can pick them
there but the benefit of this one is
that he actually if you can't fulfill
all the data that you've put in your
attributes it will check its parent
route for it and if they can't find in
the parent it'll keep bubbling up
until you specified not to bubble up
anymore edit route because sometimes at
runtime you might need to edit the route
or if you have dynamic segments so for
example on our journey if you are
booking an engineer you can have an ASV
or you can have an IB journey if you
have an SV and an IV or IB or an SV the
URLs are different but we want the same
data for each one actually necessary the
page name will change from ib
appointment a sv appointment or a
combined appointment the last one is
search boots search boots is related to
get metadata by root it's so you can
just set your defaults of what you would
like it so if you ever run get married
later rather than specifying it every
time if there's typical ones that you
would use in certain routes you can do
that so this is this is a little mock-up
of how it would work it's just a root
grandparent parent and child or section
page type and page name when you run the
function they still get root mate
service dot metadata by root you specify
what the root is that you want to get
from and the edge beats you want and
this is at the bottom is just an
expected result of what you'd get
returned back there's a little look at
the implementation so I decided to use a
recursion as the best way of doing this
that way because it does everything it
needs to so why not just repeat it and
then at the end it filters out anything
unnecessary that you don't need is there
any questions about or potential users
yep okay thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
