nincada's and today I'm going to talk a
little bit about energy upgrade our
energy downgrade like the two
possibilities of using the upgrade
module from angular you've got the
upgrade way and downgrade way I would
say the first thing why should I upgrade
my angular application
well I think a major reason is that
you've got ahead of time compilation
when using angular 2 instead of just in
time compilation with which brings you
better security since the HTML templates
are just placed in the JavaScript files
and everything they should is yeah sorry
I'm a little bit nervous so like faster
rendering and reduced code and better
performance since change detection is
different in angular 2 or above so like
the next step I hope I'm not so fast but
actually it's just a little step by step
guide and things that I noticed when
using angular app great so there are two
ways of using angular upgrade but I just
want to say at this point that it's not
actually angular upgrade it's like
angular upgrade slash aesthetic since
since angular upgrade is the upgrade
adapter which is deprecated so you
shouldn't use it but the package me to
install is still angular upgrade so the
ways is the ways you can use this
upgrade module or the Unkrich module
what are the major differences between
these two methods in upgrade measure
module you have the same zone for
angularjs and angular so when change
detection is triggered it will be
triggered in angularjs and angular 2 or
above in downgrade module we have
separate zones for angularjs and angular
so yeah today I'm going to talk about
downgrade module as I mentioned before
so why the downgrade module we have been
using the upgrade module in a bigger
project and winter no ties because of
the fact that angularjs and
has the same Sun it can lead to major
performance problems since the change
detection is triggered in both of these
angular applications you can also
research research the problem you find
really really many issues on this and
yeah that's the reason why I'm talking
about downgrade module today so yeah so
the downgrade steps are actually really
simple you just need to declare your
angular 2 or angular 4 5 module for sure
and its components you need to down
create your angular modules and
components to angular chairs after
implementing them and after that you
need to for sure refactor the components
and directives from your angularjs
applications and move them to your new
angular 2 module to in later steps
remove the old angularjs modules and
remove also the angular upgrade package
since it is not needed at this point
anymore yeah the implementation for sure
you need to install angular upgrade
that's our main package we need and
things we need from this angular angular
upgrade static is down key components
down quit module and downgrade
injectable these free modern efforts for
the components for the modules and also
for the services which are used in the
angular application so I will show a
little example so we can define our
angular 2 module like always this is
just a little snippet from a base and
after that we need to provide a function
which takes one extra parameter this
parameter is needed from from down crowd
down crate modulator and the return
value is the value from bootstrap made
you module
I think my okay and yeah so what we will
get here when using downgrade module
with this function defined above we will
get actually angling one module which
you can later use the bootstrapping and
registered as angular 1 module so that's
the first step we have our angular 2
module is set up and down created so
angular 1 so we can later move the
components to our new module like it
says sound create downgrade which is so
well it's the same for the components
it's really another complicated thing
you just need to create a component and
resist it as a directive with using the
downgrade component function I'm so
nervous I think my I have like two
slides left and I talked like two
minutes I don't know I'm so sorry it's a
first jargon and yeah well the same for
angular services you need as long with
injectable is provided from angular
upgrade slash aesthetic I see I forgets
you a ten-part here I'm sorry for that
but as I said before I you need to make
sure that you import from angular
upgrades that you get not from accurate
because that's the deprecated upgrade
adapter yeah it's it's it's really too
fast and my content is too far
yeah later the next steps are like
removing the angular chest when you have
finally refactor your angular 1
directives and services into angular 2
directives you can remove your old
angularjs application can remove angular
upgrade and direct run your angular 2 4
or 5 model module on its own that's the
simple simple steps on upgrading
angularjs application so yeah I'm so
sorry that they were third shot is
anybody had some</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
