bugs and how do we actually do that at
nested how do we deal with those bugs
and practice so a little bit about me
some developer facts I do not use vs
code yet I will use at some point but
not yet and I like types with single
quotes hope not too many people are
living cool some fun facts about me and
I'm called mister have a nice day at
mustard because I do like to tell people
to have a nice day
so what will I talk about before that
like as a small thing I will talk about
four things I know that breaks all the
rules about like one two three money and
so on but we are developers right so we
can talk complex things so first thing
what is a bug and you shall create bugs
right everybody Chris BOTS and tracking
bugs and dealing with bugs these are the
four things that I will talk about today
so what is a bug I'll try to make this
talk a little bit interactive so I'll
ask you all to raise your hand up yes
people please raise your hand up cool
now those people have a definition of a
bug in your head please leave your hand
up those people who don't know what a
bug is you can put your hand down
because some of the people know what the
bug is some people don't I won't touch
actually ask you to it's like give me a
definition
I took one from Wikipedia and you can
read it here the three key words here
are unexpected unintended or incorrect
so something that you don't expect that
behaves the way you don't expect it to
it's categorized as a bug so I know
there has been best-paying filtering
around the way this is a bug or this is
a feature like some developers like to
call box features right so usually
that's because developers make
assumptions about how things should rug
work in a way that's different to how
normal people think so by now we have
like a good definition of for the bug
eyes it's something that
behaves in a different way than you'd
expect it so you shall have butts same
stuff like everybody raise your hands
those people who think that they write
both free coats can leave a hand up and
those people who don't think that can
prevent a lot
cool every would put your hands down so
how I have to skip this
so reasons why bugs are created like
it's inevitable bugs will happen human
errors is in my head the most common
reasons like computers don't make
mistakes people do and be right coach
stands to reason that feel introduced
but changing requirements is one of
things but I just had shout chat with a
guy here and it's like especially if you
work in a start-up things change daily
weekly and as soon as you start working
on something this like Fame come what
comes up and like you'll need to rework
everything in a different way now which
means that you have to like rethink
everything so again by doing all that
computation and logic you are bound to
make mistakes time pressures are not
saying miscommunication or no
communication so like there is a lot of
communication that has to happen between
you and your p.m. to like get the fame
in a state that people actually intend
to use it so again this like expected
behavior I have to like communicate that
very properly and software complexes
like software is a complex thing
inherently so bugs are bound to happen
so now that you're on the same page you
know what buggers and you know that
everyone introduces bugs how do we track
those little things raise your hand up
if you know Joel Spolsky oh no not many
people know about your spa ski so how
many people know about staggering for
how many people have used a gramophone
yeah so Joe's post key is one of the
guys who create a stack overflow so you
should know about that guy and he
invented Joel test so that's a 12-step
thing that tells you like how to write
better software or better code
and in this particular case I'll talk
about bug database so yes I have a
question how many people have a bug
database at work okay at Fairview that's
cool so painless but fracking is part of
like having a bug database so what do
you actually need to have a proper bug
report like what comes in there and Joe
says that you need only three things so
we need steps to reduce bed bug we need
an expectation what what did we expect
to happen once we deliver steps and what
actually happened by having those things
we can actually rip to reproduce bed bug
and hence sort or fix it so how do you
report bugs first thing is automated
reporting this is like a large chunk of
your bugs will come through this at
least that's true for SMS Ted so there's
a bunch of like monitoring tools and
Aubrey and Tom talked about New Relic
and how these New Relic we actually
started rhobar and in Vandy ended up
fifth century granted they are slightly
different tools to what New Relic does
or what some other tools do they're
purely error reporting so the end of the
fifth century and this is how a bug
report actually looks like for us in
practice so we got this bug report we
sent some additional data and the key
bit here is the full full story current
session URL so it's a nice nice URL code
that actually gives us this you can go
in and watch actual user stories so like
we get a bug report and we get a video
of what the user was actually doing on
our site and trying to debug it so it's
incredibly helpful than like trying to
figure out what what happened so logging
is one way to like get insight into what
happened or seeing bad thing is another
way how we can like see what user did
design your site this is not always
possible Possible's like this adds size
to the thing that's running a browser
like you have to get that script you
have to actually track that so it
at size but on most marketing sites like
we have invested it's totally possible
and in my head it's quite a recommended
way of doing bad so full stories about
tool that you're using there are more
tools these are before tools about were
listed on stack share you can find more
about them on stack share like if you
don't know stack share go to sexy all
right go site so automated reporting
tools is one way you'll get bugs on our
ways by good old user reports so this is
like the actual user report files we've
got that nested at March on a second and
this is how it will look like so this is
actually quite a good report and but we
did get the steps to reproduce for bug
me that they did get what actually
happened and that what should have
happened is implicit in that we should
know what should actually happen once
once you do those steps cuz we built a
software so this is quite a good report
in reality you're gonna have to do a lot
of face-to-face talking to people and
trying to figure out what actually
happened so like user reports can be
helpful but sometimes it's like a
double-edged sword and but it's more
work to get the data that you need
there's another way of like getting
those user reports and but we get slack
messages saying that she's broken so fix
it so this this is another one a real
example of like our site being broken
and I was very culprits so bug database
so now now that you know how to get
those bugs in let's talk about do you
actually like keep them so ideally your
bug database would be a single source of
truth for all the bugs so you know
they're to look for any possible bug
that ever happened to you or that you
have that you are tracking so clubhouses
our tool of choice is like a project
management build for software teams this
is how it looks like in practice and
these are the bugs so you can actually
see bugs looming among among the
features and shorts that we actually
deal with fun fact you'll notice that
there are points on most of the cards
but
I've been estimated but we don't
estimate bugs that's intentional we
don't really know how long it will take
us to fix it because well we didn't
introduce and intentionally
hence we don't really know what's
happening so how can we know how to fix
it we need to figure out there's a bunch
of tools that allow you to track or like
project manage give you Strela initially
it was too general for us so hence we've
tried out Clubhouse and we quite liked
it
I know breadboard was floated around and
it sent away I don't know why manuscript
is worth mentioning because it's
co-founded by Jose post key himself so
that stuff must be good right like it's
my guy who writes software and the
second bit about bug database is
integrations are important you want to
get your integrations right and but bugs
should be flowing to that database
easily you shouldn't need to have to my
life a man or like gather those reports
because like that means that this will
never happen and you'll just have stuff
lying around so clubhouse has an
integration with century it's not that
good we had to actually roll our own
thing there every century era crates a
clubhouse cards so we actually like see
those cards piling up and it's part of
our flow so those bugs are never out of
sight we always think about them when we
are estimating and playing our things we
have slight integrations so yeah now
that you have this bug database you get
all this bugs in you have to like deal
the fun so the fifth thing that joel
tells us to do this fixed bugs before
writing new code who actually here fixes
bugs before writing new code raise your
hand three people four people five
people died add more no okay cool so
five people that's not too much
according to Joel that should be and a
day-to-day thing and I understand that
why there's not too many people actually
do this because it's it's freaking
difficult but before
are going into why this is difficult and
how to get around this let's think a
little bit about why would you actually
want to fix bugs before writing in code
so there's a great job post about this
again sure takes less time to fix bugs
that sooner you find them so once you
introduce something if you are told
immediately that the thing that you've
introduced cost a bug it's much easier
for you to think around it and try and
figure out why this actually happened
the longer it actually takes for you to
like spot a bug and get around to fixing
it the longer you'll actually need to
like spend on that bug you'll actually
need to get that same context get into
the environment like if if it if it's a
separate project means like pull
everything and better stuff so it's is
becoming more and more difficult forever
long it takes for you to find it better
estimates but that's not an obvious one
so why do we get better estimates by
having all of those like bugs
solved immediately and the reason for
that is that again we don't estimate
bugs because we don't know how long it
will take us to fix those bugs right if
you know if you knew why the bug was in
there and how long it would take you to
fix it you would have fixed it in the
first place so by having those bugs
fixed you'll have a backlog that's only
features or things that you are planning
to do which means that it will be easier
for you to tell how long it will take
you to build something cuz explaining
how long it will take you to build
something compared to like explaining
how long it will take you to fix
something that you don't know why it was
introduced there in the first place is a
different thing so having no bugs makes
your estimates easier but you can tell
these are the things that I'll need to
build I can thoroughly estimate them
fairly well and I can give you a better
timeline and the final next before final
bit is coated ready to ship at all time
so yeah you have that confidence but
things are working if you introduce a
bug you know you'll immediately see that
something is not working so again it's
like a better feedback loop and the bit
is the final bit is it reduces
distractions
Dalia's it's best that I've added and
don't tell mr. Joe so it actually like
makes your life easier but you get less
distraction so you can focus on the
features that need shipping as opposed
to like having those bugs lying around
and like bugging in your eyes unless you
actually don't watch out those bugs in
which case shame on you
so this is the main bit this is the bit
that I'd like you to take away which is
sword bugs before fixing them
so Joel tells you to fix bugs before
writing new code and I'll tell you to
sort them before trying to fix them so
what do I mean by sorting them there's
one disclaimer here
sorting rules are unique to every
company I'll tell you about sorting
rules at nested for different companies
of different sizes which will be
different and I'm sure that visuals will
change for us at nested as well so first
rule ignore all bugs that don't affect
real users we don't really care about
spiders or web crawlers if you're an
e-commerce site that may be different
and you may really care about this so
don't do that
but if you're at Nesta and you're a
marketing site you don't care about you
crawlers this is a real thing like I'll
give you examples of like real things
that happens and I had to fix so there
was this like pulse point XD free web
scraper whoever you are I don't care
about you ignore bugs that effect a very
small amount of users so javascript is
unique it's especially if you're
developing from front-end and that we
have a bunch of different environments
like if you're working on the back end
you have like a nice environment you
have all depends you have like your
environment like your cool like for
JavaScript you have like hundreds and
thousands of browsers I probably
surrounds rights difference of versions
and like users running ie nine seven and
whatever is like it's gonna be difficult
so we had like one user one event we
don't really care about users so we just
ignore them ignore bugs caused by
third-party scripts again this is very
unique to nested if you are like an
e-commerce site have
relying on your I don't know gdm or
something you're like one user is like
getting moszer it's likely that more
users are getting this so for you is
maybe different but for us at nested
like we had this problem with the fad
Chad Chad digit but we had and that
fidget was like causing errors we didn't
really notice and things like we don't
really have time as a start-up to spend
our time on fixing bugs in chat widget
so you don't care about them there's
like a good things like a thing Tom
mentioned about getting noise from
third-party libraries you can silence
that noise really easily by whitelisting
your own URLs so something has a good
blog post about this but effectively
what you do is you whitelist your own
files and if errors are originally from
other files but are not from your domain
I just ignore them so this is like an
easy way to only get your own earth but
there's another option which is ignoring
those errors manually so again this is
that error that I was talking about text
text widget coming from frame dot
something yes not our problem you don't
really care about it so we we want to
silence it there's like this trade-off
between whitelisting your own stuff and
manually ignoring all the third-party
things so right now since we are still
small at nested I can actually manually
you can warp errors but I don't care
about but I'm actually aware of like
best scripts that are causing those
errors so if something like a chat
widget is causing too many problems I
can just replace that fidget with
another widget and I'm aware of what's
happening so the fourth bit ignore bugs
which are too expensive to fix duty
opportunity costs this is especially
true if you're really small like
relatively small so at nested we are
like 70 people we have 20 people in our
engineering team or lives you don't have
time to fix all the possible bugs
compared to like the features vertical
chip and provide value so I
Jose Bosque writes a very good blog post
about this one it's called hardest about
fixing and this is the bug that we
consciously decided not to fix so it
affected 50 users so it's like a fair
number of users over 5 months and we
know why this bug is sort of known by
bees this bug is happening it's it's
when you do code splitting so I'll try
to explain this when you do code
splitting you create a bunch of files
which have hash names then you make a
deploy those file names change so then
you deploy something use the lines on
your page then you do another deploy and
that's use it by having downloaded a
couple of files try stacks has those
same files from previous deploy and
those files no longer exist so we
actually do get 404 which is an
index.html file and we try to parse it
as JSON which obviously it's not Jason
and that complains so this happens
fairly small amount of people I have no
idea how to fix this bug if somebody
hasn't like you how to fix it please
come try to me later on I'd be very
grateful
but yeah you consciously decided not to
fix it and basically we just leave it
there in the background I am aware of it
if somebody comes around and tells me
how to fix it problem solved and I don't
have to actually like do too much work
so the fifth bit is report and the
possible fix bugs out of course by
third-party libraries so recently we are
using this CSS and J's library called
style components and we recently had an
issue there server-side rendering Styles
have been accumulated necessarily and it
costs our app to be really slow don't
you CSS and J's yeah so he had this bug
you reported this bug me help debug this
bug and the fix was released so we had
to update it like be a good citizen
contribute to open source help out
whenever can and the final bit once
you've like discarded all the bugs that
you don't need fixing
you've sorted them now we can fix the
rest of a bug so the bugs that are left
are actually important so you should be
able to fix them
last two bits ignoring bugs configure
zzi you can ignore bugs in your
configuration files that means that
you'll need to ship coats like masters
so that would go through that whole
procedure of like opener opening a
pudding first getting some people to
sign off as her stuff versus di which
allows you to like ignore bugs in a more
powerful manner so getting more bugs for
some users so like for seven amount of
time my preference is to ignore bugs in
the UI it's more powerful it's faster
and I can actually keep track of those
ignore rules in one place across
multiple apps so it's much more powerful
useful and yeah you can see that they
ignore there and it actually like tells
you for how long it is it has been
ignored and how long it will stay that
way and the second bit is separate from
our metal variable for bug reports so
the the bit that we did in the beginning
was like report bugs if it's production
yeah that sounded cool but then we
started to wanting to test production
environments locally or NCI and turns
out that we've got a bunch of bug
reports but
frankly we didn't really care about
because we knew about them because we
are actually testing about things right
now so by having a separate
environmental variable for bug reporting
we actually save yourself a hassle of
having to like sort those bugs that
shouldn't be there in the first place so
the thing that we ended up having is
fully qualified domain name as the
differentiating factor so if the URL
that you get this bug on is actually
nested comm then they report that bug if
it's localhost if it's AB that nest of
the test or whatever if you don't really
care about it so it's a useful tip so
things I've covered what is a bug you
will create bugs if you haven't known
that tracking bugs reporting bugs and
black databases how would you go about
dealing with bugs fixed bug before
writing new code they the key bit sort
bugs before fixing them and yet ignoring
bugs and separating Marvel there
