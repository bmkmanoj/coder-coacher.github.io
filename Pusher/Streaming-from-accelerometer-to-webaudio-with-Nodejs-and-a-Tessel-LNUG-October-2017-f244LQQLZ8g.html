enterprise DevOps II boring stuff this
is stuff that you can do at home and
play with and see what it lands you so
what we got here is a device micro
controller called a tehsil this micro
controller actually runs node on this
little thing it's not strictly speaking
node apparently it's a lure but it's
being written node it's been compiled
down it's been added here and I'm going
to show you how I've done that first I'm
giving you a little demo you can see
there's an x y&amp;amp;z coordinates shifting
along all the time there now what I also
did as part of this little experiment
was if I can get there let's go to
another window here and we'll do typing
with one hand just shake okay so now add
one tab I have a bunch of data coming
through from my tehsil for my
accelerometer and in this tab I'm
running a web server which is just
running an HTML page and I need to go to
a browser so go to localhost
I've taken I've taken I've taken the
South the data from my accelerometer and
turned it into sound and that is what
you can do with node does anyone want to
see the code yeah if you don't close the
window okay so how do you get the
inspector back up here oh never mind
that let's close that generate a sound
okay
so I'll give you a quick I'll give you a
quick preview of the code just to sort
of prove though it was node so tehsil to
provide kettle's nice because it's
pretty modular this is the accelerometer
which is plugged in there I just pulled
it out so it's gonna stop working
obviously it's very light and easy it's
not the only device out there but what's
nice about them is they package them and
make it easy to program for they provide
a bunch of stuff a bunch of node modules
that you can code for and a bunch of
sample code which is this is mostly
based on so I have a tehsil app here
I'm running this by my USB and what am i
doing it was a long time ago that I
wrote this okay so I'm basically
emitting a WebSocket of setting up a
WebSocket server which is taking from
this the tehsil serial port it's
listening on the port and it's doing its
piping stuff out and somewhere I can't
remember where sending it as text right
then on the actual hardware is being
looked at here so here's here's this is
a little bit easier to understand
because this is taken from the sample
code on the tehsil website it's clearly
JavaScript and it's quite clear what
it's doing it's basically listening for
the ready and the data
events and it's outputting data from the
accelerometer fairly straightforward
stuff and the client-side is not node
but it's JavaScript sound I probably I
probably ripped this off someone's
website something listening on the
WebSocket I've got a audio context
running and I'm just basically piping
what's coming in from the WebSockets
through to through to the frequency
modulators and all these things you can
get into with Web Audio and creating the
r2d2 sound that you get so that's it if
you wanna have a closer look I'm willing
to share it with you and show you later
I haven't put this on my github or
anything yet this is a test one I I got
this through I was a backer in their
original sort of fundraiser and got this
as a prize they've they've kind of upped
the ante and their performance and
they've got the tehsil tools out now I
don't know much about it but there are
other devices which are worth if you're
interested in writing JavaScript for
small devices other than the Raspberry
Pi which is just a small computer you
got something like the S Purina or their
Springer Pico which whoo I've got a
couple here in there literally are the
size you can do you can do cool stuff
that you know will output two-year-olds
Nokia display there and it maybe next
time I'll organize it but this is the
device here it's got a I've soldered a
Wi-Fi and ten onto the top of it but
it's basically this plugs into your USB
or you can get it standalone to run off
battery and that runs it can run a
little node server on it as well it's
quite it's good for putting a little
sensors around your house or you know
the various things so it's worth looking
at at s Purina what they were they what
they're doing Johnny Five has anyone
here heard of 25 all right getting
getting node onto you're getting
JavaScript running your JavaScript on
your on your Arduino or other devices
via firmware so what do they call it
a Fermata which allows you to run it the
code actually runs on your machine so
you have to be tethered and just to sort
of give a nod to node bots and I know
they haven't had
for a long time but look out for them
when they do because it's a really great
day of just hacking hacking on hardware
so that's where I did that I did BOTS
day so yeah that's my little lightning
talk</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
