about its building search in a week ish
this week we're still halfway through
it's been about a week already so it
won't be quite a week into production
but almost and today I work for Tito
we're building a Spotify for sheet music
type app we started off with three
volumes it took us a load of time to get
to three volumes we've now got a
thousand pieces a bunch of stuff you can
find Lila and loads of stuff and problem
is that actually you can't find it this
is what my hypothesis is anyway so our
current database we're running on
DynamoDB I don't know just anyone else
using DynamoDB one yeah you work with me
too yeah it's not it's not that common
it's really cool and if you're using
notes I recommend a really good module
it's not actually mine I've inherited it
I need some help actually so if you want
to use it and then help out they'll be
really useful and but basically dinamo
provides indexes and scans as the basic
kind of look up the material that you
can use and filters so for searching
that becomes quite problematic
so our first I should say are my first
idea was to basically take all of the
key bits of material that we want stick
it all into one big string deburr it so
take off all of the accents and all that
sort of stuff
lower case everything like super super
super naive search use the scans feature
but it kind of kind of worked and it
used it was enough to demonstrate back
to the team what we could do very very
quickly to show what we could like how
search might be able to work so then
products went away and kind of designed
some of you eyes and all that sort of
stuff then we started looking at like
what would it really be like we run ten
percent time we can't afford twenty
percent like Google but ten percent time
one of our engineers ran off and kind of
had a look at AWS to see what was
available two options elastic search and
cloud search cloud search is solar
elastic searches elastic search they
both come from leucine thank you it's
basically the same sort of stuff
slightly different kind of service level
we didn't really play with cloudsearch
but I did have a quick play the other
day and it's really really cool if
you're using DynamoDB if you want kind
of predictive indexes because you can
tell it to sample your take a sample
from your DynamoDB date table and then
it all build the index for you so I'll
kind of select the bits and pieces that
you like the types and all that sort of
stuff and bear in mind that DynamoDB is
a completely kind of just throw anything
at it database complete document
anything could be in there and it will
build the indexes off that for you which
is quite nice so like this it's not
great because I'm not entirely sure what
this field is at the bottom here just I
it's a bit it's it's most of the stuff
is in there and so we decided to
actually go with elastic search the AWS
elastic search service it's elastic
search as a service it is pretty much
for an elastic search so if you've used
that elastic search outside of AWS you
can just use it here transfer everything
in done it's nice and nice and easy
and so one of the problems that we've
got is we've got a database over here
but we need to keep the elastic search
index up to date so we can run our
one-off batch scripts we can use the
dynamo DB event streams I don't know so
not many people have used it but you
might have heard about this any changes
in the database any to any of the rows
can trigger an event and an event you
can subscribe to that event using a
lambda function SNS all those are
they're called
AWS things or we can just run it on like
a cron job so I just like it's called
for it to be run like out of date for a
day it's probably fine so demo time
we built mm-hmm actually won this
tonight and you see this say this is are
now searching this and running off my
prod database now so the suggestion
there's back hoping this is going to
work
say hey I did I did put this talk
together but like while I was sat there
so I have prepared some predefined
searches at the top and I'm not entirely
sure what it's doing behind the scenes
I've never used the elastic search in my
life before
but it does do some really cool stuff
and this is what I'm going to spend the
rest of the week looking into is why is
it returning these results so this book
here by pam wedge woods is not back
there is nothing in there that says buck
but there is something clever going on
here and i need to find out what that is
but it does do some nice stuff i can
never remember how to spell Tchaikovsky
and I'm not a classical musician I know
that this guy existed I know it kind of
feels a bit like to go work no it's
shirt-cuff No
well anyway I prepared a bad search
earlier this one and it would still
works which is really cool so it's doing
some really funky fuzzy matching you can
configure it to do all sorts of
different things we've kind of set it up
in a super simple kind of start MVP
fashion but really really pleased with
how far we got in a few days just by
hooking into the AWS infrastructure and
not really writing a lot of code
I'll show you roughly this is the script
that we're going to run on a poll so we
can drop the whole index here so I do
have another talk titled clunky doesn't
use load Ashley enough apparently I do
now
but we grab all of our content is geo
restricted as well so you can only get
Lyle island in Europe and all that sort
of stuff so we've got all of the
countries we've basically shove in
everybody is in an organization but we
grab all of our learners there where's
the products yes we grab all of the
organization's we grab all of our
products from the database so that's one
scan rather than doing that on every
single search we now do that once
a day to grab everything limits the
number of hits to our database we then
massage it with all of this stuff and
then we throw it in this is a bit of a
funkiness because I was getting timeouts
on elasticsearch but again MVP throw it
all into elastic search using the there
was a we had a bit of a problem with the
security so we used HTTP I can't find it
all right so wrapped up in the service
is there you have to kind of sign all of
the URLs if you want to make your last
search service safe on AWS safe so it
was a bit of a funkiness that we had to
go and get through and then throw it all
in and display a summary and that's
basically it any questions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
