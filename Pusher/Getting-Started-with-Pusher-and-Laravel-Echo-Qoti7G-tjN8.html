and consumers have become conditioned to
expect that within the web apps they use
in the mobile apps that they use and so
it's only natural that I wanted to go
and learn more about this technology and
how I can implement it so one of the
first places that I'm going to look to
of course it is pusher because they've
been doing it probably the longest
amount of time and they work for some of
the biggest names around so they're
pushing the stuff out for github
MailChimp NBC News New York Times and a
lot of impressive stuff has been built
on top of pushes infrastructure and I
really like the way that they focus on
the now and you as a developer to build
apps and not faff around with the
infrastructure that powers those apps so
we're going to look at using that within
laravel today because that's my favorite
framework and fortunately level 5.3
comes with some goodies out of the box
which will allow us to basically just
get up and running pretty easily now
pusher is free to get stand up and
started with I recommend you do that and
let's get started
okay so for the purposes of the example
that we're going to use for this entire
lesson I didn't want to just go down the
route of doing a to-do list like
everyone else does
so I've spun up something really really
quick and simple it's kind of like a
social networks type thing so you get a
post and you get comments and cats
apparently Hello Kitty some of them
posts are public and some of them are
private we'll get into why in a little
bit so as you can see here we've got a
public post which is a picture of me
that I don't mind sharing the world on a
private post which is a picture I'd
rather kind of not show the world
because I was 16 at the time wearing a
pillow and each t-shirt thinking that I
look cool oh well I don't know what I
was doing so let's head into public post
here and what we've got here is a really
simple HTML file use spoot strap but
I've also used view j/s view to with
view Fi and view resource which comes
quite handily built into laravel so
basically out of the box you've got all
of this functionality web pack is built
in larvas elixir allows you to run gulp
and bang at compile
squishes it all down to a J's file that
we can spit out to the browser along
with any CSS and sass related stuff so
let's just do a quick demo here so I'll
just do hello world do submit great so
what that's doing is actually sending a
HTTP POST across to laravel and Larry
always going away and propping that in
the database from returning the response
to view which we then put in the page
take a quick look at how that's done now
because it kind of forms the foundation
of what we're going to learn next
so inside of our resources assets J's
components I've got this comment stock
view file really very very simple stuff
so inside a template we've got this this
little section here and you can see I'm
looping through all of the comments I'm
spitting up the username what the
comment is and then further down below
we have got a text area with a submit
button now I have many videos before on
utilizing view components within your
application and this is a view component
as such although my video was based at
view one we're now using view two but
the concept is kind of similar and it's
kind of I'm telling you this because if
you look at things like this post URL
what I'm binding a variable to obviously
we need to know where to post these
comments to and we don't want to have to
put Blaze templates in these view files
ie because we couldn't do it anyway and
B because it's probably not good
practice and there's better ways that we
can do that so we put this post URL
we've got this props method here and
this props is basically anything that we
instantiate this component with we can
also anytime we instantiate the
component we can pass along these
variables so we can pass it on the post
URL the comment zero post ID and for the
purposes of this the comments URL is the
URL that we will use to actually go and
get the comments from laravel post URL
is what we used to push the comment that
we just created to laravel post ID is
self-explanatory and we pass that in if
we look at our show method here which is
what is actually showing our individual
page we instantiate that component here
with those values so we can actually
grab them straight out of blade x'm we
don't need to worry about putting this
in the jaw
script here so one other caveat when
you're doing things we view and you're
requiring stuff to be kind of center
level it's going to be really really
finicky about CSRF token so we have to
make sure that they're covered as well
so let's look in our layout file here
and you can do this one of two ways you
can see I've already got it highlighted
there within the script section you can
put window clarabelle and you can pass
an object CSRF token being one of the
keys and the levels a little helper
method there CSRF token being in the
string alternatively you can tie it away
nicely at the top here as a meta tag and
shove it in the content net and if you
look in bootstrap jeaious
you can see that as long as you've got
all of Lara vales stuff installed
properly it's going to be able to pull
that out using this method here because
it will instantiate it or go and look
for it and find it on it so further down
here you can see what actually I've done
here uncomment that out because that
isn't commented in by default
that's because laravel echo itself isn't
actually installed by default so what
I'm going to be doing is taking this
front end that we see here and anytime
that we submit a query as it says or
comment what I wanted to do I want to
learn how to actually broadcast that off
to pusher and I want the Jas to be
sitting separately listening a pusher
and say hey if you've got anything new
for me and it goes yep got a new comment
for you pulls it down and put it on the
page so we be really nice to get this
kind of working so that I can type a
comment in on one window and you see
that up here on a second window
automatically without any refreshing so
it should be quite simple to do that but
first off we do need to install some
bits so let's look at the first bits
that we need to install so we've got NPM
I should have it here this doesn't come
out of the box reliable it's very very
easy to do so just running this command
will pull down levels echo libraries and
also pull down the pusher JavaScript
stuff the web pack will eventually use
to get all this stuff working so with
that done and dusted we can move on to
the next thing and that is composer
require push up put on a - PHP - server
this just allows PHP to connect to push
up and push up the events that you want
so when install that as well and that's
great so let's take a look at some of
our laravel specific configuration items
now so we'll head into our config folder
and under broadcasting I've set my
default to be pusher without any
environmental variable I'm not going
anywhere else away from pusher for this
sort of stuff so having this as an end
variable is just asking for trouble
inside of pusher here I just got my key
secret and app ID and these are
available in the pusher interface so I
advise you log in and have a look at
keys it's made very very simple few on
there in fact their UI is really really
nice to use some of the UI is for
third-party services are really hard to
navigate through and kind of figure out
what's going on where but it's quite
nice and simple to use so do that now
one other thing to bear in mind is this
options parameter and to make sure that
whatever you put in the options
parameter is also reflecting the j/s
side of things because you don't want to
say that the j/s is expecting encrypted
stuff but your servers not sending
encrypted all that your cluster is
us-based and you're actually based in
the EU so you can see I've kind of
utilized all of the options available to
me here really I'm an EU based cluster
on things encrypted and if I head back
over to this bootstrap J's you can see
that I've done the same thing there I've
put my key in broadcasters push I
definitely encrypted and the cluster is
EU so in terms of the JavaScript side of
things we should be pretty much up and
running ready to go soon the PHP sign
needs a little bit more though because
what we need to do now is tie in to the
point where you create a new comment we
want to send that comment serialize it
all the way off to push up so the pusher
can send it to JavaScript
well the way we're going to test this
first is that we want to just make sure
the push is actually receiving these
messages from PHP and the best way to do
that is let's have a look they've got
this this nice debug console and it kind
of shows your events and it's it removes
everything in there when you refresh the
page so it's really nice for just
checking things out so what I want to do
is I'm going to leave this running and
we're going to start off by creating a
new event so we'll do PHP artisan make
event I'm going to call it new common
what's awesome about the fact that this
is all kind of built-in is I don't
really need to change anything anything
I want to do is implement the checkout
should broadcast because that that
tailed larval that we actually want to
make sure that this gets sent to pusher
rather than it kind of be in just an
internal of them and the next thing that
we want to do is we want to pass we want
actually get the instance of the comment
that has just been created so I'm going
to use phpstorm super quick stuff for
instantiate in that the difference is
that what instead of using PHP storms
private thing I'm going to use public
and the reason is that what level does
when it see realizes these events is it
actually looks all the public properties
and it makes them available in the
serialized event which is obviously
going to be sent to pusher so we want to
make sure that that is available as a
public variable and broadcast on okay so
in private channel this is what we
actually want the channel name to be
called and I'm going to call it comments
dot and then what I want to get here is
the post ID because obviously this
channel is specific to the post ID and
to do that I can just do this comment no
I can't do it post I don't actually I
named this database tables a little bit
weird so I've actually call posts ID
from from memory always good today right
so that's ready to go now the only thing
that we've got to do now is when a
comment is actually posted is to fire
off this event now one caveat here is
that you need to ensure that you've got
cue stuff up and running so whether
you're using Beanstalk we're using the
built-in laravel queues which I
recommend if you're not doing these sort
of crazy scaring and stuff that you can
get quite a long way using our builds
built in queues so I recommend doing
that and there's a there's a command
that we can run to do that actually it's
PHP artisan not queue listen where's a
queue table what that will do is
actually generate a migration for you of
all of the stuff that you need and then
you can just run PHP artisan migrate and
it will just migrate that and then you
in your queue
config' we can you can see I've got this
set to sink but no it's not sinking in
my right environment variable set to
database and it would just work out out
the box which is really nice um let's
head into web PHP so this is where
everything's going on now it's a bit
messy I wouldn't want to do things like
this I'd have them in Nice controllers
everything would be nicely kind of
dependency injected but this is just an
example tutorial so hopefully it makes
things a little bit more transparent as
to what's going on the only place that
we're really interested in looking to be
honest adhere and this is when a comment
is created so we're going to use our
rails helper called event and we're
going to we're going to create a new new
comment I'm going to pass in this
comment that we've got here now what's
going to happen here is as soon as a
comment created it's going to fire off
the event handler for that comment
passing in the new comment it's going to
see that as a public variable it's going
to serialize it send up to pusher so a
upon going back to this this page here
refresh in we should see so we've got
nothing in our debug log or we've got a
connection there but if I do testing
submit and I know why it's because we
actually haven't got out of queue run it
so I can just do PHP arts m.q listen and
so now you can see that a new comment
was sent if we ping this open we can see
everything about it it's that's so
awesome and this is exactly what was
being returned as well to our view
instance so it's kind of really
interchangeable which really not the
only thing we've got to do now just hook
up view component to be able to listen
to push up and to be able to do stuff as
and when it receives that information
back so it's going to hear now mount it
this is where the magic happens so as
soon as a component is created within
the application or this comment
component is created this mounted method
is run you can see what I'm doing here
is actually going and getting all the
existing comments and that will cause
them to be put in the comments data
object and then loop through and spell
out here
but I want to do the
next thing which is I just want to get
view to listen into pusher so they can
get any updates and push them onto the
end of the stack so let's do that now so
I pasted that from the larva
documentation because I can't remember
everything so this listen will become
new comment and this is going to be
comments dot and actually I tell what
let me head back to here something's
bonus so no comment as you can see there
is going to be the name of the event
class here broadcast on this is the
channel that we want to kind of listen
in on so that's going to be comments in
the post ID so let's head back to here
and to get the post idea we actually
have that in the data rail base in the
property here so we can just do posts on
the school ID when we get that it's
going to spit that out to the console
for us to listen well to show us what's
going on there that should be enough for
us to basically run gulp on I'll create
a new one so Q can continue to run so
that's that's a way and um now I should
see this in the contact it's not
actually going to show anything on the
page yet but we should see in the
console and the reason that we haven't
is because this if you remember rightly
this is actually a private channel and
that's because that means that I
actually need to change this to private
just simply doing that should make this
work but actually this is such a quite
important there's a few other things
that we need to do now at this point
let's go into our app dot PHP file
because by default the broadcasting
stuff is actually commented out and this
broadcast service provider is actually
quite important especially it comes to
private channels and I'll explain why
now so let's head into providers
broadcaster Rider now on the boot method
this is actually providing some routes
the view and laravel echo can tie into
to determine whether or not you're
authorized to tune in to this channel if
you're authorizing it's going to let you
do it as you can provide a key for you
to go to push it with and so on and so
forth now we want to do comments dot
star here and this broadcast channel met
here we're using is allowing us to
determine the authorization for this
channel and the first argument is always
going to be the user that's logged in so
if there is a user look this might be
false and the second is whatever's in
this star if you have multiple stars you
could have another variable for example
not being there but we we our wise
actually post ID that we want but to be
honest we're just going to return true
because we don't care whether the user
can or can't do stuff we're always going
to let them do do stuff so let's head
back
I'm will just file from every one of
these awesome three two and helps if i
refresh my page
awesome v3 we'll get the third time
lucky now this is the problem with gulp
sometimes I forget - if you run gulp and
then gulp watch it's going to do an
initial build for you and then it will
listen to any changes and make sure that
they're kept up today because I always
do this update the j/s and I forget that
we're not working in PHP and it won't
automatically update for me so you can
see now that's done the job the cue work
has gone figured about what it's got to
do so it will serialize it send it to
push our jobs we have successfully
listened to pusher and got a WebSocket
push back and we've got this object
awesome v4 so now the only thing that
we've really got to do is head back to
here because at the point of receiving
this and so look at the exact syntax of
this again yep so we've got an object
and comment in it so I can do comment
that should be right so the point of
receiving this I actually want to push
this up so I can do self comments dot
push should be good to go now you can
see web pack has automatically figured
that out now so I'm not made a fool of
again awesome v5 great awesome now can
you see the problem
obviously view j/s has been built that
when we submit a comment that it will
automatically push that on to the end of
the comment stack awesome that's exactly
what we want but the problem now comes
in the it's also listening for events
and it's got an event back for the event
that it just fired and it's adding that
on to now it looks like we've got
duplicates but if we refresh the page
we've only got one v5 there now fuging
there is a really really easy way to get
around this and it's already been
thought of it's genius let's take a look
so back in our web PHP this event now we
don't want to fire off event we want to
actually fire off broadcast and we can
simply do to others this is going to
make sure that we're not going to fire
off this event to the existing
connection that this applications got
and the other people are going to get
that event no one else now I'm gonna
head in to see Quechua Lee and clear
down them comments excellent so we have
a clean slate here and to get working on
so we will do comment version one you
can see that I only get that one comment
I don't get any other duplications there
which is nice
so I'm going to create a new private
window and I'm going to do push up dev
and now matching that you log in because
the application needs actually the
application needs to be able to logged
in to be able to understand what users
post stuff and all of that sort of
malarkey so I'm now logged in as my wife
what I'm going to do is another just put
hello there wife we should see whatever
I do appear on this side of the screen
then boom the cue list and I'll pick
that up and send it away to push her
this pulls it down and you can see hello
there a wife so really that is that's
awesome we can get some real-time rocks
we can send that back and see it appear
here pushes awesome so this stuff is
actually really quite powerful and you
can see how implement in your
application
is actually quite easy I mean there was
a few hurdles to get through initially
once but to be honest that is mainly
getting the broadcasted stuff set up the
configuration and whatnot but you can
see I've had to do very little in terms
of actually going to push in and setting
things up it's really nice back in
infrastructure I come in line to just
push and serialize events - and listen
in - as well it's kind of feature packed
so all the stuff that's built into
laravel echo you know will work with
pusher which is really cool because some
of those other providers don't
necessarily support certain methods yet
as well one of the other things that I'm
really excited about with pusher is the
mobile push notifications and I know
it's not specific to laravel but it'll
be really nice to be able to have kind
of notifications real-time notifications
kept all under one hood for the clients
that I work with because not only do
they work with um want web apps they
also kind of want mobile apps as well so
having the two in one place is going to
be really really cause well but I look
forward to kind of learning more and
more about push uh the more I use it and
I recommend that you think about ways
that you can implement real-time
communication in your web applications
because for a user's perspective it's
really really nice to see all of this
sort of stuff just kind of happening on
the fly and it fills eyes sort out if
you know what I mean you're not having
to refresh the page and think oh it's
because they might have done done that
and I've not refreshed the patient to
just see a panel automatically is is
really a nice feeling so I'm going to
close this down now I'm going to go back
into pusher I'm going to go to my
application keys and I'm going to create
a new clean secret that you are not
allowed to see I think you just did see
that there we go we won't see that so I
hope that really helps you get to
understand how you can start working
with push a real-time notification in
your web applications and if you have
any questions but please do not hesitate
to contact me i'm at the skater dev on
twitter and i'm more than happy to help</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
