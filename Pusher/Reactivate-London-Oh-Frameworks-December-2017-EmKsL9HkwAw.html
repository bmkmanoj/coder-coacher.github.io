little bit about sorry-ass and ember I'm
actually not going to tell you about how
to use react with ember or something I'm
not even sure if that's if that's the
thing this is more I'm going to talk
about personal experience mostly yeah so
this story up sorry I'm qualia I am a
web developer I am mostly fronting but
also a bit of cool stuff because I guess
from time developers nowadays we all end
up doing a bit of full-stack because of
note I am currently working with yld
which is a node consultancy and I also
mentor at cause your future which is a
coding school for Refugees so if you're
interested Google dumbots
they're pretty cool so this story
actually starts with not with ember not
with reacts but we thank you were a few
years ago before I knew about react I
was working in an angular application
and it was a fairly new application so
we needed to hire a few developers into
our team so we were interviewing a lot
that time and the one of the developers
was really good in the technical
questions and he was amazing we wanted
to hire him and this happened I guess
this is something that can happen in
interviews at any time but we asked why
do you want to be a front-end developer
and it just replied oh because I really
love react so I was a bit confused okay
this is an angular job and you're
telling me that you want to do react I
are you talking about angular but he
just said no no no I really would love
to do react and I'm like okay but would
you be okay with working with angular
and he's like oh no I'm not really sure
about this
okay fine so at that point I was just
thinking okay why is he here fine but
then I started wondering okay I heard
other people speaking
and it was picking up a lot of traction
this was about two to three years ago so
I wanted to to see what react was so my
next role was with react because I
wanted to learn about it so I wanted to
know why people loved react so much and
I started investigating I started
reading and once I started a new product
which reacts
it wasn't easy it wasn't it's never easy
to start learning a new framework and I
mean coming from angular angular was
quite structured it gave you a lot of
things out of the box like routing and
testing and react didn't so you need to
research and then there was webpack
awful awful things right so you need to
learn to work with webpack there was no
build tool just ready for you to jump on
but this time went by I just started I
just started enjoying it a little bit
more and I started really getting used
to the way reiax works and to the
patterns that the community follows and
if we can really see became really nice
to work with because my team had a tool
that had an application that they had
built and that they left because it was
tailored for us and we were not hacking
around so it was really cool and these
were the things that I liked the most I
guess and you can write react in several
ways but this was the way that I just
got used to program
guess the functional programming writing
really explicit code being able to trace
the flow of your application from the
beginning to the end so if you look at
some part of your comp of your
application you can see where it came
from and you can know what codes
triggered each part of the application
and you you know what codes triggered
the function that you're currently
looking at
and yeah you importantly what you need
not a giant framework so after two years
of these of learning react of getting
used to react of getting used to react
patterns
getting used to composing composing
instead of extending voila
I was proposed to work on a number of
projects and I said ok a number project
ok
so first how many of you have worked
with amber in here
no one write and react if someone works
with reactor yes yeah of course your
inner reactive so I was like ok why not
let's give it a try it's time to learn
something new it's been 2 years there's
lots of companies working with amber so
yeah I guess yeah let's give it a try
and in the beginning it was it was
fairly it was it looked quite nice I
started looking at the tools that amber
heads and embrace this tool that is
quite similar to create react up in the
beginning
it's called ember CLI and you can just
create a new app just by typing ember
new name of Europe but the difference
between these and create react app is
that it already provides you a structure
we told the folders that you're supposed
to put your code in so amber is kind of
MVC so there will be a folder for
controllers models routes components
helpers and all of that because the idea
behind them amber is that it's already
it tells you exactly how to write your
codes there's lots of documentation
telling you how to write your code so
there's not much choice involved that's
the philosophy behind it
as opposites to reiax I guess here and
the architecture is fairly since
sensible because the community works
together to get the perfect architecture
instead of everyone working separately
to get their own architecture which yeah
I guess it depends on the opinion of the
developer but it works well for some
things yeah and it handles testing out
of the box you just drop a file
to any part of the app and it with -
test and it runs your tests but that was
that was really nice until my first
feature and until the code review time
came in lots of comments most of the
comments just said please do this the
amber way okay fine so what's the amber
way you Excel instead of compose so
basically most of it just works by
extending well I guess which react I was
used to hotwire harder components you
can also extend which reacts but amber
really realized on these a lot and like
okay these will become really difficult
to debug and how many layers can you
have and I don't know it just I also
used to do it the other way that it was
just confusing me but I guess in the end
if you have sensible codes it's it can
work pretty well both approaches can
work really well as long as you don't
just have several layers of extensions
so that's alright then the next one
everything is a string this is not
immutable j/s this is how you get Elm
you get properties inside your classes
you don't do these dot items you have to
do these dot get items these dot set
items for example doesn't feel a lot
like JavaScript it's a little bit
difficult to autocomplete
but it's fine you can get used to it so
next thing if you want to run tests you
need to filter them if you want to
filter only certain tests in your
application if you want to run only
certain tests you need to filter it with
strings so this is if you look at the
first example it says a module for
acceptance and then there's a string
that is how you describe your tests and
that's yeah
that's how you know which test you are
running so ember contains acceptance
tests unit tests and the integration
test it allows you to run the three of
them out of the box without any setup so
you just write as a string basically
what type of test you have there's a lot
of a few other differences but yeah this
is one of them but yet then when you
want to run them you're an amber test
filter name of your module now what if I
wanted to run all the shopping cart
tests that are only unit tests I would
need to do a negative filter and what if
there was a test called the test for a
module and if there was a module called
acceptance then how do you how do you
run unit tests for a module called
acceptance it will run all the
acceptance tests it just doesn't work
but again if you keep a really strict
naming convention for your modules it
can work because I'm Reds are their
advantages so it's so it's alright it's
there's like a trade off but the next
thing this was the most interesting one
these amber contains add-ons add-ons are
packages that you can build and you can
install them by NPM and once you install
them in your app they are immediately
available for use so for example you can
install an add-on that contains a few
components and you install it just by
installing the components are
immediately available in your app and
you can start using them I guess
that is good for UI libraries for
example but I guess the question here is
that you're not just you're not telling
your app explicitly use this package
you're just installing it by NPM so I
have this application here this is a
simple amber application it's just a
hello world application just
bootstrapped it with ember CLI and I'm
just going to install a package that
will me
your app to be more Christmasy so let's
just run it so yeah okay
it's called merry amber if you want to
install anything if you have a number up
and you want to hijack it
okay good this way okay the app is
running again and we're coming back I
didn't move yeah yeah there's snowflakes
fooling enjoy a little bit and we'll go
yeah so you can see it just didn't do
anything so for example if you have a
package that has like a minor version
upgraded and they decide to and for some
reason someone decides to make fun of
everyone using their package they can
just do something like this
how does this work it's just simply by
this is the index J of my add-on and I'm
just exporting a property called content
for and I'm telling it to where the
style tag to the heads and I'm telling
it to add some HTML with snowflakes to
the body now that's basically it which
is scary right it's it's a bit scary
it's scary
so this was how how I was feeling when I
discovered what discovered what that
Donn's could do and whenever I went to
speak to one of my friends and they
asked me what hey how are you doing I
would just tell them I'm doing ember now
and for you well but yeah as time as
time goes by I start saying that it
wasn't told that Beth's
ember actually had several good things I
mean there's so many people using it so
certainly it helps teams to create their
absence people really love it
so yeah and there are some things that
we can actually learn from ember and
move it into our react applications
because usually react applications can
be very lose each team will build the
application according to what they need
so something that ember brings that's
really good is the conventions there is
a lots of documentation there is lots of
people helping you online telling you
how how you should do certain things
okay it's not necessarily good but it
helps I guess if you're searching for
solutions and people will just give you
one solution instead of giving you
several so it's a good I guess if you're
a junior developer for example and
you're just starting out or if you have
a team that is full that has mostly
junior developers for example it can
help the architecture is pretty yeah it
actually is pretty solid because there's
so many people iterating over the same
architecture all the time
and it comes with something interesting
that I think could be helpful in a react
app if you already know how to how you
want to structure your components and
and your pages it has this generator
thing you just type my generator out
Christmas for example and it will create
a folder with
your pages we told the CSS and
JavaScript files that you need for
example can be helpful but yeah
basically conventions I feel like when
working with react apps that don't use
any framework like next years or
whatever if it's just a react app that
you built from scratch you chose to use
redux you chose to use graph QL whatever
each developer will have their own
opinion on how to do things and it's a
good idea
I guess when starting a projects or as
the project evolves to decide together
what you want to do and to document that
and to make sure that every that
everyone then follows those conventions
I mean conventions can evolve you can
change the documentation you can update
it but if everyone does it the same way
then code reviews are just so much less
painful in the case of ember for example
cause reviews just became way less
painful because you're supposed to do it
always the same way so people are not
code reviewing on little details they're
called reviewing on the actual
implementation and yeah what I was
saying finding for solutions for
problems it's always a little bit easier
because everyone does it the same way
but I guess there's there's a trade-off
so yeah I realized I was complaining so
much about temper I was I was being I
was being a little bit of an idiot I
guess because you know each developer
has its own has their own way of doing
things and when you get so accustomed to
do any things own way particularly you
get so accustomed to functional
programming to hire other components to
choosing your own tools to have freedom
in your development coming into an
environment where it's for everything
where everything is very much stricter
it just makes you a twist to me made me
feel like I was
constraints and instead of seeing the
good things I just started by saying the
bad things about it and I only started
seeing the good things afterwards and
yeah that kind of happens with everyone
right so I think everyone has well lots
of people have been here and lots of
people have heard the story of the
jQuery developer who came to a framework
or whatever and just kept on complaining
that they couldn't use jQuery modules
for example I mean I've done that I've
heard lots of people who've done that
but that just means that yeah we are
used to a certain way but we can always
learn to do something differently and we
can learn from frameworks I think it's
always yeah I think it's always a good
idea to look at other free I see how
they work so moving from like one
framework to the other is like I guess
learning to drive on the other side of
the roads you're just like what's
happening what am I doing here but after
a while your mind just gets used to it
and it's just driving on the other side
of the road as fewer as you've learned
yeah what I meant is just codes
I guess call this a cultural thing it's
like a language like a skill and yeah
you never stop learning
just yeah keep your mind open to to new
things you don't need to keep your mind
open to Ember I still don't like it so
yeah people like it so it's fair enough
and it's good it has good things yeah
that's it for me
thank you
if anyone has any questions no not yet
actually so I think it will definitely
influence in the parts of deciding
standards from an early stage of the
application and writing more
documentation I guess because I think
most of the problems that I found with
reacts ups we're not the actual we're
not the actual tooling it was just
people having trouble following stars
because you need to write code really
quickly so you just write it your own
way and then you don't define a
convention because you need to ship it
and then you forget to then there's no
documentation at all so the next person
will go and we'll just write it their
own way because it's difficult right so
if you you can I believe that
next time I work in an area up I will
try to spend more time in the beginning
just setting a bit of standards not too
much but yeah just so it's all beat so
everyone can find it easier to work with
yeah I guess I guess I would probably go
I would probably always go for yeah but
I think that if you have a team that is
used this would be on one of the cases I
guess if you have a team that's used to
Ember everyone knows
yeah yeah I guess if it's because react
is kind of I know you need to know a lot
about JavaScript I think and the other
frameworks both angular and ember maybe
you don't need to know as much
particularly ember because you have so
much documentation you can just read
through the old Doc's and you know how
to write your app so if you have a team
that's less experienced and you need to
create an up fairly quickly I guess in
that situation I'd use it but I mean it
I suppose of really big apps maybe it
can be a good choice react can get messy
but again yeah it's about using the
right tool for the job but it's also
about using the tool that so that your
team likes better so I guess if you have
a team that evaluates a set of choices
and they prefer to use one of one of
those that can also be another reason to
go for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
