today you know camel how many of you are
familiar with the camel oh okay that's a
big chunk of here that's really good
so as you know a camel is an impure
statically typed functional language and
a common standard library doesn't
include any built-in iterators it only
has lists and lists are strict so non
lazy evaluated in place lists they can
be infinite in some specific cases if
it's like a self repeating sequence or
something but otherwise they're like
using up your memory so usually when it
comes to iterators people use libraries
third-party libraries that implement
some form of an abstraction model that
maybe encodes like lazy lists or some
form of sequences generators and I'm
gonna be talking about these things and
I'm gonna be explaining the differences
between the fundamental models and the
interesting observations that I can make
about the models that I'm about to
present is that most of them are non
pure they're mutable they use exceptions
references so not something that would
like to present like you know Haskell me
talk so to say so I'm gonna try to
improve them so bear with me I'm gonna
try to take these models and beat by
beat make them less impure more pure and
at the same time I'm going to introduce
some safety mechanisms and potentially
even improve their performance this
talks includes a lot of code so I'm
gonna be moving fast ask questions if
you don't understand something I'm not
expecting you to follow every single
line of code just focus on the ideas and
the models I guess and do ask questions
please so this talk is not actually
about iterators or anything it's it's
more about like fundamental ideas that
we have in computer science functional
programming or camel or Haskell or
whatever it's about functions and
now that I'm thinking about this after
the first dog by Ben and I'm thinking
this dog is actually about fold again so
it's all folds it's all just folds and
I'm hoping that you will see this
pattern here so this is a type you know
camel and it says I'm expecting a unit
and I want something of type a this is
like a generic type for those of you who
don't know a camel and what can we say
about this
so in Haskell of course I think this
function is like kind of impossible
right like you can you have to rise an
exception or like use undefined or
whatever but you know camel you can
specialize this function to integers for
example and return like random integers
because it's not pure so you can you
know read stuff from the standard input
and just throw the intercepts to the
user what I was saying is that if you
specialize this function to integers so
like unit int in that case you can
produce integers in Haskell you can
produce one integer but you know can we
can produce multiple integer so the
whole domain of integers and this this
function represents like the basic idea
of the pool based model so you ask for
something in it you get something back
so if we let's assume that this function
kind of produces values that we need so
it's like a very primitive form of
iteration so to say how can we make it
stop like we need to give it a way to
terminate its execution signal that I'm
done how would you usually do this so
another way to terminate a function and
say like I'm done I don't want to leave
it at this world anymore so just throw
an exception and by just using this
primitive model let's see what we can
build that kind of resembles what
iterators can be so we have eater and as
you can see the type is unit a we define
an exception stop iteration we have a
global mutable reference and then we
have count as a function and it
dereference is the current value check
if checks if that element is greater
than or equal to 3 and then rise is an
exception and
increments the reference and returns
that so okay how do we use it well we
can call it so you saw that the type is
this which means that we can essentially
just call it and we get zero and then
one and two and then once it's finished
it just you know Rises an exception okay
so this is brilliant right
we have mutable state exceptions notice
that this if doesn't even have an else
statement
this is just okay but I promised that I
would try to improve you know these kind
of models and iteration you know Carmel
in general so let's let's see if we can
do something better let's follow your
advice and let's use options and this is
actually the type used by one of the
very popular akarma libraries called gen
that implements this kind of iterators
so Bowl based iterators give me
something i have nothing
iterators let's see how we can really
find the count function using this this
abstraction now this looks better we no
longer have the global mutable reference
at least so we don't have exceptions
which is even better but we still have
the local mutable state right so this
function can be used by well first of
all creating initializing the iterator
and then calling it a few times and when
I reach done it is gonna repeat none
forever and now that we know how to get
the elements out of this pattern let's
implement something more functional like
a fold so this is a fold it takes an
iterator it requests for more elements
if the iterator is empty then we just
return the result otherwise we continue
the recursion expecting the iterator to
produce a new element next because it
has internal mutable state right this
map definition for example uses local
references the only way that map has to
communicate its termination is by
checking if the inner
iterator stopped so this is why we have
the stop flag here initially it's false
but then once the inner iterator is none
we say that stop is true so we stop the
map itself as well okay so with this we
can actually write some functional code
underneath it's kind of mutable ugly or
camel but this is you probably know this
kind of forward type forward application
operator we have a nice functional
interface so why why can why why do we
have to use this mutable state in most
cases maybe not map
not in my but in other cases and the
type itself is just not flexible right
like this type I mean it kind of asks
for mutable state this is something used
by rust I think pythons iterators are
very similar to this you just keep
asking for more and more iterator
elements you get the exception when the
iterator is done but anyway we already
improve this but can we do better I
think so but before actually go into the
improvements to this type let me talk
about something else
so what do you think it's the opposite
of this type may be ignore the option
here well the opposite is like consuming
elements instead of producing elements
and it might seem that it's like the
opposite of iteration but it's just a
different type of iteration and it's
iteration that is based on the push
model so instead of requesting four
elements we supply a function that will
get the elements as soon as the producer
has them potentially all of them which
is really important so then this type is
not flexible enough to implement actual
iterators but if we look at this one I
think this is good enough and in this
case we have a function that takes
another function as an argument and this
function here the first argument is a
consumer so it's like a callback this
thing here is a continuation
specialized to the unit result-type okay
so we take this callback function and
expect the whole function to give us
elements of type a and then something
will happen so it's like a dev know like
a black hole for values the consumer
function now let's do exactly the same
thing and try to implement count with
this we have our type so the iterator is
something that takes a consumer and then
returns unit this is how we define count
the function that I showed you
previously for loops you don't have
those in Haskell so as you can see this
function this.k argument here is the
continuation function so it's the
consumer and we eat right on the numbers
from zero to two including two and we
just send them down to K and I can do
with them whatever it wants you know
it's not the producers responsibility to
decide what has to be done so now we
initialize this counter and we can call
it we just supply the function that you
know much is the types and it just works
now how can we get the elements out of
this thing like the type returns unit
like we are forced to use mutability
again so let's look at some functions
like filter type and fold can you not
use references in this case
mmm-hmm what about this one like I think
that the only way to extract something
that is happening inside this consumer
is to use a reference so we initialize a
reference to the accumulator we run our
computation trusting our producer to
give us elements and then once that is
done we have the updated result right
and take is a bit more complicated I'm
not going to talk about that but yeah
okay so what is this pull based
iterators and push based iterators like
two completely opposite models to
achieve mostly the same thing so each
one of them has their own like
advantages and limitations the most
common one is the ability to zip
sequences so for example with push based
iterators is extremely hard to zip
things because the producer is in charge
and the producer decides when to send
elements so we'd have to wait for one of
the producers to give you the second
element to zip the pair of of those
forward and I I was thinking about this
limitation and and I decided to
implement something that would support
this ability to zip and of course pull
iterator support zipping because at any
point of time you can ask the to eat
writers to give you the next element and
once you have those you can kind of
yield the pair why why did I want to do
this
well because pull iterators are slow the
reason pulley tracers are slow because
they allocate an extra boxed value
optional value for every single element
that they produce and that goes to the
heap and then the garbage collector is
woken up and you know it's complicated
while push-based iterators don't suffer
from that problem as you were saying
it's just function composition so I
decided to do this kind of small
experiment and see if I could improve
pull based et writers using some
techniques to learn from the push-based
in traders and just for come
witness pool by sea traitors are also
called external iterators and push by
sintering iterators are sometimes also
called internal aerials so what is the
kind of ideal model that I'm trying to
achieve and I think now that I'm that
we've discussed this kind of trade-offs
this is a bit incomplete because yeah of
course I'm focusing like on pole by city
writers data structures but in general I
wanted them to be pure I'm not really
sure why honestly I think you know camo
people usually don't ask these kind of
questions like if you have to use
references go ahead
exceptions for control flow why not but
I mean this was just like an experiment
so and it kind of fits the Pasco meetup
being as well I wanted good performance
safety so closing file descriptors for
example if needed lazy on demand any
initialization of those resources early
termination by consumers and educational
termination by producer you might know
this one this - from pipes or conduits
if you use them and the interface that I
implemented is similar to this one so
it's a very basic streaming model the
interesting bit is that take forces
early termination fold is the consumer
filter well doesn't go through the
doesn't pass all the elements to the
consumers so I mentioned that we were
going to try to improve this type so the
pool based it writers and I decided to
play with it and the first thing that I
tried was to introduce this explicit
state so leave the state to the type
level and make it part of the
declaration we have the initial state
there so if we are iterating on a list
for example that's the list that we have
next is the function that expects the
current list or the current state and
produces an element from that list and
also the next version of the state so
that we can continuously get the
elements out of the state or otherwise
it just stops saying none and that means
the producer is done this is how we can
implement count with this model I think
it looks nice what do you think it's
pretty simple so we define the next
function that essentially expects an eye
for a counter I guess if it's end and
just return none otherwise we yield the
eye itself and increment the state and
the initial state is zero okay so now I
also mentioned that we want to make this
safe so I decided to include the these
two helper functions the init and free
in it protects the state from being
unnecessary unnecessarily initialized so
for example if you create an iterator
and then immediately say like take zero
well the producer is not going to even
open the state in the first place and
free of course just releases the the
site closest the websocket for example
or there's some other additional work
this is how you implement fold with this
and I'm using the common in Haskell
bracket pattern to make sure that
whatever happens inside this lopes in
inside this loop is always properly
initialized and cleaned but otherwise I
think it's pretty straightforward okay
so what is the problem with this I was
very happy about this I mean it's not
massive improvement but it's pure at
least it has better performance than
original pull based iterators for the
general case at least what was happening
here compared to the push-based
iterators this was still incredibly
incredibly slow so as I was researching
some other ideas I came up with this I
found this thing called scoring coding
and this is very similar to charting
coding which essentially allows you to
represent a data structure
as a set of functions I guess functions
that simulate the data structure instead
of being the data structure so it's
focused on the behavior and not the
structure so the difference between
coding coding and chart encoding by the
way is that coding coding uses uses the
type itself so it's self references
recursively while in church encoding I
think lists are like fold rights
essentially the reason I have this like
in Haskell is because if you search for
Scott encoding and accommo the only
thing that you'll find is like Haskell
essentially all over the body so but of
course we can just translate this to a
comma sorry about that okay so this type
has a function called view the reason
I'm using is trucks by the way is
because we need or at least prefer this
R type the result type of this whole
thing to be a universal type and then
this view function accepts two arguments
are for the neal case and cons for the
non neal case I guess for when you have
the elements and it's easier to
understand with the example so this is
wrong by the way should be one this is
regular pattern matching on lists you
just check if the list is empty zero in
that case otherwise one plus recursively
the length of the tail with this view
function you do exactly the same thing
but you don't have to party much you
supply the value for the default case
the case in which the list is empty and
you supply a function that expects X
being the element of the list that one
and access the type itself so that one
you can't use axis on its own because
it's again this kind of abstract not
obstruct but obstructed type and you
recursively call Lang again in this cons
function so why should we care about
this well for me the answer to this
question was performed
essentially so by using this functional
obstruction we avoid avoid any runtime
allocations on the heap and thus get
better execution times how can we use
this type well this is how you can
construct Neil and cones and you can
figure out the left or the rest I guess
you can using these two functions you
can build up lists from any other data
structure or source in general so Neil
for example just ignores the F because
it knows that it's empty it's the
definition of the empty list and returns
R so we get zero if we call that cons on
the other hand ignores the R because it
knows that it at least has one element
which is X and then the continuation the
tail of the list is L here so in that
case it's gonna be 1 and so on now I was
looking at this and I was really
impressed and I decided to merge the
initial type that I had with this and I
came up with this type okay so let me
explain step by step what it does or
what it is you need and free are pretty
much the same from the previous slides
next it's a bit different so next next
is accepting the current or initial
state the current or initial result and
then it has this stepping function and
the role of the stepping function is to
essentially take the next element from
the state it's given the next element
from the state and it's given the next
state and it produces the next result
which is the one that will be returned
here now the interesting bit is that
this S has the similar a similar role to
the list that we have here it only
exists there to allow our stepping
function to eventually call next again
with a new are and with a new S so it
drives the
continues okay so now this is how our
map looks in this model so this is kind
of identical to pattern matching or
Karrimor frizam as you usually say in
Haskell so i'm destructing this state
with the next so the view or the
unconscionable that it has so far and
I'm expecting this step function to get
an element the next step and then
finally it calls the step from the inner
iterator so it essentially rubs the this
iterator here with a new next function
and uses this stuff to continue kind of
let this step drive the recursion
this is tyke take needs to make some
changes to the state so not sure if you
notice but in this case I'm saying eater
with next so this in a combo
means take all the fields from eater
record and replace next with next this
next while in this case I'm replacing
all of them because I need to make
changes as I said so in it is actually
the original state of the inner iterator
and then I also add an counter or limit
sorry free essentially ignores the
counter and frees the state or parent
iterator and then inside next I have
access to both this state from eater and
I which is the counter and I can you
know decide what to do next
the interesting bit is that since s is
an existential type I'm not actually
allowed to use this type you know for my
own purposes the only thing that I can
do is to essentially pass it to next
because next understands it
okay so fold and fold is the one who
actually drives the drives the you know
recursion so it's still a pool based
model fold is in charge four fold is a
consumer and
it has this go function which is
recursive we use bracket to make sure
that we you know handle resources
correctly and then finally inside our
stepping function so that's the one
that's gonna be used by mob filter and
so on we call go again with a new state
so go is like the balancing thing
between the state and the result the
state is like the bucket with some input
and R is the bucket with some output and
go is kind of responsible for taking
stuff from the S bucket and putting
things through the F function to the
result pocket so I implemented this
using this model and I try to make a
simple benchmark that essentially used a
few Maps if you filter sand view tykes a
very simple and primitive benchmark it's
not useful to judge any real-world
production applications of this model
but at least it gives us some
information and here are the results so
the results are normalized so this is
showing the percentages between the
different models here we have the
absolute values external is the original
pool based iterator internal is the
original push based interrater external
K is mine stream Fusion is the Hamill's
implementation of something similar to
haskell stream fusion I guess the one
that has yield skip and done that
essentially removes the recursion from
the combinators and thankless is just a
lazy list at least protected by a unit
values and I mean it's performing well I
was really surprised it's even better
than our internal of iterators so I mean
maybe that's an improvement maybe I just
miss something but I'm gonna continue my
research in this so yeah this is it and
that's all I have to share with you
today some conclusions before I finish
so I think that in general continuations
or
functions in general can lead to better
performance I've seen cases were like
libraries that were mentioned here like
pipes are conduits benefit a lot when
converted to the conservation bypassing
style so it's something that we should
always be aware of yes it does
complicate the code but I mean if you
really need performance maybe it's worth
it
and also I'm starting to think that
maybe we just need a better syntax for
our continuation based you know
computations that would make this
problem just disappear
pure programming is actually possible in
a camel I mean of course it's not
enforced by the type system or anything
but you know even in Haskell you have to
kind of pretend sometimes right like all
the unsafe functions and all that and
also in pure functional code is possible
in a camel in pure functional code is
also possible and it essentially means
that you know yes the the initial post
based and pull based models that I
showed you use mutable state and
exceptions and all of that but they are
all protected by this interface and like
I don't really care if Tyco has to throw
an exception inside to you know maybe
the number of things to to pass forward
because you know a commis type system is
really solid so it allows me to build
nice functional interfaces on top of
ugly mutable code so yeah and finally
functions are the ultimate ultimate
abstraction in my opinion like it's very
it's firm it's really impressive how you
can build really sophisticated things
with just a few functions and yeah
that's it
