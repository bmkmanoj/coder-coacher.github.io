laser data visualization on the web have
you ever heard the expression
time is money or something like that
well that's not right time is more
important than money
so what we can do is and we're trying
navigate the wilderness for you guys
with comes that visualization because
there's a whole bunch of stuff out there
right all the d3 guys and paraffin guys
have their libraries and all those web
devs have like our other stuff but I
think as I've met trend from more and
more stuff towards the web when it comes
to that of authorization statistics
machine learning which is good for us
because that's the best be honest we're
getting we're getting bored web
development there's just like if in devs
they're under the P agent and displaying
bit yeah so we have choices have choices
when it comes to everything d3 Cabana
Vega
you know WebGL ubers you know 3GS
babylons yes how do we pick what to do
with it whenever that validation
solution so we just like come to these
roads and we're like doing all right or
do we left or do we go around the Rona
boat and then down that road there so
the future of that vegetation according
to my humble opinion or maybe not so
humble opinion the WebGL and JavaScript
there's some really cool stuff that's
going on right now there's like sediment
like Mandelbrot sets where you watch
these zoom and you zoom into the
Mandelbrot set well you can do it in 3d
and WebGL and it's just there's some
funky stuff man
I've made a CD strategy game with the
Babylon GS no obviously as programmer
speaking called analogic we once or you
could actually come up that
visualization solution and nobody's done
before just by using your programming
logic and somebody's like native 3d 3d
objects that the Babylon
thank you soft made this female called
Bible mgs which is what I'm using here
and that allows square high-performance
framework allowing you to hates up heads
of the gory details of WebGL from you so
what Ober I've done and actually talk to
the guy I mean can metaphor this what
uber I've done is they've actually
created a small wrapper around WebGL
which doesn't hide you from little level
WebGL stuff by it sort of makes it look
more more friendly
and he build this thing called deck gel
on top of there Lumi nothing and what as
is it basically allows you to visualize
big data that can plot millions of
points on the screen at once using like
even to submit my rubbish Mac here this
is 2015 so big data it's really hard to
visualize some things what you've got
but will these kind of things you can't
she started visualize them so they have
all the stuff can I write inferred
reacts but I was talking to the guy and
say it's about you trying to extract
that out of reacts or the enemy can use
it on any framework these are like like
city things and other stuff and like you
know obesity should workers in a minute
visual export a of large datasets and
this is Google facets which is another
thing so they kind of picture as you
know what is a machine learning right
basically it takes data and categorizes
a you know to Saturn like you want to
categorize something as a car or a dog
or and you know categorize whether this
drawing matches a cheer or something so
or even just like data you want to
visualize but in a way that it's kind of
for after the war a spreadsheet
this is facets things with the helps you
he'll give me a live demo this is
basically word this so let me just show
you a demo so this is ten thousand data
points it's a 2d drawing but it's over
on web feature web gem WebGL canvas and
if you actually can see how this is real
time by the way so I can actually
navigate this you click on any data
point and you can see the data here and
you guess and this is not possible but
d3 or SVG's and what you can do is you
can actually categorize you can actually
faster ties these things into rows and
columns so for example if we tick pick
with a faceting and we can do a rule
based faceting on CH and put them into
bends which you can sit so you see that
animation there that's how all those
things moving individually this is a
again this is a rubbish Mac I've got so
this is like you can see here these are
like you can colorize by I think it's by
occupations so you can colorize by a lot
of things you can colorize by something
like
module Cyril sighs so you can see like
all the red stuff here young people
basically we're never married and then
as you go up more people are married and
then you've got this like divorced that
area runs a lot of people don't get my
divorce throwing 39:54 right I don't
know why I take that they keep pecking
this that thing it's kind of sad to look
at many it also in Coke and fast i sat
right on their ways and and the
practical one so you can do by a race
you want to see had my ideas are Paris
so there we are so you see here that to
be honest it looks like the proportions
or prefer race are kind of like similar
baby this is this is basically you can
you can put anything Canada in here if
you want like this one here's another
one this is machine learning data set so
you have a bunch of drawings that
recognize like a face or something
I think it's loading
there's supposed to be a lot of like
feces in here alright skip that this is
the best bet here this is this is Dec GL
so this is the best like I'm the
maecenas anything eyes before than the
browser's this is crazy
like this is like real-time 3d points
and the clout I just I don't know my
Internet's working first year
shame
I think he's just loading a lot of data
all right here we are this is crazy
right these are all like individual
points that can even plot and you can
add imagine one that's not like a decent
match look at the GPU there's another
cool one where you got like all these
like street accidents in the UK so you
can basically see what's going on going
wrong in London
Philly's accidents and you can like
change the radius of the points to get
even more resolution so this is like
never drawing a lot of points right now
any book will check it out oh those are
these are feces so like this is a
machine line data set so each point has
like at it is recognized or not so you
can actually color by things like is it
recognized and then the computer will
see this is basically you can categorize
both these facets vertical horizontal
and then you can go and see what the
computer so this is basically this is
this not recognized as a face right and
this is like so this is like computer
looks of that and thinks now it's not a
face no there's a well some of them are
like I don't know why it doesn't think
that's not face and like this like also
you can make these are like strokes I
think as if they care they're number of
strokes so like somehow it thinks that
you think that maybe the more strokes
would be more more accurate but the
sometimes the machine learning the more
strokes that are the wash that gets
returned ah okay great so the more
simple like to a certain point rate I
mean oh there's like a bare minimum
there's like a sweet spots or you can
look at this data you can very quickly
see like what is what's happening and
and I'm like but a MIDI and stuff all
that thing don't lies work okay so I'll
just go and rest the slides so we know
we have deep learning capabilities in
the browser this is Google's one of
Google's latest projects so all people
like me that basically program for nine
years I can't avoid learning Python and
it cuz it's not another language no we
don't need to learn a long language we
can use our JavaScript skills to use
machine learning and they actually have
things running in a browser like playing
piano real-time with based on what the
machine is learned when it comes to
looking other composers and especially
running in a browser
what it does is it uses it shifts all
the complicated calculations from
JavaScript over to the GPU and it gets
the results back from the GPU until
you're at your normal JavaScript
programming 5,000 stars I'm actually
just looking at Sunwest did about
research on it I make some youtube
videos as much a figure out what's going
on because I don't like one of the
things that Gabe brought when they
sought something like you need
Visual Studio or Microsoft cord to run
this thing I was like whoa I'm ain't
going in stop putting system issues but
you know it's exciting
another thing Microsoft have their own
version of Google facets so it's called
sand ants it's been around for over four
years this is somewhat kind of stuff as
benning this time faceting or bending
and d3 we all know what these three is
anyone use d3 so do freeze like SVG well
more at that's right it's like toolset
you could Envy d3 which is like the
chart this off easy chap chartwrapper
around d3 if you can use that and it's
like a macbook version of all this tool
set you go bigger which is another sort
of wrapper around d3 so said are using
declarative solid procedural code you've
got this sort of declarative JSON files
which specify how things should look I'm
not used it but I've played around with
it
but Cabana Koran is like a thing it
looks a bunch of Jason and then people
like the bald dashboards around it and
that's that so what's the competition
for these guys quick piece of
development
lots opportunities we get deeper in and
it's all in so and that's it thanks for
listening</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
