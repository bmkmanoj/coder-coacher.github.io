York Times article we have met the enemy
and here's PowerPoint and this is a
PowerPoint slide that PA consulting did
for the US Army about Afghanistan about
eight years ago and when a Stanley
McChrystal syrup he turn around he said
when we understand that slide we'll have
won the war a little PowerPoint even has
its own political party the anti
PowerPoint party I thought this was a
joke I then went and investigated and I
found out they're not it's not a joke
they want a ban PowerPoint and they are
the eighth largest party in Switzerland
it is not a joke so here I'm gonna tell
you how to spread the tyranny of how to
create PowerPoint files with office gen
and no Jess so PowerPoint is actually
really popular for making diagrams the
case example here is I work for a kind
of called star count we have client
leads that go out and basically explains
businesses how to better understand
their customers free data analysis and
they wanted to create this particular
slide here and they were like this is
kind of like a guide through a dynamic
customer journey all the different ways
in which the customer interests with the
client it's got lots of different
elements to it and it's all dynamically
driven so we basically work out what the
best values are and then plop it in
there big problem that they had was they
said we want to use this diagram across
many clients but every time you try and
make it it takes a really long time and
a lot of customization so we had to look
at ways of solving this problem and we
can match across the way to do it and
there Jess and upon the discovery I
learned some interesting things you
don't need PowerPoint to create
PowerPoint files it turns out you can
actually create them with a text editor
and you might say how's this possible
and I will tell you what if I told you
PowerPoint files I just zip files to the
terminal so I am going to show you this
code executing if I can just get out of
there we go let's just do that so it's
going to unzip the file it's going to
open up Adam Adam is going to take its
time loading because it's an electronic
I know I wrote a book about it and
basically this is my presentation
unzipped right here so this is actually
a schema of files and folders
all XML that PowerPoint generates and
the way it does it is it's using a
format called
OpenOffice XML file format basically
it's a way to future-proof documents so
that they are still readable long after
the software that crediting is gone or
in our case made illegal by the anti
PowerPoint party and if you want to read
more about it there's two links the
office open XML file format um I've
called OpenOffice earlier but it's
office open and if you don't know about
XML Microsoft has made this handy guide
XML for the uninitiated if you want to
read about that and get familiar with
XML but it turns out you do not have to
write XML by hand to make this
PowerPoint files just on a curious note
does anyone know who that is by the way
yep the guardians program NASA Margaret
Hamilton she got the Presidential Medal
of Freedom from a bomber for achievement
that's all okay by the way if you wrote
all that you've got two libraries
there's one called pptx Jen Jess it
works on both the browser and the server
and you can play with that the one we
used at work was office Jen an office
Jen actually allows you to create Word
documents and Excel files as well and
PowerPoint I'm going to show you how it
does it so if you go through NPM install
and then you go you've got your
dependencies and then you want to base
the stock doing something you go declare
the file type set the title set the size
size then make a new slide put a tunnel
for the slide set some background
foreground colors to make sure that you
don't have the hash like in the CSS for
hex values and then you can add some
text so we have hello LLL knock set the
font face the font size how you want to
line it the XY dimensions you can just
set percentages the CX and CY refer to
container so that's actually like the
width of your box that contains the
object and then you can also create
images straight to tables and charts
only got eight minutes so not gonna be
able to run through that but basically
correct right file stream so you open up
a file streaming node we just set up a
little message to print out saying on
closed closed
pipe the PTX file generation stream to
the right of the file stream and it
generates out so it receives it and then
as it closes it does it is it gonna yes
good so basically just showing you this
actually running if I just run this now
that's code by the way was the actual
file I just show you do not that this I
can't type there we go so that's all the
code that we just ran through if I now
just quickly open up you can see that a
hello oh look that is the actual
PowerPoint for we're just generated for
that little example there and if we go
back to here so now we used office gen
to also mate generating the diagram for
us so the complicated diagram I'm just
going to run you through the code very
quickly once I got some up there we go
switch to dick basically we put in a CSV
file you'd have like different sections
for the different points of lines an
icon to use what kind of color you want
for the item that you're gonna plop down
some text put inside of it and then a
increments will spend number that we
just put in the circle on the left hand
side then what we do is just quickly run
for this we'd have this instantiation
here we'd do some little magic here
context basically does the work of
working out dynamically what should the
position of all those animals be
depending on what section they're in how
many there are in that section and then
basically making sure that everything is
just night nicely and nicely aligned and
adjusted and all that and then what
happens is we basically loop through a
list of images and shapes and text you
can see the calls here and I just do
some D structuring on the objects
because actually it passed in Peru as
raised stroke through and then output
BAM done and just to show you what one
of these files looks like I have one
here from earlier and basically it's
just doing this and these two hours to
do this
so then after this anymore which they're
very happy about so back to the other
presentation it turns out
mission accomplished you don't need
PowerPoint to create PowerPoint files so
just remind you there's office Jen
there's pptx Jen oh okay
there's office Jen there's PPE TX Jen
Jess that was really good because if you
want to embed YouTube videos and media
files you can do it with this and if
you're curious the founder of the anti
PowerPoint party has written a book the
PowerPoint fallacy still presenting or
order II fascinating if you become a
member you get seven years discount on
the site bargain and speaking of already
presenting that's it done thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
