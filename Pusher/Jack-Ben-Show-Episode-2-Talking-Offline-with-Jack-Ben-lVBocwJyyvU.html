without internet access offline or messy
everyone welcome to the Jack and Ben
show mine is Jack I'm a developer
evangelist here at pusher and enjoyed by
my colleague been i'm also a developer
evangelist here at Fisher as well go us
go us go insane cool and yeah today
we're gonna be talking a bit about the
web and building offline websites and
applications cool yes so I'm really
excited about offline web apps
especially with the stuff we do a pusher
likes we I think it works with the
things that we see people using pusher
for because when you're building
something that reacts to real-time data
you've almost got intuitive the offline
state as well so I'm looking forward to
seeing people adapt that more as I can a
UI thing yeah and also another thing
that's kind of exciting at the moment is
like we just released a new version of
our precious library which also runs in
a service worker I think there's a lot
of cool stuff that we could do there
yeah shout out to a colleague Jamie for
the push of 3.1 yet togo jamie so so
service workers are coming in form of
the main focuses of the offline web
today and they've been around they're
fairly new by the feds say they've been
around for a little bit of time now yeah
you're not going to don't pay out a
little bit across other browsers rather
than chrome we're kind of push for
additionally so a service worker is kind
of a script or that sits between the
browser and the network right and it
lets you inset requests and either
respond with some static data for those
requests or go into a cache of data
which is obviously works offline or you
can go and still hit the network and
then cash the response and then the next
time you you have our data back so
that's the kind of Gemma ID rights as
workers is we can have loads of control
over the network requests which we've
never been out to do before totally and
hope that whole style of having a kind
of script is existing outside your page
just allows so many kind of new things
which is awesome and everything I carats
is such a kind of small idea but it's
got really big ramifications so suddenly
you're able to kind of have
push notifications do background syncing
all that kinda stuff so last week I was
a CSV comp over in Berlin which was
brilliant this is about kind of open
data and things that we can do with that
and I built a project for that which was
a tool that gathered together data from
a runkeeper API don't RunKeeper API and
pulls down all that data and allows you
to access that through a service worker
so you're kind of synthesizing this
these URLs and what's really cool is
like once you've got data in your
browser you can format that data in
different ways through that service
worker and it means that you don't have
to have like a kind of complex web
service that is doing all this kind of
processing and yeah kind of it worked
out pretty well yeah yeah what I really
liked when I saw the demo application
you'd built was how you had so you had
like a ton of different URLs that sort
that gave you the data in a different
set of data more categories are
differently or whatever why I really
liked about that is because you're
caching all the data off line is if you
visited a JSON and get a ticket set of
JSON your online for that that was fine
but now the data is cached offline you
can go to bj's on and it will show you a
different set of data but from the cap
app so you had a kind of full offline
support with yeah pretty lift little
effort told really i think the
serviceworker gives a really nice
abstraction for if you're doing
especially data-driven visualizations
and stuff like so in your front end
you're just making Ajax call and that
happens to not be going to server but
just being served just from the service
worker and that means that your
front-end code doesn't have to know
anything about the database it doesn't
have to know about anything to do with
how to access those API is all it seizes
i canna Jason or CSV or
whatever you want yep yeah I like it
prior to service worker we have this
thing called app cache which was the the
precursor really which was didn't
rillette you be fed said every let you
configure much about their kind of gave
you this solution and if that solution
fitted what you were doing that was
great but if it didn't then that really
kind of you you couldn't tweak it or
change it and then Jake Archibald post
app cache is a douche bag and kind of
spoke about it and that led towards Jake
and I was working on on service workers
and its really interesting we're seeing
this trend now of new browser api's and
features being added that a much more
lower level than we would have expected
in the past and service workers really
good example of this because it gives
you nothing out the box right you have
to write even the most basic example of
a serviceworker where you you hit the
network you cash the requests that you
serve from the cash you still have to
write the code to do that that's not
that much to write but you still have to
do it their way I've really enjoyed that
we expose more low-level api's and
giving developers full control even that
means there's a bit more work upfront
and it's a bit more complicated to get
started with longer-term I think the
benefits a huge foot for doing that so
one of the things I really like about
service worker is it's a very low-level
API I think we're seeing this more and
more with new browser features is rather
than expose some high-level feature that
you can kind of use or not use and not
really tweak we can now get this
low-level API that is maybe a bit more
work to set up and get started with that
longer term gives you complete control
which is really really nice and even
though it's basic use case of sending
requests as a network giving a response
back cashing it and then serving it from
the serviceworker requires any developer
to write zone 10 lines of code whatever
is maybe a bit fewer but if later on you
have some really contrived use case you
need to use it for you can because you
have access to the real low-level
nitty-gritty nuts and bolts if you like
which is yeah really good to see I think
and I think we'll see quite a lot of
libraries that are utilizing service
workers and kind of building on that you
almost probably want you been touching
it necessarily you then get offline
support for free effectively because in
the background power ship is going as
local storage and it syncs everything
for you so I've just been building a
really quite boring note-taking
vacation because that's a novel idea and
but it's really cool because if I you
know I'm writing a note on my cool app
that I'm gonna sell for millions and
suddenly like Oh bye I go into it I'm on
the tunnel in it on a train I can still
keep writing my notes and when my
internet comes back they will sink for
me and that's possible because we have
these low-level API eyes and then pouch
adds to that right and it's really cool
I think all those service workers are
fairly new i think google already got
service work a pre cash and a couple of
others which will generate service
workers for you if you tell them kind of
i want to catch this file on this file
in this file they'll just give you a
service worker that does that so yeah I
think like long time you're right i
wonder how much will even write service
work because of tools for the most basic
use cases will generate them for us and
that'll be it and that'd be great we're
viewing it as a wave gonna caching files
and keeping those kind of static files
ready in case you're offline but also
what I think I find a really excited
palter is the prospect of having more
real-time data sets using service
workers going to serve that when you're
offline which is something I mean with
the new version of pressure I've been
playing around with that quite a bit and
I'm really liking kind of patching cash
patching the cash to kind of add new
data as it's been pushed out by pressure
there's some really kind of exciting
stuff there and there's also like em so
service worker is allowed this kind of
push to exist because you can just you
don't have to have a web page open to
receive a message and also there's a
background sync API which think is just
in Chrome but yet which is like super
cool yeah and that is effectively try
and make a request to network and if
you're not on a network it will just sit
there and wait until your our network
and then send it off right so i think
jake a jake are called a render conquer
yeah the demo of like a chat was it is
emoji chat and he sent this message and
he didn't have a connection so he hit
enter and to him on his mobile little
that fine like the message had been sent
in university commons if you like and
then when he came back home on it was
sent and then he got all the replies and
stuff so yeah it's amazing and it's a
really exciting time to kind of start
playing with this stuff I think I think
it's like I mean it just opens up all
these possibilities for web apps to feel
much more natural as you can have as
you're using women kind of on your phone
going through network bad spots away i
think it's like yeah i think the web
could be a better place as a result
absolutely I don't think like we've seen
you know I think the worst thing for a
mobile users you load up this this
website and its a wide screen because I
think I think they will call it life I
Lite IV haven't got Wi-Fi and then at
least if you haven't got Wi-Fi you get
like a 404 you know you get the chrome
dinosaur whatever but if you've got this
fake wife I already bad signal you just
get a white pages it's loading stuff
which is just such a rubbish sigh
experience and that's one area where
native app traditionally have had a
benefit because if I load up and I've
said the Facebook native app and I'm
offline i'll still get all the content
from whenever I last looked at Facebook
or Twitter or whatever it might be but
now a service worker and background
saying all these things that are in the
pipeline we've really when we can match
that if not do better than that as an
accent that's really cool you've got
pusher running in your service worker
yes thing out for these events exactly
so I've been hacking around a little bit
with using pressure in a service worker
which is actually katic one pretty well
so it's quite different from the push
notifications and from background sync
it's kind of for real-time data as
you've got window open and it's got some
really gonna nice benefits and what's
really cool about it is I could start
off with this really simple app
architecture like you don't need to can
have this huge infrastructure of like
lots of different libraries it's just
basically you've got your app and it
works as normal and then you can just
add a service worker on the side kind of
enhance it yeah I think it's been
quicker your blog post about it this
week I put it in the show notes cool
yeah yeah that's definitely one of the
best things about service workers for me
is you can there a separate script you
can happen to any existing website and
still make them useful and also it's a
perfect example of progressive
enhancement because you just in your
main javascript is if service workers
are enabled add this service worker else
don't bother so I think that's also
driven adoption a lot because there's no
downside to use them really even if even
if they only affect half your use users
that still that
great yeah and that number is only going
to go up as more and more more more
vendors start to work and implement it
I'm pretty sure with mostly there now
yeah I think Apple might be the ones who
were not so sure about weather app does
your yeah exactly and judo I guess so a
kind of cool little thing what really
irritates me sometimes that is using
custom fonts like from google fonts
right about that but you can totally use
a service record player optimization
anything that is outside of your origin
you can intercept the sericus it doesn't
just have to be your own files it can be
stuff on the google fonts or it can be
kind of any other any API or anything
yeah cool which is like super powerful
yeah so these videos are kind of a new
idea and we're trying out other things
this week grin and try out at any other
business section so this week Eldon will
put 17 got released so elm is a a typed
functional language that compiles to
JavaScript which kind of takes a very
different approach to building
JavaScript applications it's always been
very very powerful it's kind of in its
infancy but picked up a fair amount of
steam from the community and this week
the latest version or point 17 got
released which removes one of the more
or doesn't remove it kind of hides away
/ abstract out one of the more
complicated parts of Elm which were
called signals which are these values
that kind of change over time kind of
like streams in reactive Jace or
whatever and replaces them with these
things called subscriptions there's kind
of the nitty-gritty details don't really
matter but what's important is they've
kind of dramatically simplified Elm for
people coming to language and removed
one of its more complicated hard to
understand features with a much more
straightforward model which is really
exciting so I think over the coming
weeks we'll be talking and updating some
of our LMS our pools and blog posts and
opal in 17 but really exciting to see
how this release will affect people
picking up down because I think it will
help a lot cool that's that's great like
cuz I actually think about that like
because I I really enjoyed that talk he
gave an atom but I caught length ya know
it was great but the signals were like
everything that
I was just like I was into it but it was
kind of a bit eight years yeah they're
very tricky I'm kind of goes like this
is okay this is okay this okay BAM yeah
so no so the later East own kind of has
a lot of improvements other than that as
well which is very nice yeah cool yeah
what about you Ben have you got any
other business and this week having put
you quite a lot about circles just yet
okay right so I've been working on this
kind of this deal time graphing thing
and I think you've got I've been playing
around with basically different modes of
plotting that and I think I've come up
with something which is kind of quite
pretty so yeah I've been like looking
into that quite a lot so basically all I
wrote was like this kind of a few
functions for like if you find out if
our circles intersecting and how to like
move them around nice okay and based on
those got like really tiny permanence
you can do all these kind of really
crazy cool looking things so yeah
circles are cool so I guess thank you
very much for watching if there's
anything you'd like to hear bed and I
talked about on the next show or in
future editions you can tweet app pusher
and we'll pick up and get back to you
you can leave any comments on the video
will also leave some show notes with
links to rather than things we've
mentioned throughout but yeah thank you
very much for watching and we will see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
