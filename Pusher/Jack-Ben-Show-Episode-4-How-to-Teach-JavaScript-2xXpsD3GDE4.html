good workshops always get bored don't
care because the instructor keeps of
babbling on
hello everyone and welcome to this
episode of Jack adventure my name is
Jack and this is Ben yo hey it's been a
while but we're back today so I'm going
to be talking a bit about how we first
got into the web and JavaScript
specifically and then talk about how
we've been teaching it I think both has
to be doing farewell workshop type
things recently you just want to kind of
mull over some force from those I guess
yeah yeah some start then how did you
even get into the web okay because we're
talked about this earlier and like so I
think I can I got in late so the first
website ever made was for my skateboard
I had like that's gonna yellow
skateboard there a website for and it
was like it was terrible but it was it
was quite I had done a quick fun and I
think just be able to like the openness
of man just have something together and
get it online contributor geocities nice
yea ye what was your first I had to
build a website for my football team
okay good my dad and I actually built it
to glaze yeah so we bought a car around
HTML book and i'm rachel andrews CSS an
apology but cool side for one which is
excellent and has been updated and its
really really good and yeah we just
built it I think we did use we didn't
even use tables and we went straight
onto floats took us a little time pretty
sure we had comic sans and there the air
but website to show all the scores from
our for our football team solid and
never angry yeah so I guess one of the
things we're talked about earlier as
well was about like we were both fans
jquery and still bands right like um I
think so that was something that could
have helped us both along right like
yeah you gave a talk about that render
yeah good teachers cool thanks so much
and yeah I think that to me the thing
that's important about that is the
accessibility of the web right like
making it easy just going to get started
and made people not feel intimidated by
it not generally went really far to do
that yeah i think my first exposure was
copying and pasting about cone's it did
like an accordion or a carousel or
something dreadful that Mia you know one
of those things I think JP gets a lot of
stick for making people be able to write
bad code already
efficient code in particular but
actually the way I would never been out
to write that code in regular JavaScript
at that time without being very much put
off I favorite and struggling with it
and i think jay jay is a perfectly valid
entry into the world of javascript and
what I did after that I think what you
did as well was go back a bit and kind
of step back and then I didn't know
about what's going on under the hood or
such yeah and I guess another thing
coming so I think we both got quite a
lot from blogging as well right yes so
usually particularly you've got a
JavaScript playground yes yeah and I
have about 500 other blogs before yeah
my first upload was a CSS blog birthday
yeah I think it would might have even
been called CSS wizardry before Harry
Roberts had CSS was a dream or maybe it
was something like that sometime soon no
it sounds like you know he probably had
at the same time that is way more
willing to learn good girl yeah I found
just writing about stuff a really
valuable way to get thoughts down and
kind of clarified what would I fall
about it what was your first block oh so
I think the first one that can
contribute to go to I'm not had as many
as you but I had like be fox or walk on
and it was just like this random little
bits and pieces of things I was having
on but why found really useful ways like
I'm notoriously bad from not finishing
projects and stuff like that where is
having a blog gave me somewhere to kind
of output it yeah and I think to me like
possibly like github repos are my new
blog thank you know it's like yeah and
so I kind of create I create one this
morning yeah there's no treated quite a
lot oh we're sounds like that we got out
right all right I
so I think we've both been involved in
teaching other people out here to kind
of program stuff aware yes things so and
so you were holding some react workshops
earlier theory yes yeah so I did a few
times actually I did a couple Wyatt over
in London and then one at Scotland j/s
and somewhere else is what I thinks I've
done about three or four kind of day
long react workshops now which has been
really good I really if anything
actually prefer doing workshops to a
talk unlike having 20 or so people for
our old days it's very different
a bit more rewarding and kind of half
hour I'm a couple hundred people's
attention let's be really good as to be
really interesting to see how people
learn what areas people struggle with
and also dealing with like the tooling
around react and teaching that and
seeing how that gets in the way or not I
think there's a lot of people who think
that maybe tools are a big issue and
they are in some ways but it's really
sign see people kind of pick up these
tools and actually they're not half as
bad as the stick they sometimes get yeah
yeah yeah it's really enjoyable when I
learn a lot from it as well and how I
can teach things better react i'm just
generally kind of JavaScript and the
rest as well cool cool ya know nice yeah
I think I've ever going to believe like
you no longer need to say good things
yeah yes all good um yeah thanks and so
yes oh and also usually like tons of
talks over the last yeah like yeah it's
I think it's always interesting like
writing a talk to try and focus on
getting people to get as much as out of
it as possible and say it's really hard
to kind of bring everyone along at the
same pace or something like that right
like which I guess probably more with an
issue with the workshop right yeah I
think with a workshop you have to be
much clearer ahead of time what the
requirements are for someone to get the
most out of it there will always be
people who a bit slower a bit they
quicker what I found really nice
actually at all
I've done is people have kind of helped
each other out along the way so that
that's from the best things if someone's
stuck and I may be helping someone else
or whatever often I'll come back and
someone's gone and I'd like better help
you a bit again I'm going to go so
usually like there's a sense of the in
the room that everyone is helping each
other out as well which is been really
nice to see so a big fan of the work my
workshops tend to be not be talking all
day because that ball me as much as very
much for the attendees than a clear I
mean you're bored right yeah I'm good
more words than I so I tend to like
maybe a bit of talking then have a
couple of exercises or challenges than
to do and rent a repeat after out of the
day so that's I found that very nice to
keep them and kind of hands-on engaged
talking or in laptops and then everyone
kind of often some will get stuck on a
problem i'll ask a question relates to
that and from their own leaders like a
half hour tangent on that particular
thing is almost the most valuable bits
the workshop chunky bits that happen
kind of the blue cool yep something
that's going all guys like ever done
know what's cool then or anything no so
I'm there what's really nice is you get
these set of ten tasks that you've got
to do to like achieve a particular to
learn about particular kind of text it
might be using express or might be using
kind of reactors on like that and you go
through each one a dragon-like workout
you can skip them if you want but in a
group it works really well because if
anyone's stopping a particular one than
other people who have done it they can
go and help people going to do it at
their own pace and stuff like that yeah
it works really well as a no that's nice
we've held a few times in jayhawks right
and it's kind of just run itself it's
quite nice awesome yeah and you've been
doing a fair amount of JavaScript ting
as well yes yes in a sudden some tent in
a field yeah I wasn't a fan of yours
yeah and so yeah this weekend I was a
EMF electromagnetic field and I gave my
first ever proper workshop that I'd
written myself which was a little bit
shaky but I was using a new tool odd
written which is this I'm calling a co
je s for like collaborative Jes and it's
kind of like an in-browser editor that
you can cast to other people and we're
let you do is
you can describe you can go through
court example taking it and everyone can
be watching long enough computer and
it's like it's quite early days like
I've been writing over the last couple
weeks but it's kind of cool like it is
gonna it creates quite a nice
environment for people to kind of share
their cold and working from rings and
stuff yeah so because I think thing I
find this thing i really i really dig
talks they're awesome size wise that you
you can go to talk and like listen to
half an hour you've learned quite a lot
workshops are super cool we need to be
there in our entire game I feel like
this is going to taking part of workshop
style of seeing cold and playing with it
but cramming it into a smear amount of
time so you don't have to kind of
worried about getting any tools and
still order yeah so that's something
that I've been doing and so the tool
it's just an editor with an iframe feels
doesn't like cold translation of stuff
is again using be playing roll up nice
your fans or you're so hip see oh yeah
yeah that's been yeah we were talking a
little while ago about tools and stuff
yeah and workshops so yeah without fail
every workshop I've done there will be
someone for whatever reason on whatever
laptop like not even like just old
windows machines all sorts of devices
he's like no Jess will fail like how
won't work or some incredibly obscure
reason and that's the worst actually
because like really I don't know what to
do to fix those other than a few very
common areas all I'm going to do is is
google them and so so that often I've
actually learning at all which I tried
our one of the workshops which I would
use in the future which is the same
sounds pretty similar to your
collaboration thing that is a react
editor so people go to a website and
they have an answer on the left and a
kind of view port if you like on the
right hand side the beauty of this is
they don't set up any of the tooling
around react and either like Babel to do
Jess X webpack to bundle together or and
hem to install things know that it's
also about balancing the browser they
write code they just have to define it
was a name and it will magically get
rendered to to the browser and let them
see it and because it's all with a
browser they can pick up the react dev
tools instead inspected it and all the
rest of it but it I found that to be
really nice to just get people started
and it I use that for the beginning the
workshops will come in for the laptop
down go to URL and be straight in with
the the exercises and this kind of
lessons and stuff to guide you through I
think sometimes if people go and sit
down and have to clone a repo or unlike
any own story cetera that can often be a
bit of a kind of like momentum killer
particularly when something goes wrong
and then everyone else is ready to start
on one person is struggling because
their computers not playing ball so I
find interest how we both kind of ended
up on this yeah yes go through and you
want all my tears 2015 yes oh yeah this
is our other discussion that's the basic
about the show if you take this fast I
don't leave the office yo put them in
front of the camera so another
discussion yet Tommy doesn't we never
had this is good ok cool so how do you
feel about yes 2015 vary from learning
ballast games like well interesting
question yeah yeah so I really like it
is 2015 and like nearly all of the
features it provides I think we've
learned a lot from the way it was
released and so on and now again so much
smaller races we could card I think in a
previous Jeff adventure but think there
is a danger that some of the new
features are really good but not
necessarily is easy for beginners to
pick up upon I think very easy example
is an error functions are very concise
which is great if you are comfortable
with them I think for a beginner they
can these encode that looks scarier than
it than it actually is in reality so I
think we need to actually if someone
came to me right now as I can complete
JavaScript beginner on everything had to
cover any es2015 not a single bit of it
oh yeah I as as you might've discuss
before I agree with that entirely I
think because I mean error functions are
cool when you know the problems with
this binding yeah you know Ennis but
then I think looking at them afresh it
can sometimes be a bit obscure then on
the same hand as like stuff like
kind of for each iterators and stuff out
there and that potentially makes things
be yeah this is a talk at render about
that and which will in turn the notes
basil yeah and just can't explain things
like for each sometimes like if you go
at like linguistically actor than people
can I can have on to be easier yeah but
I mean I think it's always really are to
see kind of coding concepts that people
are coming to like through from their
point of view like it's like some of the
some sometimes coaches like so obscure
and yeah detach from star sir yeah I
think a lot of you if you teaching on
the Australian 15 first there's an
appreciation for what the new features
are adding the structuring is another
good example like a Robin I'm do these
three variable devices I can just pull
them all out in one so yeah I think
there's a balance and classes again just
kind of syntactic sugar I won't want
someone to just pick up yes 2015 classes
without having a vague idea of what
they're doing by the scenes but you also
have to align somewhere it's like there
are some really nice array methods added
in yes following my map and elect or
filter I can never remember which one it
is called dr. Phil something might be
selecting Ruby them yeah it's one of the
two anyway whatever it is and there's
like some as well or every and all the
loans and I would teach those from the
from the beginning I think so be
interested seat like maybe because he
has 2015 is still relatively new we
think this but maybe in a couple of
years we might think yes 2015 as a
baseline to interesting to see whether
that line moves over at some time all
very interest is just so interesting
cool so I guess finally perhaps we could
talk about is how people can help other
people yeah what kind of things that you
can do absolutely yeah cuz we're just
making this up so we go ahead you know
there's a big misconception that you
have you know we know experts in this
right we just like doing it and I think
there are lots of people who could
probably just as well if not much better
yeah yeah basically yeah I guess yeah
right much better than me
oh cool cool so what would you say is
that if i'm watching this is someone who
wants to kind of get started maybe
teaching of it work or watch you go so
i'd say like so one of the things i
helped do is how it has a a meet-up up
an oxford can n javascript web group and
we're always looking for people together
then contribute talks and that can be
really great way if you've got if you've
learned something if you've kind of got
something to share and get in contact
with a group in this it's such a good
like it can be really rewarding
experience yeah i'm going to share that
information really useful pretty cool
yeah it's definitely like the very low
pressure environment as well i think
people also surprised about how few
people actually proposed talks to meet
ups totally i think a good example of
this is i was looking at the london node
user group website up there i think our
colleague Alex Linda's to it and they've
gotta get up repo for proposing talks
and this is London node group they have
a load of members and their meetups use
your very busy in they have maybe to
talk proposals so I think most meetups
are like absolutely desperate for people
to go into each other and everyone there
I want you to do it good tour but is
willing to kind of go with it and
support you in it they're fairly chill
because I want to just come from work
they don't like and really you know it's
not too intense it's pretty relaxed as
usually like beer or drinks available so
it's a nice environment yeah totally
yeah and yeah another thing I so I
jayhawks video or with the solver and as
a few hack days and like as the same for
the old school one you get if you can go
and tender and you'll end up at the end
teaching other people yeah that's like a
really can a great way of kind of
disseminating knowledge and stuff that's
really it's worthwhile just doing stuff
yeah yeah and then there's blogging yeah
I think we both think is a very good way
to also check that you know what you're
talking about as well yeah what a load
of my blog posts have come with the back
of me learning something and immediately
blogging about it and that's not me
being like you know that knowledgeable
about particular topics I just learned
something called on get this down and
pay
because other people find a cool let's a
really interesting as late as soon as so
you need to get over is as soon as you
realize how to do something you I
sometimes insulae feel like everyone
already knows it yeah and it's like it's
kind of like okay I'm just working out
this thing as I art I'm sure a one
already kind of they don't need me to
tell them because i actually just doing
a quick post or a tweet like that is
actually really bad yeah absolutely I'm
really gonna be useful to someone ya
ain't looking at my like Bob stats some
of the most popular posts are once room
234 years ago about stuff that you'd
probably imagine and I are mostly known
everyone knows that the others so many
people come into the web show from all
levels that yeah people always need to
know stuff die so we like to round off
the show by doing any other business
where then I picked some things that we
found cool recently so then what if he
found cool recently so the coolest thing
by far was electromagnetic field which
was a kind of I guess it was like a kind
of tech event last weekend and it was
all it was like a festival and it was
like there was tons of stuff going on it
was just mind-blowing this is the badge
from it like the lies so it's actually
yes you can program it and do a whole
one that's pretty good bad here's a very
good back use your problem it to have a
different thing yeah but then I think
yeah you probably could do that yeah but
you're not having it ok front of and on
that events like so I am helping run
cult retreat in later this month which
is a main up in Oxford which I'm really
excited about and that's about it's a
happy but happy about bettering the way
you make cold cool which is cool and
then lastly by my last pic is a you yeah
it's like yeah just like I really
appreciate you very much great guy
thanks yeah cool
later it's nice yeah om so what have you
felt moment that wasn't it yeah I felt
about it yeah so yeah I dad that's my
kind of pics a nice anybody any other
business I have got any other business
I've got two pretty cool things to the
world of JavaScript the first is
Facebook released a thing called create
react which is a command line tool for
creating reactor kind of fun in either
the idea behind this is people get
bogged down and starting react posting
up web back from Babylon and all the
rest of it Craig react app kinda there's
one command you run that has it all set
up for you in it kind of shifts a bunch
of stuff out of the box for you so it's
really really good for people who just
want to get started with react I would
for example probably use it in my
workshops because people don't demand me
so a bunch of stuff it got some
criticism around like because it
abstract Saul they're like no level
tools away but I don't see that as an
issue because I think it's at all very
much for beginners I think the people
who wouldn't use this tool shouldn't use
that tool I probably won't use it my
produce because i like having full
control but i'm comfortable in that the
web pack like config and environment but
if you're brand new to react you want to
get going on at its sponsor that's very
nice category a very small part that
which I particular Jose they include an
eject commands so you can react create
app eject and if you've in your
resisting react app and it will actually
remove itself and give you all the
config so you can then take that as a
base to build on seemed kind of like
create a sack with the tool and then
when you want to customize it just ditch
the tool and move on which is a really
nice approach yeah finally sort of tweak
couple weeks go by someone the google
chrome team they're very close to
bringing a headless version of google
chrome you can actually run it now
working there are some very involved
steps so i haven't attempted it but this
means like the hats have kind of phantom
jess and those other tools should be
able to go away and be a place with an
actual headless version of chrome we
should make browser testing way easier
awesome i'm sorry i started guys excited
yeah and finally this is going to be my
last Jack and Ben show yeah yeah
heartstrings salary saying that I'm
moving on from pusher this week so this
is the last time that we'll be recording
together at least on the jack adventure
yeah maybe we'll meet up yes I never
work and undo something record ourselves
having a beer yeah cool so yeah who
knows maybe we'll be back in another
guise but for now this is the last last
jacket men show that i'll be on so is
being you can get that new york ago i
can strap you like those feeling a lot
right now yeah hey girl cool well yeah
so catchy catch you later or like damn</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
