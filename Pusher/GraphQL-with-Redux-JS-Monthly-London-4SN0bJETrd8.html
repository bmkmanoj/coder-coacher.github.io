related to the talk you heard before
because apart from the fact that I'm
going to be talking about graph QL the
the system is the same so we are also
doing a synchronous calls and we're
going to store them in the Redux store
the results of them but myself I'm Mike
Liang Meier I work at BT and it's an
awesome company and we've been doing
react for number of years now
glad I joined here and the basic
reactant graph QL stack that people are
used to is that this is how it was
introduced in January of 2015 it was
basically react and graph QL and relay
as like the link that basically it's a
client caching layer that basically
stores the results that you get from
graph QL and it lets you query those
results in a declarative way the only
thing that changed since then is Redux
became pretty popular and I want to
explain why a lot of people in the
community are replacing redux replacing
relay with redux now it's good and it
looks like this for a lot of people who
work with graph KL these days so what is
graph QL graph QL is a lot of things
actually it's a it's a whole framework
but mostly it's a data querying language
that is based on Jason
it is server-side technology so if you
want to make use of graph QL you need to
have a server that supports it but
there's support for all the big
server-side technologies Java Ruby PHP
even note so if you name it
Facebook invented it because it had a
lot of problems where them calls using
react on mobile devices and react native
so it was looking for a solution where
it has has to make the minimum number of
calls and get exactly the data out at
once so not more data and then trim it
down in the client because that's
inefficient and this is can you guys
read this because this is what the
syntax of graph QL looks like it's
basically JSON and when you make a
request you basically give a JSON object
with an ID and the parameters that you
want and the response is the same object
including the values so it's very simple
and for every JavaScript developer
really familiar advantages of Grasse PL
are that you only need a single
endpoints so everybody who has had the
experience where you have a front-end
team at the back-end team working
together and the front-end team meets a
new set of data and the backing team has
to write an API this whole thing would
be cut out in this scenario so you can
basically query all the data that you
need from the server in the in the
client which is really great to feel
front-end developer you can specify
exactly what data you want so you can do
inside the client you can say I only
want this set of properties you can do
pagination much easier and you never
have that situation where you get way
too much data from the server and then
you have to filter it or something like
that
you always get exactly what you want
colocation of queries and the view code
is something that is useful um if you
manage the data so I have an example
here I'm not again I hope you can read
this so it's basically you use
in the lower section there's a bit of
JSX there so you basically write out the
username and in the top section you
request a username so if you would need
any other property from the user you
would just add another property and
request it and it's that easy so I think
that's a pretty good thing that's it's
for graph QL then relay is what I
mentioned earlier is on that framework
that Facebook originally sought out to
be used for graph QL and it's a whole
it's a data fetching framework it does
more than just request the graphical
data for you it also caches it for you
and it is inspired by flux so when relay
was created there were so flux
implementations that have multiple
stores and all those problems and so
people thought why don't we make a
solution where we have one single store
kind of like we'd exist now but just for
server-side data uses container patterns
so whenever you want to hook up a react
component with data you basically create
a real a container and tell the
container what kind of data it wants and
then put all the components inside
umm.yeah components re-rendered when
data changes I think a lot of people are
used to it from flux anyways and that's
a bit of a caveat and it's only for
server data so it's not like a flux
store where you can't just put anything
inside and manipulate it whenever you
want to it it is um those declarative
queries that you use to query the server
it's the same way you query the real a
store they really so will decide for
itself if it needs to query this over or
if it gives you a cached version and it
works mostly with react so
whereas some relaxes independent from
frameworks at least in theory relay has
mostly been used with react and there
are some projects that try to use it
elsewhere but I don't think they have
gotten very far from what I've been
seeing then what is Redux and does
anybody here use we looks and
professionally that's still quite a good
number yeah so it's good I think a
lovely looks and glad spreading so
basically an implementation of flux but
it just uses one store it basically uses
reducers to take all the stores that you
used to have in the flux pattern and
reduce them into into parts of one store
object makes it really nice to see what
state your application is in at the
moment it had it it's encouraged to use
a container presentation components
pattern where you have some components
that basically look nice and do the
things you want and container components
that are linked to data yeah it has
great react integration of course but
you can use Redux in angular 2 for
example and another JavaScript
frameworks and this is a graphic how
redux typically works where you have two
Redux tour and then you have the view
component and it dispatches an action
and then it goes to the reducer and then
back into the store and the store
re-renders the component so pretty much
like flux anyways and this is how it
would look like if you used graph QL
with redux
so you would use an a synchronous
library one like chris mentioned earlier
I'm using redux thunk at the moment and
all you do is you start the
a synchronous call but to a graph QL
endpoint and you send your graphical
query and then the response it comes
back you reduce it and put it in a redux
door and um we render your components
and caveats that there are some of
course as I mentioned earlier like relay
is more than just a data fetching
framework is a cache so you're missing
out on the caching that relay this relay
has some really cool features for
example if you want to do pagination it
does that out of the box if you don't
use it you're missing out on that too
relays has really good react integration
but I mention it earlier there are
projects like cache a for example which
is sense a client-side graph QL cache
which does a lot of the things that
relay does I don't think it's a as
advanced yet but I'm sure it will get
there as I think the community is moving
to use redux instead of relay that's it
thank you very much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
