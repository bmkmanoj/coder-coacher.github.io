drilling yet real-time feedback that's
one yeah so thank you for coming this
talk on tools tips and techniques for
real time developing realtor maps with
the focus really on like the development
process but also like the choices you
make in terms of the software and
technology you use in your apps my name
is phil liggett ah i work at pusher
prior to work in a pusher I worked at
company called coupling system kaplan
systems there's two gentlemen down here
i represent them so please hustle them
afterwards and I've learned a lot from
around building real time out to the
techniques and so on from working there
it's not the nicest looking up this one
there are nicer skins but quite complex
quite a complex you I powered by SDKs
integration with real-time data sources
and you know obviously lots of real-time
data I now a company called pusher we're
a hosted real-time service that helps
you integrate real-time data and
functionality into web mobile and IOT
apps using any technology technology
almost comfortable in basically
real-time infrastructure so Oh who's
heard of pusher by the way I've
interests okay pretty good pretty good
you've all heard of pushing our so you
should have always happens it's a test
so I want to cover why real time laughs
every time I say real time now is just
gonna be difficult and i also want to
cover those tool tips and techniques I'm
going to work my way through through
like your real-time stack from sources
of data throughout servers and real-time
servers which might be the same thing
and then your client application with a
bit of a breakdown in terms of thinking
about networks and the libraries that
you're doing probably associated with
your real time server I'm not going to
touch on application logic a little bit
I'm not going to talk about you I if
you're interested in your why
performance then you should probably be
in the angular track um that's good
noise leading great so why real-time who
knows what a notification looks like in
a nap or what you meant to do with it
come on everybody so we've all seen
notifications it's an indication that
something related to some data that you
are interested in has happened and you
know any person now we'll see something
like this bar and go okay well I click
on that and I get the additional data
that's been delivered to the brow
activity streams are you know like the
lifeblood of social networks and
actually really driven real-time
technology forward in terms of
demonstrating a great use case so the
idea is you can see a history of data
history of things that have gone on and
anytime that new data is available it's
pushed into the view at the top of the
stream and again most people who use
Twitter Facebook Google+ even news sites
now and sports sites have this idea of a
real-time feed of data that's going on
as human beings we like to consume data
in visual form I guess most of us prefer
a visual form so it makes sense that if
you add a real-time element to those
those visualizations it helps you
identify trends see things that are
happening and ultimately act upon
changes or things that are happening so
visualizing these real-time changes in
data who uses some sort of chat
application okay everybody right so we
all know the value of communicating
instantly communicating with colleagues
with friends with family mary meeker who
works with kleiner perkins did an
internet trends report study she does
every year and she identified that six
of the top 10 most used applications are
indeed messaging applications so they're
massively popular they're ultimately
chat and they're powered by real-time
technologies I wanted to highlight uber
as a great use case and they've
obviously revolutionized the taxi
industry to a certain extent whether
positive or negative depends on whether
you're a taxi driver or whether you're a
user of the service but part of that
experience is the application that
provides you with real-time feedback and
where that taxi is coming towards you
you can be sitting the taxi and making
sure you're going in the right direction
so it's it's a user experience that
we're all seeing the benefit from who's
used customers like Google Docs okay so
the idea there is that you're saving a
lot time instead of editing a word
document checking him to SharePoint have
bed checking it out again editing it
checking it back in again instead we
write a draft we share it with with
everybody and we collaborate on it in
real time this is actually at impaired
which is a plug-in for github zatim
editor that Jamie patella push a rope to
let you collaborate in real time
code with other developers any time we
create technology we build games with it
it makes sense that we build games out
using real-time technologies multiplayer
games this is seb lee on twitter i don't
know how to say surname sorry but I was
recently at something they'll simply
live and he talked about creating a
real-time multiplayer lunar lander game
and then he kept the trails in to create
real-time art which is pretty cool IOT
there's obviously lots of stuff on IT
sometimes it's great sometimes it's not
so bad this is actually pretty
impressive really the robot but I don't
know about the falling over but
obviously it's about real-time
communication between devices and the
technology provides is a fundamental
part of that so with the exception of
the falling of a robot most of these
examples provide some sort of real-time
user experience that benefits the user
so whether it's something like Facebook
becoming becoming more social because of
real time or it's a better customer
service experience with real-time
functionality and something like user
voice or the collaborative element of
Google Docs or the the real-time
feedback nature and experience of uber
that is getting to the point that that
my mom isn't obviously saying where's
the real time you X but she's if she's
seen the better better experience in
another application and it's not present
in the current application she's using
she thinks the applications broken so
without a real time user experience it
can feel like your application is
missing something that maybe it's broken
so that's why real time I want to get
into these tools tips and tricks and
you've already seen this are broken down
an application into these kind of four
components or system elements whereas
the data sources might be kind of api's
databases web point interactions that
will ultimately hit your your app server
through to your actual application
server doing some of the work and then
your the apps that you're building there
from the examples that you've seen I'm
my development experience I focus on
browser but I think a lot of these
techniques will be applicable no matter
what the client type is the or your
building um who here thinks they have
real-time data in the app so who thinks
they don't have real time
okay everybody has real-time data in
your apps I hope it could be wrong I
don't think so any kind of incoming data
into your app the point at which that
date is arriving the data payload the
event there's there's a real-time data
associated that if data change was it
changes within an application that
change event is also a real-time event
with associated data the data that was
there the later it is there now and the
change any interaction between a system
whether it's a database interaction
whether it's a web endpoint interaction
whether it's a interaction with the
queue all of those things are events
with associated data obviously user
interactions if you're building an app
with the user you have the user you have
the interaction and making and you have
the data they've entered or how they're
manipulating the app to do what they
want with it all of those are real-time
events with the real-time data is
anybody not convinced have you got real
time date on your app I haven't gone out
well that's that's going to be tricky
yeah okay it's a fair point so where do
we find this real-time data obviously
that your data sources as i mentioned
like databases Hughes third party
services your app server the interesting
thing about the app server is that
obvious things interact with it it
they're not actually creating the data
themselves so there's maybe real-time
data in the app itself but they're
normally from like the external things
it's open for debate hence the question
mark the server's themselves now
obviously they have lots of data being
fed into them but also they might offer
specific types of functionality like you
know connections user presence or maybe
chat specific features with events in
real-time data and obviously your client
application whether it's a signal from a
device turning on and off or you know
humidity or or whether it's a user
interacting with the app so there's real
term data so I'm going to make my way
through from data sources through to
client applications but the first tip is
as it's the second tip tip number 3 i'm
going through these fast in every
decision that you make throughout your
system you need to think about where
you're ultimately delivering that data
to so the client application what it is
what is it you're building and how will
that affect that client what
I user experience will they deliver what
performance considerations have those
clients got so when the data reaches
them what do they need to do so always
think about the decisions you're making
anywhere in your application
architecture how it's going to affect
that client so looking at data sources
as i mentioned api services queues and
so on and there are lots of api's now
that offer real-time endpoints of some
sort you might interact with them
through through a library in which case
you'll probably have code callbacks or
like it's kind of abstracted away from
you if you're accessing or an
interacting with these services in kind
of more raw form you're going to have a
maybe a web hook call back so an HTTP
request normally in post form being made
from the source the service to your
application server with a payload
obviously HTTP streaming so you make a
request you hold that connection open
and you consume data over that open
connection or web socket so web socket
has been built with clinic client server
browser in mind but there are plenty of
real-time API endpoints that are
offering WebSocket that can be consumed
by any technology that can basically
make a WebSocket connection so one of
the problems with this is that when you
starting to build an app and consume
data from these third-party sources or
from any source you end up with things
like this where you like I'm connecting
to the Twitter streaming service right
now and I'm waiting and I'm waiting
their weight and ultimately I want to
get some tweets in so I can start
building some stuff but I give up and I
start again conversely you can have
something like this where again I've
gone well I've changed the keywords I'm
searching for I've suggested I'm going
to go for a few more popular keywords
and I end up with this which is
similarly difficult to develop against
because you've got all this data
screaming and you're kind of going well
so ultimately it's quite difficult
because you can't control when you get
the data or the exactly the format of
the data you know if you built anything
against the Twitter API before you've
probably gone to your Twitter
application and sent a tweet to make
sure you get it but that's not a
particularly efficient way of building
these sort of apps so the solution is
generally capture and replay or you know
build some fake sources of data for you
to build upon so
it would seem that the nice solution to
this would be just sick of proxy in
between the data source and your your
app capture that data and use that proxy
to replay maybe checking some stuff in
system logs webhook tools there are a
whole bunch of web web book tools whose
use the web hook API before consumed a
web hook okay a few people who's tried
out and rock a more review than the
consumed web book tosser so it can be
used obviously for dealing with HTTP
requests as well so I would definitely
say a tip is to use thank rockets great
here's a little video it's a tool that
you install where's my cursor can I
start so here I'm kicking off my web
application I'm going to go to it
locally just to prove its there localize
5000 and then going to start n dropped
and i'm going to say subdomain pusher
and then i say 5000 i did is too quick
and what though does is open opens a
tunnel between my machine and the
internet so that you can access via a
public URL so it's push you to anger
calm so i can go to push your anger calm
and I see my local server and also angry
it provides this really cool dashboard
that you're running the anger it to
locally so you can go to the dashboard
and you can see what's coming in through
this this proxy ultimately so in here
I've got a web hook call back from from
pusher in this case it's like if
somebody subscribes to a channel make a
weapon call to this end point and I'm
saying pusher calm sorry push you to
anger calm / web hook and I go to this
page here just to fire that the web hook
you can see these false things being
logged that's the web hooks coming in if
i refresh and grow up for some reason I
see these post requests coming in as
well I'm going to fix my code so I'm
actually return in two hundred response
and restart the server and we'll see
actually the the web hooks have been
cued by pusher because they were failing
so it's been is coming in again and I
can also click on the replay button and
replay it locally so we're doing this
capture and replay stuff which is really
useful for dealing with these incoming
web hooks um for web socket and HTTP
streaming
you again you could look at a proxy but
I've got to be honest I couldn't find
anything that was really doing that
capture and replay functionality that
was looking for most I mean does anybody
know of one something that's all sit as
a WebSocket proxy and being able to
manipulate the data so i also found Gul
which is pretty good it does offer HTTP
capturing and replaying but it doesn't
offer WebSocket support and I don't know
about streaming so the solution is log
all the things ultimately so if you're
if you're capturing this data as you're
you know starting your development
process took things into a log and from
there you can simply monitor you know
what's going on you can filter them you
can build little tools around lot of
things that just replay from sonality
I've done a bunch of work with opta and
also stats calm around real time sports
and that's exactly what you have to do
that they will in fact provide you with
a set of XML documents and you have to
build tools around that to start
building outs on top of it I looked at
some logging tools so what logging tools
exist that might offer this reading and
replaying functionality and a bit like
this video everything seems very shiny
and enterprise-e but it doesn't seem to
be this nice little logging tool that I
can parse a log and replay data through
I even asked at work and it was you know
logged standing out which is nice
because you can see what's happening
within your apps use the standard log
format so log log format is actually a
standard that Heroku use and then grep
said no I don't know I don't think
that's fitted Lee it's in a valid but I
think we need better tooling around this
and this is maybe something that we
might look at doing so we can capture
the day that's coming in a cap to the
day that's coming out and help replay
that source stuff so how does the client
fit into all of this so we're consuming
all this data from us our server is
consuming all this data so the tip that
I would say from this is that you're
getting all this data and there's a
tendency at the moment to chuck stuff to
the client and make the client do a lot
of work you know the browser's are
pretty amazing now of mobile devices are
pretty amazing but there's still not as
powerful as our service so take the
opportunity when you're consuming that
data on your server to do the work on it
now I speak to you in
Kaplan yesterday about listening well
it's not necessarily rightful is it
because if you think about it sometimes
if the data is highly time sensitive
than doing any processing will delay the
delivery of that data to the client so
there are always caveats to this sort of
thing but generally do the data
processing and decision making on the
server so the application servers
themselves things like querying
obviously you might want to be checking
it into a database and updating a query
doing some transformations you know
taking it in it from the lovely XML
format through to the JSON format that
you probably want and also things like
data formatting so it could be that if
you're going to be you know time is a
good example you get a big time string
and then you send that through the
client the client has to check it into a
date object in JavaScript and then part
it out into a nice format that's
additional work you're asking the client
to do now that's probably an extreme
example and if you're fine tuning to
that extent it's maybe a bit over the
top but there might be situations where
you could do a little bit more
formatting on the server even send HTML
that could be directly rendered in some
situations heaven forbid but they're
obviously again caveat said that because
if you do that then you can't lend stick
a mobile device you consume the same
feed of data so this is a tweet
so there's a lot of data in a tweet now
right so if ultimately I'm just building
an app that's to show who sent the tweet
the time and the tweet content then I
don't really want to be sending all that
I just want to be sending that data so
that's a really simple example of you
know improving the efficiency of an
application by only sending what's
required another nice example is that if
you maintain the state of data so say
it's a football score you've got
liverpool vs arsenal and it's nil nil
and then an event takes place and
liverpool score you just put the full
one as a kid it'll be john barnes many
ones that old job on scores so the data
that's changed is really just home team
score in the event time so you only
really want to be sending that data
through and not the whole all the data
so and you get more benefit from that
the larger the initial payload so I main
set upon initial connection send up all
the data from that point on just send
those those changes so this was me
building a UI and consuming the
real-time feed that I you saw streaming
past earlier and this is kind of a
non-existent UX you know you try and
build a real-time Twitter like viewer
and you can't even really see the images
don't get a chance to load there's no
way I can read it so this is basically
pointless so if I'm consuming all this
data and I'm sending data too quickly
for the use case I'm trying to build
then it's just a waste of time so you've
got to control that update frequency
based on the experience you're trying to
deliver I've obviously googled this and
just found it online so 100 milliseconds
for a human being to feel that something
is instantaneous now at games i guess
it's 600 frames per second I don't know
how that translates but you need to kind
of think about the this experience that
you're delivering 250 milliseconds if
there's any kind of reaction to be made
so obviously with Twitter you're not
trying to click on real quickly but if
you're trying to build something that
requires some sort reaction the human
being has to have at least 250
milliseconds to respond to that
and each of these updates requires some
parsing so you could see as a pretty
janky for an end that it was really
slowing down the experience was terrible
so data has happened to be parsed HTML
templates rendered and the UI update it
was pretty rubbish so you can also
consider batching so if you're getting
all these updates and you can stick them
all in one message payload rather than
sending them individually that can also
be an efficiency improving so we're
moving on from the server through to the
real time frame work in the same way
that we want to know what's coming from
the data sources and keep track of that
being able to build tools around it we
need to make sure we know how we're
processing the data we also need to kind
of know what's going on within our
real-time framework to be able to make
sure the data is going in as we expect
and that is going out as we expect and
also the internal functionality is
working you know are those events about
connections occurring so that we can
make sure we can build functionality
around connectivity so these frameworks
need to be able to expose things like
connections subscriptions people
requesting data people unsubscribing
from data and the actual messages that
are going in and out that you're sending
this idea of presents users coming
online going offline all right and any
features that they provide that all
needs to be logged now I appreciate
Logging's pretty dull but it is a
fundamental requirement you know to the
development process if you can really if
you really want to be able to develop
these things efficiently so again log
all the things build tools around that
now we have pushed sure we're obviously
a hosted service so we have built a tool
that lets you see the data especially
with the toasted service when you're
you're going to throw in data at an HTTP
endpoint and you're hoping it's getting
there like what's happening so we expose
this tool that lets you see what is
actually happening in pusher so this is
a nap and this is actually consuming the
Twitter streaming example that I had
previously so I've actually refresh the
page somewhere and I've got a
disconnection this tweet channel has
been vacated so there's no subscription
to it now the connection as the page is
loaded again has come in I then
subscribe to the Twitter channel and
then it's occupied which means there's
at least one subscriber so then I go and
i'll start my Twitter streaming source
which isn't a great it's called naughty
or nice because it was like a tracking
t in Nice keywords for Christmas so
while ago and then I'm going to
basically break my debugger because I'm
thrown in all this data the idea here is
I can actually inspect some messages I'm
clicking and clicking and clicking and
then I pause I'm clicking and clicking
and clicking again and eventually I can
open up a message down here they've
obviously stream by and somehow I've
also clicked on one of these circles
which is like replay I don't know how
I've done I've done that like the UI was
basically broken because there was so
much data going in there and then I can
resume it so i think these tools are
really valuable specific not for like
what's going on the application right
now in live production but certainly
during the development process so build
tools that i can capture and replay this
functionality will really help the
development workflow there was something
called socket i/o you I that somebody
built this sort of thing but it hasn't
been updated for a year so I'd really
like to see more tools around that
whether it's you know soccer I ofay
signal are whatever the real-time
framework is I think as part of the
development process these things are
really valuable it's not visible so we
need tools so what about the
connectivity and I'm going to fly
through this so I'm not expecting anyone
to kind of take a lot from these I'm
just trying to make a point so we've got
a connection from our real time server
to our client and we need to make sure
that we're choosing the most appropriate
transport type for that client whether
it's a you know something running on a
Raspberry Pi whether it's a laptop or
whether it's a you know a plug or
whether it's anything that could be
connected to the Internet connected to a
real time frame works you need to make
sure you're choosing that base layer of
connectivity appropriate for the network
appropriate for the client you then need
to choose a protocol so you know which
of the protocols meet your needs some of
them offer pub/sub functionality some of
them are like massive XML chunks XMPP
there are loads of protocols to choose
from you then need to pick and what I'm
calling a communication pattern I don't
know whether that's necessarily the
right way but there's an idea of just
sending a simple blob of data simple
messaging there's pub/sub so you
subscribe to a channel and you get the
data on that channel there's a vented
pub/sub where you subscribe to a channel
and you bind to events on that channel
so it can be i subscribe to activity and
then i bind to the
new activity activity updated activity
deleted there's rmi so if you want to
make requests over the wire and let the
framework handle the fact that you call
the function on in JavaScript on the
client and it will transfer basically
work out which function you're trying to
call on the server and vice versa and
there's data sync so if you think about
Google Docs as a collaborative document
with an underlying data structure there
are frameworks that deal with you
manipulate that data structuring code
and the framework deals with
synchronizing those changes you need to
work out which one of those kind of fits
to what you're trying to build and I've
got this diagram based communication
complexity so how how complex is your
business logic the communications over
the wire or data complexity which use
case fits best with those different
communication types so there's lots to
go into so you all tomorrow is a bit of
a cheeky thing but just look at the
function line you're trying to build in
your application and pick the framework
that offers that now it's an obvious
statement and think about the client
that you're trying to build and make
sure that framework offers the right
type of connectivity the right type of
functionality it's got a native mobile
API sorry SDK and so on and watch my
videos so 2013 I spoke specifically
about choosing a real-time framework
because there's obviously a lot of stuff
to consider there and but it's
definitely something you need to think
about like don't plump for soccer oh
just because you've seen a stack
overflow answer that says I'm a PHP
developer I want to build some real time
stuff use Sakai oh because that's not
the answer the answer is to make it an
informed decision as a real-time
framework you're going to use this is
definitely true soon you might be able
to go to the bathroom without SSL the
point here is that to use a whole bunch
of new features you need to use SSL to
be secure you need to use SSL to connect
over mobile networks especially with
persistent connections you need to use
SSL so you'd like there's a whole bunch
of features that come to browsers that
you won't be able to you or some
existing ones like service worker HTTP
to you have to use SSL so use SSL in
development as well as in production and
then also your development environment
mirrors your production environment so
moving through decline applications I
broken the client application down into
kind of like a network layer generally
handled by the runtime so the device
itself or that all the browser and then
the librarian service the librarian
service will be associated with that
real-time server so that's the kind of
layer that I'm talking about just now
and the great thing is because we've
always thought about all these things
previously we've done things like making
sure that the server's doing the
majority of the processing the payloads
are small and focused formatting if
required is it handled for you we're
controlling that update frequency then
we've done a lot of the work and we can
kind of almost focus on building our
real time for an end and but you still
need to monitor the performance of that
client and then provide feedback to the
user to let them know if things are
working or things I'm working so things
like latency when you publish messages
put a time stamp on them upon receipt of
those messages have a look at have a
look at the time stamp on your local
machine consider things like timezone
differences and system clocked on the
server versus the one on the client and
but you can work out this latency and if
it gets really high you can provide
feedback to the user to say right well
the data you've got right now isn't as
up to date as you probably think it is
there's a bit the data is stale
something really interesting that Kaplan
specifically solved a while ago was that
you've got a lot of data streaming in
over the network and then as as the data
flows through your your application
logic as soon as you introduce things
like set timeouts and request animation
frames it potentially gives the network
again a chance to kick in and you start
getting more data over the wire and you
can end up with a message queue of
unprocessed messages so you're showing a
certain value or a piece of information
but there's there's messages further
down the line in some sort of message
queue that say actually this date is
wrong so we're Kaplan we had a point at
which the you I was showing a certain
trade value and you'd they click on it
but the actual underlying view model
would have a different value in it
because there was this lag this catch up
so speak to you and who actually solved
the problem with
a low be called ffs that what you called
it ok but he can tell you how he did it
it is genuinely interesting I've got a
little jazz bin that kind of shows this
if anybody wants to say afterwards so
the thing is if you can monitor that
that cue work out how the clients
performing you can start to make
intelligent decisions about you can
inform the user you can even inform the
server to say hey I've got all this data
and I can't even process it right now
can you stop sending me updates every
500 milliseconds send it every second
send it every five seconds or if or it's
getting really bad you can simply reset
and just say stop just now let me catch
up and then start sending me data again
so this is the bit where you've got your
library now interacting with your
application so we've done again we've
done we've got a lot of stuff to get to
this point we've talked about like data
sources control in your data the data
considerations processing payloads and
so on the connectivity online offline
because obviously you need to feed that
back to some sort of you I to tell the
user hey you're offline right now how
your online or the performance
monitoring stuff to say the day is stale
it's out of date and the tricky thing is
ultimately you're probably just trying
to build that real-time feature that
notification activity stream that chat
that collaborative experience but you've
had to set up all this stuff before you
can even start building ultimately the
thing that the user gets to use and that
will add some sort of business value so
can I ask who's in Ben's talk yesterday
ok a bunch of people a bit more
interested in this huh this is dry tips
tips so as well as waving his hands
around and wearing the same t-shirt as
me he had you know some really cool
visualizations but obviously to build
that he doesn't invite 100 people around
his house and say hey could you go to
this URL and let me test out this slides
oh I've got a bug could just hang on a
minute what he has to do he has to find
a way of simulating this kind of
experience and building this application
which is ultimately an application in
slides out so how does he go about doing
that now I don't know specifically how
it goes about doing that but we've had a
few chats
a great way to do it is to have a
service or library abstraction layer
that you can control and basically mock
out and you write your own JavaScript
layer that pretends to be that real-time
data feed and in that sense you can
control the data that's coming out of it
you can trigger fake connectivity events
so who uses angular guess nobody kisses
otherwise you'd be next door right I get
a few people so it's got it so embrun
angular both got the services layer in
this example I've got on my module I'm
saying well if somebody wants the the
pusher service they get returned to push
your instance the nice thing about that
is that in the development process I can
just comment out that that thing that
returns a real push or instance and
instead return fake instance and the
implementation I control it might offer
additional things that I can call to
create fake data so for this I create a
little example just to prove it wasn't
nonsense so I can I'm going to run
mirror my screen not going to mirror my
screen
so if I kick off my amazing tweet
streamer so I'm getting my you know
non-existent UX all these things flying
in again it would be really difficult to
imagine i set a debugger like some sort
of break point and then i go platinum
sudden it's hit again because the date
is streaming in far too fast for me to
really do any development so if i kill
that and instead i go to this is my like
it's a workbench which is the name that
we had for I thing called blade on a
jest you would build a component in
isolation and have these services that
you could mock out so I've just taken
the idea I've got my pusher JavaScript
library I've got a Twitter viewer
component and this is a web component of
web components so they are the future of
the web so view interesting that come
speak to me so this is just the Twitter
viewer and up here I've got a test stub
which basically overrides the the pusher
JavaScript API and add some additional
functions and I've also imported another
component which is a viewer helper I've
called it so if I save that and I go
back here and I reload this frame what
this does is gives me this little
component off to the left but as far as
the main component itself is concerned
it still thinks its interests
interacting with the push your API so it
lets me send through you know fake data
like that and I can obviously control
the stuff that comes in
stuff like that which is obviously very
realistic and but the nice thing as well
is because I know the API know the
events that are triggered from the
pusher library from my service I can
also do things like have a little check
box which triggers the connection event
which lets me build the functionality
that ultimately I want to build and I'm
not having to turn off my Wi-Fi to
simulate that connectivity problem so
these service this services layer is
genuinely really valuable especially
when it comes to orange n in general in
development but certainly for real-time
data and the great thing about this as
well if you got the services layer you
know you could have chosen to use socket
i/o is your real time service to start
off with and then you need to scale to
millions of concurrent connections or
even hundreds of thousands and you can
drop in pusher without making too many
changes or if you decided that you know
the functionality you needed was really
signal our RM I style functionality you
can swap out that underlying
implementation without breaking the
public API that your service exposes so
we're now into that um logic UI layer
and I'm not as I said I'm not going to
go into that because there are loads of
great resources on it specifically for
browsers obviously Paul Irish Jerry
twist pull luis por luis right yeah
insane is it and then all browsers now
you know they've all got amazing
developer tools even Microsoft edge
don't speak to martin actual demo that's
here and also really a Gregory for the
networking layer like the stuff that
Google are doing around this is
genuinely amazing so definitely worth
worth following those guys and seen some
of these resources for other types of
clients I'd like to be honestly I don't
do a lot of my native mobile dev I don't
do a lot of IOT dev but I'm sure there
will be tools that will help you you
know make sure that you're building the
most performant client possible so
that's 14 tips that are kind of broken
down into like techniques or tools or or
so on and that the whole point in this
is is that the value you're trying to
add is that real time user experience
and to get there can be a pain so if
hopefully those those ideas will be
really useful in helping the development
workflow and also making sure that
you're you know the components you've
chosen within your application are
you're making those decisions ahead of
time you
following decent practice that means you
really can focus on that app logic and
the UI layer layer which is ultimately
the thing that you're delivering to your
users and that's what you're trying to
build you're trying to build that
real-time user experience so that is it
I think I've got quite a bit of time
left for questions I think</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
