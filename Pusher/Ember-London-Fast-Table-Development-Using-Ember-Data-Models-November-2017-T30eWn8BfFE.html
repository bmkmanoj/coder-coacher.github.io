for IG with Luke and a couple of other
guys here it was actually meant to be
like a lightning talk so I didn't
prepare any slides so just this one yeah
so straight to the topic what's the
problem imagine you have a world of
applications where well every app
consists of some kind of a table it
could be based on the same underlying
data but just have some columns messed
around or anything just some pictures on
it some different components or
something else is based on the data so
how would you approach it like normally
without any additional help so I've got
some amber up here set up for the talk
so we would start up with some amber
data model so can you see it okay about
now weather okay so just start with some
simple amber data model and just add
some add some routing chill today to
your review and then for for your
template you would just end up with
something like this it's creating a
table with some HTML and that would work
you can get a nice table you could do
some different stuff with it you can add
some components here and there based on
the data it would work just fine but
then imagine and you were to create a
table that looks exactly like this one
but on the other page and you would have
to maintain to two sets of this this
code basically well obviously you could
create a component and just feed the
data into it but then that creates in
other issues like maintaining your
table headings and so on so that's quite
a burden so what we decided is to make a
use of member data and first of all
create a component so I'm using models
table I don't know if you ever used
member models table quite useful
component it gives you lots of stuff for
free
so yeah that's the table it's working
pretty good and the issue around using
this model stables component basically
was that you basically had to set up
some predefined predefined the columns
for your table basically so we had to
copy this set of config every time we
wanted to use a table so we wanted to
have those information saved in one
place where we would have to maintain
only one one copy of the headings
namings like sorting underlying data
model and so on so whenever we wanted to
use a table similar to this one
just throw in one one simple component
and you're good to go without managing
without managing stuff like different
headings so the solution we found was
just use ember data as a single source
source of true so basically you can add
on to your properties in number data an
extra object that's basically a metadata
and you can use this easily with your
tables but the problem was how would you
go about extracting extracting this data
from your model easily and use it
everywhere on your in your application
so we're using this pretty simple with
one one with one util here where we just
import the actual the actual model that
we want to use the table on so users for
example
then just use the function pass your
model and your table is generated just
like that and the magic behind it is all
on this one yeah there is simple
function we came up with just to extract
the metadata from oh yeah sir yeah that
should be better oh yeah so basically
just a simple function that takes your
model and gets the metadata that you've
passed the the object basically so you
can pick any key from your model we've
got table here so if we ask for a table
it's gonna return all the all the stuff
that's required for not required but
just everything that that's here but
that wasn't that wasn't everything that
we needed because that's really like a
generic generic function and all it does
is takes this takes this metadata from
your model then we created something
else that's that was supposed to work
that's working with the Umbra model
stable but it can work with any other
component we're passing a function to to
the util basically and we were just
doing some magic behind behind classes
and property names that the components
actually the component takes in so with
one function call on our controller just
like that we can have as many table as
you want just with basically two lines
and that's really helpful tool because
if you would like to create another
table so that's the first table and then
there's a better table with some some
component here that takes the data from
from the model we had and then just add
something on top of it and to solve that
it's pretty easy all you have to do is
get the columns and just add something
else on top of it and that was the amber
model stable way of just passing a
component it gets all the context from
your controller and stuff and you can do
some pretty cool things really fast so
just to get that icon there just three
lines of code basically and you've got
the table like that yeah so that's
pretty much it it was meant to be a
quick talk all right thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
