environment for web development I will
be talking about what text editor I'm
using and what terminal and what shall
I'm using because I experienced in many
in many talks after the meetups that
people are constantly discussing what
they are using and what would be good
and advantages and disadvantages of all
the text editors so I just quickly going
to show you my setup and afterwards we
can have a collective discussion but
what you are using and what's best so
I'm using Visual Studio code and I term
you can see here is Visual Studio code
and here is I term how many of you are
using Visual Studio code okay that's a
lot yeah so I I tried many many text
editors I tried at home Visual Studio
webstorm brackets and ultimately I ended
up with wishes to decode yes it was
really amazed when I was using Visual
Studio that there is a thing like
intelligence and for c-sharp development
you have to use basically Visual Studio
and so I tried with Studio code and I'm
happy ever since and I'm also going to
talk about I term the terminal I use
because the basic terminal is - I think
or it's called terminal something like
this however I will not spend much time
here because I'm not using it that that
often and also visual studio code comes
with a terminal on its own yes I think
that's it another important information
is that I'm using a Mac MacBook Pro and
yeah so the first thing I want to talk
about is wishes to decode and the
features are displayed here if you click
on the link here you should go to the
home page which is not this plate
doesn't matter we'll just copy it
or we'll even even yeah we even just
open it here and show you they should
work right now yeah so so as I'm working
on here I'm going for Visual Studio and
here are the main features displayed
first of all the has it has intelligence
which is practically just syntax
highlighting and also autocomplete I was
very amazed when called encountered this
feature it basically allows you to
suggest you the methods of objects or
functions whatever and I will afterward
show a short showcase on how to use it
and then it will be clearer and much
easier to understand
there's also debugging involved in
Visual Studio code you don't need to
debug in Chrome or whatever browser you
are using
you have also built in good comments and
it's ultimately easy to extend extend
but I think nowadays most of the editors
are easy to extend I also created or
even wrote an article about about the
Visual Studio code extensions I'm using
and this is actually the article it has
which pretty much good success I've just
listed all my extensions I'm using I'm
using extensions for HTML like auto
close tag rename tag HTML snippets
markdown extensions of course JavaScript
extensions this is very important
debugger for Chrome you can easily start
debugging without a lot of configuration
maybe I can show you that as well of
course he is lint linting checking your
code
yes in modules intelligence so if you if
you're interested just go to the article
and check out the extensions they are
pretty nice for developing yes that's
the article about extensions and the
next thing I want to show you is I term
is anyone using I term okay one awesome
then just a short and quick introduction
to our term just give you an overview
just typing in I term and it should be
the first one it's a terminal especially
for Mac OS and if I go to features you
can see what what you can do with with I
term you can split panes you have hot
key windows you can search for stuff you
can autocomplete yeah so different
features that makes the use of of a
terminal very easy and efficient I never
really used use the integrated terminal
of Mac OS started using item right away
because I was recommended to use it and
I was always happy yes
so that's the I turn part and if I go
through the presentation I'm also using
it with I think I will just put it in
here because that's too complicated
otherwise I also combined it with good
set shell is anyone else using to test
shell one nice I use it with the oh my
oh my Z or however it's called
it has some nice our teams and features
and also using the out of suggestions
which I'll show you in in practice as
well there's also a good article and it
will show the slides afterwards so you
can check that out as well since my
setup here is a little bit weird I will
go right away to the demonstration part
created a nice a nice slide here yes so
now I'm going to demonstrate how
using both visual studio code and the I
term just figuring out how to use it
properly here I think the best thing is
to just put it in there and looking on
top so maybe another nice feature is to
use spectacle is someone using that for
Mac OS it's just that you can switch
with your window probably here it comes
on default by yeah but Mac doesn't have
has have something like this
so spectacle on top the glasses is a
nice tool and that's for free and it's
working great so as you can see here I
can't really stand on the side you know
as you can see here is that's the
terminal I have use used a nice team
with coloring and showing the get status
and I'm currently at the developers
rising repository because I want to
demonstrate how to add stuff to the
homepage so what I can do next at first
or what I want to show you first with
all message and and the tech shell in
general is to show you the LRS allows ya
that comes out of the box and they are a
lot especially a lot with kid that's
very useful this can be very useful you
can see here and for example if I want
to do something I can get status which
is just just and it shows me my current
status of get so what's also very nice
and works well with which is to decode
it's not when I'm typing or maybe let's
have it like this if I'm tithing yeah
probably
so so if I'm typing code dot there is
I've installed it in the path
I can't just open visual studio code and
now it opens of course in my other
window but here it is and here are
having the terminal on my site so I can
always work with the terminal here on
this side and can work with the editor
on this side so what I wanted to
demonstrate now is just to see how
Visual Studio code works you have
options here to show you the folders and
files you have a search you have an own
section for your get stuff you have a
debugger mode and the extensions listed
and it's also very easy to install
install extensions you can just add them
here and here
activate them install them uninstall
them etc what's interesting is also
maybe was a little bit bigger here no
she better know you also have a console
here you have a debug console you have a
terminal depending on what shell you
have installed you can also use the
comments here you see just work working
fine and it's also if you have a linter
or something else installed it displays
all the problems and stuff that is not
working so what I did here is as you
know we have a home page for we are for
developers rising and I just added our
new partner that is we accelerate for
chests and search everything is working
easily we accelerate you can see it just
put in their dev here a div class this
section here and now it one of the
benefits with Visual Studio code is if
you can you can simply click on the tab
here just show me the working tree here
and show me the difference and its side
by side showing you what you have added
or changed and it's working perfectly on
this
on the side here you even have a mark
where the change in your file is so if
you're if you are having a large file
with thousand lines then this really
helps and in this case I quickly can see
okay I have here added a div so now what
I'm going to do is I use the terminal I
most of the time I'm using the
determinant terminal to use kid stuff
because it's just faster so once again I
use the check git status to check what
I've what I've done now say okay I'm
using also a Liars here and said okay I
using a cookie to commit with a message
and I say just add new partner partner
we accept the rate accelerate is this
correctly yeah
oh maybe with a double D you can also
use it like oh holy what's that
so now that it says are still something
missing okay I have logo so just get at
all very easy just and then I can ah
what I also want to show you is the
complete I just go in with that and it
shows me the last the last commit I did
with with a type of message like did
this so I use I just say add yeah a new
partners logo awesome
I don't want to do that remove so this
is not working what I'm doing now is
just pressing ctrl C to get out of this
whatever it was have no idea
so I'm trying it again still just out
completing it what
now it's working right no true true true
true awesome now it's working and now
instead of get push I set the upstream
already so just GP and now it pushes to
the master branch and that's pretty easy
we'll also want to show you is now this
one resolvers so it's it it's connected
and knows that there is there there are
no changes and what I want to do or show
you as well is to go to the Help section
and if you haven't worked with Visual
Studio code you can easily just download
it install it and then you can go to the
interactive playground that is what I
wanted to show you and here we actually
I think this is amazing and I haven't
seen this anywhere else it has an
interactive playground where you can try
to use the features so here is a
interactive playground you can see the
numbers here you can simply do some as
it is explained here you can combine
different keys and for example add
multiple cursors on 10y different stuff
awesome
but you can also maybe if I want to just
switch lines or cut multiple multiply
lines can also do that very easily I can
switch them around that's very easy I
also can do is I'm not quite sure if
I've installed this here just on the
line going down and adding I don't know
what is this here no idea maybe you can
add another comment hi
that's it awesome and I can also delete
it cool so that's a great feature and it
just goes through the stuff here what I
want to show you is actually the
intellisense
which is amazing here is a basic Express
example and what intellisense allows you
to do is if you type app now and then
dot
then it should suggest you things which
it doesn't I'm not
it does but this is not optimized
because that's the playground doesn't
matter it does what it should do it just
suggests you features and methods that's
not working really in the playground
maybe I'm using it yeah yeah I don't
think it's working like it should here
doesn't matter you can try it on your
own and it hopefully will work
the airline action of talking about that
refactoring so there is plenty of other
stuff on how to speed up your coding and
I think it's pretty good especially if
you're starting with the free card game
curriculum you have the box where you
write your code inside and at the
beginning it is okay but when you later
have to write longer code I think it's
more and more important to have a good
editor with syntax highlighting and also
suggestions and what I've used in the
curriculum when I was more advanced and
working from the advanced algorithms I
was always writing the stuff inside the
text editor like Adam or wishes to
decode and I think it's just easier to
work with it
test it and see if you're working the
algorithm the right way instead of using
the field on the homepage yeah I think
that's it I think those are the most
important things I just wanted to go
through since the setup is really weird
here for me I'm not going to demonstrate
more yes oh yeah I haven't introduction
or maybe I can close somewhere is the
presentation yes here's the background
credit for somewhere Taylor from
unsplash yeah just about me a little bit
core
organizing this meet up with Rob with
Robert and I'm a business law student
I'm working as a front-end developer
currently I'm focusing on machine
learning and also did if anyone is
interested in machine learning I also
did where is that or I even have even
wrote an article actually so find it it
would be nice yeah it's here
so if you if you are whoa if you're
trying to get into machine learning
there's a great course online
it's from Kucera because arawa is also
an online learning platform it has very
it has a lot of different courses I
think also in CSS and JavaScript and
stuff like that but I did the machine
learning course and I also wrote tips
and tricks on how to do it I think it
takes three months or something and it's
just amazing so I can also recommend to
check especially this course because the
teacher is amazing also the platform
Coursera
it's amazing yes this was my setup now
we can discuss your setups or if you
have any questions just feel free to ask
thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
