topics offline first craft database and
also in Kuwait first of all about myself
my name is Thomas coos I started with
developing axel Marcos in 2014 that was
my start let's say in 2017 in the
beginning I developed visual basic.net
and six months ago I started with
JavaScript and my first app I developed
is called sport bi and sport bi is a
website which offers a random workout
generator so if you go to the gym and
make exercises you get every day a
different workout so you really
challenge your body every day and you
have good progress and everything you
shock your body really and today I will
show you the questions I ran through
when I learned Jas with my yeah
playground which is the app sport VI the
first topic I will cover is offline
first my first question was is it
possible to create a completely offline
website and the simple answer is yes
it's possible and this side answer is
yes you need to connect to the website
at least one time of course to get the
data my second question was how can
decline and receive data and use the
data basically there are four ways
cookies local storage session storage
and index TP I decided for indexeddb and
my cert question was who can use index
TP here on the right corner you can see
that 94% there is 94% global coverage of
the browsers that can use index DB my
fourth question was how does index TP
look like in the browser so what you see
here is Chrome and you see the developer
tools on the right side
if you go to application you can see a
point which is called index TP and below
that you can see the databases here
there are 2 theta bases which are
Scimitar and training and by the way on
the left side you can see the apps for
pi which is showing a random workout for
that day table my next question was how
does indexdb look like again in chrome
application now I'm in the database
training and in the table exercise what
you see here are different exercises I
have opened one exercise it's showing
you an object with details about this
specific exercise my sixth question was
how can I talk to indexdb well there are
different libraries worth checking out
my choice was called exe my seventh
question was how can I make create read
update and delete to the database here
you can see for example how I can create
an entry in the 20 line I don't know if
you can see it very good it's the third
line I connect to the database the arrow
shows user which is basically the table
user in the index DB the second word is
put and then I put an object which is
the object you see here on the right
side so I've just created an entry to
index DB next was how can I make read
it's also very easy first of all you're
just connect to the database the
variable is called TP then table user
again to array and what I return is the
item the first array item 0 and I again
have the first item of this user table
regarding update and delete I will skip
that just for timely reasons but in a
break we can talk about it it's not a
problem my eighth question was how
complex can I make varies and for
example Dexy is quite powerful
do you have many ways to query the
database I have highlighted let's say
most important ones for me I think and
you can see yeah it's it's you can make
good good things powerful things my
ninth question was how to make the files
available offline so it's one thing to
have the data offline but it's another
thing to have the files offline like
HTML j/s and CSS that let's say a state
of the art technology is serviceworkers
but why didn't I choose it it's because
of the global coverage of about 74%
and you can see for example internet
explorer and edge is not supported and
yeah this is the reason why I didn't
choose it then how can I make the files
available offline in another way and I
chose manifest the library is called
goût manifest it's it's hard to read
here actually but I will explain it on
the left side I have a gulp task which
is basically where I define all the
folders the J's folders and CSS folders
I need to catch and what it creates
every time I make a build is that it
creates a file which is this app dot
manifest file which lists all the files
I want to cache in the next step I have
three files the first one here on top is
an iframe I can include it in every
website the source here where the arrow
starts the route is called slash
manifest which is basically this HTML
talk document manifest HS or manifest
HTML if it in the in the HTML tag there
is app dot manifest so if this HTML
document is loaded it runs into the
route app manifest which is then again
referring to the previously generated ed
manifest
here below the the below arrow is just
the manifest route the normal route okay
the 11th question is what is the result
the result is on the left side you can
see again chrome developer tools in
application if you go to clear storage
you can see on this chart this diagram
there is a blue area which is the
application cache which is which is
currently 4 megabyte and you can see the
index DB which is currently 1.4
megabytes
here you can also delete if needed and
yeah you have an applied offline
application that's that result and I can
also show you we can try it one time
wait a sec for example here I'm on
meetup.com
I have no connection at all you can see
it here if I go to meetup.com it's not
working because I have no connection if
I go to sport P I workout then it's
working and it's completely working
offline now and I can refresh my
exercises I can switch the date like
it's storing all my workouts I had in
the past and yeah this is offline first
then my second topic is Croft database
so while I was developing my sport bi
app I was also wondering how should I
store the data on the server well the
classic ways to use a relational
database where you have also relations
but you need to write the the fields
always two times in different tables
like the yellows are in two tables the
Koreans are in two tables
the Blues are in two tables I was
challenging the technologies out there
and the second one was craft other
pieces and I was wondering should I use
craft databases finally I took it and I
decided for the technology which is
called or the wind or
is called new Forte here on the right
side you can see also other vendors and
below here the links you can see how to
install it on Linux and Windows and in
general just to describe what is a craft
database well you normally have nodes
here you can see node user and you
normally have relationships and here in
this graph we have node user and the
relationship folders and these different
names which are old users are following
each other so this is a very simple
graph my second question for craft other
basis was how can I run it once it's
installed if you have installed it you
can run this link it's local Coast
localhost and the port slash browser
what you receive is a very nice
interface very powerful where you can
write your database query here in order
to test it and it returns you a graph
but also the text form so you can see
how it's yeah you can see the take very
life my third question was how to read
the data well I have here a simple
example from the sport bi app here you
can see a person this is the green one
and on the other side you can see an
exercise which is the career one and in
between is a relationship which is
called makes so in other words you can
say a person makes an exercise so this
is the simple interpretation of this
this craft what I want to show you is
that every element for example that
person here can have different
properties within this node you can see
it here below but also a relationship
like makes can have different properties
but also the exercise can have different
properties and you can vary all those
properties now let's make a query with
JavaScript but before I start let's do
it without JavaScript so a human would
say find the person that makes the
exercise which is called let's say
seated cable rows
a machine and translated into the neo4j
database would say match person makes
exercise square brackets and then the
exercise name and return the name of the
person what you can see here is in red
letters you can see P person R makes
exercise it's just you don't need it
really but it's good to have it because
you can reuse this variable P for
example in the second line I say return
P name but in order to return the name
of the person I need to in the first row
say that the person is P you know yeah
okay how can I make the query with
JavaScript I took the same query like
you have just seen it it's a variable
just called query and I passed this
string basically to a helper function
which I just reuse every time it's just
a query to the database so you set it up
one time and that's it and it's the same
if you also do it in this new Forte
interface and the result is P name and
this is what is returned then this is
these are the helper functions what I've
just talked that I passed the query and
it's it's thank varying the database on
the left side you can see the JavaScript
driver which comes from new 4j directly
so I would suggest to use it because it
opens the session and closes the session
but you can also do it via suppose it's
also possible but you should use what's
coming from your chat directly okay my
next point is is asking your wait when I
started to develop this JavaScript I ran
into the question do I really have to do
it like that it's like it was I couldn't
really understand that
no other way and my second question was
of course are there any alternatives and
yeah the alternative is using promises
and awesome Kuwait and in order to use
it you need to start your function
always with a sink as a prefix and then
you can use before you can use always a
wait and here I made a very extreme
example also from the workout generator
basically I'm calling a function with a
weight and the variables I passed to
that function are also having a weight
so yeah you can also nest to nest the
ABE rate functions yeah my third
question was how is it supported again
especially for the front-end and we have
global coverage of 90% especially
Internet Explorer makes problems again
and because the workout generator sport
VI is mainly used on mobiles it's a
topic because Mobile's are also not so
well supported by J's us in Kuwait so my
first question was then how can I reach
more compatibility for us in Kuwait eg
also for example us for Internet
Explorer and it's possible you can
compile it down to years to 15 for
example and yes I used Babel and also
here together ugly 5 with Internet
Explorer 8 and it allowed me or the
result is that you have no I'll sink
your weight in your code anymore you
cannot read it it's not readable but the
a secure weight is a way and the app is
still working and you have it
comfortable for all the process as well
which is very very important
that's it sinks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
