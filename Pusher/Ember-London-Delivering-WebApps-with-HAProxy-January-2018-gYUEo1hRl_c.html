proxy the history behind our
infrastructure changes of true var and
why we decided to use a cheap proxy what
are the pros of using a cheap proxy and
where are the cons of like using other
choices so a little bit about the
history of Java and what true VII is
truly is an ecommerce platform for
independent retailers our goal since we
started in 2013 was to always bring
truly unique products to the hands of
everyone across the world and and
Trouville was originally named Street
hub when we launched in 2013 our goal
was to prove that we can take the local
supply and fulfill local demand so
initially our tech stock was basically
an absolute minimum viable product it
was just gotta be hosting with static
HTML files so to kind of help you
visualize that this is how it all
started how it all looked in the
beginning so users would basically
request HTML static HTML files with
boutiques in their area so if I was
looking for a boutique in Shoreditch I
would go online I would find shortage
that HTML downloaded and I would find on
any boutique that I wanted to go to but
essentially after that in 2014 we
decided that we still want to meet the
the local demand with the local supply
but we wanted to enable customers to
place orders online and this is where we
kind of decided ok obviously you need
you need something are we going to go
down the path of server-side rendering
for like everything with just I don't
know PHP or whatever was popular at the
time we decided to use basically build
her own nodejs up which was going to be
hosted on no jitsu which closed down
hence the rest in progress with rip and
then we also decided that we're going to
host well store all of our products and
boutiques on elasticsearch and our
single page up was at the time hosted on
s3 and this is basically again just to
help you visualize it we just had our
single page up elasticsearch note no
jitsu api
so this is where kind of like small
problems started coming to play because
our front end was being served through
domain a and our elasticsearch and no
Jitsu were on domain B so what comes
with that course comes into play so with
I'm not sure if how many of you are
familiar with course but I imagine most
of you are but basically what course is
is basically a request mechanism in
which every time that you want to make
an API call from domain a to domain B or
even a subdomain a to subdomain be you
essentially have to say ok my server
only responds back to these client ups
so you first do your your pre-flight API
call which is an options request and the
server says yep you've got access and
then responds back with yes you have
access on the options request and then
you have to do another API call well the
client handles automatically but the
client does another API call which is
your actual API call so if you wanted to
get a boutique it would have to do the
options first and then the get boutique
to find the boutique and then finally
the server responds back with the actual
data so this was fine because if you
think about it we only had two back-end
services so configuring that configuring
that was like very easy it was also easy
on the client side as well so in in
early in early 2015 we decided that we
really want to focus on delivering great
products and the only way that we wanted
to do that and expand it globally not
just locally within the UK was to focus
on the quality of the curation and start
shipping internationally where rather
than just focusing on the local
liquidity so we what we decided to do is
we decided okay we're going to rebrand
Street hub and create this new brand
called Trueba and in order to meet all
of the all of the criteria that we
wanted to meet we basically decided
we're going to create four single page
apps one of them is true Vodacom which
is where you can buy products where you
cannot products your basket the other
one is
the checkout process which is we decided
to split out from the main app so we can
help the customers focus on the user
journey of checking checking out and
just remove any of the distractions of
the main site and then we also created
two other single page apps which is our
own internal CMS and the retailer CMS
which is what the retailer's use to
manage their inventory accepting new
orders or reject them if they don't have
them in stock we still kept our core API
which was built in in node.js but we
moved it over to Heroku since no jitsu
closed down and again similar to before
we still kept elasticsearch and for the
products and boutiques so this is this
is what it looked like at the time we
had our four single page apps we had one
JavaScript API and our elasticsearch
instance so that meant that adding four
new well adding three new single page
apps meant that we had to go back on our
on our back-end services and update the
course configuration to support all four
single page apps easy to do but then as
you start to think about it more and
more the more back-end services you add
the more front and services you add
there is more configuration piled on top
and on top on top so it just gets a bit
tedious to update in 2016 basically this
is our current state now since 2016 we
have built five new services which work
alongside the core API to deliver the
all of the content that the single page
apps need we kept all four single single
page apps and we also introduced algo
Leon to the mix for doing the searching
of products and boutiques so to
visualize that again we essentially have
I couldn't fit all of these services so
there's more services there but this
essentially meant that we had to again
for every see for every buckin service
we had to go back out the lovely course
configuration again and it became so
common for us to think about this thing
that we were actually thinking at a
point
to create an NPM library which has all
of the course configurations that we can
share it across all of the single page
jobs which sound to be something funny
but actually it was a common problem for
us and if you think about it also course
doesn't make sense in this in the sense
of basically you take almost twice the
time to actually execute an API call so
that's where we kind of sat down and
thought about things and we decided to
you start routing all of the all of the
API calls through one single routing
layer so we started using a cheap proxy
unless your proxy sits between the user
every single user basically that's using
our apps and then between and the other
side of the things are basically single
page apps and are all of our API is so
what is a cheap proxy and why we use it
a cheap proxies are fast and very
efficient load balancer and routing
layer so why we use a cheap proxy proxy
avoid helps us avoid course because we
can route everything through a single
domain so if you're on checkout you can
do the request on checkout and you can
still route to the same API service if
we're on our no Trouville come then we
use that domain to access our API calls
at the time we're also thinking like the
other way of doing things would be to
use sorry that's all these annoying so
the other way of we're thinking of doing
things is basically use a CDN like cloud
front so you can serve all of your
single page apps and also define rules
in cloud front where you can basically
route all of the all of the api's but we
decided we didn't want to go down the
path because that meant that we had to
do cache invalidation on index on the
index dot HTML and although that's very
reliable thing to do it also takes time
and sometimes you're not entirely sure
how much time is going to take on each
different edge note across the world so
I'll show you in a bit how a user ship
proxy to get around that problem but for
now keep that in mind
and the other reason why you decided why
we decided to use a cheap rocks is
because we have one single routing layer
so all of our requests go through one
single routing layer so it's easier for
us to debug things it's easier to go
back and look at the history because you
have one log and it's just everything's
a lot easier and also a chip rocks it
comes with a very interesting and
excellent statistics dashboard so there
is one statistics but dashboard that you
can go to and you can see how many
requests are failing per second how many
requests have passed how many requests
are going to every different service or
how many times you have served your your
single page up so just to talk a little
bit about how we actually do the
redirection you cannot before you
actually start implementing things you
need to start think about how you're
gonna basically this is where it
namespacing comes into play so if you
start namespacing things so if I want to
start accessing the list service I what
we decided to do is we can namespace
everything under slash API slash lists
and then for the inventory service it
slash API slash inventory is similar
with a cart and then for anything else
that doesn't match those rules we're
basically going to route everything to
the to our core API service so how does
how does the configuration actually look
like a chip proxy has three concepts
which are quite important they have the
concept of a front-end which is
essentially I mean it's it's essentially
one input so I think of the thing of the
front owners basically where the request
is coming from and then think of the
backend as where the request is going to
lead to so if you think of a routing
layer or just like any standard like
routing think of the input as being the
front-end and the output as being the
backend and you can actually name things
and you can have multiple different
front ends multiple different backends
so here for example we decided to name
our our this specific front-end we
decided to call it HTTP and it listens
on the port
forty forty and with then we can set up
a load balancer in front of it so it so
that we can have everything on port 80
and that allows us to have multiple
agent proxy instances behind one one
load balancer the third concert the
Daisy proxy has is the concept of a cos
a cos are access control lists and
basically the that is very similar to
saying Const something equals something
so it's just a variable and what you
actually basically how this works is you
say access control list is HTTP that's
the name of the variable this is my
condition so I want to say I want I want
you to look at the header X forwarded
proto
and I want you to check if it matches
that value so here we're checking if the
request that's coming in is on HTTP
request then we've got two more access
control lists one checks if the path
begins with slash API so if that if that
matches then basically is API will be
true so we want to route to the core API
if the path starts with slash API slash
carts then we need to route to the card
service and then then we use the use
backend directive which essentially
takes the first thing is the backend
that we want to redirect to and then our
condition so if this is not HTTP request
then I want you to use that back-end and
anything after that is not going to be
cold because we're we're going to be
used that we're going to be using up I
can't so for the HTTP redirect back-end
that's quite simple we basically do use
the redirect directive and we say
redirect scheme HTTP code 301 basically
means that I want you to change the
scheme of this request to HTTPS and I
want you to do a 301 redirect because we
always want to be using HTTPS if we want
to redirect to if one proxy the request
to to our core API a cheap proxy allows
you to have multiple different servers
so it will check that because it's a
load balancer you can
have like three different instances of
our core API and then it will know how
to distribute that load
equivalently so basically you say my
first server is has that name and that
name is going to be used in the
statistics dashboard I want you to route
to that IP on that port so 443 is are as
a support our HTTP port and I want you
to verify that this request has a
necessarily cuz we always want to make
sure that there is an SSL associate
associated to that request and I want
you to the check directive basically all
it does is it checks that these servers
up and running before doing the before
doing the routing so there we have two
servers and then they ship proxy
automatically knows hey I should load
balance this and then I should do 50/50
traffic so that's quite handy so I
talked a little bit about the about the
API proxying but what about like the
client routing because I mentioned
earlier that we also route basically all
of the index or HTML files so the way
that we do that is instead of looking at
the actual path we also look at the at
the domain domain or subdomain whatever
so if this is a www Sotomayor or just to
make a domain then I want you to route
to the travel.com website if this is a
check out retail or our internal CMS
then I want you to route to the
appropriate location and to show you an
example of that of how we how we serve
our Ember UPS is basically this is this
is the example again we've got a
front-end which is named HTTP n it's
listening on port 4040 and we first want
to check which not API which client is
this that should have said so we're
checking if that's the this is our
checkout so if the requests coming in
much is the secured approval comp so if
the host is if the beginning of the host
is secure the tribunal comb then assign
basically the result of that into the is
check out and then
use back and check out if it's check out
now obviously you wouldn't do this for
like for just one one single domain you
would do this for like multiple so like
we've got like our force equal pay jobs
so we we have more of these just to fit
everything on the slide I trimmed it
down so then our back end here is called
checkout and we want to we want to do
two things and we either want to serve
the robots or txt if there are trying to
access the robot so txt or we just want
to serve our our main main check-out up
so you can have multiple a ACLs inside
back-end so we're creating here on SEO
which checks if the path of the request
is going into the for the robots.txt if
that is true then what is going to do
here it's going to set the path of the
resulting request to our s3 buckets or
and then the specific path to access the
robots.txt and only do this if robots is
true and then the other way around is
basically if it's not any of those then
we need to serve our index dot HTML file
so similar to that we say set path to
the s3 buckets the path of the
index.html file unless robots so the
other way around off of if robots and
then s3 actually expects that the
requests coming in will have the header
off of host to be the s3 bucket so we
actually get around the problem by
setting the the ending request as as
basically we're marking the host to be
to be what what s3 is expecting so then
finally we say server the name of the
server is called checkout and we say the
the public s3 sub domain of faith WS so
basically what a chip rocks is going to
do is going to take the domain that
you've given there it's gonna update the
the host header to
to the Amazon AWS one and then it's also
going to set the path 20 of these two
depending on what you're trying to
access so basically as a summary why we
decided to use a cheap proxy is mainly
to shorten the request lifecycle because
it's very important as an e-commerce
business to have things really quick we
also wanted to avoid cache invalidation
by getting around basically cloud front
and just using just using a cheap proxy
to serve the index.html I mean
everything else all of the assets go
through cloud front so all of that is
all of that is cached and it's also
easier for us again to have one single
routing layer to go back to if something
goes wrong we can check one check one
log we can see once that once that's
dashboard which has everything in all of
our back ends all of our front ends and
yeah so that's</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
