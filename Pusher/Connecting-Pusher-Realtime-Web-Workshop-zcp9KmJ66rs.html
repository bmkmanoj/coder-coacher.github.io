a developer evangelist of pusher this is
a video showing how to connect pusher
and also provide with a bit of
information how to debug connecting and
how you might use our connection states
functionality so a little bit about
pusher before we get started we're a
hosted service and this means we're
infrastructure as a service where
real-time infrastructure-as-a-service
this means that you don't need to to
deal with scaling your real-time
functionality infrastructure and we
obviously handle that for you i'm in the
same way that twilio handle
communications for you sound great
handle email for you we handle real time
functionality but they also recommend
you have a look at the overview video
which shows some of the examples of real
time functionality our focus is to let
developers and businesses spend time
building features and cool stuff and not
configuring and managing and scaling
infrastructure
so here are some of the key concepts to
pusher your verse needs to connect a
pusher and this is what we'll cover in
the video need to subscribe to push it
to receive information and then you
obviously need to be able to publish
information so we'll focus on connection
so let's get the code from the real time
web workshop this is in github and we
can follow the URL or you can go to jada
mp4 / pusher hype and workshop and I'll
clone this ok we'll open up sublime you
see there's a number of different
sections in here at the minute and I'll
add some more examples but we'll jump
into the start so what we're going to do
is we're just going to connect the
pusher and demonstrate that we are
connected in a number of different ways
so we're going to create a the
application here it's simple HTML page
but it also includes jQuery jQuery
Mobile framework this means that it'll
them appear nice on a mobile device as
well so if we have a look at this at the
minute we jumping to connect with the
start we'll see it's just just says
hello world so in order to go to connect
a pusher we're going to use the
JavaScript library within our
documentation you'll see with a list of
libraries here we're going to client
libraries and JavaScript and we have a
number of with to CDN hosted versions of
the script we'll just take the HTTP one
and will include that
okay so we've now got the library so how
do we actually connect so the first
thing we need is an application to
connect it with in push up so once
you've signed in you'll go go to app
topic on and you can create a new
application okay we'll create a
real-time web workshop and within their
there's a peon access section that
provides you with information you need
in order to connect and publish will
take this key will also have another
quick look at the documentation so the
docs provide you with information you
need but also it's a focus on how do you
achieve something so under the using
pusher sections or client api overview
on to actually connect so here's the
information connect we create a new
pusher object and pass in our
application key and optionally some
options so here that says we're
connected if we now load this
application we're connected but how do
you actually know so one of the pieces
of tooling that we provide whilst
developing is a debug console within the
dashboard so if we're going to the
dashboard and then debug console is
waiting for events now this exposes
internal events that happening within
pusher so if we refresh this page you'll
see there's a disconnection so the pages
unloaded that's a disconnection event
and then when it loads again it connects
you can do that again cool now let's
also try that with a nice oh so this is
the same URL local s8000 one x start and
you'll see you sort of connection event
coming in and i'll unload it as a
disconnection and then there's a
reconnection
so that's great so you'll also want to
know that well there will be many cases
where you actually want to know about
your connection state within the
application so for instance if you go
offline or just generally when you've
connected and you know you connected to
Bush and you know you're going to start
receiving real-time information so the
first thing in terms of development
that's really handy is a push your log
property so this is on the pusher class
like a static property and you can
assign a function and you can log
information about what's going on within
the library so if I now open the
JavaScript console there's nothing there
I reload the page you'll see over there
we get information it over in the
console to get information about the
connects to state changes and also
within the JavaScript console we get
that information so that's great but
what times if you actually want to do
something in your code so maybe show an
indicator of whether you're connected so
let's do that let's create a an element
up here so we're going to start showing
our connection state within our
application up there so there's nothing
in the minute so if we jump back over to
our documentation you'll see we've got
connection States so firstly within
pusher everything is kind of an event so
you trigger an event you subscribe to
channels and you bind to events so
connection is exactly the same thing
that events occur for instance the
connection is it initially initialized
then we're connecting and then we're
connected and there are some fairly
states as well so you can bind to events
on a connection object which is on the
instance of pusher so you can bind to
individual connection States or state
change events so here we've got steak
change so this tells you what the
previous state was and what the current
state is so we're going to bind to that
and will create a state change function
and what we'll do jquery is included so
we can just click this this element i
will set text to the current connection
state value we now I'm going to pop up
refresh the page you'll see we've got
connected we do the same thing in the
iOS simulator you'll see we also get
connected so that doesn't look very nice
but what you might actually want to do
is provide a better connection indicator
so if we jump to the solution you'll see
when we're not connected it's red let me
open debug console now we're not
connecting at the moment because we're
not providing a nap key I take this up
key I jump into the solution I put my
application key in there I jump back to
the app now fresh the page you'll see
we're now green because we're connected
and we can do the same thing you can
show the page in our highslide bit as
well we're connected so that's it so
that's shown how to include the script
tag connect to pusher determine whether
we're connected or not by using the
debug console the pusher logging
functionality in the JavaScript library
and also through code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
