not that exciting really but it is
something that we tend to have to work
with a lot as kind of web developers and
so I think it's like quite important
especially if you have an application
that relies extremely heavily on forms
right if you have junior developers or
even like yourselves as like you know
senior or intermediate or whatever level
you're at you kind of don't want to
spend a long time having to repeat the
same thing with forms so typically an
app will have some sort of style guide
you'll have to like apply the same
classes you'll have to like kind of redo
these defaults every time if you're
sticking to this kind of typical HTML
form structure and so I think maybe a
year ago myself and one of our other
front-end developers we got together and
kind of sat down and thought okay what
would what would a form look like if we
were to create something for ourselves
and we decided that it had to have
convention over configuration to kind of
stick with thee with the Ember kind of
you know ethos and so it would try and
provide things like sane defaults and
you know kind of make decisions that we
thought would be best for our
application and for our developers and
it had to really what it boiled down to
was it had to provide minimal fuss but
also complete flexibility so we had to
provide these same defaults but allow
any developer at any point in time to
jump in and do things their way right
because one solution doesn't always fit
all especially when it comes to things
like forms and and it kind of had to be
like you know at its base and it's very
kind of basic implementation pretty
simple easy to understand had to follow
things like normal HTML conventions when
it came to things like events and other
properties that you had attached to
these yeah so you start with something
like this which is a fairly simple form
and this is a form taken from our
application and this is actually using
the
solution that we came up with but this
isn't actually very difficult right this
is one of the most simplest forms in our
application we have a text area we have
like some errors here because the
address can't be blank we have a
selector which is a country's US states
quantities which is a number field and
then another message text area down the
bottom and then two buttons save and
close so there's a very simple form but
then you get also quite complex forms so
this is another form that we have which
is probably one of the most complex
forms in our application I would say
second most complex but we have a
selector which searches every user that
works here at the company we have a
client contact which belongs to like a
different model we have other select
boxes we have this duration field client
availability a whole bunch of things
going on and to add to that there's a
lot of stuff that's going on in the
background right so we have a whole date
picker over here that has like it yields
each day and then each day can have
different properties attached to that
this field is actually displayed in
minutes but it's stored in seconds here
we have time zones which is you know a
whole world on to its own but here we're
like converting this is a conversion of
that time zone against this time zone
and then we display that output there we
have actions we have radio buttons we
have like combined fields down the
bottom here so it's like very complex
form and this is the exact type of thing
that we wanted to set out to solve we
wanted to say how can we say how can we
build something that takes something
like a very simple form all the way
through to something that's a little bit
more complex and still carry the same
conventions and yeah it was it was a
little bit challenging but I think we
what we what we ended up coming up with
I don't think is unique mmm I think it's
been done before with other forms though
I think some aspects of it I like pretty
pretty interesting and quite unique and
so yeah what we wanted to have was field
areas labels we wanted to be
to disable fields we want to be able to
disable the whole form if we wanted to
we wanted consistent styles so that the
developer never has to think about you
know if they have an input they
shouldn't have to think like what class
do I need to attach to this input to get
it to look like the 50 million other
inputs in my app it should be easy for
testing if we're building our informed
then we should like take liberty right
and we should add things they're gonna
make testing easier for us and then we
can build helpers on top of that as well
and it should also be really adaptable
so it should be able to support future
field types so it should be very
pluggable and and we're always thinking
right we always wanted to get to this
like minimal fuss but complete
flexibility that was the aim over
everything and yeah it was like a bit of
a challenge for for Andre and I and
really there are two things that you
need to kind of to grasp in order to to
understand how the form works
the first one is contextual components
is everyone familiar with contextual
components okay cool that should be easy
and then the second one is this concept
of project proxy objects or change sets
if you've used Ember change set are
people familiar with these as well okay
I'm gonna go over them anyway but what
are contextual components so I think it
was like a year and a half ago maybe a
little bit longer maybe a little bit
shorter give or take a few months but
you previously if you wanted to have
this concept of like a nested component
you couldn't really do it so you could
namespace them but you couldn't have
like a concept of like this component so
in this instance you have my component
you pass in a user it might need some
knowledge about like that user then you
have a label and input errors select and
you couldn't have this concept of like
well these label or this label component
is actually a child of my component
right if there's a there's an inherent
relationship there and that could only
be defined by the name spacing or by the
structure of your application in the
folders that was and and also you have
like you know you have a bunch of
repetitiveness here so you have the user
and
because there's no shared context here
you have to pass the user into each one
and I think a lot of us would probably
have situations like this and some of
our apps I know we do with some some
widgets and weird things like that where
they've got headers and then content and
then footers and but this was a pretty
typical scenario but obviously it's like
not very good it's not ideal there's a
lot of repetitive notes it's not very
clear it's not very easy to read and
understand
so the solution they came up with was
this idea of a component helper so we're
all familiar with helpers I have white
space there and that's driving me nuts
but you have this concept of the hash
helper people familiar with the hash
helper essentially it will take these
this is actually wrong but that's okay
we'll roll with it
but essentially will yield this hash and
what you would have is you would say
like you know label equals component and
then you would have input equals
component errors equals component and
you can kind of think of that as like a
normal object and the key will be label
and the value will be this component
which is not actually evaluated yet it's
not evaluated to you call call on that
argument that's yielding out into that
hash and so this is basically the the
essence of contextual components because
now I no longer need to as a developer
right not as an add-on implementer so
this is what you would have is an add-on
implementer and you still have this
concept of like repetition here but I
think that's okay that's okay because as
an add-on developer you're designing an
API you're not like reusing this in
multiple areas of your application but
as a developer you just want the
benefits of this and that's what this
help is all about that's what this
contextual component is all about it's
designed to make it easier for add-on
developers and for like you know
developers in your team to build
components that expose some level of an
API to make the job easier of building
your application and so yeah you can see
here that I pass in user to my top level
so this is my component jeaious and I
pass in disabled here and then I can
pass this in to each one
and then essentially what that's going
to look like we'll look at in a bit
but then I changes the the thing here
quite dramatically because I can yield I
get an argument back called like
component or something I can name it
whatever I want and then all I need to
do is component label and that's it I
don't need to do the disabled or the
user anymore because that's all getting
passed in through the my component
component okay so that's contextual
components what our proxy objects I'm
sure in some of our applications or
perhaps like earlier on in the days of
ember this would have been a pretty
typical scenario so you would have had
your form it would have had first name
last name email and that was probably
directly to we're bound to like your
model or some form of that perhaps like
a an alias on your controller or your
component but this was a pretty typical
scenario but this is not ideal because
the embassy or is global and so that
state when you mutate it is changed
everywhere in your application and then
you as a developer you're now you've
gone from you know trying to update
first name to having to go back and
rollback global state and that just
shouldn't be like a concern that we have
to worry about and so there's this
concept of a proxy object I think in
amber it's like amber dot object proxy
and or changesets so these are kind of
similar things change set is a similar
concept but essentially what you're
doing is you're populating your proxy
object using defaults from the content
and then when you change these you're
only changing them on this proxy object
or this change set and only when that
changed set for this like kind of middle
person here is valid or is in a state
that you're happy with do you then
persist that back and the advantage of
this is that if my user decides to fill
in this form and then cancel because
this is all within a component I don't
have to do any cleanup I just have to
throw it all away and forget that the
thing ever happened I'm not mutated any
global state here all I've done is
create an object
populate with some defaults and then
throw it away and so that's kind of the
concept of a proxy object or or change
that and so yeah these give us like
really good things though things that
don't necessarily that easy to use on an
on an ember model and because these can
be just plain pojos these don't have to
be anything special and so because of
that we can create our own conventions
around these so we can do validations we
can have temporary properties like
password and then password confirmation
and then we can have something in there
like a function that compares them to
make sure they're correct and we don't
have needless store creation so if I
want to create a new record I don't have
to create that until the object that I'm
actually mutating this proxy object is
in a valid state and can be persisted
back and I also avoid two-way binding
and I stick to this principle of actions
actions up data down or data down
actions up one of the two okay so back
to forms and so this is really a kind of
brief look of how we do the forms at
alpha sites there's like a lot more in
here that I would that I would love to
cover but honestly I could keep going
forever so I kind of have to like scope
myself and mm-hmm but essentially this
is this is the X form component okay so
if you think about our my component
before this is the component that we've
generated the form component and it's
called X form because naming things is
hard and so here we have just a plain
component and what this does is it
yields out a few different contextual
components this isn't an exhaustive list
like I cut this down a little bit to
kind of simplify it but we have a text
area actually I should start at the
start the first thing you get passed in
is a change set and then a global
disabled fault sorry global disabled
state and the reason for this is because
as if you imagine that your application
uses modal's or they go to a page and
then you require to load like you know
five other different models
like in the case of that scheduling form
that we had before you don't want your
users to be able to interact with this
form yet right because it's not ready
and so we have the option here to just
pass disabled in as true and that can be
running off something like an ember
concurrency task and as soon as that
task stops running and is idle the whole
form will be enabled and all that data
will be in there so we can use ember
concurrency tasks now to control the
whole state of our form with just one
property and because we're using
contextual components these just get
passed into every other field and then
we have like classes which get applied
and then the X form has like a special
CSS file which then makes everything
look the same right so everything can be
disabled there is a drawback here which
I'll go into later which I'm still
trying to solve and so we yield out a
hash we have text areas select and under
the hood this select is really just a
power select so we're doing you're doing
that whole concept of like you know
there are these solutions out there that
exist things like power select or power
calendar that are really great right and
we don't want to lose those benefits by
like trying to reinvent the wheel so
what we've done here is we yield out a
select and the underlying component
there is actually just a Power select
and then we provide like defaults even
on to that Power select and we have a
plain old input and then a button and a
label
okay so if we dive in to that input
component this is what that input
component looks like and if you imagine
what a form is and you imagine what a
field or what we call an element is
we've decided that elements are made up
of three things an element on a form is
made up of a label a field and an error
list and and so you have in that first
example the label would have been named
the field will be whatever the input is
for that particular element and then the
error list is basically a list of errors
and so at any point you can use all of
these you can use none of these if you
want just the field you don't have to
have the label you just wouldn't do like
form dot label or whatever if you don't
want
field for example you can do that yep I
have an example later where I can
actually demonstrate some of this in
action and so if we dive down a little
bit further let's have a look at the
field and so here we we have like this
is an example of like taking a bit of
Liberty as an add-on developer or as
like a kind of developer building an API
in this an it where we define a computer
property but essentially it's like a
very simple thing write the tag name is
just input then we have a few attribute
bindings for some normal kind of HTML
attributes value disabled Rideau in the
placeholder type right so we have
default support for things like number
or email or website or anything like
that and then we apply our like kind of
class names which is specific to this
particular X form we do things like auto
focus so these are things that there is
an html5 attribute which is auto focus
but that only works if the page loads
and it's not and it's the only input on
the page right if you have a component
that is in a modal or something like
that
auto focus doesn't always work in that
instance so here again we can take
liberties and we can say if you've
provided auto focus we do some like
quirky jQuery stuff in here to select it
which I removed I think to to hide that
shame and then we do a few more things
in the init so we do we define like a
property here - to watch the value which
I'll get into in the example so each
element also has a property which
reflects it tells that element what
field in the change set or proxy object
it's responsible for because by default
that this knows how to update itself but
that doesn't mean that you can't change
it which I'll dive into in a bit and
then we provide like you know the
default actions as well so we expose
those so we say if you've provided as a
developer if you've provided me an
action on input I'm just going to yield
up and I'm gonna give you the event and
it's up to you what you want to do
if you don't provide that action then
the default is to just set that property
on to the change set or the proxy object
that you've passed in so always trying
to think like what is the same default
here what's the expected thing but then
providing that complete flexibility for
the developer to jump in and do whatever
they want basically what this slide says
okay so an example so here we have a
form I'll bring up the example
controller and so here we have a
controller the route is just example we
don't have a route we don't have like a
real ember model either so you'll just
have to like imagine that a little bit
but in a knit we create this model which
you typically wouldn't do because the
controller is a singleton so this would
only get loaded once so typically this
would happen in a route so you'll have
to forgive me but then we set this real
model so we're basically like faking the
route action you can see here that age
right is stored in months so I'm trying
to like replicate this tricky situation
of something that's stored but then
displayed differently then we have an
action which is log objects which you'll
see when we get to the form and then
another action there to set the age so
this is the form and so this is what it
looks like in code this is what it looks
like on the on the page itself first
name will last name raxworthy
age 30 and and so yeah so if we walk
through this form a little bit first we
use the X form component I've used class
names here because I like didn't want to
kind of do my own CSS so I copied from a
from a previous form just to get the
kind of spacing and stuff like that
right and put it in the middle of the of
the page I'm using a change set so we
use change sets by default but really
this could be anything this could be a
member object proxy it could be a POJO
it could be whatever you want we just
use change sets and and then in response
or what gets yielded out to you there
this forum this component but you also
get that changed setback and this is
really important because this is what
lets you have that complete fix of
flexibility over what your what your
form elements will do and then we have
an input so we do formed our input I
tell it which property this element is
looking after which is named I have a
label first name by default so if I was
to get rid of this and just do this by
default that's just going to take the
property name that I have and capitalize
it and just do name I don't know that
seemed reasonable when we did it but you
can override that you can yield out and
you can do whatever you want you can
have a label that is like a select box
now you can have a label that is a
picture or like gif or something like
that right you can do whatever you want
or you can just put first name or you
can just have the default and then we do
the input field and this is this bit
here so you can see already right we've
created this change set it's backed by a
real model which was named will lastname
raxworthy and just by doing this it's
given me this input which then
pre-populates my default values in there
and ok so we have the same thing for
last name and then we have age again
which I'll get to in a second and then
down here we have we have a button and
so we have this concept of a primary
button and then we have a concept of
like a secondary button which is just
like a cancer or something like that
oh can everyone see that and so yeah we
passed primary true I'm not a big fan of
like passing primary true if I could do
it again I would probably do button -
primary or something but it's ok and
then we have an action here which is
which is on quick so by default a button
doesn't know what to do you have to you
have to tell it what to do so in this
case we're going to call log objects and
so if we have a look at log objects
what's it going to do it's going to log
the real model and then it's going to
log each of the values of the change set
so name last name and age
and this is really just to prove that
that the the change set is working and
that we're like you know updating these
values as we want so if I was to change
this to James and then I click this
button here you can see my original
object or my real model hasn't been
changed in any way but might change that
the values have been changed and only
the ones that although the ones that
have had those values are still the same
values and you can see like by default
right this is a pretty same thing you
put you type in the input the input
updates the change set and then you get
the change set back and so where it
becomes a little bit trickier is here so
we have this aged form and the aged form
we've decided we're going to store it in
months but when the user uses it we want
to show it to them in in years because
that's that's a better way to view your
age and and so this is an example of how
we can go completely custom on this
thing
so the default now is when I type in if
I go back to this example and I type in
something like 20 I want to see 20 but
what I actually want to store on the
change set is 240 all right it's like
stage fright I didn't even want to try
and so you can see right so by default
the value here would be change set age
and but we're we're overriding that now
and we're saying if change set age is an
integer and I'll show you why we have to
do this in a sec so integer is integer
is a helper that we've we've made and if
it's an integer then divide change set
dot age by 12 and if it's not an integer
integer so it's like no or text just
yield that text and this is so that I
can say something like I didn't capture
it but in the scheduling form if I was
the type test right you don't want to
show in a
you want to validate and you want to say
you've typed test but this is this field
should be a number I can show a better
example of that it actually works but
yeah so we check there if it's an
integer divided by 12 otherwise show the
age and then on input so rather than
going with that default action of just
updating the change set we want to run
our own action which in this case is if
there is a value set the age to the
value divided by 12 I sorry multiplied
by 12
otherwise don't do anything we don't
want to do anything so then when I type
in here and I say something like 50 and
then I hit save you can see the change
set is stored as 600 but the value of
that is displayed in my input is still
50 so my user has no idea that what
they're typing in is stored in months
but as a developer I have full control
to kind of like show that form exactly
as I want but I still get all the other
benefits right so I still get all the
classes I still get all the all those
other same defaults I get the error
lists and everything like that
and if we look at the classes we can see
that we have like you know we generate
all of this stuff which is useful for
for testing so we have like X form field
dash dash name so we use those
properties because you've told us what
that element is and so we can use that
to build class names which in your queue
unit tests you can now just go you know
project form dot X form field dash dash
name check the value of that and then
off you go you kind of don't need to
like traverse this whole dorm down to
like input so yeah we can take like a
lot of liberties here and we can provide
like a really good experience for for
someone who's building a form so yeah
like I said there's a there's a lot more
that I could probably talk about here so
I you know things like select boxes some
more like kind of complex examples of
how you would structure this how you
might go about testing it some other
helpers that we've written to kind of
make this stuff a little bit easier
I think I'm running out of time and
today I want to have any questions at
all yes I the whole thing itself is an
open-sourced purely because originally
it was changing so often as we kind of
figured it out I would love to open
source it I think there's another one
called ember form for which is quite
similar which also handles things like
change sets and stuff like that
it also does like translations and yeah
I would love to open source it I think
kind of before that there's like things
like accessibility that I would also
like to figure out like how you would go
about creating defaults for
accessibility yeah things like that
the other the other gotchu is so here
right I can say I can disable an
individual field so I can say if this
value is blank then disabled this
particular field short so if I go back
to my example template I can say like
here disabled equals true and then if I
go back here so age is now disabled and
you can see like this is an example of
how I've given it one property but it's
changed everything about that field but
now if my form as a whole is dependent
on a like running tasks I've overridden
the default here so I then have to
repeat this kind of like if this task is
running disabled this field as well and
this field so there's like a few things
like that that I'd kind of like to
figure out so like how would you
actually merge these disabled States so
that you can still disabled the whole
form but then have the ability to you
know have kind of nested disabled States
another thing you can do is you can
provide like modifiers so if you have
instances where you want to style a
field slightly differently you can
provide a modifier and that will be
familiar with be e/m it'll be ex form
field - - name - - something or other
and then you can like style
specific to your situation so yeah
there's a ton of things that I'd
probably love to change about it before
then any other questions
okay cool
