talk was led by two experts and right
now we're having a talk led by a junior
so you can see how cool inclusive and
diverse this conference is my name is
Amanda Cavallaro I'm a community
organizer at women techmakers and the
Google developers group London but for
cloud and I also get paid at my work
they work is that the resolver Dakota UK
which is an online platform that you can
complain for free so you don't have to
be on the phone for three hours or not
knowing the emails when you want to
complain to people you can just use our
free platform and today I'm going to
talk about this project that I had one
week to make I actually had a bit of
more time than that but I was wasting a
lot of time trying to come up with the
best idea so the context was I was
invited to speak at this conference for
girls and women in stem and since like I
work with with tech I thought it made
sense to just like because just having a
stand and having people come and give
them swag didn't make much sense to me
so I just wanted to have people play
this game I built and it was very very
cool and so this was the picture of the
day or the event this was before and
then I put I did give people the swag
and there were girls and it was just
amazing so first thing I did was just
modeling everything so I just got my
tablet and I wrote like I actually drew
I do how I envisioned envision it so I
just thought okay I'm going to do a logo
and the game is going to be people just
write something in HTML and then it's
going to be rendered and you can see the
page rendered on the same page just to
text boxes and then you could add the
photo from from my webkinz since they
were going to use my my computer on the
day and then you could just add some
styles to that but again it was just one
week and I has been working with react
for just a couple months so I just
thought maybe I can do it then but
before I chose react I was just thinking
what should i what should I use should I
use angular should I use react what
should i do then
I thought I'm wasting too much time just
choosing the framework or library or
whatever I'm just going to start
sketching things so I just know it's
better than that drawing I made before
so I just put the text boxes the images
and the button then everything was just
written with an h1 it wasn't even
buttons or anything just wire framing
and then I just added some jQuery it was
magical but again so I'm just trying to
show you how like me as a junior how I
think so many of you are thinking she's
doing everything wrong but I just wanted
to share maybe there are some other
juniors here they think in a different
or maybe a similar way they get the same
fright as I did and it's very hard to
talk about things that are not good at
in front of I don't know 160 people but
okay I'm doing this then at this point I
really just want because it was really
bad to look at that I just wanted to
stop and add CSS and make everything
pretty but I'm like let's stick to the
plan let's just you have these to do
let's add continue as a jQuery try to
make just one animation so I added
jQuery and may just put one animation
and think those things were working fine
then I thought it's time to choose what
I'm going to use so I went for react
because as I told you I was studying for
a couple months and I was just like you
know when you're following tutorials and
then things just seem to make sense
they're like I'm so good at it
but then when you actually have to do
things on your own it gets a bit harder
so I chose to use create react up
because it was simpler it was easier and
I just had one week and then I hosted
the page on that Lefroy which is awesome
very easy to do as well and then okay
things were actually you know so that's
how everything was looking when I just
added react and then I spent some time
just playing with things and it's very
hard for me to get just the HTML and
pass it to JSX so I went to those
websites HTML to JSX and they just put
things in there and then it helped me a
lot because then after I pasted this
first time I could just repeat and
reproduce the the first steps and then I
had my two tags that were really badly
aligned and things were looking bad but
they were working in react it was
really exciting then so before since I
did everything with tags I had one
so one tag for jQuery so what I had to
do was just use NPM that the expert said
it was very good so I'm doing it right
so I just had a jQuery in the right way
and then it was time to use the webcam
thing me then I went on that webpage I
think and p.m. where you can see all the
packages and everything and then I just
saw this awesome thing that had
everything that I wanted and then I
could just capture a photo and then you
could you use jQuery to just add the so
I could just use those few ters or I
could just change using animations which
is awesome for the beginners there to
play with it but again it was just one
week and I was dreaming hi and I was not
and I was doing this alone so okay so
things were working it was not very
inviting but okay but then I actually
used some boots fried and just use the
colors and I was feeling so good sorry
but then I had a problem I thought I was
the expert of bootstrap and I I just
started to add things with like row and
then add the twelve column grid and then
add the row and then I noticed I was
doing things wrong because you don't
have to repeat the row all the time but
the time that took me to realize that I
was doing wrong cause know most telling
me so it took me a long time and the
things were just overlapping them then I
figured how to do it yeah so now they're
not overlapping anymore but then they're
not really well aligned okay so I
managed I aligned it but now the image
so remember the person was supposed to
type here choose it and the thing was
going to output there but it's outside
of the text but was it so hard to the
textbox things then I had three days to
finish I was panicking like it was
almost there
so I decided to just change the project
project it was really disappointing but
it just needed something that worked so
instead of using the collab cam thing I
decided to just use images and then I
just got like some static images of a
cat
and of a dog and where's the hamster I
also I did I'm sorry I also got very
offended from the previous talk that he
didn't mention who is a hamster person I
am anyone Thank You Jesus Christ okay so
from the previous slide I had the
filters then I worked on the future and
edit some sappy I was looking cool who
who needed those webcam filters come on
this was just excellent then it was the
day before and things were not working
and I don't know if you ever worked with
default value and value here but so
basically let me just get back to the
thing here so whatever I was typing here
was outputting there but then when I was
I was using default value whatever I
typed it was showing there but the image
when I chose it wouldn't change and if I
use used value the images would change
but the text wouldn't so at this point I
was like what am I going to do it's
tomorrow so I was just very proud and I
didn't want to ask for help because it
was my first project but I just had to
so I asked my friend Tomas who was just
an expert and everything and then he
actually changed things so what he told
me to do was instead that was a code of
that he gave me so instead of using the
just value or default value I have to
use value with in managing the state and
then things worked and it was okay to
ask for help after all even if you have
your baby project it's okay to ask for
help with people you trust and just
right channels going and Stack Overflow
and stuff so that on the day things were
looking good with the hamster not many
people chose the hamster though and one
thing and another thing that I did wrong
is like I waited until everything was
finished I had like enormous code and I
didn't divide things in the in the
components which was very hard to
separate things after it so if only I
had started in the beginning with my
four components I think I'd be a lot
less lost so that's also a piece of
advice for people and I'm going to show
you the sorry the
Oh or is it not this one so basically
whatever I wrote here and then my
favorite color
I changed my favorite color so my cute
pet and then I choose the hamster and
then I you I would ask the girls like
just choose your favorite style click on
the on the filter you like and then you
have to come here and you wear it so
it's a it's a style for the image where
where is the image tag just go there and
change it there and then people like oh
my god I'm such a hacker I can just can
do stuff and things like bad and then
yeah it was very nice even even if it
was just a simple thing people were like
they had no idea what coding law so some
of them just did some like simple HTML
classes in school so they were feeling
like oh my god I really got this don't
worry so what I would have done
differently I would have spent more time
modeling the project because maybe then
I would have realized I wouldn't have
time to do the webcam webcam thingy
before I'd also have so I started to get
repost the repository only when I I
realized I was going to use react but
why didn't I start before so start from
the beginning to use any version control
you want and I would have as I said
separated things in the react component
letter right now and you know when you
run the audit thing in the white house
thing that's how the the thing is
working right now so I would have spent
more time in those things that people
who are smarter than me say is important
and some on some of the comments I heard
in the day as I told you so it was very
nice to just see the girls doing
something and some of the nice things I
I saw there and just some tips I give to
everyone as a person who is learning and
talking to people about this too very
hard so just try to build projects from
scratch because many times that work
like people have already started like
that project exists for years and then
you're just like fixing things and then
sometimes you go on Stack Overflow you
find the dancer quickly you don't you
don't get the time anytime so just start
things on your own so if you have any
time in your free time try to build
things from scratch because you're going
to realize so many things you don't know
that you think you know and it's
okay to fail it's it's okay when things
are you put deadlines and you can't meet
them I mean for your projects not the
ones that work because if you're
learning from them so if from each thing
you're learning just one thing sometimes
we're just like but I need I need to do
many many things no it's okay if you
just learn one little little little
thing by day it's it's alright and ask
for help it's okay don't bungle it too
proud like I walk ask for help and the
last one is really important and if I
wrote everything as I was doing I was
just I being and complaining and saying
things were difficult and yeah it worked
so if you want to read everything out
share the slides and if you have any
questions that's where you can find me
online thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
