you why you are wrong yeah because I
think Jules and JavaScript are just like
driving a car when you know how to drive
a car no one else around you knows how
to drive a car just us you are the only
one person in the whole world that knows
how to drive a car
Enzo we know how to write JavaScript and
you don't and we also know there's right
cars do you have a license I do the
license she has a license I used to have
a car - oh cool
anyway this is us I'm Ellie I work
downstairs at train line I'm a front-end
developer which makes me an expert so
everything I say is right and everything
you think is wrong also we're on a state
let's pretend this is a stage so
obviously we know enough Ellie come on
I'm like one six Oh
so I'm Sarah I work in yld which is like
five minutes away so pretty huge right
as well and I am also a front-end
developer there and I'm an expert
front-end developer so as you can see my
photos are conference so pretty
expert guys I know what the I'm
doing
all's same yeah okay so no we can start
yeah good so our first thing is package
managers let's talk about package
manager yeah I guess twitter hasn't
talked about it enough right if you work
with JavaScript you need to manage your
packages you do you need to manage your
packages in real life like I didn't lose
manage your packages we don't want you
to do it wrong so let's talk about NPM
and yarn I mean does anyone wanna talk
about Bower cuz we're super into that as
well don't they have the parrot stickers
is that them not against you oh no
that's Bower that's power
yeah that's not pretty anyway let me
tell you about MPM NPM is amazing NPM is
a classic NPM is the og package manager
didn't know gee killed his wife or
something
Shh he was innocent you should be using
NPM for all of your projects you're not
using NPM you are wrong um here is an
amazing tweet screenshot from one of the
people that work on NPM who is very
smart much smarter than all of you not
us though and there explain
and you can see they explain that MPM is
slightly slower but it's much more
dependable like a you know like an old
friend like an old car as well yeah
exactly exactly it still says um if you
want your app to be stable you should
use NPM okay but what if I'm just what
if I have other things to do in life so
I'm defending yarn cuz yarn is dope it's
much fast it's so fast you can't even
see like you go yarn install and I
should just like whoa it's dope ok and
so also NPM does that really up
thing we're like if you have your yarn
stuff and then you run npm install lo -
for example cuz you wanna install the
entire internet so npm install or add it
deletes all of your yarn stuff and it
just installed slow - and nothing works
on your website and that's not it that's
that's not cool well II know so clearly
don't use yarn yeah obviously yeah you
use NPM alone it won't break your stuff
actually brawler will anyway but that's
not its reliable am i crying from a joke
or the pizza it's okay my pizza was
really spicy so also like it works
offline like if you're in a plane in
words I think I've never tried it but I
think it works I'm pretty sure your
words and like there's a second time
when you're still offline it doesn't
matter like okay ever like how much you
code on a plane really versus how much
you want your app to be reliable I'm
just saying I'm just saying you know I
think it's way more important for your
app to be like go get on a plane also
does this really cool thing which ate
yarn upgrade interactive it's fine yeah
it's it's dope shut up
so basically you run yarder interactive
and there's this things that tell you
like this is a patch update this is a
minor and I didn't have a major update
but it tells you all the things and you
just like dab your way through it and
just press the space key and you select
all the things and you click enter so
obviously if you're using NPN like dude
dude it's 2018 right whatever right okay
cool let's talk about semicolons because
I
semicolons are a very contentious issue
in the JavaScript world engines even
meeting though but it's highly debated I
guess I think right now that neither was
her native English um you you have to
use semicolons semicolons are amazing
semicolons sick mmm tc39 if the
JavaScript overlords recommend you to
use semicolons
therefore you should use semicolons you
can avoid errors you can avoid
unexpected behavior it's a nice little
end to your you know line life um it's
safer you won't get these weird bugs
that you don't know where they came from
it never happens that happens all the
time
we never happens tc39 they are
JavaScript you know leaders thought
leaders and they say you should use
semicolons if you're not using
semicolons you're wrong I just want to
point out the react felt leaders that's
following me on Twitter so technically
I'm a thought leader as well same
okay so first of all like JavaScript as
a CI which means like semicolons are not
necessary this is like you have been
lied to like the only reason I don't use
semicolons is because when I do learn
JavaScript everyone told me that I
needed to use semicolons and then I saw
this tutorial and the guy was like oh
semicolons I'm not necessarily just
reminded me of all the lies my mom told
me when I was a kid and I just felt
betrayed I did were you laughing I'm not
happening I'm crying
oh that's cool and I don't know I just
felt betrayed and I was like no I don't
need semi code they're so pretty it's
like when you move out of your
grandparents house and you live in this
really cool hipster house and like
everything is just so pretty it's just
it's so much better like there are three
occasions where you're like it up
but you'll never find them actual
because you have the absolute atomic yes
lint
yes lint so basically if you're using
semi cannot using semicolons dude 2018
let's talk about frameworks let's talk
about frameworks
the tenant no I'm kidding we just picked
four okay so we have react
who's up for reais put your hands up
team react to react yay
we have pre-act we have view and we have
angular since none of us has actually
worked with anything after angular 1
this will be related to only angular 1
only angular 1 because we didn't want to
show you on something don't ever use
talk about what you know okay yeah
exactly
we're experts but not in that yeah yeah
we just it's the one thing yeah we don't
know angler so react
it's very nice yes it's so nice yes go
it's declarative it's easy to use it's
the hot new thing on the block
everyone's using it it's a very easy to
create apps with react react has
honestly been like a super huge
game-changer for to the JavaScript
industry also all the jobs are in react
now so you can get money real money
which you can exchange for goods and
services so obviously if you're not
using react
you're not only wrong but you're poor
and sad and sad yeah you're everything
so I'm a pre X advocate I think I can
say this so first of all it's much
dining no I think there's only one more
slide we don't don't worry about it's
much tiny like the syntax is very cool
it's very familiar to react so you get
like the best of both worlds like you
can use all the cool things that we I
TAS in a much tiny thing yep oh
that's other selection I mean smaller is
not always better but you know it's fine
what are you talking about um bundles
Oman the sizes okay oh so you're not
some really cool things to do do it do
react like why would you not use it like
it's smaller a bumble sized it's smaller
AIT's a sometime what you never used it
I've used it one you guys never want to
react up and I try to change and it
broke and I was upset that's fine I'm
sorry okay so view view it's must fast
view is so fast view super fast
also I feel like view is like the kitten
of frameworks is like the Harry Potter
of web frameworks everyone loves it no
one like you either
I've never met anyone that hates Harry
Potter I have never does anyone okay
cool dude get out dude come on you
either know it and love it or you just
haven't read it haven't heard of it like
those are the two states there is no
hate with you
there's no hate it's like a little kid
in a web development also I just want to
say that they're Docs
I like awesome if they put Google
AdWords on that that that would be
doop you either love them or you haven't
read them true true true true also I
think if you're not using viewer I think
you're slightly wrong it's probably
wrong probably wrong she'd ever used to
you yeah so angular one
[Laughter]
oh my god and go 2-1 does anyone
remember route scope and set timeouts
and yeah that was though about that
let's talk about state management oh my
gosh thank you um I know this this
theory is actually from the talk now I'm
sorry um alright so there's like two big
players we want to talk about and tell
you why you're wrong
Redux and mob X lots of X's there you
know what I'm saying um Redux is amazing
Redux is the thing right it's immutable
it has amazing dev tools Dan Abramov is
on Twitter like it's really suspenseful
is a delight she is a delight everyone
is using it so again jobs money not
being poor all of those amazing things a
house having a house it's a great
solution actually technically it's a
great solution and I know because I'm an
expert so really you should be using
Redux for your state management please
don't
you're wrong if you're not ok so first
of all I just wanna say that I hate
Redux because you have to change four
files to change an object and that hurts
my feelings so much because that's not
the way life works and also my leg is
like oh my god it's so nice like it's so
nice it's just so pretty
it's so pretty like the code is just
nice it's just you know you don't have
to change one file you get to go home
early because you don't have to change
the other files the other three files so
you only do like 25% of the work it's
dope you should see it like also I get
paid by the month not by the hour so it
doesn't it's not really good for me to
use redox I'll get paid the same so if I
got paid by the hour if you get paid by
the hour use Redux swear you swear to
you that app is gonna fill in your
pockets like crazy wait can I how many
of your contractors how many of you get
paid by DL use redox radix is dope it's
super reactive like you change one thing
in one file and you're like updates in
the in the other one we're just two
files because the stories and objects
and not some weird thing and why isn't
it more popular you know what I'm
it is it is it's more popular than you
know if you're not using marvex you work
by the hour basically so let's talk
about types who whose a type person was
a Thai person are you have like three
friends le gonna convince the rest types
are amazing what are you doing having a
life look I'm not gonna get into the
whole typescript verses flow thing I
think both are great
I think typed JavaScript is the future
and the way to go you stitch
so basically types find all your
 before the internet does soul I
mean I don't have any I'm an expert but
if I did like Sarah I would get
real-time feedback on what went wrong
before I even run my ass you know what
things are it's great for big teams for
communication it's great for
understanding what your code is doing to
what when and I think if for any app
bigger than like us you know listening
box yeah you need types and if you're
not using types you're definitely wrong
definitely please know your size okay so
first of all no one wants to learn two
different languages are basically the
same language that's why reason is not
picking up it's not that's not okay so
like the thing about types is that like
it's imagine that you install lodash and
he doesn't have like it's not a site not
a nice typing's but it does okay imagine
that it doesn't fine okay so imagine
that you write a frame a librarian
someone is like oh dude this doesn't
work which I you had a right to types I
had to do that for flow that was not fun
that was not fun at all that was way
worse than Google Analytics and I hate
Google Analytics trust me I'm not fun I
hate it oh my god it's so glad I know
it's so much faster to develop things
when you don't have any types they're
not fast if it breaks though you know
what I'm saying defense defense depends
on I mean we're experts are things don't
break but you guys will promote break
stuff so come on don't lie to us there
is actually like no proof that is
actually better to develop with types I
develop with types and I can tell you
better from experience and I know
everything so there you go
science fact okay what's our capital
Bulgaria anyway this is a picture of
nothing it's a black square of nothing
yeah just new JavaScript Elliot you
would not look any ties yeah okay I'm
just I'm just gonna lay this out here
I'm just sayin cyan all their real
languages use x so I don't know like
what not in front of company
darling okay so let's talk about editors
editors we actually both like the same
editor like America great oh my god is V
s oh my god it's so cool
it is amazing oh my god PS code people
in the house yes yeah the
rest of you using Adams
that's cool
Adams cool as well I'm fine without Adam
Adam sublime Oh yours is webstorm dude
IntelliJ Oh notepad plus plus yeah
Microsoft Word the dev tools and pro um
Gnaeus code is great it's free I mean it
has amazing type support it has like
intellisense so you can get previews and
it previews your imports and you can
click through to things oh it's so good
I know it's also like Microsoft is an
evil anymore it doesn't break all the
time like some of the other ones yeah
they're getting better every other evil
anymore no no it's what Apple is evil
who's evil No I can't just read like if
you touched my laptop the new ones yeah
that's not cool so far he is the new ie
so far it shows on you IE oh my god dude
yeah you're a girl sorry I'm heart emoji
times 2 because we both love it
I know right and we count each one of us
counts us to emoji we strongly feel that
if you are not using this code you are
wrong yeah two experts saying the same
thing double run alright so let's talk
about vim who loves vim though ok cool
cool ok everyone loves vim but who uses
on a daily basis like to code who knows
how to quit vim
five people five people know how to put
them okay no I don't believe this
how do you quit them yeah somebody
anybody nobody says how you give him any
okay good okay I would quit and save on
him
murmurs everyone looks at their nails
like mmm no boy okay so the thing about
them is that it takes you an entire
Court is that that is like Amazon
de velas like loud Amazon wife services
hey don't the West yes I want for
joining you know usual earning curve do
nothing things like a dictionary of
stuff and I swear to God that how to
quit vim is like one of the most such
things on Stack Overflow I think is like
most views and then the entire country
or Portugal it's kind of amazing
we're not that big but come on it's like
still ten million people but the thing
is like if you know how to use it you
just like you never touch your mouth
like you're super into that thing you're
just super fast super effective your
friends hate you
your friends hate you and your friends
look and you're like fuck's wrong with
you but you don't care cuz you use them
and they don't and you're smart about
that
you are way smarter than the cool thing
about them is like it works everywhere
even in your mom's computer like you
don't have to be there oh my my
honey solve es code now it just works
but like why are you coding on your
mom's computer you know my life okay
alright fine you don't know what like
okay she has like one of those tiny EP
C's it's so fun oh my god formatting
bollocks prettier yeah we love it too
we're big fans yeah what you guys know
it was the way the rest of your not
using pretty so pretty is dope um you
don't have to think about formatting it
just does all the work for you format on
save is the most satisfying thing it's
just like magic mixed with chocolate and
puppies let's not you know it's
configurable to a point so you're not
like completely at its mercy
you can pick whether you want you know
semicolons please don't want semicolons
say yes to semicolon and I have so I
have this friend who's like I don't like
prettier because I like to make my own
rules
and it was like you get used to it in
like 24 hours it's 24 seconds like you
click command s yeah or control us sorry
and like everything just formats and are
like I don't even care how its formatted
any
if you spend time formatting you're not
doing your job and again back to the
money jobs thing you know real money not
BIC Kondo
no not Bitcoin it's real money like
pounds styles styles you love CSS
everyone loves CSS right oh my god we
have one hand actually like CSS it's
fine don't worry you're not alone in the
world so CSS vs. CSS nsj yeah I don't
know okay I think it's pick this one
okay I love CSS it's amazing it's much
faster to render it's much easier to
pick up if you learn CSS before the
whole react you know world yeah um you
already know it you don't have a
literally with jQuery that's Asus I know
right yeah MySpace what do you query
myspace yes there's less tooling I was
friends with Tom on myspace oh my god
who - I'm special you can use the
correct casing for the properties that
you see on the browser oh my god like do
that with good snake case what snake
case case the bad case instead of like
the big little thing you don't have to
put quotes around values you can just
tell it what the value is you know like
every use cell components it's the real
CSS like you don't want any of those
poster libraries that the maintainer is
gonna get bored and quit and left pad
all over the place okay so first of all
what CSS and Jas is amazing okay so
first of all you get like if statements
in CSS which I come on it's a dream
that's true that it's I gotta give it to
you I do like if statements if statement
I like it more than most other
statements what are the other statements
while loops only try catch okay so you
can actually server-side render with CSI
CJ yes most of the libraries lay you
server-side rendered that thing word is
like oh my god but it doesn't
server-side rendering dude you're not
checking the internet you gotta check
the internet rule number one of life
always check the Internet rule number
two always believe the internet the
Internet is always right yeah you are
always wrong
rule number three CSS nsj is awesome
some of them some of the tools are
actually smarter than us like this is
tool called fella was like if you use
but it's the same thing like margin top
10 pixels all over the thing it actually
creates like helper classes for you so
you don't have to do it and download
tachyons attackers is the best by the
way interesting yeah I know I'll look
into it
what tachyons yeah yeah Auto prefixes
all your things so you don't have to
auto prefix all the things when I join
my old company they didn't have how to
prefix all my field on a on Safari
I mean obviously use all of it
developing for Chrome only exactly like
it's Firefox if it works on the first
try the new Firefox the new fire for ya
the quantum one yeah the black one the
quantum quantum quantum its component
base like it's good probably like you
make your component and then you make
the size of your component and then you
have a component it's dope I think it's
like if you're using CSS like it doesn't
make an if statements if F in statements
who doesn't want have statements in CSS
what does it more happiness in CSS by
the way so let's talk about animals now
you want to feel very strongly about
this oh the Mojo's I'm not showing up so
there's a cat and a dog emoji picture it
you know what emojis look like you know
what cats look like right I'm wait lemon
I would just want a quick poll who here
is dog people cat people all right look
cats so no listen
dogs are these amazing fluff balls and
they love you back
unconditionally and when you get home
you are the best thing that has ever
happened to them in the universe
they love cuddles and they will cuddle
with you when you want to cuddle with
them not when they want to cuddle with
you you know what I mean like that's
what people are for if you want to be
angry anyway cats are mean they throw
 on the ground and they're like
Ebola they're like watching your every
move and when you slip they strike you
know if I'm gonna feed you and bathe you
and walk you then you better love me
unconditionally I'm just saying so we
just realized that she hates humans in
general because cats are basically
humans I guess our personalities except
for you directly if you're punching
in the face don't please don't punch a
guy in the face like that's not cool we
do not recommend it we do not worry
around anywhere punching a kind of face
well if you accidentally step on it or
something's gonna be pissed like a you
one yeah then you spend all this time
loving it and now it's just gonna leave
you it's gonna leave you doesn't know at
all we live in an apartment all the
is gonna get out you don't know my life
what are you gonna trap it I want it to
be happy to be there
I mean puppies are so cute maybe anyway
I don't know okay so first of all cats
won the Internet and that's the second
of all there's a lot of puppy videos
there's a lot more of cat videos I
shipped on more yeah because people
can't find anything else to do with them
it's like you can't love them and they
won't love you back so might as well
film them and make a buck on YouTube and
then you're rich like really really dark
people whoo no no just me Trevor they're
not mean they're just assholes like Jim
ones their dislike oh yeah okay okay
okay you know what Sarah I think we can
agree to disagree
these are this is real footage of us by
the way yeah yeah on a Saturday yeah we
forgot that we forgot two costumes I'm
sorry yeah yeah what sorry so we fight a
lot but it's friendly fighting what what
I've never been told about this part the
if you're on the Twitter or on Stack
Overflow or on the Internet in general
you will see a lot of these points and
you will be told that you're wrong and
you probably are but in all seriousness
now and I'm using my serious voice it
doesn't matter what you use you can use
whatever you want whatever you choose
it's fine
do not let the internet tell you
otherwise do not let some random yelling
girls tell you otherwise there's a lot
of hate in JavaScript these days and in
Twitter and everyone's like oh Redux is
great or Redux is wrong and everyone
that built Redux should die like anyone
literally the whole world like says that
about that nabber mob honestly I mean I
haven't so nice on Hacker News in a long
time but I assumed that's what goes on
there
don't be discouraged by people telling
you wrong don't be discouraged because
you don't know about a thing a tool of
framework whatever the hot new thing is
that all the cool kids are doing you
don't have to know it if you don't want
to you know you can't learn it if you do
want to you can learn it you can hate it
and it's fine it's totally fine what are
we fine
no weird friends is reality that's the
thing we all think that everyone cares
and in reality no one cares as long as
you do your thing and you're happy some
your boss is happy and your boss is
happy oh there's also an emoji that's
not show me
it's the confetti tada emoji so you can
just imagine the emoji yeah
Oh point is no one cares here's whatever
you want
be happy be happy don't let the
JavaScript get you down we don't care
no one should care if you want to be
happy though tongue is angular one
that's the only thing that's the only
thing actually you can use angular do
whatever you want just don't use angular
one dude my Saturday went down the
 drain same down the drain oh one
thing but everything else is fine you
guys are great yeah every time I use
windows develop on Windows XP do what
don't listen to the hype just on your
coffee machine get a terminal I
don't know do drama script tacky things
it's all valuable so that's that's
pretty much our talk I thank you for
listening thank you for listening
get out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
