actually about something bigger than
Mongoose and at the time it was the
lightning talk we were really just going
to talk a little bit about some problems
we ran into but what this is really
about is a story about how we made a
series of really good decisions you know
not things that even in retrospect I
would critique that ended up overtime
kind of cornering us right so you start
out with these nice cute Mongoose
puppies here you come back as an
innocent snake making your way in the
world thinking you might eat one of
those puppies and that's what you're
confronted with to start out with just a
bit of background who here has actually
used Mongoose so ok quite a few people
so I did make a slide just in case
nobody anybody didn't know what it was
it's basically this comes this is just a
screen grab straight off the website
it is a modeling tool for monk for
MongoDB right so you can basically
create models it gives you a lot of
really powerful functionality and it
also gives you it wraps a database
driver so it's both the modeling tool
and a database driver and that's
important I'll be coming back to that in
a moment I'm gonna talk just briefly
about who we are what we're doing where
all this stuff fits in first of all this
is the company I work for we're called
sentry technology we're an ad tech
company a few my colleagues are out in
the audience and we are developing an
education platform so we're already
delivering in a quite a large number of
schools people are doing their homework
on our platform teachers are delivering
lessons and that kind of thing this is
our stack and so we're Mongo Fitz was
right there but actually what happens is
and all of this is important to this
story right because this is all about
the way that our platforms evolved and
the way that this really really good
tool mongoose that allowed us to connect
to Mongo and manage our our entities
came to cause us problems so we've
developed our front-end using web
components with polymer
who here has experience using components
in a four
on front-end so you'll have an idea of
some of what I'm talking about a little
bit later on we use typescript that is
also going to figure into this story we
have a front end a set of front end
api's which are micro services developed
a node right that's why we're here at
this forum we have back-end api's that
are doing all of the machine learning
and data crunching and that kind of
thing those are developed in Scala also
micro services the backend API is talk
to Cassandra when they need to interact
with Mongo they go through the front-end
API and that's our stack this is
actually an even bigger problem and this
is the one that sparked the initial set
of thinking that basically led me to
propose the lightning talk way back when
we had a discussion I don't know exactly
how serious it was it was one of those
things where it was serious but we
weren't really going to do it we started
talking about whether we might want to
switch to another database and that has
to do with the lot of things but one of
them is the evolution of our overall
data design it's become more and more
relational as time has gone on and as
anybody who's used Mongo knows it's not
really a very good platform for managing
relationships between data you have to
write a lot of that stuff up in the in
the in the application when a sequel
based database like say Postgres which
also allows you to have schema less
Beeson fields in it would manage those
relationships for us out of the box and
we started thinking about that now I
mean switching to another database is
not a trivial task under any
circumstances but if you've got a
package like Mongoose that basically
combines your database driver with and
your data access layer with your models
suddenly you've got two parts of your
application that have to be completely
rewritten in order to accommodate a
change like that and that's when we
started thinking about the limitations
of this tool that what it was giving us
out of the box was also tying us to one
piece of tech in our stack whether we
wanted it or not and as I say I don't
know how serious we've ever been whether
we'll ever switch to another database
but
when we started thinking about that and
that's when the first set of problems
started coming back and we started
thinking about this in light of that and
started thinking well maybe this is just
something we want to to start moving on
from now the reason I talked about our
stack is how that plays into this whole
situation so when you develop components
on the front end you can think about
those as kind of like micro services for
the front end right there each one of
them has its own scope it's almost like
developing a whole cluster of tiny
little applications that each have to
interact with stuff in their own way
each have to import certain resources
each have to exist in that way so
spreading the schemas among all those
components spreading the types among all
those components doing all of that kind
of stuff was a big headache and having
all of the schema definition
concentrated again in the one layer was
causing us a big problem so we started
thinking about a solution to our problem
and so that's why I'm saying this is not
actually a talk about flaws and Mongoose
so much as focusing on Mongoose is an
example of a problem so first of all
thinking back again to the fact that I
didn't even mention this at the time on
the slide the Scala api's have their own
data definitions and those are totally
not shared with anybody and in fact
really all schema definition because two
years ago we were a start-up is still
happening in a Google Doc and so we want
to move on from that and so what's
happening now is we've got a repo of
JSON schemas for all of our entities
everything even the stuff in Scala so
what the Scala developers do to actually
consume that is totally up to them but
basically the data architect writes
those schemas we write them with them
with her if you know when we need to do
input and then what's in the repo is
basically the entity definition and that
can be exported out so we then begun the
process of splitting apart
modeling from data access so we are
going to phase out Mongo all together
we're gonna write a new data access
layer we're looking at a couple of
packages for doing that and we're going
to do that in such a way that if we do
make that decision down the line to swap
to another back-end system it's not
going to affect up any other part of our
code we just write maybe some new access
code and put that in underneath the
models and most importantly we've
started writing agnostic model classes
that we can use in all parts of the Java
Script parts of the applications so
basically their base models that can
operate on the back end and the front
end in differently we don't use anything
like browserify or any of those kind of
build tools so the idea is that you
extend these so on the back end you
extend them and show a code example in a
moment you can extend it on the back end
and all of the dependencies can be
imported using back end imports and on
the front end you can use HTML imports
this is what we're using for the moment
till we switch that as well so finally
we found a really good plugin that we
can use to take all those Jason schemas
and convert them into typescript and
that's what I'm going to just show in
this example so bear with me for a
moment oh wow it landed on the right one
so this is an example of one of the
agnostic models this is based on a
really really simple instance of a user
there is also another one that is
showing the JSON schema on the left so
the JSON schema there for this user is
defined there when you run the build
tool this is what you get as an output
for your typings that you can import so
this would be and it sitting on top of
the repo that we're going to have which
is going to be exporting JSON schemas
and we still haven't quite worked out
how we're gonna how we're going to
deliver those to the real world but this
thing will basically conduct a build on
that create a set of type
that we can then import into any classes
that were using and then this is an
example of a base class so again it's
not pulling in any of its dependencies
its declaring all of its Taipings
everywhere it's in its implementing the
output that we got from the jace it from
the json schema converted to types its
declaring all of its public interfaces
down there and then it's got methods and
this is an example of how you extend it
on the backend so I do my imports up
there and then I just declare those in
the constructor and so by doing that
we're basically going to be able to do
identical validation code on the front
and back end so zed schema which is the
plugin that we're using to do json
schema validation works on the front and
back end they provide you downloadable
versions for both and we can therefore
have identical code running so if you
think back to the mongoose situation if
we wrote another class to do front-end
validation we've now got completely
different code doing our validation on
the front end in the backend and that is
obviously a maintenance overhead so
that's basically the talk it's about
halfway between the lightening talk and
a full talk and it's as I say it's
really a story I think from our
perspective about making the right
decisions and still having them blow up
on you and then trying to figure out a
way to get out of it so I guess I can
open up for questions if anybody has any
otherwise won't thank you very much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
