about server-sent events which is
handling events in JavaScript on the
client site where the events literally
happen on the server my name is Cornell
ocinski you might know me from apps like
imageoptim and image optimization in
general but I also do JavaScript not
just images so that's why today's talk
server sent events is now kind of old
API it's older than its competitor
WebSockets it's and I've been I've been
involved in designing the API at what
working group what while ago so let's
just start you probably know the Ajax
the XML HTTP request which is simple
just downloading a single file over HTTP
on the other end of the spectrum we have
WebSockets which is a completely custom
protocol with a dedication permanent
connection to the server where you can
exchange messages in two directions
however between those two between just a
simple download on a HTTP connection and
full-blown custom protocol there can be
a simpler alternative which is server
sent events server sent events started
as as a hack it used to be called comet
or long polling where instead of
downloading a file from the server
immediately the server wouldn't respond
until something happened so to the
browser it looks like the file is just
taking a very very long time to respond
but the server is deliberately not
responding until it has something to say
to the client and then it sends the rest
of the message and closes connection so
that was long polling and this sort of a
hack got fully standardized
into server-sent events API and even
extended that not only you just send one
thing in close connection but the server
can keep responding and responding and
responding on the same HTTP connection
what would you use it for for example
you can implement your own slack clone
server sent events is just from the
server down to the client so if you want
to send a message to the server you
still have to use the classic Ajax
request or a forum or whatever you use
to communicate with the server up to the
cloud but then with server sent events
you can make all the clients all the
other windows all the other users
everyone else
subscribe to listening to this events
that happen on the server so the server
can say hey there's a new message
there's a notification there something
happened and then all the clients will
immediately in real-time get get the
message you can observe logs on the
server in real-time and probably the
biggest users user of the server sent
events API specifically is github I
don't know if you notice but if you keep
a github window open and a push new
branch to the repository that message
will pop up automatically you don't have
to refresh github.com will detect that
you've pushed to your git repository
using command-line git or any
application or anything else and notify
all your open browser windows in
real-time that you've just created
something that there are new files
there's new new branch or that you've
posted a comment and it pops
automatically because github it uses
server sent events and makes all your
browser windows always subscribe to
events that happen on the web server on
the web server from the client-side it's
it's a very minimal API there's
eventsource
construct
so you subscribe to a stream of events
giving URL on the server I'll briefly
shortly describe how to what descend
from that URL but you'll create your own
server-side endpoint for messages on the
client-side you just subscribe to that
endpoint and you get a source of end
object and it will fire a message event
event every time the server send says
there's something new that happens and
you'll get event data which is arbitrary
string usually you can just send a
string of json and decode that json from
the server there's also a bit more that
you can that you can do but that's the
basic if you just want to know something
happened on the server now differences
between WebSocket and server sent events
are mainly compatibility so service and
WebSockets he used to sound like a nice
solution a couple of years ago but I
think happened HTTP 2 is now very common
and it happens that WebSockets are not
compatible with HTTP 2 WebSockets were a
hack on top of HTTP 1 and that hack no
longer works in HTTP 2 world however
server sent events on the network level
look like it's just a file download a
regular file being downloaded just very
slowly one line at a time so service and
events continue to work with all web
servers web proxies most CDNs everything
is actually that you can just distribute
a regular static file over then it also
is most likely to be compatible with
server sent events and compared to hacks
built on things like XML HTTP request or
never-ending iframes or slowly
downloading scripts and so on
it'sjust is that the browser no
server-sent events are dedicated to
sending of events from the server so it
can be smarter about managing those
connections avoiding blocking other HTTP
traffic that would otherwise wait on
that connection or reuse one connection
across many event objects so what you're
sending from the server is a text file
you have to set mime type that's called
text event stream and then the server
sends a line starting with data column
those five bytes are the entire overhead
of your message so the protocol is
actually quite efficient after that it's
arbitrary data that you want it can be
plain text it can be JSON string
whatever you find convenient and the
blank line blank lines and tells the
brow browser
I finished that's the whole set the
whole message fire an event now so the
cool thing is the whole protocol can be
basically described on a single slide
compared to WebSockets
protocol which is a binary data protocol
with special framing compression many
other features which are like a 50-page
spec so if you were if you were building
a WebSocket server from scratch that's
actually a huge challenge and a library
and to use WebSockets on a client you'll
also probably want want to have some
kind of a library that adds sugar on top
there on top of the raw API on the other
hand service and events are just a plain
text protocol sending line of simple
instructions so I can it so I can tell
you everything about the protocol right
now so as I've mentioned every line
starting with data is a bit of the event
that you're sending you can
sign and ID to every event if you can
assign an ID the browser will remember
the ID of the last message that it has
seen so if the connection is lost the
server will try the client the browser
will try to reconnect the server and
will tell you the ID of the last message
that it saw this way your server can use
some kind of a ID that you can get from
a database or a timestamp or something
like that and you keep track of how many
messages the client has seen and in case
of interrupted connection you can
gracefully resume sending messages from
where the browser lost connection this
way you don't don't lose any messages
and this also is robust against data
loss you don't have to worry about user
having a mobile connection and going
through a tunnel it will lose connection
but the browser will automatically
reconnect tell you with I've last heard
from you around that time and your
server can read it and just resume as if
nothing happened
another client-side you don't even have
to see those the IDS on the client-side
the same event source object will just
continue firing messages for you which
is really nice as I mentioned the the
browser will automatically retry
connecting to the server in case the
connection is closed and you can set
delay in milliseconds how much is the
browser should wait after before trying
to reconnect it can be something like
one second to be almost instant you can
make it longer if you just want the
browser to go away for example if you
have too many users coming to your
website at the same time and your web
server just cannot handle so many
connections you can tell them like go
away wait 30 seconds I cannot serve you
right now
you can name your events by by default
the source of event source object fires
message event but if you want to be
fancy and categorize your events into
different types you can before sending
data you can name your your event
anything else this way for example you
can have several components on your page
share the same event stream but each
component getting its own kind of a
message or you can just keep sending the
anonymous anonymous generic message and
as a data use JSON string and identify
what happened there in your own
application specific way from the from
the data itself as I mentioned if you're
trying to decide whether you use
WebSockets
or server sent events it's mostly about
simplicity and compatibility if you use
WebSockets you might it might be so much
hassle that you'll decide to outsource
it to a third party company that
probably happens to sponsor this meetup
but server sent events are so simple
that you can reasonably roll them out
roll them out yourself and you don't
even need library it's not like NPM
install this special thing for server
sent events if you're using nodejs it's
literally sent set the content type and
just keep sending lines of text in
nodejs you don't even have to flush the
connection it's different if you use
another programming language or some
kind of another interface that buffers
and speaking of buffering
that buffering is the most annoying
thing about service and events when you
try to deploy them so for example nginx
a server by default will try to buffer 8
kilobytes of data but if you're sending
event that is just 100 bytes of data
well it's gonna sit in the buffer
waiting for more data to be sent
eventually which is not good when you
want to want this data to reach the
browser immediately so specifically for
nginx you can send a HTTP header that
disables buffering or set a
configuration option that disables
buffering if you're using other proxy
proxy servers like HTTP proxy or
something like that check the
documentation for your proxy if if
messages are not arriving it is probably
just you to do two buffering and in
other languages like PHP you have to
call a flush function that actually
tells it to start sending data though I
really recommend using node.js because
if you're using PHP your server will
look like that so the server sent events
there is a permanent tcp/ip connection
open for every visitor of your website
so if hundreds people are visiting your
website at the same time you will have
hundreds connections and if those people
open through win three browser windows
at the same time you will have 300
connections so with something like
nodejs not a problem at all you can have
10,000 connections and they'll be
handled fine as an event queue but if
something like apache + PHP that setup
assumes the connections are short-lived
and you have a limit still like if even
if you have PHP or Ruby or something
like that that that's not designed for
permanent connections you can still use
server-sent events for your smaller
scale usage for example if you have
admin interface for your website you can
have real-time notifications real-time
updates or watching the status of your
server or new customers or whatever you
want to know do update on your website
as soon as it happens
it's just you know that will be prepare
for 20 connections not 20,000
connections still if you have problems
with overloading your servers as I
mentioned server-sent events
automatically reconnect to the server
you don't have to do anything that's a
beautiful thing you don't have to manage
errors with servers and events the
browser already does it for you it will
do its best to keep connected so you can
just tell clients to disconnect and
retry after a delay and you can keep
increasing this delay as the load on
your server increases and the printer
try new line and close connection so the
client will remember the how long to
wait the connection will be closed so
your server doesn't have to handle the
connection anymore and can serve other
clients but the client will retry after
a while and see you you know knock again
can I can we talk now so that's a very
very good way to scale beyond what it
whatever your server can handle by
default in terms of deployment the story
for surface and events is the classic
one which is all the nice browsers
support it and support it for a long
time now so you do you don't even have
to worry about the version of them they
all do even on mobile except the classic
villains
it's not supported in IE fore-edge it's
under consideration
so maybe supported maybe not the good
news is because the protocol is so so
simple and it's so similar to long
polling there are polyfills for IE and
edge that that basically work exactly as
the native API is just one library on
the client-side
that will make it work so that's it for
the server-sent events I'll add a little
bit of history for it is the whole idea
about server-sent events started on what
working group when somebody said
wouldn't it be cool to remotely control
a webpage and the origin that's why it's
event and that's why you can define your
own type of event because the original
idea was to send mouse clicks and
keystrokes to the web page the idea is
use add event source tag with a URL for
the server to remotely control what
happens on the patients and mouse click
move Mouse do this to that that remote
control idea that not really catch on
but still you can send you can send your
own events in a currently completely
native purely JavaScript API so that's
it if you want the slides there on my
site and there are questions if you
google for a server sent events polyfill
the first result on is
github with a really nice well-designed
library there's also a small polyfill
written by Remy sharp and both of them
use XML HTTP requests and can straighten
they can stream and parse the requests
on the client side so they're fully
polar filling the same API and it's just
few kilobytes so IE support is not a big
deal WebSockets is is an obvious choice
so if you need a two-way communication
for example you're implementing a
first-person shooter and need super
twitch quick upload of every keystroke
to the server then yes WebSockets is the
right choice for that a server sent
events is from the server down to the
client in real time and only that
direction so if you're implementing a
chess game then you can use servers and
events if you're implementing
first-person shooter then use WebSockets
