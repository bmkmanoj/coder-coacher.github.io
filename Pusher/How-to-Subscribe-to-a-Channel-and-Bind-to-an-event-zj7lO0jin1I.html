go up to the channel and then bind to
about events on it so in this example
we're going to subscribe to an energy
usage channel and then bind to a usage
updated event so based on the example
from the connected a video you can then
subscribe to a channel subscribe we're
going to call the energy dash usage then
we want to bind to an event on that
channel we're going to bind to usage
underscore updated and then we pass in a
handler get the usage information and
within this handler we want to do
something with the usage for the moment
we'll just create another section I will
just output the contents of the Jason so
we'll to use jQuery to get access to the
element the text to I will stringify the
Jason the object that we passed okay so
this is all very well but how do we test
them so we test in a couple of ways we
can actually call the MIT on the channel
object or we can use push your dashboard
for simplicity sake i'll use the
dashboard so if i go to app top push
around calm I'm then going to use the
talks up and
I'll use the event creator here I can
put in the channel name so if we take
this energy usage channel name placed in
there and we take the event usage
updated we pass in there and we want to
pass in some event data for the minute
we can just pass in a property hello we
evaluated world so if we go back over
here we'll see on the right hand side
that's just it connected let me put some
so some text in there we can say nothing
here yet then i can send event so my
event has been successfully sent if i go
over here we can see we've got hello
world as appear on the right side now
the actual format of the data is going
to be a bit different so I've got that
stores here so we've got quite a bit of
information in there I had a got a
payload number of devices because this
is an electric electricity usage example
each device has a name and as a usage
and we just go passing math around them
which isn't going to work I can make
that five I can make this turn I can
make this ok so I send that that's been
successfully sent and over here we've
got the Jason's appeared on the outside
so that's an example of we've already
connected we can subscribe to a channel
we can then bind to an event on that
channel and then we can display the
information or be in a not very nice way
but within the page</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
