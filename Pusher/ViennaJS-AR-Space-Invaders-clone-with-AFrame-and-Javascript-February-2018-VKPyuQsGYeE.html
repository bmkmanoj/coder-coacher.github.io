gonna be in many ways very opposite to
what you've just heard so none of the
mine facts stuff this is gonna be very
easy maybe taking you a little bit back
in time
basically my talk is about how easy it
is to use a frame which is a web VR
framework and you know get started very
quickly with with the web RIA what we
are I've started this project with with
a friend Marco Bogdanovich he's
unfortunately not here he's the true
mastermind behind this it was his idea
and he he has the most experience right
about me I'm on a day 59 of the first
round of 100 days of code so if I say
anything stupid
maybe somebody can explain to me why
everybody's laughing afterwards Marco
has quite a bit more experience I'm just
gonna get right into it so the project
was started doing a hackathon the
coderdojo hackathon which had as a as a
target
you know kids they organize courses for
children and they try to get kids
between 8 and 17 I believe to to start
coding to learn how to code through
different projects they use also some
hardware I forgot I think it's a micro
bit that they use yeah I know and that's
also coded through JavaScript and
basically for this hackathon we were all
supposed to come up with anything that
would help the kids you know get
interested in coding learn coding and so
on and so forth we we basically used a
frame which I'm gonna show actually who
is familiar with a frame all right so
this this this will be interesting for
some of you
a frame is a framework which builds on
top of 3j s and it allows web we are to
be implemented with the help of HTML
tags basically let's see so this is a
very simple this is more or less the
hello world of a frame a frame and it
would look if if you look at the
components you have some some very
simple geometric items and a plane and a
sky and it would
it has great also some great
documentation and if you look at what we
the code that we've just looked at kind
of looks like this somebody can look
around can move around in the scene and
from a very basic example like this one
can go further into something that looks
a little bit like this like this of
course if you have a Google cardboard or
any other type of device that helps you
connect your cell phone well to your
head if you will you can activate the VR
capability through this and yeah alright
so we we use this in order to develop a
very small game
I'm thinking maybe everybody can just
whip up their whip out their cell phone
and type this website in and have a look
at it directly
I think that's easiest that's the
easiest thing to do you're gonna find
yourself in space well not a nun in
space you're going to find yourself in
this room actually with
right with some okay here we go yeah I'm
hearing already some successful logins
and if you move your your cat your phone
around you should be able to pan the
camera and see some agents at some point
some alien looking objects and if you
point the cursor you're going to be able
to shoot them as well they come from
every direction right yes of course it's
early alpha right so I'm just gonna I'm
just gonna talk a little bit about how
this scene is created so you've already
seen that the the the everything is
based on HTML and every entity in this
scene is is an HTML tag the background
for example the sky that you see here is
is a simple a certain kind of picture
I'm gonna go yeah so the code would look
a little bit like this a frame requires
loading at the beginning and everything
else has to go into an a scene tag then
you have your assets in this case we
have the enemy models you have a camera
you have a cursor all the entities which
can take any shape or form you have
sounds and basically that that these
would be the resources now if you look
at how we manipulate everything else is
basically JavaScript manipulating these
these HTML tags around the only part
that I had a
major role in it was was this file which
which generates the the enemies if you
look at this you see calls to HTML tags
and afterwards a type attribute setting
oh yes sorry actually I'm just gonna
write and once the entities are are
available on screen one can add
animation to them all sorts of
properties rotation animation and so on
and so forth the the problems that we
ran in one once we started getting past
the very basic elements were for one the
model we wanted to use something a
little bit more advanced than what a
frame was offering us in terms of object
so a frame has of course cubes spheres
and so on and so forth
we wanted to use something that looks a
little bit more advanced and so we found
a model online and very quickly we
discovered that trying to shoot them
doesn't work the way it works with a
frame provided object because I think
the model probably the a frame doesn't
have an understanding of that of that
model that we imported we found it has
one Achilles heel where it did register
the mouse over but that was unplayable
so Marco came up with a very interesting
solution in my creative solution he he
added no it's actually here he added an
invisible a frame object to the to the
enemy to the enemies so which which he
created which basically the opacity the
heat turned down the opacity but they're
always there and so they can respond to
the to the mouse over of the
of the cursor that would be one problem
that we so we we kind of hacked around
then another problem that we found was
the fact that we wanted to have some
kind of a function which decreases the
player's life if the object get too
close if the enemies get too close we
however discovered that a frame creates
the the scene like a big bank so
everything that would eventually be in
the scene starts it you know coordinates
0 0 0 because the player is at 0 0 0 the
game would start with the player getting
damaged immediately
so again Marco came up with a hack where
he said check so during this explosion
when when the object got past a certain
point they would activate the check and
Wednesday the game actually started and
they started getting closer going past
that check would enable the the the
enemies to to hurt the player and that
looks a little bit like this a frame has
a this model of component which which
which are a type of function which can
be added to the entities and they can
modify the behavior of the entities and
so on and so forth then let's see one
last problem one one one thing that we
wanted to do which is what you've just
experienced was the camera input we
wanted to fake an augmented reality
experience and just simply instead of
instead of the background which you see
here and it's which is you know it's
it's fixed we wanted to have the camera
feed as the background and so so we
managed to make a call for that and it
looks a little bit like this this is 99
percent Marcos work so I'm just going to
show it and and avoid a
planing trying to explain it because I
don't understand most of it as you can
actually see here right
so that would be there will be it for
for the things that we ran into as you
probably know when when you start a
project and you don't have some kind of
deadline and an exact thing that you
have to achieve you start to think oh
how great would it be if we could add
this and this and that so we would like
to implement some levels yes some
difficulty levels and and also like a
form of storyline where the aliens start
in space then they they end up in in
basically a a city they okay master
password alright yeah this I guess I can
do it like this to show that it's very
easy to for example to change the
background let's see if there worked yes
so basically we're from space we've
ended up in in on earth because they've
advanced and now they're attacking here
and of course the third level would be
in your room where they are attacking
you right there where you are which is
what you've just experienced yes that's
that would be it for my presentation if
you have any kind of questions I'm gonna
try to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
