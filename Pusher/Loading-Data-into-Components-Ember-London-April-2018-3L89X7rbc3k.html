how we handle data without roots at IG
so why why would we want to do that
there's anyone got any ideas about why
we'd want to do that
has anyone ever loaded any data without
a root before it's okay you're in safe
hands it's fine you can admit it it's
okay okay so one anyone else yep not
over there okay so there are a few
reasons you might want to do this so at
IG our team build the front-end
dashboard for our leveraged trading
products and clients can access a
variety of financial data and then buy
or sell contracts with IG and other
traders hopefully to beat the market and
make a profit and we do our best to stay
LTS so why did we build a configurable
dashboard to our users really need to
compose their own workspace well many of
our valuable clients would like their
home office to look something like this
and for a few of them I've heard that
it's actually not that far from reality
so when we built the project when we
started building the project
configurability was a high priority for
for that project okay so let's talk
about ember them so I'd like to think
about conventional routing in amber as a
mapping of a URL to a nested series of
Russian dolls or views so this routing
system is great at mapping segments of
the URL to a UI hierarchy hopefully for
those of you familiar with embers
routing that all makes a lot of sense so
at each level we get a route with the
lifecycle hooks designed to help manage
loading data the model hook is probably
the most well known of these hooks and
you also get a template that has the
result of the root model hook passed
into its scope
and you get some conventions about how
to provide loading in our templates
great so pretty cool but what about when
we want to do this
so in our app users choose precisely
what charts and use and trading data
they want to see and they can compose
the screen how they like so there are
potentially infinite combinations of the
UI that our clients configure so it
doesn't really matter where to the URL
and unfortunately this doesn't really
make much sense we can't pass arguments
into outlets for child routes as they're
supposed to get their data based on the
URL it's a few other ways but that's the
main way okay so before you think we're
crazy for wanting to build this
flexibility in the first place I just
want to talk about when we had Eric Brin
visit our office last year he was there
to help us tune the performance of our
app so this is Eric here in the middle
posing for a photo of the team after a
heavy week of coding a bit of beer as
well so Eric was recommended by Tilda as
being great for what we needed so he
used to be a core team member has worked
with Netflix LinkedIn he also runs ember
weekly so if any of you subscribe to
that you probably know you've probably
seen some stuff that he's written and we
were really impressed with his
performance insights but that should
probably be a topic for another talk so
early in Eric's visit I remember him
saying that our app was probably the
most ambitious app that he'd seen and I
was feeling pretty chuffed about that
until later in the week his phrase had
changed just a little bit and it's just
a little bit but yeah it does make a
difference but truthfully you felt that
the app
felt more like an OS and thought there
should be more patterns available to
support this paradigm in ember yeah so
let's get back to the problem and go
back and tie
three and a bit years ago when we
started working on the app so what can
we do
option one just don't do it don't don't
do it we using ember use routes it's
fine
these guys convinced us that we needed a
better option than that so option two
load everything in the workspace route
that's what we call those dashboards
it's our workspace clients can have lots
of those and whilst we considered this
we prefer to isolate the various data
for the panels in case we wanted to use
them in another way also to prevent kind
of a monolith emerging that might be
tough to work with big team option three
so right components that handle their
own data when we started writing the app
this is what we did and it's probably
worth noticing at this point that we
aren't using ember data this is probably
mainly to do with I was wanting to keep
a lot of our core business logic in a
framework agnostic library because we
were sharing that with another app at
the time ok so this is a bit small you
don't really need to see the details but
this is kind of what a component looks
like when it takes care of its own data
it's injecting a store and loading the
data and setting a property on itself
you can probably imagine what the
template looks like it's handling
loading it's Hara handling and arrow
states and this is kind of before we
even get to any of the stuff that this
view should actually be taking care of
and you've got even more complex when we
started support features like sorting in
our tables so we you can see here where
the store we're doing this get only
lookup this is to get an instance of a
store which has injected the actual
store behind it so that we could keep
kind of like a view model in place and
it was implemented as an array proxy we
were really keen not to mutate the
underlying data and that's kind of
we did it so that you can have this not
so this concern didn't have to happen in
the component but also didn't have to
mutate the underlying data this approach
also meant we had to clean up view
stores when components were destroyed so
this got really messy you can feel a bit
of anger towards that approach from
probably those guys they're smiling but
they're yeah they're angry so we want a
better way to isolate the concerns
without wiring up too much magic behind
the scenes it was hard to teach and also
just made testing really complicated
because you got to setup all the data in
every single test so in the meantime a
few newer concepts were getting popular
a number so tagless components that you
use declarative component structures
without impacting markup of your your UI
structure which is pretty cool yielding
block programs so components could now
expose data to the markup and components
passed it into the block which is very
cool so these new features were what we
needed for a new style of data component
that we called data loaders so here we
have a data loader that loads a list of
markets and exposes it to its block the
inner block doesn't have to worry about
loading and arrow states and this
because this is just all taken care of
in the data loader zone template just
leave that there for a second
cool so roots back to roots roots are
really good at providing conventions for
loading and arrow states and they
provide a few lifecycle hooks for
managing loading of data so we to
abstract Adar mechanisms into a base
class that we could extend for our
actual data loaders we didn't want to
have to write this code over and over
again for each of these data loaders and
loosely again don't worry about the
detail too much but this is roughly what
it ended up looking like it provided all
those things that we expect from from
roots so our current version is okay
it's well tested and it isolates the
concerns nicely things like loading
lists subscribing to live updates for
prices and submitting forms but it's not
that ergonomic and it's not exposed as a
public add-on with usage guides
everything that you'd expect so as a big
company benefiting from ember it feels
right to contribute back maybe and you
know providing these sorts of libraries
is maybe a good way to tell the
community what you're doing in your
company maybe generate a bit of interest
so unfortunately we have had some epic
open source fails in the past like we
had Istanbul providing code coverage
back when ember CLI blanket didn't play
nicely with Babel quite a while ago
however we got caught up in building our
app and didn't publish it and around
half a year later it was someone else
who made this awesome tool available to
the community kind of similar story with
ember preloader something we developed
around a year ago we we had an attempt
at trying to make it available but for
one reason or another we just didn't
really make a very good job of that
so perhaps loading data for scenarios
that routes don't cover like dashboards
is something that we can help with
that was the drum a little bit I miss
the drumroll
Amba datablock cool so it's a new
implementation of the data loader
pattern very very new as in like when
will tricked me to do this talk the
other day since then it's been created
so the main difference with this is it
tries to basically if you know how to
use routes you should know already how
to use ember data blocks that's the
theory so now I've got to do a demo to
try and explain how that works cool ok
so here you can see four examples where
we're using it in slightly different
ways just to kind of give you a feel for
all the the common use cases that you
might have for your routes and how we're
handling it with an implementation on
top of the amber data block so person
data is the thing that we're honing
around here and you can see in the first
example very very simple person data if
we go to see what the code looks like
inside that basically for the most part
we're just implementing a model hook is
returning a promise which is quite nice
I've got something going on down there
just so that we can kind of imitate an
error state as well for a later example
if the ID isn't one that's going to
return an error but that's not really
what's important here what's important
is that it should feel a bit like a root
you can model hook return some data cool
so let's just see it in action and if I
hit refresh it's the top one you're
looking at so that set timeout was
around three seconds so for three
seconds we just get blank that could be
whilst the app is going to get some data
from the server and then it just
displays the template so very simple in
the second example we've got a loading
spinner so just passing in a string here
but that could be a component because
it's really just using the component
helper under the hood so you could set
up the component with your own arguments
if you wanted to again very simple it's
not exactly the same as routes because
in routes you would put that in a folder
somewhere but it's still I hope quite a
simple way of just saying this is the
loading template or component in this
case that I want to use and you can see
that as we load the page you get your
nice loading spinner and then it comes
up with a template very exciting
template lots of work went into that
okay so third example again quite
similar we're just providing the the
error component here and as I mentioned
before we've got ID equals two which is
going to kind of trick this into failing
so in this case there's no loading
spinner no loading template and it just
comes up with the the template in the in
the error component okay so there's one
slightly more interesting example here
so in routes you can do this thing where
you return an object straight away and
then if that were to be like an object
promise proxy you could do something
clever kind of like Amber data where you
then fill in the values after you've
given it back what this means is that
you can build that UI straight away
before you've actually loaded the data
maybe you want to show someone the form
before you've got the data to support
the form and then you kind of want to
make that active when you actually get
the data so this is what this is going
to do in a very simple set scenario so
here I haven't got any data at the
beginning and then when I get the data
it fills in you could imagine that might
enable the form when it gets the data
from the server so it's all quite simple
stuff but the idea here is it's not
original necessarily but the idea is to
stay as close as we can to the API and
the features you would expect of routes
rather than doing something very
different like
so if you'd like to help us build out a
great primitive for loading data outside
of routes then please do get involved if
you are loading data outside of routes
already found out some of you are then
I'd like to hear about your use case see
if this would work or or whether
something else would be better so I'll
just quickly mention other things to
consider so this has been a story of
what we tried and what worked in the end
for us browsing and bradon's comm there
were a few other things like it but I
didn't find anything that tried to mimic
the route API quite as closely as this
attempt to so there might be interesting
Amba concurrency so every concurrency
makes a lot of this easier to work with
but I still believe in a good data block
primitive and that that's useful and
removing the loading logic from view
component so I just think it's a good
thing so the other one the monolithic
route it would perhaps solve the problem
for if you have quite simple widgets in
your dashboard but complex widgets would
like staged loading of their own and
kind of alternate display states that
could get a bit messy trying to manage
that in just one place in your app and
then of course engines which kind of
allow for better splitting of our cloud
base maybe and we're actually hoping to
investigate this soon to see if it's a
good fit for our app however our current
understanding is that it would still it
wouldn't help much in adding structure
to the loading of the data in a
dashboard style app so I think we need
to investigate that a bit more cool so
that's all just want to say thanks to
the team for helping on these solutions
the difficult problems and thanks for
will for tricking me into doing this
over breakfast last Friday and yeah
thanks if you've got any questions come
and have a chat near tool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
