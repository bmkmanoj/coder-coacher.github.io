I'm working as a full-stack developer
for BearingPoint
for the last 10 half years a big project
for a big railroad company I'm not about
to say which one I can just say it's not
less fun and thanks for staying so long
and for heaven here and I hope you will
find it interesting so my topic today is
introduction to an angular animations
animations which all know allow us to
engage with our users call it angel
various need so when some new elements
come to the screen we can a nicely fade
them in or slide I mean so to call
intention where is needed and there make
our application more fun to use for our
users and for us the program of course I
had some projects where I developed only
web services for a few months and it was
boring painful etc and when I finally
got to program some user interfaces I
was so happy that I could use some young
animations I see look at the jump etc so
also for us as developers it's fun to
see something moving on the screen we
have several ways how we can introduce
animations to our applications simple
way is using css3
but it's good only for simple effects
for we use it by adding or removing
classes so for simple fade in fade out
and the bounces they are ok but for more
complicated use cases we have to use
something more powerful in your
animations uses web animations which
allows for fine grained animation
controls so we have much more power how
our animations be able to work out and
how they our applications look ankle
animations use web animations in
foundation with the angularjs they still
use the css3 animations I think and now
they are using
animations they are supported in all
modern browsers and there is a polyfill
available for others and modern idea I
mean Firefox and Chrome can I use web
animations two of them are green and
also the end angle anyway thousand opera
if there are so are there any opera
users I have it on my mobile it has a
great head water and some new animations
use animation DSL using the state's
transitions and transformations to
achieve our desired effects and from
version 4.2 there are some new features
like router animations animation
parameters we can pass some values to
our animations and make them reusable
and pack them in their own files
animation scrubbing something which is
not at all possible it css3 which means
to have a slider and to finally control
which frame will be displayed and to
play for up a record etc I have to say
most tutorials that I found looked like
this
but by angular animations they have
quite a good guide it's a bit outdated
it's for version 2 or something but you
can get up and running using only this
first link and guide animations and for
the rest there is a great blog by Matias
in Mela or whatever it's pronounced and
he is the core developer on animation
since angular 1 actually and best source
for all things animations related he is
also great conference speaker so you can
check out some of these talks at youtube
if you have some spare time this would
be a minimal example of what we need to
have something animated of on our page
the first is to add angular animations
dependencies to our package adjacent
usually forget this and then I wonder if
I have some errors so first step
add the angle animations to dependencies
to npm install afterwards and then we
also have to import browser animations
module to in our application module
which will use animations and then we
can actually add animations to our
components for animations we have a few
steps or concepts we have this add
animation trigger which is connected to
animation trigger in the component cells
and animation state which controls in
which state is our animated component so
is it displayed not displayed is
bouncing or whatever we use and in our
component we have a few more lines so
first we have to import import all
animation elements that we want to use
define this in animations array on our
component decorator which what will be
our trigger and then underneath can we
can define all possible state
transitions animations etc what do we
need so in this example I have my
animation trigger it
only two states when something is
enacted it has a style of opacity zero
so it should not be displayed and then
it's active
it has opacity of one and when we do a
transition between inactive and active
we will animate it during one half
seconds yes there there are all possible
ease-in ease-out is which is a
combination of ease-in and ease-out also
bezier function you can define all
different properties there are very
there are many our example set this year
of more block yes the name of the
chicken so animation trigger is is bound
to this time and this is the state
variable it has to be a string variable
on our component we can also use a
getter but it has to return a string if
it's boolean it won't work there are
some examples which only call which may
get her to convert between string and
balloons but it's simple just to use
control variable which is string on our
component and in toggling we just set
our control variable to whichever state
you want and angular does it's magic and
animates everything any more questions
somebody said three slides already
talking for sponsors I guess somewhere
so now I should do a demo I wanted to do
a live coding session and created a new
empty CLI project that it sent away and
died let's see if it's working
host okay it's a more advanced example I
will show you later I know I was right
now behold made you dangle thank you I
never have this reaction let's just now
make a new component I first have to
find this thing
tighten up this so let's create a new
component to do our wonderful example I
think I have a console somewhere hot
area ng generate a component house we
call this live demo what so I and
reserved now I should have also a new
component there live demo and it created
some files for me component component
component so let's check if I have my
dependencies right I tend to forget it
in package a Sonicare my angular
animations so : good in my application
module I also have my browser animations
module shorts okay and now what do we do
No
so light no more like wedding
yep live demo did not mention a Thomas
why well demo component is there a sure
okay let's go it away let's do it
component and add our live demo
component to my routine huh it should be
my third example about my second live
demo component live demo component to
save and
oh it is a life okay let us now do some
live coding
don't pretend you never had this that's
work so let's try to do that retry
showed a few seconds ago so div it has
to make did it is happy and let's make a
some contact the let's say my animation
my animation is my anak state and let's
say it works as I said another button
just a button which will do something
hopefully do something if it does
something I'm happy I'm not very I don't
have very many requests so that's the
way click Handler and say run animation
okay so far so good
I also tend to forget to save my files
in visual studio because I use IntelliJ
or something like that so if I forget it
please tell me so I need my own state in
my component and let's say that it is in
active inactive okay
here we will just calculate it this my
annum state is active let's now define
some animations so as I already said we
have animations which is an i1 array and
this array we can use some triggers so
we have to import all this stuff from
animations we import things from angular
animations totally already offered it so
I don't need it
I need a trigger I will also need
animate and what was probably a style
and a state for now so let's see if it
works I will have a trigger with the
following property so my animation and
an array of things we can define our
transition directly with inline States
or we can define our States which we
will use in the final transitions step
the difference between inline States and
predefined States is when you predefined
state and your variable space in this
state then this applied end step of
animation stays there so if you use
United States then it does form
animation then jumps where it should be
at the beginning I'll show it in a
example later so we have this trigger
and we will define some States one state
we named inactive and
with style let's say opacity zero and
the same with opacity one but we will
call it surprisingly active and now we
can define our transitions captain
transition we have an transition between
state inactive to active and we want to
do something we just animate it and say
1010 Piron people see oh it works it
doesn't work okay in active active
animated style my annum state is
inactive it's okay and here we have my
own in states with my animation handler
what did I do wrong
drunk now does it by automatic opacity
Zuria automatic ah maybe there isn't
there are no bubbles there so it's
safety huh it's wrong
huh I just saved the father do something
why it works
so it looks easy but it's not that easy
to set everything up and sometimes it
will not work when you will at the end
see today I spent about half an hour and
so at the end I did there an active -
Enoch inactive and my component is was
in active states all along and it said
sign just says this is an animation so
it's a anythi has to be the same as this
one in air controller and I also forgot
to forgot to say so it will be picked up
by the compiler and compiled in the best
most performant JavaScript maintained
ever seen so it was a promise from
Mangalore creators
poor Anisha I think so the directives I
was just components with so if we wanted
to use something simple like five events
one animation start on the nation end we
have something like these event handlers
so at my animation start and we can do
do something and we'll start let's see
and also my animation and and we can
check these events and if we need more
fine-grained approach then we can use
this new feature animation builder which
gives us complete control of animations
but it's only available from version 4.2
I think that this start and end events
sent a handle to animation let's check
it I'd haven't tried it but I think I
saw something like this and we will now
make a handle start and say a animation
start it and just output our event which
we got saved yes rebuilt yet okay
refresh
probably you have multi-monitor setup at
home and it's a bit cumbersome okay yeah
animation started then we get some
element and from state phase name etc so
this is animation can seems like it any
more questions yes actually I made the
proof-of-concept project a few months
ago and did some extensive SVG animating
and it was a lot of fun I got some
problems like with the changing scale it
doesn't scale only the size but also X
and epsilon coordinates from whatever
reason and then I have some bubble and
it jumped all over the screen and then
grew so then when you will do some
simple scaling Gong so of course you
have to use a translation too so to keep
it in place but it grows some tricks but
it works with SVG two more questions
then let's go on with next slide so I
already explained what states are and
they are in normal use case string
values which are tied to our class
properties and there are also a few
special states like void
and the star avoid means nothingness
when our elements are created then they
are they have void state and they come
in from other state and the star is
every state so we can define animations
which are fired by transition between
any two states using that transitions we
can use predefined States which I showed
so we can define our state's up front
induce transitions and in this case our
elements will have the properties after
animation has ended they will keep those
properties and with in mind transitions
those properties will return to their
initial state and there are also two
special transitions on enter and only if
which are aliases for entering from void
and destroying this component now a few
words about angular for to new features
so we have a possibility to send options
or input items to our animations so to
parameterize them to export our
animations and use them in some other
components so to reuse animations which
we are created
Kurian stager clearly is according to
matias the best thing that happened to
animation since the beginning of angular
which allows us to query for all the all
children who for some element and check
their animations inside their animations
etc and stager which allows us to add
some delay between animating different
elements sub animations using enemy
child the routing animations it was also
possible in all their versions of
angular with small hex and also
programmatic animations with animation
builder now a few words about each of
them I wanted to make some nice examples
but got carried away with building
animations in my project so at the end
I couldn't prepare it as good as I
wanted but I took some animations
shameless is stolen them from here of
moo block and here we can see how we
define the options for animation so we
can send as many options as we want and
then use them with using the already
known mustache or double bracket
notation in our animations animation we
use using animation or use animation so
we define some animations use export and
then using use animation keyboard we can
import them in some other components and
then reuse them in so it's grazing
Korean stagger week when we have some
element with children let's show this
actually it's quite cool
we can then animate children separately
what did I do
I took the template I'll just throw it
in our template and see what happens
copy and let's also do the component
sink damper and pepper if I do something
wrong please collect correct me
animations ha thank you very much
you are good
okay and well let's add another
animation trigger it should be around
here somewhere not this one animation so
around here no good is gone let's add
query and Steger use it to cope I'll
ship it what am I missing here I need my
list of course I prepared it so I don't
have this wonderful list with items so I
don't have to type all of this and so
let's see what happens
compiles perfect something's wrong
it is my last example I'm not allowed to
see that I'm shining it seems ah like
damn thank you that's cold i refresh
does the Refresh of fruit also it's so
simple to animate items in our lists
let's now go back to the code so what
did I do here I created a simple list
with the parent element in which I
defined this animation list animation
with items length as property and in a
component itself there is some magic so
at first each element is translated a
hundred percent off screen and then
animated during one second on screen and
this stager says give me 200
milliseconds between elements and it
flow questions
it's also possible to use redefine yeah
to define sub animations you're using
animate child so in this left case we
have a animation child animation to it
and then anim repent bins like in real
world and child animation is not cold at
all and in versions newer then 4.2 we
can define this create child animate
child syntax which will also execute our
child animations there is also a
possibility to add routing animations
using this route animation prepare route
state and giving the data which tells in
which route are we right now and then
defines from transition between pages so
we can use some nice light life slide
right etc whatever we want it works very
nicely there was also a possibility to
do something like this in Prior versions
of angular I gave that example I will
show it a bit later and also
programmatic animations using animation
builder we just include the animation
builder in our constructor and then can
use builder build to build animations
and then have access to player and then
we can switch between frames backward
forward and do whatever we want
questions and now let's go on other demo
so I prepared this other demo
you already saw it so behold you have
username and password and if we enter
wrong username password and it says and
it is read for a second
let's show cause for that so it is in my
login component and the elements are
already known I have my bubble animation
and on trouble done I set it back to
inactive and here I just translate this
button left and right two times that's
it actually
now let's do a login and see what else
do we have user password is one two
three four five six
it's the most secure password the
statistics say that most you people in
the world use it so it must be secure so
this is an example of switching routes
and animation so this is first well this
is second route and I can show you in
code how it is implemented in my
application module so each of my
components defines this host route of
transition and animation router
transition and inside I defined this
trans transitions between components so
on enter it translates from left on
screen and to an exit it does the
opposite and actually that was it
and in my second I prepared another
application yesterday there was a
question which is better reactor angular
yep and so you can here see here I use
this inline version of animations so
angular drops back it doesn't stay in
this big state any questions that was
all for today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
