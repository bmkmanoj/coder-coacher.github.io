learning how to ride and it is an
introduction to psychology s which is
very nice very nice framework so show
hands how many of you have heard about
psycho years Jay s before oh okay it's
better than I expected
nice nice nice so it's a framework it's
similar to for example frameworks like
you would expect like angular or reactor
those kind of things which I'm hoping
you're going to be familiar with oh it's
different in many ways as well so we're
gonna go over some of those differences
so brief index introduction so how it
looks what the code looks like then
because functional and reactive
programming are a huge part of
psychology is I'm going to spend the
bulk of the presentation going over the
reactive concepts that you will need in
psychology especially framework called
rxjs which is quite cool and it's like
the building blocks of psycho and then
I'm gonna go over the good the bad and
the beautiful psycho Jas I'm not here to
preach you to start using it and leave
all other things behind I myself have
been using reacts for quite a while now
and I love it I love this as well so
it's just getting you guys giving you
guys a test taste of what it is and
hopefully encourage you to try it out
because it's quite cool so what is it
what does it look like why should you
care so in the words of the Creator
called andreas touts psycho Jas is a
functional and reactive JavaScript
framework for cleaner code cleaner code
being the key word there it removes
everything that you don't need
functional reactive simple concise
extensible very testable which is good
thing for those of you who another unit
testing which you all should be doing by
the way
explain
sit data flows so like you can trace how
the items are coming into the
application and out of its compostable
so you can build smaller components that
then make a bigger components that then
make up huge components and it's pretty
cool as well
that last one was mine everything else
came from the website so brief
expectations setting this is an
introduction to cycle dot J's it's
learning how to write you can go and do
that by yourself so I wish I knew how to
do that and wish I could teach you but
for now we're gonna stick with the
basics so to talk about psycho jjs is to
talk about the interaction between
humans and computers so the guy who
created this framework likes to like to
think a lot you know like likes to feel
a bit philosophical about things so he
talks about human-computer interaction
how humans and computers communicates in
a cycle and the humans outputs ie
clicking on the mouse or something are
the computers inputs and then the
computers outputs displaying something
on the screen playing a sound or
something are they human simple through
the senses so he was thinking about this
and he said I'm a programmer right so I
can write this as a couple of functions
one called computer that takes inputs
and returns outputs and another human
and the outputs of the computer function
going so the human function is inputs
and vice versa so this is quite cool but
those of you who look at this for a
minute can probably tell that we have
like a weird recurrence problem here
right like how can I call a function
that needs another function that depends
on the first function to run and that's
pretty much what psycho J is solves so
psycho J s takes this like architecture
of a psycho with sources that are inputs
into the program those magic with it
which is what you program of course and
then it releases syncs which are the
outputs that then get translated using
drivers into Dom element
into HTTP requests or other side effects
so what can I do for you in a nutshell
so psycho Jas is simply an architecture
for building reactive weather
applications a set of ideas about how to
structure an app using rxjs so it's no
something like reactor jquery or angular
that it gives you like a huge tool set
and it's a massive library and it has
ways of coding it's more about it's a
different way to think about your code
and to structure it and to help you out
it provides some very useful libraries
like I told you about the kind of like
recurrence problem before there's like
psycho core which is like something that
you import by am node which so solve
problems but it's mostly a way of
thinking about things so have a look
about brief example if you go to the
site woops smaller than I wants it to be
so it's this example right it's like
it's a box where you can type anything
in time like London is hello London so
it's literally like a hello world hello
world unlike steroids or something so
that's the psycho program behind it I
want you guys to see what the actual
code looks like before I kick off so at
the top you've got your inputs again
cycle core is the main thing and then
you also imports all your Dom elements
from the cycle Dom driver then you've
got a function called main that takes in
sources and return syncs and this is
where all the magic happens it's a pure
function so given one inputs one same
inputs it will always which are in the
same output for that given input so that
makes it very success then at the very
bottom we've got the cycle the run
function which is the one that solves
the Umrah currency problem and it just
connects it so like your actual like app
live in your HTML in a similar way to
what react throws for example you write
your code
to render with Dom elements inside the
name function it's similar to JSX in a
way that it's a virtual Dom so it once
actually writes HTML code out to your
HTML file it will just kind of like
pretend there exists an element there
and similar to reiax it also those like
differences so when something changes
it doesn't rerender everything it just
rear Enders the parts that change which
makes it quite you know fast and
performant and that kind of thing so you
taking an input as a stream you map it
and then the variable that goes into
your map then gets printed out below and
that's like kind of like where the cycle
happens gonna go over this in more
detail later don't worry if you don't
understand it fully now I just wanted to
show you how the code looks like before
we start now functional programming
scary word for some beautiful word for
others who here has done some kind of
functional programming before ok great
great great so for the benefit of those
who haven't done it before or who forgot
it a little bit's gonna give a very
quick example of what functional
programming entails go cycle is very
very functional so imagine you've got a
robot nanny and you've got your children
right that's inari and the Blaine
Charles ABC couldn't think of anything
else and you wants the nanny to call
them respectfully master and me mustard
playing master Charles and you want to
do a program that when you log a
variable called family I'll print that
out so the not so functional way would
be using our friend a for loop so this
is like a dump robot nanny that needs to
get told everything it's like the
imperative programming paradigm you know
it's like ok you're a dumb Robo I need
to explain how things work how it works
let an are a call family be MC then go
ahead and count my children and take a
counter in one of your hands and then
put a mark every time you run through
this and then for every child as long as
you still have children left in your
counter go again on a pen master to the
beginning and then add that to the file
you created in the beginning so I mean
it works but you
telling her how to do every single thing
and the functional way is a smart robots
you trust that she will know how to do
it if you just tell her what you need
her to do so you do not specify how are
you gonna go about counting it and it's
racing over it you just say I want a
constant cool family you're gonna take
my children you're gonna map them and
for each item in the children RA you're
just gonna append master to them so this
is the psycho Jas way it's a functional
way right and the benefit is that it's
way more readable it's less lines again
makes your code concise but it's also
way easier for other people to
understand it to extend this and part of
the magic of it is that operators like
map you can chain them right you can
chain many many many operators and
that's kind of how the main function in
psycho Jas works so if we go back to the
example I showed you before your this is
unobservable which we're gonna look into
a bit later you map it and then you say
start with an empty string and then you
map it again and all of those operators
are functional right so it's easy to
other no the one in between it's easy to
move them around without messing up your
code as if you had a for loop for
example so that's quite cool plus again
because we're using pure functions
whenever you have the same input you're
gonna get the same output so not only is
it extendable and easy to read it's also
quite testable um so yeah happy robot
now the other big big paradigm that
psycho J is depends on even more so than
functional programming is reactive
programming and reactive programming is
a term that has been floating around for
a few years but it confuses people
sometimes because like take react j is
like the big framework that facebook
creates that some of us know and love
that's not really reactive programming
but it's call react so it may get a bit
confusing so reactive programming is
something pretty cool and programming
reactively is the main
Avia I mean architecture behind psycho
Jas so let me give you an example
because it's easier to show them to just
tell you about it so a nonreactive way
of building a button that prints hello
when you click on it is you have a
function that prints hello you have a
button and the button has an on click
events that's a spring hello
so who those this I do this a lot I'm
guessing many of you do you do this law
and it works because like you know
pretty low is that pretty low but then
what happens if say you change the name
of print hello to be right hello well
cold breaks right because you need to
update your button because your bots are
no longer know so I print hello is and
not only will it not prints anything
it's will throw an error and the grumpy
cats as well I mean you can then change
it back to write hello update it and
it's so fine again but then what happens
if a few months down the line your
requirements change or something and you
end up deleting the function again not
only will the pot to not spring hello
because that may be the intense but it
also breaks the code because it's still
there it's still part of the button
grumpy cat again so what's the reactive
way of doing this if we think about a
reactive approach to do this we have the
same button pretty much the same
function but the difference is that the
button doesn't really care about the
function at all there's no unclick call
there's no nothing
it doesn't need to know it's only
concerned with the view with rendering
how the button looks like and what's
according to psycho J is that's exactly
how programs should be things that are
concerned with the view should not be
concerned with anything else because
regardless of what you do up here it's
still gonna work and then on the
function we've called an events listener
which says I am going to stay there
listening to this particular button and
whenever someone clicks on that button
I'm listening and I know and when I see
that then I'm gonna do some magic and
print hello and if I were to change the
name of this right yellow print hello
right hello nothing happens no
grumpy cats because the person doesn't
know about this it still works as long
as you call it again if I get rid of the
function yeah I mean it won't print
anything of course but it doesn't break
that code because the button is separate
from the function so that's the main
idea behind reactive programming it's
making your functions react to events
that they're listening in to rather than
making your buttons and your HTTP
requests and all other parts of the
application call your functions so you
might have seen AI roads add
eventlistener which is like an ECE
JavaScript way of doing things but it's
not the best way of listening to events
so psycho Jas uses a very cool library
called rxjs to listen to events rxjs is
have you guys heard of rxjs before okay
I see a few notes about mostly confused
faces so basically a group of very very
smart people got together one day and
said hey we need to make programming
languages more reactive because I mean
there's many programming languages out
there but not many of them address the
reactive programming elements as well as
they should so they got together they
create a library for composing a
synchronous and event based programs
using observable sequences a synchronous
big scary world worth so it means just
running different things at the same
time which the experience of you may
know it's hell because you know one
thing may depend on another thing and if
it hasn't finished it may throw an error
or do something weird with your code so
they create observables right which
we're gonna go into more detail in a
minute but I'm not server Bo it's just
like a stream of events and each a
synchronous stream is an observable so
you listen to them and again rxjs is
just like one of many rx libraries for
many other like exciting languages like
Scala and Python and other slightly more
questionable languages like Java and C++
but yeah so it is something very cool
for dealing with us
and again observables are them it's the
core of rxjs
and it's also the building blocks of
psycho jeaious everything in psycho Jas
is unobservable you think about things
as observables because observables are
things you can listen to and react again
they're lace event streams which can
emits one or more events and may or may
not finish so if we draw a line through
time I just drew like green bubbles as
events and that stream of various events
at different points in time
that's an observable and why like why
even bother with this well main reason
is there's simple and very nice
operations like we saw before like maps
like reduce functions like the sort of
thing that you guys familiar with
programming with functional programming
would do with Erics for example with
objects or with other collections
well rxjs lets you use those of
cooperations with the strings which is
it's quite cool so I can I'm gonna give
you an example let's say you've got a
program and this is like literally a
real psycho joyous markup you got a
check box a blow check box that says off
and when you click on it it's gonna say
orden it's a light switch yay
so if you go about programming this in
cycle Jas you would start by thinking
okay my check box is going to create a
string of check box events and every
time I use for clicks on it it's gonna
throw either a checks or an unchecked
events so that's this it's sources the
bomb is one of the helper things that
psycho chase gives you it's just a way
of targeting Dom elements I'm gonna
select inputs which have an events I
change event so whenever any input
changes its gonna come into this here
observable then I'm gonna run operations
with it to create my program so let's
let's dissect this a bit more again
the string is empty to begin with
because nobody's clicked on anything
before because I Provident the program
doesn't even exist yet but the program
says I'm gonna listen to all inputs who
change then I'm gonna map that's because
I only care about events that are
checkboxes right so I'm gonna map each
of these events and I'm gonna return
whether the target is checked or not
because I only care about whether it's
checked or no I want to see a true or
false I don't care about the position of
the checkbox in in the page or anything
else and then I'm gonna say I'm gonna
start with false because if we don't
give it an initial value it's not gonna
render anything and then I'm gonna map
again those events that are either true
or false I'm gonna pass them in as
toggle that's like my variable name I
choose to use and I'm gonna render a div
that has the inputs of type checkbooks
and a paragraph that's either toggled or
knots so concede begins with false it's
not toggles it will display off then
user comes in clicks on the checkbox
what happens well an event comes into
your stream you listen to it and the map
runs it's kind of like wait things are
on patiently and when you cease and even
come in it runs it's checked it's true
now so let's display on Nolan comes in
it's off now turns off and so on so
you're just like it's a program that's
just very actively listening to two
events and when they come reacts and
prints out Dom elements so that's that's
the basics of it it's all about
dissecting your program dissecting your
requirements and saying hey how can I
think of all of this as events what can
I observe oh I'm gonna serve the
checkbox I'm gonna observe an HTTP
request I'm gonna observe users inputs
and then it's just about knowing which
operations to run with it and that's
that's pretty much the basics of it now
if we have a look at this which is like
what actually renders a thing guess
what's for those of you who know reacts
it works with JSX as well so it's go
right so like I'm very familiar with JSX
because I've been working with it for
months I'm quite familiar with us
sex that creator decided to go for this
as defaults cuz you know JSX kind of
adds like only that like tags that look
like HTML and stuff and see he said nah
let's just let's just get rid of that
make it a bit simpler but yeah you're
you're one npm install away from being
able to use JSX so it's it's quite cool
as well so so going back to what I said
at the beginning psycho JIS is simply an
architecture for building apps it's a
set of ideas about how you should
structure them using rxjs so again it
says okay the guy who invented it said
okay I really want a program
functionally and reactively but I'm
running in so many troubles so I'm gonna
create a framework that addresses that
and that's pretty much it so again the
simplicity of it is you say what can I
observe what do I need to see happen in
my dome or by the user or from the
backend to react to and once you get
your list of observables it's just about
chaining to three maybe four operations
to them and much happens and all those
operations were again created by the
Eric's j/s folk and they're quite
powerful so our average psycho JS
function will probably only need two
three maybe four operations change
together rather than like having a
massive list of hundreds of like for
loops and if conditions and stuff like
that so it makes it quite simple in the
end so let's now move into the good the
bad and the beautiful of using psycho
j/s in my opinion of course so let's
start with a good because you know
positive no it's very easily testable as
I've said before spear functions so
there's nothing that you can test more
easily than a pure function like I've
literally literally broken my head so
many times before in my projects trying
to test a react components we're trying
to mock it render it into the virtual
and then see if I can mock a click event
and observe for a class name change or
something here it's just okay it's so
pure function so if I put this in I
expect to get this out does it work or
does it not work so for those of you who
like to do test-driven development quite
cool it's very lightweight so again
because it's more of a set of ideas
rather than a huge library cycle core
which is the one that gets rid of the
little circulatory problem that's pretty
much the only thing you need other than
the driver cycle coy is about a hundred
lines long like if you compare that with
massive libraries like perhaps reacts
angular even like jQuery and those like
things of the past it's crossing down
your load sign right when I usually
loads the page it's gonna be way faster
and also when they click on something
because it doesn't need to go through a
massive library or just functions a bit
better and this also way way less
intrusive than having to deal with a
completely different system or set of
functions that come from the library
because you're not inheriting much you
can still write pretty much about Nilay
Jes just like hype it up to the next
level
it's compostable which is a word that my
software wasn't really happy about it
gave me a red squiggly line but it
basically means you can trade components
out of it like everything in psycho j/s
is the components even your whole lab is
a component that you can put your whole
app instead of bigger app and it'll work
because again it's all pure functions
it's all pure functions so you can nest
them together you can s many components
it's at a bigger one and then if you
want to create an page where you display
all of your apps you can do it as well
so it's quite cool and keeps your code
short as well you know like you want
your components to be small you don't
want a file that's gonna be over 200
lines of code or anything you want to
keep many separate components to make it
extensible and something I don't really
have the time to go over today
but it's worth a look is the recommend
that kind of like architecture for cycle
Jas is called mvi that's similar to MVC
for those of you who know MVC from like
object-oriented programming it's just
called Model View intents and it's just
a very nice way
that's very simple to use in psycho j/s
of separating your view concerns your
model concerns and your intense so each
of those will be assets of your
functions again there are very easy to
think about very easy to understand and
very easy to put together into an
application so what am I not telling you
what I haven't I told you that the bad
thing so it's not I don't really see
them as like uber like bad things about
psycho Jas it's more like drawbacks you
know it's like paradigm shape for
example because you need to think about
programs reactively probably the most
difficult thing to adopt psycho J's is
if there's no funky syntax you need to
learn or anything it's just about kind
of like rewiring your brain to think of
things reactively think about
observables rather than trying to like
put a function inside a button as we all
do sometimes but that's not I mean
obviously it's a different architecture
it's not really a drawback of psycho J's
but it's definitely a hurdle you need to
jump before you start with it there's a
smallish community I mean when you
compare it with the likes of react from
angular it's obviously gonna be way
smaller than that like pretty much all
like respectable JavaScript people today
I think have at least heard of react and
angular and they haven't heard of psycho
yet not all of them but again let's make
it bigger you know the only way that
community is gonna grow the only way
we're gonna address this drawback is by
you know actively making the community
bigger and it's worth saying as well
even though it is not a huge community
it is a very active one so I'm gonna
tell you about this bit later so and
again it's it's not a huge name so like
there may not yet be any like a lot of
tailored npm install packages for
example there are quite a few and there
are enough to get you started but you
won't find the same number as you would
for a larger library but again as like
community gets bigger as people like you
guys start hearing about they start
using it it's all gonna get bigger right
so it's it's it's like I like us
I really like the bigger the community
gets the better the situation gets so
the bigger that communicates again just
to finish up with a few beautiful points
it's like like all the varieties it's
quite sexy right it's it's Kleenex
accents again the aim is for you to not
write any unnecessary words whatsoever
like a pack or so it's quite cool again
smaller pages shorter load times more
performant applications and it's pretty
powerful so yeah that's pretty much it
so again going back to expectations
setting hopefully you have enough to
start to write now now it's just up to
you to take it to the next level and to
do that I'm just gonna leave that up for
a few minutes while I answer questions
they're just like a curated list of very
nice things where you can get more
resources main page inside tons of links
the reactive X page that's quite good as
well that's like people who created our
exchanges and that one is it's a secure
its project and it literally the tagline
is a collection of for some psycho J's
tools resources and shiny things so tons
of links in there to examples to
libraries to packages and got an hour
and 37 minutes there's a very good
course that I created made to teach you
how to use it so couldn't leave that up
there and other than that thank you very
much I hope you enjoyed this I hope I've
inspired you to at least give it a try
and I will take all questions now
