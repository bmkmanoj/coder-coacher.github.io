Czech Republic going through several
countries I'm software developer in
corporate companies in bigger companies
right now in Vienna let's talk and I
have prepared some talk about typescript
some motivation around typescript is
there was like jQuery think at the
beginning it was like big boom it
simplified the manipulation with the Dom
we are JavaScript then came view as a
tool and it simplified the web
application development and then at the
end it's up to you as a developer to to
simplify up and I believe view is one of
the tools right now that can help you
get along with the typescript and let's
let's look at the advantages which you
can use right now so how many of you
actually hands up
try tries tad sorry right typescript
before with the view anyone ok
typescript typescript with you ok a few
of you so I will start with some basic
stuff how you can set up your project at
the beginning and in showing some
examples then from this simple simple
set up to more advanced there is
something like babel with the flow which
is also used useful for this kind of
stuff
ok but in my opinion it it requires more
configuration
then typescript typescript has a one
config file in your project that's all
what you should check first anyway if
you are developing with the view is the
sty guide so read the style guide first
to avoid any wrong patterns you while
while you're developing and let's look
how how we can use typescript with the
view the syntax is similar there are
actually free ways how you can use
typescript typescript brings you some
type safety in your in your objects and
view objects and methods view extent is
one way to do this where the syntax is
quite simple or similar to to syntax you
use in Babel you have you have a data
function you have a methods and you can
use computed properties like like you
would do in in Babel
you are just using a function extent
here other way is using view component
options this is kind of this object here
which you you can import from view again
the syntax is quite quite similar to
what you know you have you have a data
function right here and methods right
here but where you're at additionally
doing here is you're writing something
like in to
face to describe the data for you and
the methods for you so every time you
use some variable here in a method it
knows the shape of the object so you get
the full intellisense and type safety
here on the unlimited level so if you
are here let's say on click method and
you would access the message here he
would know this guy is a string and as a
soon you would try put number in this
message it would it would raise an error
small trick here is as I said the
component options so we were here at the
complying option this is a second way
how you can write a view object your
view class and third one probably the
most famous one is the overview class
component which is an official official
class which can be used in a Babel
EICMA script or typescript you can see
there is some special decorator called
component in this case you are importing
it from from view class component a
library which is official one up there
you have kind of slots for your
component properties and so on and right
here you have a class that uses those
sorry
right here you have a class that is
using this component decorator as you
can see there is no data function
anymore you don't need to define this
this will be automatic handled for you
you see there is no declaration of the
methods now it's automatically hand it
for you so any method you write here it
will be it will be automatically in a
slot with the method
this guy is an example of lifecycle hook
which are there there are special names
like create it mount it so if you write
it like this he will understand
automatically that this is a lifetime
lifecycle event you can also create a
computed property like this where you
put a get setter getter
actually get get keyword in front of it
so it will it will automatically create
for you the slot with the computed
properties so it's quite handy stuff if
you if you like to write less and
produce more this is what what this view
class component is doing for you out of
the box so now there is official support
for typescript in view click you can
create actually now project with the
typescript with only two commands so
first one is that command it installs to
view click and second comment is create
your project so you just call view
create my project
and then you will you will get into
wizard that I will show in a minute how
it looks like there is also another way
you can download templates from official
official repositories from you like
bujji's templates and running it
actually it's quite easy you just turn
on it and it's just after installing so
using NPM install you can you can use
command and PM's run surf or NPM run dev
so what happens if you now download the
view clean and you create a project over
view create my project you will you will
get this screen where you can choose
which features you want in your new
project you can choose typescript if you
leave the typescript option it will
create for you automatically project
that is in ACMA script so Babel if you
choose typescript it will be typescript
only you can choose if you want router
or UX you can choose if you want testing
framework or not so I recommend it for
you if you didn't try it you can try it
not right now it's only two commands you
need now to get there and you can you
can start experimenting with those what
it creates for you this is this is the
structure you get after this those two
commands it will set up for you
there is also question inside a while as
a second step if you want the
configuration file separately or if you
want it all in in one file so in this
case I put the option
that configuration should be all
separately so this is the part down here
where you have configuration for
typescript packages and CSS and so on in
a full option where you use CSS rotor
and stuff like that
you will get the structure with the
store automatically search for you so
from there it's just one command running
and pmm self and it will be to run the
application that it create for you so
you can from there start start
experimenting for experienced users you
usually need then afterwards start when
starting bigger project customize the
settings so this is something you should
look at then later on how the config
stuff works so by default it's using
webpack so if you guys know or you are
familiar with the web pack it's
automatically there in this case it's
kind of a global installed and if you
want if you want custom config is you
probably in a project in a bigger
project requires you can put it also we
option through view config there is a
way how to do this so let's use this
example that it created it created for
you some simple hello world example in
this case it's using library called view
property
later it's extended library which is
right now I would say semi-official
so it's using the component from review
class component which is official and
it's adding some more decorators over
this simple component so as you can see
right now right here there is a
decorator called prop and this if you
put the crater in front of any any
variable you know you that you create in
your in your view class it will be
automatically transformed into property
so this is kind of handy that you only
mark with with with some decorators the
properties or leaf leave the variables
as they are this is also handy stuff in
a previous examples if you would be
using the only component which you can
use also you saw the property was
defined in a break it's right here in as
a parameter of this decorator so there
are two ways actually doing it but I
think the decorators helps you to write
less because in in a classic way using
only view class component you would have
to define kind of the property twice so
in this case it's saving you one step of
writing again so your your component is
actually smaller at the end so this is
how looks for example the viewer outer
if you set up project with
typescript nothing really fancy here the
imports looks the same like when you are
using babel this is how it created
Buicks store for you again nothing
special you can now extend it there are
some there is some better way or
alternative way how you can write the
view X store we will see that in a later
example what tools you should know for
developing you should use you can use
Visual Studio community or you can use
Visual Studio code there is a plugin
called Twitter which brings also among
other things
typescript intelligence into your view
single file component files so if you
have if I get back here
let's am here here in this component I
would normally because this component
contains template so as the typescript I
would normally don't have or wouldn't
have typescript intelligence here but
since I'm using this plug-in it will
gives me it will give me shape and
methods and everything that he knows
about this so this is to work which is
connected to also to this little plugin
which is kind of mask to have in Visual
Studio code but there are also other
plugins which you can use like snippets
and typescript and stuff like that handy
handy stuff when developing so when you
get to real world why would you need the
typescript at all the question is
explained or cleaner if you have some
domain objects and you would say okay I
need to I need to somehow describe my
domain and and and I want to know what
the shape of my objects are and these
these objects are kind of complex and I
want to describe as much as I can so
here you can see on the left part in a
simple example of how you can you can
define some blog post object there is
some category as a complex object as a
property on this post sorry sorry let's
go back
so one post has a title and a Content
among other things as a ID an account
you can use object-oriented way now in a
typescript which you can use now to
extend the functionality of your object
which is kind of fun
now so first thing you map the domain
somehow and second thing you can now
import this domain into your view
component and start using it so in this
example I created here component which
has a variable inside code post and
putting the type behind so from now on
every time you are doing some something
some operation or or accessing some
property of this guy of this post it
will offer automatically for you every
object that you did is defined here so
how it works now if you access this
property it's offering you title content
ID and all the stuff that you previously
defined on those objects automatically
you can also now access automatically
complex objects that you have in your
complex object so post has a list of
categories you can access the categories
and even on the category itself it
offers you all the properties from the
category so you don't have to look any
more back or going back in your code
what was the name of the property
because it's telling you all the way and
there is no case now if I save it and I
would compile this program there is no
way he would allow you to put the wrong
name or wrong property because he knows
all the properties all the objects you
are using so you're 100% type safe and
this is the trick which which or feature
that typescript brings for you out of
the box so it's intelligent and type
safety and using complex object in this
example let's imagine that you have now
application that are that wants to
display some posts and lets you create
some component called post post dot view
and you want to reuse this component now
and there are two ways this error is
quite common you can now use this comp
let's say this component existence it
called it's called post dot view you
want to reuse it on to think two places
now in your program let's say you have a
list with with the post and let's say
you want to display last five five of
them so you will create some view for
where you using this component and let's
let's say there is a link on each of
this on this post where you can access
it actually in a detail where it brings
you to the post itself so the second
place where you reduce this component
is is actually in a detail so this stuff
happens often where you're trying to use
property when you are using actually in
a component only the post as a property
this is not enough to do you have to
always create kind of shadow property of
this guy if you are if you are using it
as I said only two places at the same
time in your program one way is to use
it in a list
another way is you use it as a via view
router let's say there is some part post
/ 61 so this way you ensure your your
component will be kind of safe from this
error another example using prop and M
it let's say you have a post there and
you want to delete the post somewhere so
you create a link which takes post ID
and you want to omit this event in a
list that you deleted this post and the
list itself are is displaying those post
here and wants to fetch the data again
because you deleted one of the posts so
this is how you do it in in a type
script
again you're using the component
decorator and using over this you get
all the variables now the on view
instance which one of those are is the
Hammett method in this case I created it
on delete post event which is then used
on post list which is another control
which is using the post and you see you
can see the syntax is quite the same
here you create add on delete post was
deleted and this is how you can react on
this so and again you can see the
parameter here right now as ID is a
number you can access it and you can do
let's say it can be complex object or
anything you want you can access all the
properties and all the operations that
that this object offers so again this is
type safety and this is how you mark
mark those types even when you're
raising events with the view another
example would be let say you have a list
with those posts and let's say there are
lots of them and you want to scroll to
some particle one because normally type
script doesn't allow you or doesn't show
you the the methods unless he knows what
kind of object it is so this is one of
the examples where you can go lower in
here he to some default types and you
can actually use the
methods which are in plain plain
JavaScript there so in this case just
scrolling on some specific item which
you before marked as a ref which is
connected to the view itself but you
just think what kind of object it is so
this is how you access lower JavaScript
functions with typescript this is kind
of the more advanced example how you
create vivek stove ux store
we are typescript you can see now there
is the state passed as a type to the
view store so in this part state is an
interface which you define somewhere
before which describes your data in my
case there is a there is a shape of
database and there is a shape of some
variables which one of those variables
is can be like your language date format
and so on and you are using it then as a
type here creating viewing store and
creating mutations with those types
again so again any anytime next time you
access to view X store there are some
types and you can you can gain again all
the intelligence and all the information
about them all the properties and
methods that are connected to those
objects
one example also which is good to know
you can use an event bus you can create
a variable in a store called bus right
here which gets B which can be view
instance itself and you can now use it
for emitting events in cases where you
don't need to mutate anything just to
want to raise just if in case you want
to raise some some event and somebody
else somewhere in your program will
react on this event this is part here
which you are reacting on on saving the
post which again accepts this post as a
parameter so you can again access all
the information from the post here and
do whatever you whatever the routine
should do in your program so this is
also kind of a clever way how to how to
create an event pass with the view okay
and last example would be kind of how
you create a type save event bus if you
want to be completely sure what object
it is and get rid of those strings that
that you using you can put you can
create object with those methods that
are using those strings which your which
you at the end tag encapsulate and right
now you can from their own you can call
the methods here with full intellisense
no strings and food type safety in your
program so in this case is on screenshot
here
it knows all the all the methods on the
bus on the bus all the events on the bus
that can happen
all the parameters so now you you can
from there on you cannot do any mistake
in your program so this would be for you
type script I hope it gives you some
inspiration and you can check my github
