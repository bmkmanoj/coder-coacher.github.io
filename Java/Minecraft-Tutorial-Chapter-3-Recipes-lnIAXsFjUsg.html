play minecraft this is the third video
in my minecraft tutorial series and
today we are going to talk about recipes
before we talk about recipes we're going
to talk about the official resource for
everything in Minecraft this is
minecraft wiki net and here's the URL
and it's basically a Minecraft
encyclopedia has everything you can
learn about in Minecraft and if you want
to learn more about recipes you can go
down to this little part over here where
it has three different kinds of recipes
crafting smelting and brewing so what is
a recipe well a recipe is a way to craft
new items with the ones you already have
so let's take a look at it in the game
so let's go into the world now the world
is totally flat and if you want your
world to be the same way when you're
creating the world you have to go to
more old options and change the world
type now I've already set up the world
with chests and different crafting
things to show you the recipes let's
start with crafting now crafting is a
way to turn old items into new items but
you may need one or more so I'm not
going to show you all the recipes while
show you some basic ones first is acting
table so this shape here of wood planks
is a crafting table so I have that the
next one is a chest
this shape here is for a chest and
usually when you clap something it sort
of looks like the actual item is going
to create next I'm going to show you
some tools first is a would pick or pick
ax that makes the wood pickaxe now you
can replace these wooden planks with
gold iron cobblestone or diamond to to
make those separate kind of tools then
there is a would shovel and it would
sword then I'm gonna show you some
cobble stone tools so going to make a
cobblestone axe or stone axe and stone
hoe and then a furnace the part is
basically chest made out of stone or
cobblestone and then one last one is a
door well there's late two types of
doors i'll show you both here's a
regular door and then there's a trapdoor
and that's a trap door so you can see
it's turned into nighttime so let me
show you another quick command so I open
Chopra with tea and make new / time set
either day or night so I'm going to get
time set day and now it's daytime so
let's go on to smelting now here's
another command you can do it / clear
and it gets a bit of everything in your
inventory so I did that I cleared
everything now so smelting so smelting
is changing items using other items as
fuel there are many things you can smelt
but the most common are cooking
meat and smelting or so me is food like
I said in the last video and cooking it
makes you makes a give you more help
hunger so I'm going to take this out and
use wood as fuel and then open up the
furnace put one word in the fuel slot
and put the pork chop and the smelting
slot and it uses up the wood and this
tells you how much smelting time you
have left and it takes 10 smell seconds
to smelt one item and finished melting
it and I get a cooked porkchop so I take
the out of here and I'll put it back in
the chef's now I can smell the other two
meats the same way and I think I'll do
that so I'll take this footwear here and
then it takes 10 more seconds of smelt
this next piece of meat now one would
one wooden plank will give you 15
seconds of smelting and if there is if
there's something in here that's not the
output or whatever's here it won't smelt
so if there's a stake in here a lot
chicken there it won't smelt because raw
chicken doesn't give steak another thing
you could do is smelt or I have all the
orders here so I'm going to take this
diamond ore out put it in this slot and
smelt it and I'll get a diamond so
second time more seconds to smelt this
and I get a dime in when you smell stuff
you also get XP which is can be very
useful here are some different kinds of
fuel you can use to not all the
different ones but some this one will
give you five seconds these three the
wood wood planks and mushroom block will
give you 15 seconds Cole and charcoal
will give you 80 seconds a block Cole
give you 800 seconds blaze rod will give
you a hundred twenty seconds and finally
a lava bucket will give you a thousand
seconds if you put fuel and a furnace
but you don't put anything to smelt it
won't smelt it now let's talk about
brewing there are many recipes for
brewing but they will take too much time
so I'm only going to show you a few
these are all the different brewing
ingredients you can use and here are
some portions of already created so I'm
gonna take this awkward potion which is
made by putting medawar into there and
water bottles so I'm gonna take this
going stand open it up this is where the
ingredient goes and these see the bottle
starting but one of this they understand
that they're so you can put you can put
three of them at a time and they'll all
turn into the same potion because you
have one ingredient in there brewing
something takes 15 seconds this is
little more than smelting so as you can
see it's turn them all into awkward
potions all proportions are the main
ingredient in mini potion recipes so
here you have 60 for upper portions
already prepared so I'm going to show
you some other potions
the first one is going to be potion of
health which I'm going to do with a
glistering melon you can crack this by
putting a gold nugget next to a melon
slice in the packaging table the thing I
think is funny about the stirring melons
is they look sort of opposite from a
regular melon because they're pointed a
different way so I know I have these
three opera postings and then bring them
into health potions and here I have
portions of instant health then i'm
going to make potions of poison which is
a spider I on awkward potions these
bubbles here I think that is for a fact
but they might be used for something
later on while something is brewing you
can see these red bottles outside and
then order to take them off they won't
be there so I pushing the poison and
take them off and they're not there
anymore lastly I want to show you a
potion of regeneration a ghast here what
you can get from killing a gas is used
on awkward potions to make them into
potions of regeneration which will give
you health over time throwing stands
also make little smoke particles above
them I think and I'm pretty sure just
for effect here you a potion of
regeneration if you want to learn more
about brewing you can go to minecraft
wiki and look at the recipe section
let's summarize what we learned today we
learned that for anything minecraft you
can go to minecraft wiki net we have to
learn the water recipe is and then we
learned some basic crafting smelting and
brewing recipes thanks for listening and
happy mine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
