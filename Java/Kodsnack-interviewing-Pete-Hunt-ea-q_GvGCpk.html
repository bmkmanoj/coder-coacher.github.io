about the monoliths oh yeah thanks turns
out we have a monolith or two at work so
everyone's got a monolith in there in
there yeah it happens so easily yeah
it's really easy to keep building on
them as well yeah it's also really easy
to follow the hype train and we try to
over decompose your services when you're
not really going to see the benefits of
it so I always thought that it was great
to set up your monolith in a way that
you have the option ality to go a
decomposed it no but you don't
necessarily have to take that leap all
at once no mm yeah so did you did you
start designing your system now with
that in mind from the get-go or was it
yeah pretty much from day one we were
designed that way I think it is this one
pretty much yeah pretty much you know I
from day one we were we were designed
that way but it was only about like six
months in we like spun out our first
service no and it was basically because
we had one of those services that had to
go to disk a lot and we wanted to manage
that service separately from the rest of
our kind of stateless architecture
inside that monolith so yeah we were
able to spin out one of those services
pretty easily we didn't really have to
make a lot of code changes it was a lot
more you know ops changes and dealing
with with latency the network the whole
ops latency thing it's it happens kind
of easily as well yeah I could really
easily break this out how do I get
someone to create a service from it and
manage it on the up side so we actually
are built on top of a technology called
coober Nene's which basically like it's
a google open source technology that
makes deploying docker containers really
easy so if you have some sort of message
broker and some sort of service
discovery mechanism and some kind of
kind of container architecture like
communities it's pretty easy to break
out that service and like start running
the services on a set of machines the
real challenge is okay when one of those
services dies like what is the the
failure mode how do you deal with with a
source it's getting slow but not
necessarily dead thanks that nature no
so you started with that in mind as well
and so if you hadn't started with that
we would have been a huge problem too
well I guess just just takes more effort
if you built into it already it's it's
just a lot more refactoring it's really
how much technical debt you want to have
when you decide hey I want to go and
move towards towards microservices know
and I actually think that a lot of the
ways that we design software in this
monolithic architecture where we assume
shared state and passing models to
different functions that aren't
serializable actually leads to harder to
maintain code anyway yeah yeah so that's
definitely a thing yeah but it's it's
still so easy to keep going inside of
that yeah yeah it's important to know
when you're like okay I'm done with my
quick and dirty prototyping phase and
now i want to start moving towards you
know style of development that's gonna
be a or last a little longer oh yeah
yeah try to try to keep to that
architecture if you started it as well I
mean it can be kind of tricky i start
with is really nice this would be easy
to spin out into services and turns out
we all we need to do this little hack
over here and just connect those bits
directly and not growing the spider web
there yep yep that a coupling is
insidious between software components
but I guess it must have been kind of an
advantage for this thinking coming from
facebook before we we've kind of had
yeah can beg a couple systems so yeah
it's really interesting Lee Byron is
giving a talk on graph ql right now yeah
and I think that when they announced
graph que ella was kind of hard for
people to wrap their head around it
because they're so used to developing if
this kind of active record style model
where graph ql is really designed in a
way that says hey you've got a bunch of
different back-end systems you know how
to look up different entities in those
back-end systems by some global ID and
graph G L will coordinate all of those
all that data fetching so you can start
a lot of times you know you'll go to
graph ql with a user ID and say hey give
me all of the names of the events that
this user is attending know so you go to
the user service you say ok give me
information about the user and then
you'll go to the events
and then get information about all the
related event no it's two separate
backends but graphical is kind of
coordinate now yes I so the graph
clearly introduction to work it's react
Europe okay and it's yeah it's it really
appeals to me yeah especially and also
this part about describing what the
format what you want back because we
have so many API related calls where
it's I mean a lot pile of parameters is
describing the response basically and
yeah so much nicer yeah I think we've
just mentioned that they've had the same
news feet or the the newsfeed version
from three years ago which is hundreds
of releases behind the car ever still
works which is pretty incredible when
you think about it uh I can barely keep
a release of our software working for
like a whole month no I'm happy if it
works right after release yeah that's
now so did you take a lot of like
thinking from facebook with you to new
things or is it all oh this is new and
dif let's have a different approach I so
i'm working on a pretty different
product now the facebook was a big
social app might also worked on
instagram know and we were really our
data looked like users and pieces of
content and relationships between the
users in the content smite it's a lot
different we ingest kinda analytics data
we analyze it to try to identify
patterns of fraud scams credit card
credit people using credit cards in
fraudulent way you know things like that
so it is a very different problem but
you can kind of the way that the
facebook architecture was designed was
pretty helpful we're designing this new
architecture so we're able to take a lot
more advantage of open source
infrastructure tools mm-hmm then
facebook is just because facebook's
built so much stuff into yeah but the
general idea of looking things up by a
global ID and and being able to
coordinate axes across a bunch of
different independent services was
really helpful so a lot of thinking
still applies right perience of course
yeah we're not writing PHP n so that
that whole stack which is very
impressive and facebook we don't use
that's crazy yes
so much it was a bit curious about I
mean so you were you've been in react
from from the very beginning yep I don't
know maybe this is a very fluffy
question but how did it seem from the
inside when it was sort of expanding
because from the outside his sort of
shows up but or at some point in
everyone's mind I hadn't heard of react
now I heard of reactant suddenly it's
yeah it's now a safe technology oh yeah
and it went really quickly too yeah it's
interesting you know when we open
sourced it in May of 2013 at jas conch
so there was a room of all of us at
Facebook like pushing the website
writing the documentation making sure
that the google group was was set up
moderating everything and then I think
tamo aqui no announced it at like one
very specific time right it was like 10
a.m. or something and we pushed the
button and we're like on Twitter we're
waiting to see people's reaction and
everyone's reaction was just to hate
this thing I mean they're like there's
HTML my JavaScript like what is this
this is never gonna work and the people
who got past the HTML on the javascript
thing they looked at this method of rear
ndering over and over and thought that
would be too slow and really it was a
grind for the first year and a half
people really didn't want to give this
technology a chance and so it was it was
slow going no so what's what sort of
what sort of kept you going like pushing
this effort um two people sort of I it
was this is kind of funny I had built a
bunch of applications with react and we
had baked react off against a bunch of
different technologies internally so we
actually knew that we were right and
everyone else was wrong yeah because we
had invested so much time and looking at
everything else so really was a matter
of how do we communicate this thing in a
way that people are going to understand
and when you know that you are going to
eventually be or that you are right now
I'm going to eventually win it's pretty
easy to stay motivated and you really
don't have an excuse for people to not
understand your technology it's like
really good you're just doing a crappy
job of explaining it
yeah yeah so we can we can do better
yeah so simultaneously like motivating
and also you look at yourself and you're
like all right this person did not get
why i like this technology i need to
understand like they're not stupid i
need to understand like why I'm failing
to communicate oh yeah yeah so is is
that uh so that sort of internalized in
in the culture or is it something that
was particular to the react team so i
watch your that building community talk
and i was really impressed about I mean
how you handle it and sort of really
worked with convincing people in a
constructive way because it's been we've
had discussions about this on the
podcast from time to time because one of
the guys works on plex and they get they
get criticism everything but every time
to change something yeah I'll say so I
mean so I don't work at Facebook anymore
so I can't really speak to what they're
prioritizing no but I can say when I was
there there was like they're a really
big company and they work on a lot of
different things and so there are pretty
basic issues when you're at that scale
that you need to have sorted out before
you kind of go to the next level so for
example making sure that all issues are
triaged and handled and all pull
requests are either rejected or merged
in or get feedback there was a lot of
infrastructure that they built and James
Pierce has given lots of talks about all
the github Ott's and get have metrics in
the way that they've organized the
company to be really good open-source
company so that I think is the main
discussions that were being had
internally like how do we we scale this
this open-source organization a lot of
the I think advocacy stuff was was
mostly just stuff that I figured out
when we were starting to go to the
community yeah because like I could so
easily see that go wrong you know with a
big team of developers and everyone's
sort of in a coating mindset and you get
defensive about the feedback yeah
there's also just a bunch of Engineers
that are really talented that work at
Facebook that nobody has heard of you
know and they just stay internally and
and they they hack out a bunch of
awesome stuff and they just don't really
care about the fame of open so no they
just try to build cool stuff no so that
you need a mix of people sure your
people like me that yeah
I've worked on the react or but I'm kind
of my main contribution was convincing
people this is worth it yeah that's such
a big thing it's so easy to forget it's
like okay my code is done here it is
yeah if you just write something good
around it and respond to questions it
makes such a world of difference yeah it
so it's a lot of communication yeah so
did you do did you have any sort of plan
before you started responding to stuff
like this is sort of the the responses
we want to give or was it just up to
whoever wanted to jump in and respond to
something um it's a good question there
wasn't a plan in the beginning we didn't
appreciate what the reaction was going
to be so there's a lot of really cool
stuff and react the fact that you know
now what is it three or two or three
years later everybody understands like
Oh react native is possible because
react was designed in this way they make
things like react native possible and
all this animation stuff and so we were
really jazzed about saying like hey
we've abstracted away the browser and
you can build applications in the same
kind of mental model that will work
across all these different platforms how
cool is that and that's what we were
trying to say and what everybody else
saw was like HTML my JavaScript oh yeah
and so we really had to like get back
and look at the status quo and say okay
this is up people are building
applications today so we're building
them eternally how do we kind of address
all of these different points and and
get people thinking the right way to
appreciate the stuff that reacted gnome
has come up with so the first I gave
this talk at jsk EU which is probably
like the one of the more famous ones
which was basically like hey the whole
point of it was we are not idiots like
we we understand why you are separating
your templates from your controller code
we get that we're not missing the point
there we just have a different way of
thinking about it and fast-forwarding a
couple years later you know not
everybody is on board but enough people
are aboard that i think it's it's proven
at that we're not idiots yeah and the
ideas themselves are spreading so much
as well I mean yeah virtual Dom's kind
of everyone like the maintaining a mute
state yeah I mean people are really
thinking about immutable data structures
now react certainly did not come up with
that the closure community was trying to
bring that to the weather along yeah
sometimes it just takes the right set of
circumstances and the right messaging to
to convince to kind of take this concept
that everybody knows about but doesn't
appreciate and get out yeah yeah I was
so so so happy when you mentioned that
in the community to talk about this what
was the code name of the blogpost the
future of the javascript and press yeah
yeah yeah cuz that's where we discovered
react basically oh yeah so we started
doing that for one of our apps oh then
yeah and it went out to customers Monday
oh that's a huge day sorry so you're not
on call right now almost got it okay if
it starts my bag that you know no but
it's working out really well and it's it
was funny because it really suited our
problem so well I'm just solving the
view stuff and not getting involved with
trying to do everything else at once
yeah that's also such a big thing that
react doesn't try to sort of expand and
have an opinion about everything else
yeah was that a big discussion or any
discussion uh it's a matter of necessity
really reacts has always been like a
very very practical technology yeah it
was never like developed in like a lab
in isolation and then only later on
apply to an application it was developed
specifically for a couple different
applications no and so if you're
dropping something into Facebook you
can't rewrite the whole ads create flow
or the whole newsfeed you have to be
able to incremental II adopt certain
piece of technology so just the way that
it was developed and incubated led to
kind of where it it starts and where it
stops so we need to be able to render UI
components and take over a whole Dom
node but it can't be super opinionated
about data fetching in a way that will
take over your whole application it
can't assume certain characteristics of
the browser certain performance
capabilities of a client
is there anything you think that reacts
should be doing or should be doing next
or is it pretty much where it should be
so I'm a little less involved in the
project yeah but I have a personal ah
that's a good question facebook open
source is doing a lot of different
things they I mean the the ecosystem
around react now has real a graph ql
flood like 10,000 different flux
implementation so flow as well i think
that there's a lot of promise in
marrying a component system which has
strongly typed property like props big
mountain and state adata fetching system
that strongly typed and the fact that
facebook has a type system in flow means
that you could probably do a lot of
really cool things when you've really
tightly integrated those three those
three projects i don't think that we've
really seen the there's a lot of promise
there i don't think it's been delivered
yet no but I'm excited to see what that
looks like it looks like also Chang Liu
with react motion has done a pretty good
job of figuring out what a good
animation API wow that's like that's so
cool too yeah the real question is how
like is this going to perform across a
wide variety of platforms jury's still
out on that reacts also should probably
have a more opinionated answer about CSS
there are a bunch of different competing
ideologies there and there's just you
know none of them are being dog feted by
any like big player right now I wish
might be saying something in itself I
guess yeah I think if you have really
strong conventions about how you write
CSS it's good enough yeah it's not so
bad that it's your worst your biggest
problem no exactly it's not anyone's
biggest problem I guess yeah especially
now we have flexbox I know the biggest
problem was just fighting with the
layout with them without but now flexbox
I think I you know I don't have any
complaints about laying things out with
CSS anymore known as I've started using
what's box
current
no I'm jump a bit have another thing oh
no no not that I rushed but we you know
if the stage had been ready we would
have started a bit earlier but anyway so
do you ever feel like you've become the
react guy more than you would have liked
I feel bad some or guilty sometimes that
people think i am the like only person
involved with react when like yeah i had
a big role a couple years ago at a very
very critical time but there's a lot of
people at facebook that wrote a lot more
of the code and you know the past year
so I've kind of taken a step back from
the project on sleeping facebook no but
as long as people understand that I
think that I I don't know I think I'm a
pretty smart guy now but but you're fine
with it personally like people keep to
the sort of talking react to you all the
time would you you know it's a great
technology yeah it's it saved me a ton
of time it's let me leave work earlier
and not have to wake up and deal with
emergencies yeah cuz it's super
addictive all sort of how my phone isn't
ringing right yeah exactly it's just
great technology i'm really glad to see
that that it now has a community built
around it it's a little bit weird that
for me it went from we went from being
the underdogs and everybody hating this
thing with to now this is like a lot of
people call react overhyped now mmm and
for me it's always going to be this
thing that like everybody the whole
community always hated know so you wanna
your rhetoric in your communication is
going to change like once you switch
from being the underdog to being you
know a safe trip so now we're you know
we're not publishing blog posts about
like why react is better than angular
because like everyone gets that react is
a choice worth looking into and they can
decide for themselves whether angular or
ember reactor irelia is getting the
right choice for their applicants this
is sort of a thing of trusting the
people to make up their own mind of them
have their own ideas and thoughts
not nothing not talking down to people
yeah I mean you definitely need a claw
your way up to the table and grab a seat
at the table and once you have a seat at
the table look let the community and let
each individual engineer decide won't be
a big good person about it oh yeah yeah
make sure that there's enough
documentation and the blog posts out
there for people to make an informed
decision about no knowledge east at no
good stuff
ya think we I think we need to start
wrapping up unfortunately but it was
great thank you for taking the time
chaireas great meeting yes a pleasure
chatting take it easy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
