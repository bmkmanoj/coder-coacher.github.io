of JavaFX scene border two-point not
we're going to make a demo app with an
aeronautical theme and show you how to
build layout apply CSS and connect code
we'll begin by adding some components in
the library first I drag a split pane
and drop it on to the content panel
I then add a list view and scroll pane
as children of the split pane
I'm now dragging a map image from my
desktop and dropping it inside the
scroll pane when you do this scene but
it creates an image you note for you map
image is pretty big so I choose modify
use computed sizes and now it displays
that its true size
I choose the wrapping function to wrap
the map inside a pane
this allows me to add a menu button
inside the pane as a sibling of the
image view in our app this menu button
will act as a pointer on our map by
default a mini button comes with two
menu items we're only going to use one
in our app so I'm using the hierarchy to
remove the other seam that has a neat
feature allowing you to show sample data
while you're building your layout this
helps you visualize our components by
the list view you've used here we'll
look when data is added it's easy to
interact with notes directly in the
content panel here I'm selecting the
split pane and adjusting the position of
its split up to the left now that our
app is starting to take shape we can use
the preview feature to simulate how our
layout will look inside a window as you
can see I can adjust the window size to
see our components will resize and I can
also interact with the components
directly
I'm now going to save the eff XML file
and I'm putting it inside the source
directory of the NetBeans project which
contains the logic for the app next
we'll add some components to form a
toolbar I begin by wrapping the split
pane inside a V box
I then dragged a hatch box onto the
content view by hovering the mouse near
the top of the beat box I can place the
H box of the first item H boxes and V
boxes respectively layout their children
horizontally and vertically the H box is
going to serve as a container for my
toolbar items
I now add a label textual control such
as labels can be edited directly by
double-clicking them inside the content
panel
and then drag and drop a button copy and
paste it and edit the text of each
I place a slider in between the buttons
and this little group of components will
control the zooming of our map
next we'll make a group of components
which will control the appearance of our
application after pasting another label
add a couple of toggle buttons which
will enable a high contrast theme and
also change the size of our UI
we'll now edit some properties of the h
box to tweak the appearance of the
toolbar area I select it change its
alignment property to center left the
set its size to computed
I then edit the margin and spacing
properties to move the children of the H
box away from its edges and add some
space between
I'm now going to use a little trick with
a region to space out the two groups of
controls in the tool bar I placed a
region between the two groups and set
its size to compute it as a region is a
child of the H box I can set its h box
constraints to force it to always grow
horizontally as the app is resized again
we'll use the preview feature to test
how the tool bar will resize in the
window as you can see it resizes
noisiest planned the expanding region
pushes the visuals group to the right
however you'll notice that the rest of
the app is no longer resizing when we
wrap the split pane inside the v box we
affected its layout so we need to fix
this I select the split pane select
compute its size and change its V box
constraints so that it will always grow
vertically
and then select the route VBox make it a
more useful size using the content panel
now when we preview the layout again you
can see that the app is once again
resizing as intended
you
the next stage is to add some CSS to our
app I can add a stylesheet to the root
VBox container or using the style sheets
property in the inspector
once the style sheet is added scene
builder can detect style classes inside
the farm
so here we select the menu button remove
its text and add the map pin style class
you can see that seam builders content
panel immediately updates to show the
added CSS styling the menu button is now
visually transformed into a pin
because we saved our XML file inside the
source directory of the NetBeans project
seeing builder can look inside the
directory and suggest Java files to add
as a controller
we can do this inside the controller
section of the document panel once the
controller Java file is added see Moodle
is able to look inside the file and find
methods and FX IDs
I can select individual components and
add the required method in order that
they execute code were now clicked
you
I can also select components and add FX
IDs to them FX IDs are unique to the
component they are assigned to and allow
the component to be identified by the
controller when I select a node seam
builder provides a list of unassigned FX
IDs
you
I now switch to NetBeans we can see the
main Java class which is loading the
airport app if XML file we've been
making this is the controller class
where the FX IDs and methods are stored
which have been connecting to our F XML
lastly this is a CSS file which we
attach to the root v box of our FX
amount
now that all of our code is attached to
our F XML we can take a look at the
running app
you
one of the advantages of using F XML is
that you can experiment the layout and
appearance of your app without having to
change the attach code
seeing though that helps you not to
break any connections to the code which
would stop your app from running for
example I get a warning if I try to
remove a node with an assigned FX ID
now I'm completely changing the layout
moving the toolbar to the bottom of the
app and changing the order of the
components in the split pane
I can even introduce a new node in this
case a chart
you
you can see that when I switch back to
NetBeans I'm still able to run the app
with no code changes and a completely
different layout
you
well I hope you enjoyed this video and
thanks a lot for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
