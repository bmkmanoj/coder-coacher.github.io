anniversary party with Rob jingle and
you were the seconds JCP chair yes from
about 2001 2004 okay so that's that's
been a while but how were things
different back in two thousand four for
the JCP what was the was the climate
like back then it was a period where in
the industry open-source initiatives
were starting to become lively and a
number of groups particularly the Apache
foundation we're trying to participate
in the JCP and similar efforts and the
community was having to wrestle with the
issues of how does open source relate to
compatibility and how important is
compatibility to the java community and
what are the tensions in that and that
was probably the largest issue that was
current the whole time I was chair
because actually my first action was the
Apache foundation decided they couldn't
participate on the executive committee
and to me at that time that seemed a
ludicrous outcome so we voided that
election and you know did a lot of work
with the community to talk about so does
open source necessarily interfere with
java's promise of compatibility to its
developers you know we have at that time
roughly four million java's developers
we believed sun particularly but i think
the community at large believe that the
reason there were four me in developers
was there was this cross-platform new
platform that allowed developers to work
and have a large reach now java was also
dependent on
roughly 4,000 developers who are
contributing to its evolution and the
people who wanted to contribute to its
evolution and who and the people who
benefited from the existence of the Java
platform had like you know ten thousand
to one kind of ratio so the concern was
particularly at a time when son had just
gone through an expensive process with
Microsoft over the corruption of the
Java platform now was how was it that
all of these things could coexist does
compatibility necessarily conflict with
open-source ideals and principles or can
they coexist in some way and how does
that actually play out in practice and
at the time I thought that was really
important that we figure that out I
don't know that any of us knew the
answer to exactly how it's good but you
know sort of the opening of the time I
was JCP chair was about bringing Apache
into the organization and finding a way
for them to contribute and it sounds
like you were successful to some degree
you know at the end of the time I was
chair there was a lot of contention
about well she Java itself be open
sourced I was the recipient of a
somewhat notorious open letter from IBM
that basically said you know you should
open source java and you know the way we
responded to that was at the next
javaone several months later we had a
basically an open unscripted
conversation among all the contenders
about so why do we think the things we
do what are the values were trying to
protect
the value I opened with was the idea
that you know our concern was that java
application developers not be lied to by
things pretending to be java and of
course in the whole microsoft legal
action that had actually occurred this
isn't a theoretical problem now at the
time we were holding this discussion it
was probably true that the body of
existing applications was sufficiently
strong that you didn't really have to
worry about the core platform
fragmenting anymore but all the new Jaya
sars-like the new toaster jsr is that a
little other things where if you didn't
have standardization in the body where
you could actually write when there's
when there's a whole collection of
applications that are basically the
surrogate for the test suite yeah they
will hold you right and so the the
counter example is you know linux didn't
have a test we'd well what idiot 40
years after the start of unix would
build a version of unix that didn't run
the apps and right now would be stupid
right nobody would do that but at the
beginning of each new jsr they're all
vulnerable to poaching due to
understandable competitive pressures and
so the thing i wanted out of this which
in the end didn't really happen maybe
because it was too complicated was the
idea that you know adults get to do
things that children don't do and maybe
when Jay SRS are young you have to be
really rigorous about getting the spirit
and content of that jsr to be in reality
in the marketplace the thing that you
know I said at the beginning that Java
things java applications are not lied to
by things pretending to be java but
there becomes a point in their evolution
when they're established enough she
don't really have to worry about it
more and I think the idea that the
standardization process might be
temporarily base was just really hard
for people to digest then and now
actually I mean I think that's part of
the issue is it it's actually
complicated it's got a lot of texture to
it but actually the thing I thought was
most heartening about that was when I
said the thing about you know Java
program should not be lied to by things
claiming to be Java you know the the
room erupted with applause that's right
and sort of like okay so we're actually
pursuing the right issue for the
audience so that was certainly
gratifying and I I know later a number
of the issues that were part of making
that happen became you know erupted a
bit that son basically reneged on some
of the promises we made at that time I
had already left son at that point which
I guess was a good thing because I
probably would have had to lead it leave
it then if I hadn't already because you
know I think we really thought those
things were important for the community
but you know here it's 10 years later I
haven't really been involved since some
i left the JCP and sun itself and it's
actually pretty gratifying to see that
this process still exists that it
continues to thrive with a number of
these same tensions in place and maybe
that's actually a sign of success that
something that has so many expensive
interests to all the parties of all
manages to continue to keep running with
some difficulties but maybe that's
actually a good thing so yeah so it
sounds like you know a few minor issues
aside you're actually pretty comfortable
with how your legacy has been taken
forward yeah well it was a lot of
people's like a CD right i mean i just
happened to be occupying the chair the
the odd thing about the chair position
is I'm action
the only participant it doesn't get a
vote so so it's this weird opposition in
some way so but yeah it is kind of
gratifying that it still continues and a
lot of that of course is attributable to
George who you know got the thing off
the ground and dono and especially
Patrick who's kept it going for way
longer than any of us did so ya know
patrick patrick has been the chairs as
far back as I can remember her but it's
really good to see that what he started
with was really the foundation was laid
by some of his predecessors and I in a
very thoughtful way yeah cool well thank
you owe me a chance get about thanks
very much so you're welcome to one of
the books if you have like the au pair
do you have that and this is also an
exclusive benefit of being on the night
hacking stream you got one of the UM
laptop stickers awesome all right thank
you very much thanks very much Rob take
care of</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
