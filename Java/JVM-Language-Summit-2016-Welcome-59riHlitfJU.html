Traverse at so I am responsible for the
development team for the java SE
platform so this event is very important
to us because that that's a place where
we have the opportunities to give you a
preview or number of features that the
team is working on that's a place where
we can get your feedback in terms of
what you believe it's important it's a
place where you know I expect you know a
number of discussions so I'm certainly
encourage all of you to spend the time
to meet everybody here have this abs or
size discussions that that's going to be
very important for for us you know how
as a group has a community to to avoid
the Java platform safe harbor just to
say that you know whatever features I'm
a in a present or discuss today whatever
timeline in Oh may change so don't take
everything that I say to have to the
bank so you know I appreciate you being
here appreciate you time I appreciate
your participation you know as I was
saying you know it's critical you feed
bags are critical to us and to the team
you know I know the team every years is
looking to this event you know to get
you know the merge necessary feedback
that we need if I'm looking at you know
the set of people here I think it's a
great mix of JVM developers language
designers in the people that are using
Java compiler writers you know you guys
or of the Fox you know they're going to
help us in advance you know the platform
it's a nine event you know the seven
under Oracle
leadership you know certainly and even
that we are you know will continue to
support it's something that you know we
feed is very important you know over
those nine years you know typical major
releases to you know soon to be three a
lot of you know minor updates and a
buttload of security as well as bug
fixes releases in the meantime you know
while there were some concerns a few
years ago around the future of Java it's
clear that you know Java is doing very
well you know java SE is driving you
know the drive to the cloud is putting
java at the center of the cloud
revolutions you know just looking at all
the cloud providers you know from amazon
you know google and to some level now
microsoft you know the java runtime is
becoming the foundations of the cloud
and from the developments 10 points you
know we are seeing you know continue you
know adaptions of the java priming
language as well as other languages that
are running on the JVM so I appreciate
you continued support for the JVM
technology I appreciate your support of
Java I think we are in a great place
which mean also we have tremendous
responsibility for this industry in
terms of continuing to advance in the
district knology and by the way a number
of those features you know that then we
are discussing and vogue dynamic in your
lambda you know part of those preview
designs have been disgusted here part of
the feedback that we got you know from
from this event was very important to
the team to deliver you know the best
capable capable features so Oracle care
a lot about Java why because we have a
very large number of product and cloud
services that are built on java SE which
means that every improvement
that we are making to the Java platform
mean that our product or a called
product or occult services are going to
get better every improvement to the Java
language in terms of developer
productivities we have very large
numbers of Java developers within Oracle
which mean that by improving Joe vedepo
productivities we're going to improve
the overall productivities of Oracle we
are driving a fair amount of revenues
orange ave SE in a part of the SC
advanced Q's where we have in selected
features that we are delivering as added
values to our commercial users as well
as you know support you know we are
supporting our customers you know
supporting on bug fixes securities a
neat type of environments that are
requiring in a mission-critical supports
we are here to provide simple java 8 you
know life for two years you know extra
me stable releases the adoption of Java
8 has been beyond our own expectations
we are seeing now today you know a
number of commercial entities that have
moved to Java 8 in a lot of great
features many features that were
discussed here that I've benefited from
the description that happened in this
event great quality and performance you
know from me no previous releases you
know Java 8 was a significant release
for us you know the first time or for
you know many years that we evolved the
language library and the run time
together also and at the least we try to
provide a transparent process it's clear
that Java Java Sea is beyond Oracle it's
important for us to you know provide
transparency to our users to folks like
you in this room that are helping us to
develop the Java platform and so we try
to be as transparent as we
can around the reduced schedule you know
the set of features that are part of
these releases and that's something that
we are fully committed and want to do
more java 9 you know of course lot of
features of course the big ticket is
zigzoo and model is motorized ations for
a number of years we have embarked in
this significant project to disassemble
the java runtime and reassemble this one
time into a set of modules providing
clean boundaries between those modules
and part of the reason is to help us
modernized the platform as well as to
help us reduce the cost of maintaining
this broad and large platform now beside
jigsaw there is a lot of features in
nine in fact you know at the high level
we are tracking more than 120 features I
know as part of our jab process in
OpenJDK you know today you know just
look at last week so out of those 120
features 95 these features are completed
you know 10 features or integrated 10
features are targeted and we have a
couple of features that should be
proposed to target in a few weeks I mean
so we are in a relatively good place in
terms of the future capabilities of this
release so we have switched now our
focus on stabilizations I know it's you
know those large platform large major
releases I know we have to support a lot
of different configurations so it's
important for us to start to get into
the slow process of stabilizations and
that's where we need your help we need
your help and everybody help we need to
basically get the feedback that is the
right time now you know within our
release process to be able to get the
feedback so if there is one call today I
really encourage you to talk to your
friend talk to your customers tell them
to go and uptake you know we are we are
providing in
cardiac says build up night please go in
tech and in a try and give us a feedback
we know that the adoption of nine is
going to be challenging and disruptive
because as part of the modernization if
what we are removing access to a number
of AP is internal epi is that in fact
you know nobody should have used we told
them never using but guess what they are
using them you know we also are changing
you know the layout on disk of the GRE
runtime I know there is a lot of change
no more arty dejar and we know that the
number of tools are assuming having a
number of assumptions around the layout
you know of the Java Runtime on disk so
please we need this feedback more
importantly also we need you help to
help migrate the tools the key tools as
well as party libraries that our
developers count on our harp it is you
know by the time with GA 9 you know all
the tooling chains orders kiss your body
libraries here the open source libraries
or commercial libraries already
supporting 9 so it's so the transitions
for developers in 29 is easier looking
beyond 9 of course you know we starting
to have and you will hear this week you
know a number of a project that we are
we working on but you know at the high
level we have in a few set of high
priorities number one security you know
I can tell you there is no platform in
the cloud if this platform is not secure
you know we are spending you know a
significant amount of time what shows an
investment to ensure that the java
runtime is secure there is more to do
you know the platform is this vast as a
vast surface of access and we need to
ensure that you know every access to
this platform is secure and that's our
top priority density it's all around the
relations in the cloud consolidations
that we need to improve or sauce usage
for Java services you know cloud
computing has also the side side of it
which is moving computing into utility
business cost of operations matter and
so we need to go back and look at all
the decision that we made 20 years ago
around internal representations in the
vm you do we need all this information
can we shave some bites a few bites here
at the scale of the cloud mean lot of
the law sale also we need better we need
to we need the VM and the Java
technology to be better at sharing it's
clear in the cloud you can ahead you're
going to use case where you have
multiple instances of the same Java
service on a server and we want to be
able to reduce the incremental cost to
run a new instance of the service on a
sale we need to extract you know a fair
amount of the JVM data the application
data into share libraries that can be
can take and share data across multiple
GBM processes start up always be very
important for the Java platform you know
desktop applications care a lot about
startup but now we have a new class of
services microservices lightweight
containers single functions services
that requires we need you know fast data
and so we need to work to reduce the gap
to reduce the startup cost of a Java
container versus a native container
predict abilities and low latency you
know of course memory management in the
java runtime is important you know
garbage collection performance is
typically in a where performance we are
being seen by applications so we need to
continue this long march to
reduced the impact of garbage
collections improved the overall product
abilities which add the scale of the
cloud you know sometimes the performance
of a service is less important than the
predictability of this series and that's
something we need to build we need to
build those capabilities in our
algorithm and then we know to scale to
the cloud we now have customers that are
demanding you know that the single JVM
process can manage multi terabyte it's
it's clear that we need to work a new
algorithm and that some things will be
very important for all of us and our
customers providing and service
abilities at the scare of the cloud we
need to provide cloud operators we need
to provide to our developers better
tools to be able to understand
performance efficiency we need to
provide better management of the java
runtime at the scale of the club you
know a lot of those deployments are
beyond human understanding we need to
build the student capabilities for the
next generations of cloud deployments of
the java technology and finding it at
the least you know productivities it's
clear that the Java language is old in
some way but at the same time I think
there is places where we can avoid this
morning language believe this point in
language as very sound foundations you
know to develop and build applications
on the cloud and improving java
developer productivity as well as JVM
developer / activities for some of you
guys here that are basically building
languages on top of the GBM it's as well
important for us that the JVM be in a
great environment to building and
prototyping and designing new languages
so in summary if i can leave you with a
few few points java SE is doing well has
been the cloud is raised a place where
java is striving
that's me it's a place where there is
tremendous opportunities for us
tremendous opportunities for innovations
and this is a place where I'm expecting
you know all the smart in this room to
well pass figuring out and navigate the
set of important features for the next
ten years of the Java and the GBM
runtime technology we need you help on
GD k-9 please help us give us the
feedback help us my graduate students or
body libraries we also are committed in
why the company record is completely
committed you know to raise the bar on
transparency around the development of
the GBM and the Java platform you know
we are we making progress in a pan GDK
understand some of those progress or are
small but we have this continuous intent
in at reservoir we are fully committed
to reduce the frictions for external
contributors to be able to contribute
their patch to openjdk we you know and I
certainly you know understand our
critical it easy it is for us to scale
you know to enable you know many of you
to provide us you know significant
patchi's sin if we can back the Evan bug
fixes you know at the lower costs and we
are doing it today and we are committed
as you will see this week you know where
we have in a number of features inclined
in your be online in a lot of you know
interesting features that you will hear
you know please provide us a feedback on
those features and finally you know
let's continue to innovate I think that
it's important for the industry that we
continue to evolve in advance into the
Java platform in the Java technology you
know thank you for your time I'm going
to be around into the next to two days
so if you have any questions you know
please feel free to to talk to me thank
you and have a great conference
