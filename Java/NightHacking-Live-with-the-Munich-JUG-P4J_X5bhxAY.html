Oh still can't hear me oh there we go
all right so welcome to the eunuch live
jug session I'm here with a bunch of
junk members and Anton goodbye Tony rent
on time Tony and Tony all right so let's
do was to introductions first for
everybody who's here the Dean of junk so
I want you start hi I'm Tony from the
Munich Jack I I'm gonna be in stream
team member and I regularly go to
conferences and I'm I've organized this
here because our regular place and the
check isn't available tonight and I'm
very glad that you're here thank you for
coming yeah and welcome to Munich all
right thanks charlie all right so you
like that introduce yourself hello my
name is Klaus i'm also in the joke not
very active but i'm looking forward to
get some more experience while actually
being here and looking at some new
technology oh hello my name is Dimitri
and I with an open source project names
a free plane which actively used swing
other for years and now we are thinking
about changing your place in sync apart
by javafx part and therefore we'd like
to learn more about it follow it well
they can do it ever should do it and
therefore also another team members were
joined it using your life or 19 streams
oh so you've been watching the the
online stream is very cool sneak behind
the projector so we can see I used to
get your hiding movable to the right
yeah okay maybe so bad then maybe it may
be interested in the topic ok and you
can you since the audience is
international you can introduce yourself
in German if you'd like yes ok ok so hi
my name is Willie and I'm for the last
12 years of about 12 years i was
developing swim swing applications and
no i'm looking forward of course is
jonathan's let's see oh my name is
Jurgen I'm a freelancer working in
financial engineering and I making Java
more than 10 years
hi I'm Paul and I am a product project
manager and I said have a team to
develop a computer game called tactical
sailing and we use the javafx starting
in 2009 only one only one who started
with this and Tony says we are paeonia I
don't know if if we are final year in
Munich in Germany in Europe or against
outside I'm a pioneer tips or what our
client I team you up today hi my name is
Anton I'm from unique I'm dropping as a
freelancer mostly for two small
companies into to cart and mannheim and
so I'm doing projects and giving courses
in java SE chala it appeared in such
things and on the client side mostly
swing and therefore i'm very interested
in the room possibilities cop oh I'm not
here as I am working for a small
internet company named &amp;amp; Lido I'm
developing most of my time wicked but I
also have some experience in SVT and
swing and I would love to to learn java
fix thank you alright so welcome
everybody
and I think we agreed that you can just
pick yeah all right yeah actually I left
my water yeah you know
so um oh you can see online we have some
folks in chat so you know who anyone
know who java expert is anyone anyone
recognize this guy on top yes yeah yeah
that's Jim Jim Weaver so very very nice
to have Jim online and we also have a
big dreamer is he's Mike Talon and
they're collecting each other online
they like they like a pinball machine
it's a weird to get a close shot of your
pinball machine for posterity that's a
really nice machine so we're gonna get
to play with that tomorrow right yeah
use your body label today you should
probably not have volume on otherwise
we're going again echo which is no fun
all right
so I'm going to under the show some
javafx tough to kick off the
presentation let's see I even have a
presentation I did yesterday at the
Jayhawk Conference so I will start there
I was even open let's see let's switch
to how does that look you guys get to be
in the top right corner so I'm going to
work
so I shall rehearse
I need to get it to show on this screen
not on the not just on there let's try
this presented at a kiosk full screen
okay all right there we go let's just
show up correctly on the street okay so
this is a short presentation i gave to
the let me play point 27 es you guys are
more relaxed without a camera pointing
at you will be it will be on camera for
a little bit sound good you're going to
hide too thanks all right actually could
you do me a favor and could you sit this
I could flip as the camera for a sec so
figure out what the right focus is so to
my seat though its end potentially very
nice actually um you know okay all right
thank you oh all right said if I if I
looked slightly disoriented that's
because I i just got off of 70 a
motorcycle right so oh what a motorcycle
by drove all the way from this morning I
was in the Netherlands and I forget the
name of the town it's on the border
between Germany and the Netherlands
says it's a BMW 1200 RT it's actually
it's parked right outside yeah sigh
that's the motorcycle yes oh my god all
mine or motorcycles suzuki-san sv650s
much better for like city and lane
splitting for filtering I guess is what
they say here I don't know but on this
this bike is much more comfortable if I
wrote on my suzuki like one hour and you
feel you'll get tired but this one you
can ride all day no problem alright so
let's go talk a little bit about
raspberry PI's so we're going to talk a
little bit about this old about Java
flex 20 and then show you guys some
demos and stuff yeah if my keyboard
works okay works there doesn't work here
I think it must be something with the
kiosk move anything let's still try this
again let's try this one and then we'll
full screen
maybe okay so um is anyone on the you
were on the stream right can you be in
favor Tony can you be the can you be the
ustream monitor so so it happens is like
gym or folks who are watching online if
the stream doesn't show up the right
stuff they'll yell on the chat but I
can't see the chats inside the
presentation full screen so I don't even
know if they can see the presentation so
let me know what they say in chat if
there's anything I need to stop for or
if there's any funny you want to mention
okay so yeah this is my tour around
Europe on a motorcycle so go to the
website night hacking calm and you can
follow along on the tour and pretty much
for the next week I'm in a different
city each day doing an event with either
an interview with somebody or a jug
session or something interesting so feel
free to join those are some of the
people i'm meeting I think you guys know
this guy here so and you might miss some
other folks here as well perhaps yeah
yeah i think tomorrow tomorrow Adam
Adams coming here what time is what time
is out of come even 11 a.m. ok so I mean
like like if you guys have off work
you're welcome to drop by on would be a
lot of audience too but you probably
have work this for me this is work so I
guess I just kind of for you to Tony
right because you're you're a full-time
trainer and yeah yeah so please
that we were doing it off with Jade Jade
a Jedi is here on Munich one is up
Thanks so if you hear I don't have a
slide for it but December thur ok wait
we we will we'll do this properly eat
duck j-a-y j by j day ok gotta thank you
j day 2012 one is it december third Curt
Pepperdine in Munich come or else okay
all right now it's officially is
officially part of the presentation all
right Jay day you should you should come
to this conference because it's going to
be great all right side of that javafx
so to get javafx tu download Java 7
that's it begin your dumb you have John
effects anybody have Java 7 on their
computers yeah okay so you guys all have
javafx already you're done this this
used to be like a like a five step
process like you know download java
download java effects make sure you have
the right versions install the NetBeans
plugins cetera et cetera so it's very
straightforward now because it's
integrated with the java runtime and it
works on windows apple and flings all
right so how do you develop javafx so
you can use any of these IVs
what about the updates for java for
Ethel the Zeppelin's two supports Java
or it's no on the Oracle ok so let's
Java 7 yeah all right so question I'm
going to leave this here if you want to
ask a question you say something just
you know feel free to grab it swear it
all rights the question was whether
Apple supports Java 7 or if it's just
Oracle so everything java 7 and up on
mac is from oracle so if you want to get
java 7 installed on your mac you
downloaded from java calm or the java
web site and that's that's what we did
just ready to get his tactical sailing
program i got the latest version of java
if you need java 6 for some reason then
Apple still maintains java 6 they
stopped shipping it with what i can say
if they start they started uninstalling
it unless you explicitly install it
there's a website with some information
from oracle on how you can download it
from apple and get java 6 back on your
machine if they had install it and
they're still putting out patches for
java 6 for example if you have a Retina
display you can use Java 6 to get retina
support in netbeans you use to use the
redness supported in decades not right
now yet retina display for Apple yeah I
was jealous yeah these things for them
yeah
six of you yeah so Tony just said he's
running on NetBeans on Java sex because
they have read now supported them okay
yeah because it would be used to have a
website where you can download apples
and java 6 because previous versions are
difficult to find and it's a horror
because if it doesn't work you have to
go back to the previous version you
can't find I can find so it will be
helpful to have a screen where people
look like an archive of previous Java
benefit gala sex versions yeah i'm not
sure what the arrangement was with apple
on distributing java 6 but i don't think
oracle actually distributes any versions
of java 6 is just java 7 them I don't
think app is that interested in
improving anything yeah in the
experience at this point they they kind
of give you one version they get hard to
get everything else but going forward
java 7 gives it much better as much is
kept up to date much better because it's
released at the same time as the other
Oracle releases for Windows and Linux so
you're better off coding for java 7 and
if you're building an app like tactical
sailing I'll talk about it in a couple
slides but something you should try is
the new packaging support because that
way you can bundle the version of Java
you want the user to run and they don't
need to you don't need to worry about
them having a java version installed
already that's the question how do you
see the chances to get a javafx later
also on smartphones on tablet pcs which
are not wrong and binders hmm ok so for
other platforms so the developers end
yea yea RT and what so no yeah so the
development team showed some some
previews of stuff last year yeah but
what they talked about it java one is
they're looking for companies who have
business use cases and want to support
the effort well okay let's find out why
just in just a second okay Wirecast says
it's streaming let's go back to plain
old video okay you see it's streaming
yeah yeah so maybe they're talking about
the presentation wasn't working new
streams not working okay so yeah while
we're waiting I can answer the question
about mobile support so this the short
answer is there's no mobile support yet
it's working okay there's no mobile
support yet and it's it's technically
feasible but so you know the development
team showed prototypes and it obviously
has technology working but the they're
looking for support from companies who
are interested in contributing to open J
effects and helping drive forward or who
have business use cases so if you're
interested send me an email and I'll put
you in touch with Nicholas Lorraine the
product manager and he's collecting
different companies who we can use this
use cases to get the project approved
David and the semi applies for like you
know any special platforms like iPads
Windows RT Windows 8/rt which is a
similar protected model or Android er
those platforms well it's this case is
basically about getting desktop
application adapted to some portable
device and so you can choose just just
another application getting now in this
case yeah yeah I I hear you so you can
be one of our use cases all right let's
hope this is just understand you can run
job I thanks from a website no website
mobile device so are you saying that if
I hope Java thanks from that from the
website from Safari flexible
yeah it's not going to work because you
need a java plugin to run it and there's
no plugin for mobile platforms right now
there's with which which Google we grow
I don't I don't think there's chrome for
iphone so yes for myself there's from I
don't think so Java running on that goes
psyphon super myself of children nothing
you think of the underlying platform of
Charles thank you thank you yeah so then
yeah it that's what's the problem is
that there's no java platform and
there's no browser plug-in and it's all
missing so getting back to the house we
see the chances of it to pizza to look
in some years is it like you or less
like a good defense it's it's more
likely if lots and lots of people
complainants explain that kind of
business reasons why it's important so
if you if you have like a business use
case for it let me know and i'll put you
in touch with nickels Oh in same thing
goes for online folks so shoot me an
email be my blog Steve on Java com
there's a contact form there okay oh and
I forgot jdeveloper it works on there
too alright so just I have any of you
guys coated Java text applications
before no no no okay let me let me show
you a really a really simple Java
effects application just give you an
idea what it's like okay so here's
netbeans netbeans makes it pretty easy
to develop java effects it has a plugin
you can take advantage of and this is
one of the first examples for the book
actually it's it's written by um Jim
Weaver who is on the stream and it's a
very basic javafx application but it
shows kind of the application structure
that you use so you extend the javafx
application class this is just javafx
application application
the full package implement a main method
so it's a standard Java program and in
the main method you call launch and
launch will initialize the javafx
runtime and call you back on the
application threat and then you
implement the start method there's a
couple different life cycle methods but
starts the most important one and then
from here you get the stage which is
essentially the window you're rendering
to and then you can add a scene graph
this is very similar to java flex 13 at
the scene graph add in different nodes
nodes are every elements in the scene
graph is called a node and there's a
bunch of built-in controls and lay out
some things you can take advantage of to
build your user interface so this is a
really simple example which let's let's
run it and see what it looks like
okay so we've got on e i shouldn't've
full screen it we've got on text rising
up with a little bit of cropping going
on background we have moon now this this
is not the original version i was
playing around some 3d support it's
quite easy to add different effects even
including 3d cameras so I had a little
perspective camera a bunch of Z layouts
to this guy but the original version
looked closer to i'm going to show you
the dev ox version since that's less
hacked let's run this one
alright so this is the same one just
with a dead box background and it shows
scrolling text on a background this is
using the image from the dead box
website the DevOps conference and I'll
show you another version of this do just
for fun here is
dev ox version with kind of a Star Wars
3d perspective so it shows you what you
can do with 3d effects in javafx now the
beginning is a little bit funky because
it's stretched upon me but after that it
kind of evens out all right and there
you can see it's like a little star wars
effect you can do all of this without
much code at all let me show you the the
code for for this version which you
think would be complicated but the only
difference between this and the previous
one is a little perspective transform I
added so simply this code right here so
javafx comes with a bunch of like
effects glows and drop shadows and
prospective transforms and you can take
your existing scene graph and apply
different effects to it and then you
know instantly you have a new program or
a new a new visual look animations are
very easy as well this is all the code
for animating the text scrolling up it's
using the Builder syntax for writing
JavaFX applications so you you can use
constructors like swing if you've done
swing applications you would just do
trem new translate transition and then
call you know set duration set nodes set
the sentiments of that the builders are
with nice because you can use the
Builder you call create and then you
chain functions on it to settle the
properties so it gets rid of all the
setters you would normally use in a
swing up but you can use either in Java
flex you can use the standard syntax
with constructors and setters or a
builder and the crux this application is
just setting up the scene with a group
inside of it and then the image in this
case from dev ox adding a bunch of
children to it for the layout adding in
the effect for the prospective transform
so if we take this out of the combat
this out it should look exactly like the
the previous version without the
perspective chance for you okay you can
see it now the textures are scrolling
normally alright so now you guys you
guys think you could do this just you
know basic java code look at the API
Docs okay well good because we'll be
doing any writing so javafx applications
alright so before we do that let me show
you a little bit about them the
raspberry pi so this is this is not a
pie this is a beagle board but this is
what's currently going to definitely the
dev preview of the beagleboard out that
you can try today it's similar to the
Raspberry Pi they both run armed ships
this one's a newer armed ship is an ARM
arm seven family chip and this is meant
for embedded device developers so it has
a lot more pins for LCD panels and
additional inputs like a serial a serial
input so you can do a serial tap and
debug the device so it's it's more
geared up if you want to actually do
embedded device testing by hooking up
different sensors and things to it but
it's a bit more expensive this is a
beagleboard just I think this is a legal
born xn xn is the later models it has
for us p chips as well but it's I think
it's around one or two hundred dollars
for a beagle board and their 115 okay
what's on euros is it 101 120 or
employers because you see who makes one
got it so yeah anyway this is the
BeagleBoard and you can get that and you
can download depth review and you can
try java and java effects on this today
i'm going to show you guys the Raspberry
Pi right now you can download the the
arm image the Java arm image which will
let you run Java on the Raspberry Pi
there's no javafx version released yet
so that's still in progress it should
come out assume that but the raspberry
PI's nice this is you know st. board
here it's nice because it's it's more
consumer eyes so the raspberry PI's are
much cheaper there $35 then typically
more reliable they've done a lot more
testing on these boards and they
designed them for end-users the idea is
you you can give these to folks and they
could be a low-cost computer and a lot
of people use these for like home DVRs
there's a Linux DVR distribution which
is quite popular for these and it has
everything you need to drive a display
you can drive a 1920 x 1080 resolution
TV or monitor two USB ports you can add
additional USB ports by adding a powered
hub ethernet for networking sound outs
and then the memories and the hard drive
is all on a single SD card so you can
plug in as much memory as you as you
want and SD cards are pretty cheap now
so I have a 16 gigabyte SD card in here
which I think that cost me like under
ten dollars it was cheap so you can get
essentially a whole computer on the
world board like this want to run a full
linux distribution and also run java in
javafx applications on so let me show
you some javafx apps so what do you do
here is I've got the Raspberry Pi let me
let me switch to
Wirecast so they're going to see well
showing all right so I've got a
Raspberry Pi here and it's well it will
be plugged in soon but it's not plugged
in yet let's fix that oh there's an
extra well here use use this in there
because that cables longer alright so
you can see the lights leds watching
Reds powered on and that green light
hopefully will flash soon as well that
means I haven't broken it yet yeah green
flashing let's go okay and then um the
hdmi is plugged up into this guy so this
is a little more expensive than the
Raspberry Pi but this is the way I can
turn my computer into a a TV for the
Raspberry Pi most computers don't have
Louis laptop stone of hdmi inputs so
this is a capture card and this captures
it and cooks up to my computer via
thunderbolt and I have the Thunderbolt
hooked up to one of the Thunderbolt
ports so we can watch it and we'll use
them the VLC media player to put it up
full screen okay so we got VLC let's try
this yeah so that's what happens some
days with VLC i'm using like a beta
version of VLC and it's quite buggy but
it works
okay so we're going to choose the black
magic card if you don't set the
resolution it crashes and it always
populates the wrong media resource
locator so I have to pack this you
probably wondering where I got this
funky capture string from so the very
latest like nightly build of eels VLC
properly gets the right capture string
but it can't pick up the black magic is
32 bit drivers properly the older
version of VLC picks up the 32 bit
drivers but gets the capture string
wrong so those pigeons installed and I'm
I'm doing a whole hack to make it work
this is this is called night hacking
right we have to have some creative you
see like here's the wrong string and I
figured out if you click right here that
asks me why that works but alright so
now you can see the Raspberry Pi screen
and it's a little it's a little tiny but
it's equally tiny on my screen here so
we're at an equal disadvantage let's say
okay I mouse and keyboard
alright so just a normal USB keyboard
and USB mouse you can use it pretty much
anything in the rest for advice alright
so to start with I will launch script
here and I set it up to actually log in
first so I will wash cooked here and I
set it up to launch the dev ox example
so same dev ox example in computer and
all I'm doing here I'll show you the
script well you won't be able to see it
here ok why all the script does it went
to java commands it passes in the java
runtime the JFX RT live the jar file and
then i take the same draw file we
compiled on desktop and copy it to the
Raspberry Pi and it works so you know
not not bad for a little tiny oh yes yes
I'd like to show you the screenshot oh
by the way I think thank Jim for for
being my um my helper
okay so Jim should see that now I hear
you're watching us well they're skazal
possibly but it's awesome this case so
there's a there's a couple different
types of use cases for the embedded
builds in general so one of the ones
which you know a lot of developers are
doing since these boards are cheap and
easy to use is like home automation or
different hobby projects like you can
also write your own media players or
your hook it up to like home
entertainment centers it has pin outs
here you can use to you know get data
from temperature sensors or control
devices so you can also hook it up with
other systems together you know maybe
automate your coffee maker home so
that's that's more hobby projects you
know it's not something you're gonna
make a business on there's a little
squeeze like in the air force or train
stations short information yeah okay so
let me let me show you something else
which is another what yeah yeah yeah i'm
gonna i'm going to show you guys a
secret well i guess i guess it's not
that secret since i'm i'm streaming this
hot but let me show you i don't i don't
have this and that's not it that was the
Agri sense one it's here alright so I
don't have this i don't have this
running on my pie but i have a video
from jasper which shows this and this is
some of this is the initial prototype
captured off the raspberry pi of the
digital signage for for DevOps that
we're working on and so you know this is
all graphics rendered by Jove effects on
a full 19
money x 1080 screen and the idea is to
have this be in the sign in front of the
rooms and you know we this I think this
is in the final final version Jasper
still working on it so what finally
shows up at devoxx might be slightly
different but it gives you an idea of
you can you can this is pulling data
from a back-end it's actually talking to
the dev ox conference interface grab
sucking the data back rendering all the
text doing prospective transforms on the
things and then rendering large large
images and around the screen and you
know even subtle things like the
backgrounds animate in one way of the
own these guys are going the opposite
way and another related type of thing
let me kill this so I have a second
example on the pie and this is actually
what we used for the Java one conference
did any of you guys see pictures of the
kiosks that we had a Java one for the
demo the keynote demo essentially we we
had like floor mounted kiosks with
touchscreens on them and they were
running off of a panda board but it also
works on Raspberry Pi so i'll show you
the Raspberry Pi version and we have a
scheduling application that you can use
together with this run keyword
okay so i'm going to edit the script
this maybe you'll actually get to see
part of the script if you have really
good eyesight all right let's say so
classpath all right so this is launching
java passing in a jar file and then
launching an application hold on a
second let me let me copy this to a
different file alright call that comp
and I see the right jaw felt the jar
file is conference scheduler app so
we're going to change hello earthrise
21 s a conference schedule around oops
and oh I need the I'm not great at VI I
also need the beyond path so here's the
desktop version of those scheduling now
we can check and see what the the path
to run it is it is calm Oracle Java one
scheduled are with an a come oracle John
one scheduled are ok so let's put that
the ends
oops eg eg l FP com Oracle Java lon what
was it again come Oracle Java one
scheduled our
and also I gather oops
all right could not find main class com
Oracle Java one schedule javaone
schedule are okay so we're going to do
quickly because I might have I might
have a slightly different version on the
pie is jar jar files are just zips right
so if we go in and look at it conference
oh I've to use confidence scheduler out
okay well let's try this unzip
conference schedule or as off to
conference scheduler
how do you unzip to a directory anyone
because I know if I own zip right here
it's going to make a mess all right
let's just copy copy it to the directory
and then change the directory and then I
was if it there it's not the fastest way
but calm Java sex experiments schedule
appt is this oh no that's not it konjo
effects main name ok so let's like the
path is calm javafx experiments schedule
up let's try that
calm child experiments schedule up
classes oops was too much
javafx experiments schedule up mane
should I do it's hard for me to ride to
the text isn't any bigger here
come javafx experiments schedule appt
name where's my guy lunch scheduler see
one cop scheduling alright so calm
health effects experiments schedule appt
okay here we go schedule which one of
these could it be probably start
conference scheduled appt like I've got
it so I have the path right I just
didn't have the cut live right name so
it's conference scheduled appt
conference schedule
Oh Tom javafx experiments schedule at
all right come 12 FX experiments
schedule all matches
okay maybe I put the wrong jar file must
not be finding a jar file them because
the path is right so the conference
scheduled appt is a jar file conference
aha scheduler okay let's try this time
it's really going to work if I can use
VI which I can apparently let's say bad
the right version is to launch konjo
effects experiments with your life
conference is scheduled oops
conference oh I deleted too many
characters i deleted too I got rid of a
two and yes this is why you guys are
going to do the hacking because trying
to hack after being on a motorcycle for
seven hours it's not working out alright
work this time work okay so now it's
launching egl pipeline that's a good
sign there's a few different pipelines
for javafx running on the beagleboard or
raspberry pi but since it sits on top of
prism you have 3d acceleration of
graphics so you can use the 3d
accelerate pipeline like EG 0 or you can
also do it within x windows if you want
to have a windowed environment so
there's a bunch of different options for
graphics pipeline as you can use to to
use it ok now we've got right now so
this this was the app of physically
running on the kiosks at javaone and
obviously it didn't have a funky weird
keyword like that i think i have a weird
hacked intermediate version on this
isn't the very final version of what we
showed but anyway you have at the touch
screen ok yeah we should try on in touch
screen we can have to type those of hdmi
does it have hdmi support
obviously this is a modified version for
Jay Paul that Tom made you have all the
great toys alright we will we will give
this so with you do you have the this
one this one walk the Panda thank you
but do you have the adapter for USB to
use of some high no I just going to use
the adapter for the British I'll see you
in a few sit here too long it logs you
out that's a feature especially this is
this is this is good as well to show
people so so would you get this from um
well I or did I I ordered is somewhere
in business ok this there's a guy
there's a guy over and Moses I'm Andrew
a guy over in Malaysia or one of those
countries who makes a bunch of these
with hardware interfaces for pies and
beagles which is quite popular I forget
the name of his sight I have to go check
but so he sells this for the Panda with
the attachment and he also has an
adapter where you can plug it into the
pie and it uses a USB converter so you
can drive the touch screen off of us p
since the pie has no LCD headers but
there's one of the big differences
between theone the panda board and it's
the BeagleBoard and the Raspberry Pi
buger panda yeah yeah bruh confounded
thing we will eventually get to hang or
having so much fun playing with hard way
let me let me swap the stream back to
you so folks can see what we're playing
with okay so if you look at the Panda
here see if you have another problem
with this table I'll show you so if you
feel to the Panda board here it's quite
a bit bigger but it has the same well
almost the same ship this is the main
arm chip so almost the same as what's
running on the pie but a whole lot of
extra ports and most of the board is all
this extra stuff so the idea is embedded
boards is all you really need is the the
ARM chip and one of these other cpus
there's a system-on-a-chip cord on here
as well and it's small enough you could
fit it on a little like thumb drive or
USB stick or inside of an embedded
device but this is a reference platform
you can use to test on and notice this
one has extra headers here actually the
headers are missing that's your problem
it has extra holes here and these halls
actually it's this set right here
matches up with this but you see you
don't have the headers to push it in so
you can also buy the headers and solder
than that which is quite annoying the
beaver boy comes with the headers
built-in pandas typically don't you have
to solder them yourself alright we can
put that later alright that's probably
more about hardly than you guys needed
to know for this but if you if you start
buying toys you'll know a little bit
more okay say like a quick example of
you know javafx this is an actual javafx
application running
running on the high and it's also open
source so if you go to the open JFX
project which is the open source repo
for the javafx libraries this is checked
into open JFX no Jasper checked and all
the code alright let's let's check our
own see what people have been saying oh
the evil bird who know yo bird where was
the evil bert the evil bert was on the
CSS version oh yeah ok this is a.j fall
joke so I'm Bert Bertman is the person
who runs Jay fall and he ejected me off
the keynote stage place for talking
about Java one it was kind of rude with
me to talk about something other
conference at his conference but he
could they kicked me off stage twice
that's evil birth in case you're
wondering alright so let's get back to
close this out and then we could do some
real hacking okay so something else
which is fun to play with the scene
builder so seeing builders a visual drag
and drop UI builder for java text
applications let me um I think our folks
online can't see this there we go okay
so seem though there's a visual building
tool for building Java fixed
applications and what it generates as it
generates XML files which hold all the
UI info and you can hook these up to a
controller so it's a good way of
prototyping applications quickly
something else you should try as native
packaging so you can pack it up download
box applications as that run the browser
as plugins as applets you can use web
step
and there's new native packaging support
which will create exe s for Windows dmg
files for mac and linux packages rpms or
deviant as packages for a linux and the
advantage of this is that it will
optionally bundle the JVM version that
you want to run so they don't you have
to have Java installed other machines
that will just work oh it looks like an
F storm the right side isn't it yeah
yeah it does so I I mentioned in future
refrence with Java on itunes app store
isn't it because because epic doesn't
like Java so far I'm stores so sir are
you sure are you sure are you sure are
you sure they don't like Java on the App
Store I'm sure because because look look
look at look at this app anybody anybody
know anybody know what this app is and
it's in the app store how did you get it
okay yeah so the young this is that the
first app that was released into the App
Store so basically you know the Java fix
packager creates a dmg file in the dmg
files an app and that app is what you
submit to the App Store and there were a
couple issues with either javafx or the
JDK which needs to be sorted out to get
around the likes and boxing issues and
some other constraints in the app store
but they made those changes and we're
able to get the first application
published and presumably you know in a
plumbing release they're going to push
in those those fixes that they made
several one else can start publishing
apps no this is all rights on those
three and the question was does work on
iphone this is for the desktop app store
only right now but you know we would I
think we'd all like it's a work on
mobile platforms but you have to you
have to help us convince or hold secular
management to make it a priority so yell
loudly or send me an email and I'll
introduce you to Nicholas who will help
you get set up with kind of a case study
we're trying to do and all that good
stuff all right so that's a little bit
about packaging and I think this would
be good for your tactical sailing
application oh yeah because this like we
tried to set up the tactical sailing out
here and it took us you know I'm a Java
evangelist I took us five minutes
because we had to download the right
version of Java and then say yes to
stupid security warnings and then the
first time it launched it got confused
about some signing stuff and it was just
horrible but this would not be horrible
this you can use the standard packaging
support today
and then on your website just have
download links for the dmg for Mac or
Windows you can see and people can just
you know no java they can just run it I
think there's a major second right
direction or concept yep it wasn't a
motivation which kind of Java Russians
running a customer son I come yeah I can
test myself there's one pet passport on
like what is out there it is really
impossible it's okay so but has to wait
for so the packaging support is out
already the packaging support is in
javafx the packaging supports in javafx
22 which is already released so if you
download Java 7 and the current teleflex
releases you can use the packager and
then create apps when I think is the
right step into more safe and reliable
and yes so like as a as a as a business
owner you want the ends user to have a
easy easy time running your application
a seamless experience right and so even
if job is installed on you know ninety
percent of computers that ten percent
that's lost business those are people
who want to run your app who they have
Java misconfigured or they don't have
the right version or something so this
gives you a way to get one hundred
percent of you know everybody this the
the native packaging even works some
people with just like old windows XP
systems it I mean it'll run the exe file
and will install it ok we're looking
forward ok so you can be first we've had
the first commercial
yessir never be quite some marketing
buzz ok i will join the faction is is
there already any java have x
application running would you name some
company that does javafx applications as
you explained the year whatever what it
is skywalk explanation and so on that's
like gaming but if you run a proper
application and want to earn money with
it and I wonder if Yama ethics has been
pushed into the market like that yes so
there's there's some good examples of
commercial java flex applications that
are already being used in production and
we had some we had some use cases at gym
javaone so canoes canoes creating a
packaging logistics application so it's
it's for naevus I think Nick naevus was
the company and a big shipping company
and they they they it shows pictures to
control movement of crates and
organizing things also a bunch of folks
have come to us and told us you know
they're using it for you know rail
systems you know visualizing rail
systems a lot of financial companies
like trading applications that's what
I'm looking for you yeah we're going
finance so if you want if you want
specific examples of companies using
java effects I mean there's hundreds of
them but Nicholas has the list of who we
can talk about Nicholas Lorraine and I
can put you in touch with him okay but
is it good
yeah yeah yeah I I think that would be
something good to have that way I
wouldn't have to come up with
you
someone
things but what is kind of a big benefit
when we should say yes let's use Java
ethics and not something else okay Jesus
Oh Jim Joe thanks Jen so I assume in the
Twitter in the chat yeah okay so here's
some real-world use cases of of javafx
okay so mint systems in it software Quan
cell do a foie John lodge on that was
the company that can use working with
okay we're actually known a lot la John
is Johannes company do you have okay any
way you guys can explore the links
yourself but all this is on the javafx
community site which is in this URL and
yet you can find it in the twitter
stream for Jim Weaver which is his
Twitter handles javafx expert ok so you
because discussing two different ends of
job this coupon what you explains is
hardware its lack of gold lovely is a
user info center yet when you yeah
promise yes definitely introduced to be
a rich internet yeah so the reason I'm
the reason I'm talking about this is cuz
it's new maybe to know why I will be
used is you can use for gaming for some
reason is very
is on the rapid ensoniq can also be very
well use for data entry and graphics or
applications honest I know me the best
choice of when to use genres okay so the
reason I was showing the Raspberry Pi
today was because it's a kind of a good
example of something new which just came
out but javafx is really you know the
sweet spot is desktop applications and
has it has a nice table control and a
lot of enterprise control so they've
really been building it up so you can
build you know robust applications with
standard like tables and lists and those
sort of things but also since it's a
good visual environment you can build
more graphical rich stuff I think like
you should show your application with
the boats the tactical sailing because
that's a good example of taking
advantage of the graphics and I think if
you look at the type of problems that
javafx is good for so it pretty much
from and you guys can experience this
one we're doing them tachyon javafx you
can build most things you build with web
apps easier and faster using javafx but
if it's something very visual then you
get this you can do things that aren't
possible in web app right because it's
difficult to do all the server-side
rendering and serve it up when you're
doing very complex stuff if you're
getting something very easy which is
just forms and tables it'll still be
easier and faster to do it in javafx but
you're not going to get that you know
maybe it's you know twice as easy rather
than you know ten times is easy because
it's something which web frameworks
already are very well suited for and I
think the decision on wednes use java
effects or another technology
really has to do with kind of your
deployments and your audience for the
end user application so some folks some
clients are going to demand a web
application because they once they
wanted to run across platform and they
want to keep it in on the clients and
traditionally people have been pushed
that way mainly for for doing
cross-platform an easy deployment I
think if you'll go to new packaging
support in javafx that's a good
alternative to doing web applications
where you're not you don't have a
specific demand to be in a browser and
it's from a deployment perspective it's
just as easy especially now that there's
app stores on each of the platforms so
you could have your app you know once we
get the apple app store store support
out and the same thing for windows you
could essentially have your app in a
windows App Store and Apple App Store
and adi p/n repository and it would be
native and integrated with the rest of
the rock rating system and I think
increasingly in the future folks are
going to just like oh I lost my phone
there is so just like if you look at the
usage pattern on most devices folks use
applications rather than web apps on
smartphones and tablets and you guys
probably noticed let me yeah so so the
app store is an example of Apple pushing
the same sort of technology onto the
desktop so they now have a desktop app
store which matches the phone app store
and you guys have seen this not this one
this is well right so this is the
launcher application on Apple and it
looks a lot like like this and so just
to kind of add one more thing to it so
this is one of the new Retina display
computers
oops I'm unplugging that was not good
all right well anyway I'll tell you what
I was going to show you because then you
can look at it later so they actually
they changed the key layout in the newer
computers and they used to have a button
for dashboard where you click the button
and you got the mac OS dashboard they
replaced that button with a button which
launches the this are not this this this
one so now there's a button on the
keyboard to open the launcher so like
they're pushing you towards having a
similar part on on here as you do on
here and so you know easily you can see
five years from now rather than clients
asking can I have a web app don't want
something can I have it on the app store
can I have it in the VN user experience
at Metro windows metro windows 8 and
also Mac OS X are both pushing
more like we're getting more rich
applications which is what you said but
from the architecture
you
happy like let's say 15-20 years ago so
the mainframe film screens oh you mean
you mean you mean the cloud yes are they
I think technologies tend to be like
cyclical so you know you made fun of
mainframes but actually you know we're
pushing people towards more centralized
computing because it actually helps with
being able to provision resources and
share them and have services where
people don't need to manage them locally
so it was an idea ahead of its time
because that implementation had a lot
drawbacks compared to pcs the same
things true of client technology so that
the thick client technology where a lot
of this evolved from it it had a lot of
drawbacks previously and then you know
the web made the deployment easier it
had lower footprints but now if you look
at it you know footprints on a computer
which has like you know 200 gigabyte
hard drive it doesn't matter so a lot of
the constraints and you with Network I
mean thin clients you know downloading 5
megabytes for an app is not a big deal
anymore so a lot of the constraints
which push people towards web apps
actually have gone away now and it makes
more sense to write applications which
take full advantage of the hardware
with this length right over these cloud
services that they get sometimes
performance as it could be on a fast
computer read that Brenda my condo so
actually with Java ethics we were more
creating rich cline which is then going
the next step which is actually
client-server application which is
running a lot of the programming logic
actually on the computer itself yeah you
get their high performance there we can
use the high performance of the computer
and then you need to interface with the
backends to get some data and the server
actually yeah and I've played a little
bit with the FX yesterday and like the
the widgets and the buttons and
everything this is really easy to use
but what I'm what I have looked yet
experiences how to actually connect back
to the server okay so there's there's
some ways to do it and it's actually
it's a lot of the same technology as
you'd use if you're using a framework
like jQuery to write client-side
JavaScript if you think about it most
modern web apps actually have very heavy
JavaScript gooeys and they do all this
server communication via Web Services
and they cash all the state of locally
and offline storage because that's the
only way to take full advantage of the
client so with John effects you're
always programming in that mode because
you're you're on the client your codes
running on the client and the same thing
applies you can use standard web
services so you could have a backends
using java ee or grails or your favorite
web framework serving up a rest
interface either rest or soap although i
think rests tends to be easier and and
then Java can concede of FX can consume
that you can use API libraries like um
Jersey has a client framework which you
can use directly from javafx or spring
as well has a web client framework and
actually i have an example of my blog
event and spring example where it uses
the spraying rest easy on the front ends
spring web services on the back
and then hooks up the front and the back
end together and there's also a
framework called data effects written by
Johanna Lodge on that was one of the
companies listed here where are they
let's go back to this one so this
company law John has a an open source
framework called data FX and that's a
good way of hooking up your front end to
the back end that it automates a lot of
what you'd normally do with them
communication of objects across the wire
is it open source yep it's open source
okay so i hope answer your question all
right so um all right I've been doing a
lot of talking and this isn't good
because I'm going to fall asleep here so
let me let me just get to the crux of
the presentation okay so there's lots of
controls and components you can use
ensembles a good way of finding out
about those and here's the conclusion
okay so you can build graphically rich
applications deploying the browser clade
applications you've seed and built or
run the beagleboard Raspberry Pi later
all good stuff and let's do a little bit
of hacking on javafx so what I was
thinking we do for the hacking part is
um just maybe maybe it's easiest the way
we're set up here to do for groups to at
a table and then you guys work on javafx
applications you can pick what sort of
app you want to work on and I'll help
you out and it could even be something
as simple as trying out the packaging
maybe you can create a simple happens
try deploying it using creating a dmg
file or exe file for packaging creating
a little business application using some
of the controls or you know even
something complicated we don't have time
to actually get it done but let me show
you guys do you want to do you want to
describe your app
I'm going to show them the flips on the
stream your own tactical sailing up good
keep a selectable well it's just the
other than suggest just click no okay
this but you may guess there is a
application that takes saying yes as a
as a game and we call it play against
the deal the wind because sailing is a
highly strategic game because simpler
explanation is you can't go straight
against the wind you have to go on zig
zag way and what I want to mention here
is we started by designing the front end
and in the middle you'll see a compass
life so which is also used on every boat
and then we designed the simple
instructions to to operate a boat which
is on on focus in the middle of the
yellow multiple this one yes and if you
click one of the four keys tech or drive
and the boat that's what physics is
doing so he can take around and set
sails and put up colors and so on and we
use this application first 488
to educate children how to run a sailing
boat and and what is the matter to look
for and the application has four
different parts one is cold tips that
you can choose on a sort of four main on
the left hand side if you'll put it up
Steve yeah there it is let's say to put
it up some tips and you have a sort of
can't exercise to watch on but as you
see already all the design of the
interface has design Danny not
technically but a designer has scheduled
to do what is in front what has to be
shaved what has to be done in background
and so on and we took this approach and
the second one is games Steven if you'll
just click for moment games and not
which is they re s and you please the
bottom second from the boat against boat
that's it and then next row please mana
this this one yes however if our game is
a boat against the boat this was cousin
introduction and if you just keep a
space the bolts are running and now
becomes interesting to watch what we
have done technology behind piece push
the space vacuum again what you have
seen is that the two balls in the middle
are crushed as we step down to at the
object that have been met the seeds so
all the items not only the keys but all
boats and all boys on the water and so
all our objects that have
characteristics and so we can put up now
played say you said in a good manner or
you have not so lot penalties or you are
racing in a quite foot manner and the
actually game start then Stephen if you
take the menu button which is left of
the yellow one sorry there is the main
menu and you'll see already the the
limits this menu is displayed jittering
which we are not happy on as you can
imagine because people don't like it
does a big of a menu and jitters and but
let's take an example of you take please
let me see just the key week which is
key lavaca this is a huge same event in
Germany and you click please and can
choose another item just take one of it
to buy two or four by fours it that's
very interesting does it come up yeah
you see four columns and four rows that
means we simulate wind changes in
direction and in the force and that is
what makes same interesting because
always you'll see a starting line for
example the wind when you start is
different on the sec on the second row
then it is on the top row and tactically
the wind is changing in eads each square
so you have to think which way are you
going that's a part of the game like
chess part or something and the one will
win who takes the wind always from the
best side not from it forces in
and the wind is shifting and oscillating
and so on and that is it the next step
the simulation is based on high
computational backgrounds because we
have to account to count every 10
milliseconds what happens the wind
changes the customer turns the boat and
the forces changes and so on so has a
lot of computation in the background and
then I would like to show some options
if you like if you have time to do it
you'll just pick again the main menu on
the yellow there it is and you turn to
the right of the menu there are options
and I would like to show on the boat
which is second column on the right let
me see just on the no is it on the left
side isn't it let me see you on the
right side yeah we're more right there I
suppose this one else yeah just click it
please and on top there st. path which
is one option please you said and let me
say there was the bottom fourth it'sit's
Virgie isn't it Virginia and probably
bearing that is also a thing let me just
a click main again I think it should pop
off just click it click it away on small
please yeah that's it and now what you
see is the green boat has lined to go
into the middle of the starting line at
the blue one has another one and also we
have ours on each boat and and these
errors are simulated and display the
wind direction towards the boat and an
experienced sailor that has learned the
tips can now decide which way to go and
his path say it is also tracked and so
he can learn how he goes and how he
should go best way and just started
please and just kick the space bottom
and they should start you may operate
the blue one what's up it's the x and y
x is it now x and y ki and it should it
should turn and and move just do it in
and i'm currently we work on this kind
is a more complex attitude towards the
wind you have sound in the back because
its signals and the other board is
operated by the second play out you just
use key error or left and right but
should move the green boat yeah okay and
that's how basically the ambulance now
you have to come across these
talk on penalties by what i want to tell
is there are many options that you can
see displayed here and on the other hand
we have really to be a keen on all
algorithm to make them very efficient
and i want to talk now about limits but
the direction of limits is basically
unfortunately the the menu already it's
just text it's hard to manage and also
those lines yeah just made out of dots I
may mention that some are dots with
spaces that locals fast and some are
lines that go slower so if it runs
around for say five minutes they start
to do though okay so so one of the
things you can take advantage of in
javafx 20 to fix the problem of the dots
so I assume each of those docs is a node
it's a circle or it's a javafx shape
right so everyone each of those each of
those circles is a javafx shape that's
right here and John effects bez what's
called retained mode rendering which
means that every circle you add is an
object in the scene graph and it's going
to automatically render it if you did
this in swing for example swing has a
paint method and you just your paint
method gets called each cycle that's
called immediate mode rendering so
immediate mode rendering tends to give
you better performance for certain types
of applications because you don't have
to retain a large scene graph with all
these objects in it rich but retained
mode rendering is easier for certain
types of applications like your ability
to use your interface with widgets and
elements in it you don't want to be like
drawing rectangles and redrawing
everything
time you get a pink method call but um
so javafx added immediate mode support
with a new class called canvas thank you
and that's probably what you want to use
for drawing circles if you draw the
circles using immediate mode rendering
all you have to do is keep track of the
path as a you know some sort of object
or you know set of set of points you
draw the circles and the canvas elements
using immediate mode which means that's
very fast there's not a lot of memory
taken up let's see and then even if you
have a long line then you still get good
performance out of DUI because yeah if
those are all circles then you're going
to kill performance javafx is too many
notes yeah okay but no thanks thanks for
sharing this is very cool the one is
another point is you can explain some
ideas of that the new binding concept
you can imagine that we have a lot of
bindings in it that means one variable
looks for each other and keep this up
right and I think they have three times
nested bindings and I put an example to
a spa
awesome yep and he's going to write an
example to convert these old binding to
a new version and it's a week ago
dedicated to him yeah not too bad as I
assume it is difficult now Jasper's just
busy so so Jasper the the video I showed
you with the robots that was Jasper I
was sitting in his office and we were
working on that alright say so let's do
this give me give me the same binding
we'll get it done tonight before you
leave ok so i think that's that's a good
transition to our hacking session yeah
alright so what I'll do is I'll just set
up the I'll set up the screen here so
you guys can see the chat for folks who
are online ok so this is what folks them
is saying online so you can take a look
at that and we'll leave the camera
running for a little bit so folks again
you can check out what we're doing
actually you don't you know probably
makes sense it's not watching hacking
where you can actually hear what's going
on it's not a lot of fun for people on
the stream so probably will do is will
