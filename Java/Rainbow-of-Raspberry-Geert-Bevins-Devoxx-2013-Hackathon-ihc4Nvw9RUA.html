technology Network we're speaking to
members of the java community we're here
at devoxx and we've done a Raspberry Pi
other device hackathon and we're going
to find out some of the projects that
have been done so I'm speaking with dirt
Bethan who is with zero turn around and
he's done one of the cooler hacks so
show us what you've got great yeah so
what I've got is actually a rainbow on
my head so if you know zero turn around
we've always been talking about rainbows
in your pants and this time we think
it's it's a moment to actually break it
out right it's time to come out of the
closet and to put the rainbow on your
head and even over your whole body so
that's what I did and you can just move
your hand around in space here you've
got the 3d spatial recognition by the
leap motion controller that is then
connected to the network through to the
raspberry pi over there that's connected
to an Arduino that converts this two
voltages in real time to control the
lens and so that's that now everyone can
have a rainbow on his body wow that's
really cool so how long did it take you
for you to put together this hat this
took about one hour and that's thanks to
their great installation allows you to
to access all this information on the on
the Java server that runs from the
Raspberry Pi so you just access those
rest calls and you get control over all
these embedded devices which is pretty
cool thing is that erm Tanisha's put
this this panel together so you can just
use your existing knowledge and and get
get these things going well thanks for
your time and it looks like you had a
great time I really enjoy you coming by
thank you so this is Tori we up with the
Oracle technology Network signing off
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
