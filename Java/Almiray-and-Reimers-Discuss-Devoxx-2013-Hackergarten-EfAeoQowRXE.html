Network and I'm here today at devoxx in
Belgium and interviewing andreas Alvarez
and spin Reimers right welcome thank you
for being here so Andres you've been
organizing a hacker garden so tell us a
little bit what's happening there so
what's happening hacker garden so first
let me begin by saying what is a hacker
god acha garden is a group of people
coming together for a couple of hours
maybe three four five and early on with
the side on which open source projects
we want to coat on so it could be just
fixing a bug adding new feature Korean
and screencasts testing out new features
and giving feedback to the project what
is important about these kind of
meetings is that at the end of the
session we all we tried our best to push
the contribution back to the open source
project so opposed to other hackathons
where you just hone your skills and make
new friends and of course learn new
ideas shortcuts you actually make a
positive contribution to the community
and we've been running these sessions
this is the third time in a row at the
box we have run sessions in other
conferences as a matter of fact we did
this year at javaone it was the first
time we change the name a little bit it
was called code garden yep funny bit we
actually had a lots of fun so if someone
is a beginner can they also participate
or is it more for like a senior
developers no certainly the idea haka
garden is to be fully open anybody can
join in whether it be just beginners
students seniors project Lee it's
experts in the matter the the ideas to
get account like app amazing set of
group of people just there brainstorming
clashing ideas together and get some
synergy happening so what kind of
projects were or technology you've been
working on for the last 12 days that
done yes so for the last two days we
code on a je e based applications so
basically what we added were converted
some sample je applications into
arquillian test so in this case now they
are no longer target in a specific
container but now you can use them as a
test harness for glassfish for Tommy
while fly what what have you any other
standard a container will work so that's
great we also hack on on landis yep so
that was one of the other things going
on was a small lambda hackathon
challenge thing so Stuart marks brought
some ideas with them and we pick one
that was creating for for javafx
something so there's this famous you
have to do everything on the event
thread for yo I two kids so sometimes
you just want to get something back from
that call so we thought about well how
to do this with the lambda and the
actual JDK version and yeah we figured
out something and we posted it as a gift
and we will file a request transmen with
a open JFX and see if we can get it in
for a java 9 so how is the Howard alum
does did you find any bugs no no
probably not so we discussed some things
we'd seen before so wise things I
wouldn't fit through the API or which
syntax is in which place available and
one are so those things were discussed
along route so yeah so it's a it's a
good way to learn actually the London so
plainly yeah yeah so you just don't go
there for just being that the project
lead and then leading people going there
and learning something for yourself as
well so I'm doing something you doing
something hands-on and giving back so
you were the expert for that first year
was the expert and I was the guy trying
to figure out a way and solving this
puzzle so yeah so you learned a lot yeah
I said you can learn more than just idea
shortcuts we iscandar sessions yeah yeah
so we brought people together people
interesting Radel doing things with a
nap beans and Gradle figuring out new
things so making contacts to people so
yeah yeah it turns out that there was
another project called memphis memphis
is an open-source scam like a
humanitarian effort as an open source
project for micro payments this project
has a very long history eight or nine
years now going they even won't the
Dukes Choice Award a few years back and
they are standard web application and
what they wanted to do is bring it
forward to the two modern technologies
so they also participated in adding
arquillian based tested they also
migrated from maven to Gradle which was
another common theme in the different
groups that we had so we are actually
jumping from one table to the next this
is how you can do things in our killing
with this way you want to do use this
other problem with Gradle oh no yeah you
want to use this other thing oh yes you
can do it this way so that was plenty of
cross-pollination this thing so we still
have people going on at the moment but
yeah yes supposedly the hacker garden
was only for Tuesday but we've we have
two rooms on our other side or where we
are currently sitting and surprisingly
people are still hacking and today that
is late people are maybe going for a
beer or joining a bob session they are
still hacking and then that that is
amazing so how many people do you think
you had I mean if you had a chance to if
I had to count the three days say that
we have roughly 40 people is your
assumption so we had to compete against
the sessions there is a such amazing
content this conference and even so
there are still people working on the
code
and how long do they stay roughly I mean
in in general do they stay like maybe a
couple of hours and go and do something
else or do they stay or you have some
some people would just stay and untie
your data I think there's a enterprise
guys they really stayed long yeah so we
were closing shop at six on Tuesday and
arun gupta what happens us and he said
well you know guys it's time for me to
to close this thing there are other
things that I want to do there was this
guy that there's just one more please
just one more and I will do it and
they're closing the room now don't worry
i will continue later and he received
later in i saw yesterday he received
more pull request of the stuff that
these guys were doing alright so yeah
are you going to do it again certainly
we're going to do it we will continue to
push this this is an initiative that it
started back in in 2010 in basle where
where I live was it started by another
colleague of mine Hamlet Darcy and we
have exported this idea to other
conferences and to other countries for
example we try to run this monthly these
meetings in Basle and other places where
this have been successfully run is
Vienna London Seattle Mexico City
Virginia in the US and the J focus
Copenhagen great conf de boxe in here in
Belgium so we certainly will continue to
do so next year the next one that I have
sure that it's plane is a javelin next
March great so it works across countries
cultures yes mix of it right it's a very
good name works great thank you so much
for coming and explain to us what what
is happening with the haka garden thank
you thank you everyone thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
