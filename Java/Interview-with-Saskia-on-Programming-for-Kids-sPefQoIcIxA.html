calm and we're here at the j fall
conference doing interviews today just
had a great interview with Garrett
Grunwald and also case john coaster and
now i'm here with Saskia for me rooms
and we're going to chat about the devops
for kids events that just happened a
week ago hi thanks for having me so
before we get started with the the
interview i wanted to play a quick video
clip about the conference we're here in
the netherlands at the jay paul event
put on by the netherlands
golly user group and I'm always
surprised what a big event
do this
but I'm enjoying
all right there no but I
CS talking over the video clip
yeah they also do like really nice to
give production although the video
what's wrong
video dead okay so um I had a lot of fun
at the dev Oxford kids event last week
it was just one week ago right it seems
like it was 26 of October so one and a
half weeks ago yeah I'm still recovering
from it and I was impressed we did a
similar but slightly west less organized
event for the Silicon Valley code camp
to do a kid's event and we had nowhere
near the level of organization and
polished which you guys did for the
event it looked like you'd been your
tenth or twentieth the box for kids
event so what's your what's your what's
your secret it's actually running a good
event yeah well actually it was Jada is
running in the event so it's only women
running don't want to be sexist but
we're just good at it okay do you um do
you accept hiring will hire you for our
next Silicon Valley she'll come if you
organize it okay okay I'm gonna keep I'm
gonna hold you to that um so I also have
some videos from the from the event that
we can we can talk through I didn't
believe this is the opening keynote yeah
so we got someone from the company 42 to
do the keynote he needed some live
coding which i'm not sure every kid got
what he was doing but in the end he got
the asteroids to run and he could shoot
them down so that was white so it was in
a dutch and i couldn't follow nearly as
well as all the kids in the room but my
impression was that they were having a
lot like the UC they're having a lot of
fun so he was definitely good with the
kids ya know they were they had his his
full attention so yeah that was that was
great and there are a lot of parents
still there and I
rather not have them there the whole
time but when he was finished we made it
clear that the parents should be staying
all day so they left all right good yeah
kick out the some you know parents so
most of the other video clips i have our
of the Raspberry Pi workshop which Iran
while I was there you know
coincidentally the video gear was with
me semi hits mostly kids playing in my
workshop but just to give background the
way the event was organized there was
believed three three time slots and then
three groups of kids who migrated three
gets groups of about 20 kids that
migrated between the different workshops
so all the kids got to try all the
different activities but then had
individual attention since there are
pretty small groups yeah so we set it up
for 60 kids maximum and actually 57
turned up and we split them into three
groups of 20 and the only of course we
had three workshops plans so it was
scratch minecraft modding and Lego
Mindstorms and then in the end you also
agreed to come for your Raspberry Pi
workshop so what we did is we split up
the group who was doing the scratch
workshop into the older kids and the
younger kids because of course it was in
English or workshop so they should
really understand the English and I
think it worked out fine with the yeah I
was surprised that we had we had pretty
good results I think every single group
in my workshop modified the game and
wrote little Java code and compiled it
and got it running so it was nice to see
that um even given they only had half
the time which they had when I did the
workshop the previous time but because
the groups were small and there were so
many you know helpers to you know
encourage the kids then they were able
to make quite a lot of progress and not
a lot of time oh there you are yeah and
also what I like to say at the end you
asked
each group to tell them what they
modified and and they all yeah they
sounded really enthusiastic of what they
actually accomplished in that one and a
half hour cool so um what other well for
the viewers on the stream can you
describe some of the other workshops
which are running at the same time yeah
so well parallel to this was the scratch
workshop where scratch is a visual
programming language where you can
easily click and have sprite which is
the object or you're trying to modify
can do whatever you want and then there
was the Minecraft modding workshop where
they had a noho Eclipse set up with the
Minecraft classes which are actually
written in Java so they could start
minecraft from the eclipse and actually
a modified code in within the Minecraft
and restarted again and see what the
result was and the last one was the Lego
Mindstorms where I had asked the author
of a book for the NXT two mindstorm who
did a lot of nice assignments for he
actually took upon itself to do this
workshop and yeah it's a lot of fun
model doing all the assignments for the
Lego Mindstorms yeah so I don't have a
video of this but one of the things
which we also did in my workshop as we
had a little fun with the lego
mindstorms ev3 and i think i was a nice
way to warm up the kids to you know
running java on on stuff other than a
real computer yeah
I'm afraid the nose was broken every
time they tried it though cuz it fell
yeah Tony and I fix that he um Dukes
nose has been glued people never it will
never break again at least in that spot
so but you were telling me about the the
Duke and the Duchess what about the
Duchess in the bow alright so it's a
surprise but coming up for the DevOps
conference so Angela casado is going to
be coming out to speak and her and I so
the original Duke that I used a java one
got stolen out of her car actually and
it is I feel bad for her car because it
got broken into but I think the robber
didn't actually want to steal Duke they
just wanted to steal bag which looks
like it was a laptop and they got a
surprise they gotta do kid but it was a
good excuse to rebuild it so Angela and
I both rebuilt Lego Dukes from the
ground up and her version like you
mentioned has a little little bow on it
so that should be that should be pretty
cool and it's going to debut at devoxx I
prepped her with an SD card and I've
been chatting with her about getting it
set up so are you gonna be at the dev
box event next fix ok so you'll see the
yeah of course I'm gonna carry your
stuff remember yes sitting in my hallway
all week thank you yeah so the lab kits
I used at the dev ox for kids
Netherlands event are going to appear in
you know in your car up here in in
Belgium hopefully yeah don't wait
they'll be there
cool so um why don't you tell us a
little bit about more about kind of your
thoughts on the best way to teach kids
programming maybe for parents or folks
who want to run similar workshops and
this is also a good cue for um our
audience here in person and also folks
on the stream to ask questions yes oh
well actually after this interview all
will be giving a HJ full session with
Kim who's sitting there so we're going
to go through how to get your kids with
what tools and what sort of events you
can get started on and hoping to inspire
more people to to start activities like
this and well the main thing is that you
should start with something simple where
kids can actually really grasp that they
have influence of what what is happening
to on the computer and just by wall
scratches is a good good starting point
where you can just easily drag stuff
onto your script and and run it and see
that it's actually doing what you
thought it was going to be doing so
instant gratification is the key word
for for getting kids started yeah so
kids like what we want they just they're
not gonna put up with the boring parts
no they're not yeah no they just want to
move fast and yeah well I I've three
kids and what I see is that they're
mostly consuming computers and iPads and
iPods and they're not creating anything
by themselves and yeah
starting with with the small programs
they can see well I can actually have
the ability to do something at the
computer him cool and therefore folks
you don't know scratch comes
pre-installed on raspberry PI's yeah so
you just start x windows on a Raspberry
Pi and you're you're scratching on a
cute little embedded flatline cool I did
not know that all right so um any
questions yeah comments I gave you guys
a little warning right a little all
right we've we were very shy they're
probably waiting for your talk coming up
in a few minutes that they're gonna ask
all the hard questions there probably
yeah well they heard it already yeah so
Kim is giving the talk with me this time
not Regina alright so thanks very much
for coming on with me on the night
hacking stream thank you thanks for
having me yeah and I look forward to
well good luck with your talk I look
forward to seeing you at the dev box
conference upcoming as well alright see
you there then so um if you want to see
more videos go to night hacking calm and
to give an outro since we're at the j
fall
conference in the Netherlands it's been
a long day this has been a long day I
have a little video from the NL jug
which which runs the event here to UM
close out the stream
