I'll deal with this what you work with
Tom on beers
okay welcome back 2nite hackings live
stream from the box 2015 so with me is
now Mikhail offer from the Kuti center
for scientific computing Frankfurt I
think yeah so he's doing lots of cool
stuff like a 3d printing but he's not
here for 3d printing this time he is
here for like showing you like visual
programming environments and it's like
very awesome so tell me about you what
you're doing for a day job yes I'll at
the day job I do workflow management
systems and visual programming
environments based on the Java platform
and we usually do that for managing
complex simulation systems so that
basically systems that we write it in
our Institute and yeah so after some
time I discovered that it might be
better to create a general-purpose
programming environment so i created one
swing based environment over the last
few years it has a nice plug-in system
and it's based on on groovy and then i
even went further in my PhD work working
closely with the groovy compiler i'm
getting all the information from the
compiler to really visualize data flows
and control flows yeah so that it sounds
like we need more visuals about it so
yeah the talking is not enough probably
yes yeah I mean let me put you on the
screen see okay so now your screens lie
yeah so this is to show something the
visual programming environment that you
can also download it's called vr else to
do so I assume it's a it's a github it's
of course also on get up but you can
also download just binaries for every
major platform we also fit installers
for windows and
so let's get started with the basic idea
so one problem visual programming always
has is who does actually define what
components are available and so my my
goal was always to be close to the
actual target platform and in this case
it's Java so what we do here is we
instantly visualize interfaces of
classes that you can define at runtime
so it is nests it inherits some ideas
from small talk for example because we
sterilize all objects that you see here
so when I compile this class and create
an instance I immediately get a user
interface Wow and I can directly invoke
a method and I can invoke it multiple
times if I want so this is actually very
good for for teaching programming also
and also for like figuring out what the
program actually does because usually
when you have a program working even
with workflow environments it's not very
easy to like get the description of
these blocks here and what would be
better than source code so our dsl is
actually just proved your java source
code so you can easily exit it again and
then here's another example so we just
look at this add method here so I don't
know I maybe I assume it maybe let me
switch to full screen yeah
okay so should be good now now now it's
better yeah here we have 11 add method
if i compile it and i can also create an
instance instantly and then write you
windows and now i can even do dataflow
programming so i can add some input
values here forward into that one and
then if i invoke here it will involve
all dependencies wow so that's cool I so
as it reminds me like things like like
simulink and yes and the cool thing here
is that you can do it with any java
object that is on the heap so everything
you instantiate can be directly
visualize it does it by java reflection
and all these components here can be
defined by using annotations if you want
so you can replace these default
visualizations and use a slider instead
or like you can secure a 3d
visualization so this is this is a life
like you your objects your printing yeah
this is a this is for for the printing
environment so yeah you it's just a
library called JC SG so it implements
their specific geometric generation
algorithm and all these objects here are
just visualizations of library objects
basically so it's just an API a little
bit annotated and you get directly a
visualization so I just had to write one
plugin for the 3d visualization Wow and
everything you see here is also this
year for example it's just from library
and maybe one more example in this
environment the color chooser in swing
so it that is something that that was
actually not so easy to program in swing
but for us it is because here we just
have basically one line we just create
another object and then you have this
RGB yes and you just say I want a slider
and if I compile that I get the color
chooser so I can now choose a color if I
invoke it it will run the color so that
that's how she can play the color to the
to the objector in this case not because
we are not printing multi color and the
color cessful feel like Michael color
would be nice yeah that's that's true
yeah alright so you just chill about a
in this environment so you have another
environment yeah so we have another
sense right like like very awesome
already so you're just going to to to go
even further yeah we can go even further
so fasten your seatbelts it's going to
be more interesting awesome what you saw
up till now it's really convenient for
many situations but if a programmer
really wants to map source code to a
user interface you still have to have a
control flow and data flow and
everything so I thought why not use the
whole the full information available
from the compiler because usually we
compile programs we even have a steep
transformation and stuff but when we are
done with compiling we basically throw
it away just the effect of the
transformations they remain in the
bytecode like goofy does you can like
automatically add methods or or do some
some logging or stuff like that so you
have different annotations and that's
really convenient but still this is not
enough in my opinion because an
application is much more than just
transforming an AST in a way because you
have to connect to use interface or to
some interactive parts and so also hear
my idea was why don't use the the
information from the compiler to
directly communicate with the user so
what you see here is a direct
visualization of the source code but
this is a java FX base use interface
it's still a prototype so
you can also download that on github but
yeah as it is a prototype there you have
to compile it yourself as a moment
shouldn't be a problem now shouldn't be
a problem it's great a base so it's
really straightforward so I can zoom in
even and what you see here is now just a
class called me it's this fast we can
see you're on the left leg yeah and now
I can change this source code and now it
says well groovy so we have a really bi
directional mapping between source code
and user interfaces and this user
interface could actually be used by even
an experienced programmers because they
don't they cannot destroy the program
they cannot introduce syntactic errors
in the air which yeah yeah and also this
editor knows about everything you do so
it can select the visualizations based
on the visualizations you do in the text
editor so this is all groovy based
that's all groovy bass so the other
environment was also Ruby paste it used
truly as a programming language and I
use the rupee compiler IPA API already
but this year is pure groovy sense that
yeah you still access the whole JDK and
everything but I used the groovy
compiler to to get all the information
so but by any chance you're going to do
this for java as well or only groovy or
go to scholar or closure or so actually
I started um with groovy because it's so
accessible and I only did a subset of
the language yet because I I want to
prove a point here so that the whole
concept works and after that I would
scale that up to actually full Java that
would be my first target so what I do is
actually a subset of groovy which is
like also a subset of Java in a sense so
we have a few exceptions so you can
leave out like modifiers and stuff but
basically if we will sell
so to trying to get a prototype working
on a couple of couple of things that I
Bella groovy and Bella Java yes I'm
taking it further for a expanding it to
the whole space the thing is when you
only talk about it then people really
say yeah is it worth the effort I don't
really understand whether that would be
beneficial yeah but when you really show
a program when it's running they usually
get the idea so probably we should do
that here as well if I run the program
wow I really get the intermediate result
like like like every object result is
like rendered everything is rendered in
javafx so in this case that's why we do
also 3d printing because it's a very
nice implication of that environment the
thing is we instrument the whole thing
here on a language model base so we
don't instrument the the bytecode but we
add instrumentations to the actual
source code and by that we can even do
selective instrumentation and also
optimizations if you want and what you
see here is also the profiling
information now this red box here in
execute all the other methods here
actually that's the one that takes most
computational wise takes up the most
time but these are actually executed is
that method and you see we don't touch
Class A or B they also get the sense of
code coverage ok so that's you can
convert eyes killed coverage yeah this
is actually visualization of code
coverage I mean we we don't have special
visualizations like how often you go
through through one path or something
but you get you still get kind of a
feeling we're code gets executed where
it doesn't and the cool thing here is i
mean if you see that user interface this
is like you saw in the earlier vowels
just a regular user to face you could
ship that has an application basically
if you had an application that does a
complex computation yes and it's just
one method call here on the left-hand
side
it's just this one well and so in a way
it's it's much simpler than many other
environments because you only need just
a couple of lines of source code to get
a full blown user interface and you
could apply to different problems
domains and add your own visualizations
and then you have like a visual debugger
on steroids because no debugger would
tell you whether this geometry is the
one you want or not so you have to have
some visual feedback and also humans
tend to actually ya think visually so
what I also like if somebody doesn't
know programming you still see the
intermediate steps here yeah we describe
what you do i create a cube a sphere and
this is the difference of absolute kind
of documents itself and yeah i also like
the the fact that you can zoom in and
out of us that's awesome very very very
nice so this is already this is a
prototype status and you can try it out
if you go to github and then you can
just check out the rear of 0.5 branch
there and then you can just try it out
just that there is it's a multi-project
build so I can show it here and here we
have a PR lui project and if you run
that you get exactly the same visual all
right we saw there so we will put the
link to the repository on the show notes
so people can't easily figure it out and
download it and get started and please
give feedback if you have any ideas
about that it would also be right to
develop that the writer Al Gore
community and yeah yeah so it's good so
yeah very nice having you here so I
special things you're doing here devoxx
besides I'm doing three deep in Turing's
yeah I have a talk on algorithmic 3d
modeling tomorrow so there will like
have some fun with this environment on
all it's all 3d printing and yeah we
talked about visual programming a bit
and how that could be evolved
okay so uh so a good tip for everybody
yet deluxe I come go for the stork you
will be very visually well yeah that's
true that's what it should be good so
okay thanks for ya thanks for being here
thanks for having me yeah yeah so
welcome so on the yeah the B protocol
the affirmative oh jeez man jeez</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
