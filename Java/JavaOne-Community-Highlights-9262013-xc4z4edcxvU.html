so we're going to focus on a number of
inspiring end user applications of Java
technology and so the goal is that at
the end of today you will see what your
work in the Java ecosystem is bringing
to bear and some of the amazing things
that people are doing with Java well I
have a quick announcement yes so Oracle
has signed an oem agreement with the
raspberry pi foundation and they are
going to start including thank you
they're going they're going to start
including out of the box java SE with
all of their noobs and raspy and images
so when you go and get an image from the
raspberry pi foundation it's going to
include java out of the box that's cool
at oracle our corporate philanthropy is
really focused on computer science
education and our corporate philanthropy
happens through three channels through
our volunteers program through corporate
giving and through our flagship oracle
academy program and the reason we're
focused on computer science and i think
i'm a little bit preaching to the choir
in this room as that we really believe
that computer science skills are a
fundamental literacy skill today as
fundamental to student success in the
future as reading so this is eclipse
with all my source files on it I
he has built this gesture controlled
lego robot everything is one hundred
percent job of controlled from gathering
the sensor data to figuring out what to
do to actuate the robot we use Java
technology to build software that
reduces demand for energy specifically
electricity and gas we save about two
percent energy on average per household
we engage and we've gotten up to a
significant amount of household such
that we're saving almost three
terawatt-hours this year and just for a
scale that's more that that's about what
Sacramento consumes any given year so
we're literally taking whole cities off
the grid we make software that in the in
the ground systems that before provide
flight dynamics and the GSS which uses
Java performs a lot of QA for the
telemetry of the spacecraft and also
produces configuration and maneuver
commands and I answered you have some
very specific things that you're doing
with Java yeah so we just recently
became participant in OpenJDK and you
know most notable for us and I'd like to
give a you know a little shout to a
couple of colleagues of mine Vlad
zakharov and Donald Rob who are
colleagues of mine at Goldman Sachs who
are the architects of something called
GS collections I now work for a company
that does robotics called liquid
robotics and they are not at all like yo
your typical robot is the engine that
never that never quits I've been talking
about the Internet of Things for decades
you know all the way back to the 80s it
was like a big deal for me actually in
the 70s it was a big deal for me java
actually started out as something for
embedded things doing all this
enterprise stuff was sort of an
opportunistic accident that sort of
happened on the wet on the way
