for the Oracle technology Network and
i'm joined by alexandra lease how do you
say a last name nice air Lisa Thank You
Alexandra Lisa and we're gonna chat a
little bit about getting developers
thinking about design yes whatever we
feel like chatting about thanks for
having me yeah yeah glad to glad to have
you we were chatting we were being good
chat about coffee right before they
swear it's kind of a Vaporeon murder
we're equally upset about different
things about about coffee making so I
think that's a common trend you have to
be a perfectionist that your arm
dissatisfaction I guess I'm a bit
worried that I'm going to offend people
huh you should you should that's why
we're having this interview perfect I'm
having coffee now so what was the what
was the kind of the main point you were
trying to get across to developers the
main point was that i wish that we so
i'm working as a designer and I feel
like we could be working much closer
together more closely that correct yes
yeah if we would both look on both sides
so designers are supposed to be learning
how to program and understand a lot of
the technology that we're using to build
web applications or any kind of
applications that has a user interface
what I lack or what I miss a bit from
developers is that you're doing the same
thing to look on our side of the fence
to improve your knowledge basically it's
about skilled sharing so to improve your
understanding of design and what it
takes to design something that is
coherent so probably you're not a big
fan of just um developing stuff through
I can over the wall and some designer
will perfect I love it so no I'm not a
big fan or handovers and deliverables
and deliverables for deliverables sake
so I'm not working in an agency i'm
usually embedded in the development team
yeah okay and I've been for a long time
in the only designer on the whole team
so I do have to draw on the brain power
of developers so I make it excellent
rubber ducky
sometimes i even have something to say
but i missed a bit of getting input from
the other side yeah yeah so um like for
developers who want to understand more
about what things they could be doing to
make their UI is easier to design what
what are good places for them to start
well the first thing would be like
looking for the dialogue with the
designer who has come up with this
ideally would be start or be part of the
discussion the designers are having
inside the team so maybe get designers
integrated more with the upfront
planning design of the the architecture
yes you're gonna be building yes but I
mean it's like that is your your take on
it from the development side but what I
see is like these things run in parallel
so while you're discussing the
architecture and database and technology
that you're going to be using and they
argue everything there we are designing
a concept on the other side and both
things kind of don't work without being
integrated at some point so it's more
about including each other in each
other's discussions okay so yeah because
the the database that you're going to
design and the layer on top of that that
is then making the API is that the that
the interface is supposed to be using
gives some sort of frame for the design
and what the the interface is going to
look like and what you can't do it what
you can't do or well you can't do
everything but how easy it is and
sometimes you're just shooting yourself
in the foot on both sides yeah if you're
not talking to each other so I've been
in the situation where someone had to
redesign the whole database schema
because because didn't do what did i do
what you needed conceptually for the
design of the visual path through the
application correct so I'm not talking
so much about the visuals here but so if
you think about how the functionality is
and how you have the flow through an
application yeah what the user has to go
through to solve certain tasks then the
the underlying the API layer and the
database actually do have a big
influence so you don't want to end up
with joining Phi
if tables just to show one thing so even
examples from like projects you've
worked in where you've seen things that
have worked out versus things which have
been challenging yes well as since we're
usually not working that Josie together
is of course much more instances of
challenging situations where you know is
it sometimes it feels like the design we
the design team lives in some sort of
bubble I'm sure it feels like that on
the other side and we come up with funky
stuff and then presented to the
development team I get told no yes and
they're all like what so we can't do
that so sometimes you work with legacy
systems that are the bottom of it and I
would like to have some kind of funky
interface on top Tori said no I don't
have that data so fine I can't do what I
want to do on the other side I've had
the very nice examples of working
together with that's why I come up with
the database and with the database
developer who was rewriting the whole
database layer and we had very very
tight discussions on how to solve
certain problems that we saw in the
application and he came up with very
smart solutions to solve that actually
my problem okay so with the
communication you were able to get a yes
schema data structure which actually
lets you change the visual experience
the path kind of the users serious so I
wanted to show a certain combination of
data which was not possible before
because was spread out all too far as I
was dead slow and we couldn't get all
the data that we wanted at least in time
frame was lots of data so big data set
and here we had both been banging our
heads against the wall for a long time
to figure out how we could make it work
and what we could strip off and what is
really the most important and prioritize
it and then at some point he just
marched into my office and said I know I
know how are you going to index it and
that's going to work out I worked out
beautifully I was like so it's an
example of where you were actually able
to make a difference in the application
by having that communication with
absolutely because of it to you yes we
wouldn't have been able to build what we
wanted to build and what our customers
asked us to build and we had a clear use
case for
that because of the underlying
architecture yeah that was the you gave
your talk already I think yes I do
earlier today how was the reception from
this is primarily a development audience
here yes java zone of course I mean it's
funny because every time I talk to
developers about it and say like you
know you guys are already designing all
the time all day with everything you do
because you're making lots of design
decisions and then you see some I have
thought about that before others are
just have this click when they say oh
yeah right because I get pictures from
the designers be that wire frames or
Photoshop it's just there is no
interaction in it or if you're lucky you
get even working prototype but it's
still a prototype yeah so you can't
cover all the details so you get that
and then you're supposed to implement
that for real and so like you decide
what it looks like once you press the
button you decide how you transition
from one screen to the other this kind
of in the handover you lose you lose
that communication why it's I personally
don't always have the time to think
about all the details up front nobody
can think about that I think most even
most development teams they are using
some sort of agile or editor of process
so there even the development team is
not architecting things no and then
implementing it's a no executive process
exactly and both sides so design is very
iterative as well so it's like it's a
very common process and we could get
much closer together and that means that
all the design decisions that you're
making anyway because I can't think of
all details it's impossible to think of
all the details that are showing up and
if you put that on some sort of basis
not only in the communication size so
that we have talked about it before but
also because you know certain principles
I mean I don't want that all the
designers become developers become
designers that would be kind of scene
but I'm just knowing this kind of how it
works and how this fits together so that
I know for example that do you need
JavaScript to make stuff happen on a web
page you know yeah on that i'm talking
on that kind of level from as a designer
you need to know a little bit about
development to be able to more
effectively do your job but i knew the
sames true
developers yes correct and once we get
to the point where I've been working
together with front-end developers who
are very good at interaction design
because they care about it it's just
it's like it's a breeze it's so much
easier because you don't have to say how
did this happen cool so yes okay so
you're making a little difference in the
development community trying to get the
word out about having people do more
interaction design yes can I chose with
one tip yeah yeah please I would
recommend everybody who at least cares
about this kind of principles to take a
look at the google material design
specification because that is so well
done in explaining the principles that
are at work to make these tiny details
and to get it right that it will help
you immensely next time you have to
implement an interface material design
or not so that something practical
people can go take a look at and also
working with their designer a little
more closely exactly talk to your
designers cool well thanks for the short
chat here at Java zone thank you very
much fun this is our last interview of
the conference so you guys can watch all
the recordings at night hacking calm and
thanks very much for tuning it thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
