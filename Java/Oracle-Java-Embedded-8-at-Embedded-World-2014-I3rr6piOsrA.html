world 2014 Nuremberg Germany here we are
any Oracle Java embedded pause at the
Oracle booth and introduce you to Andre
three sample
my name is under working for all the
ones in its with Russia a month
lexically and showing the architects and
I'm sure here to show you our challenges
and demos so there you can see we have
various devices running java embedded
throughout the applies to run in Germany
until I seen that so what is running a
me and that's what I see and what I show
here are you can see on the screen of
this laptop that they basically running
the same the same binary we are knowing
and you so be aware that for a long time
history of Java how many worlds and Java
Sea was diversion more and more but now
we are here to bring them over over
embedded world so we've done a major
effort in Java Java 8 to bring down you
gon see closer that's what we're showing
here also we are addressing more and
more constraints embedded environments
and this is kinetis kick 72-hour and
there we are running java me well
embedded s and P X it's really
constrained environment like 256k ram
that the few max of flash and beyond in
Germany here and the application which
rates the experimental data which out of
this device so if we shake it which you
can see on the screen this data to
change the important thing is that in
order to better address embedded market
the additive a very light like strong
and capable in the eyes into java to
provide the application developers the
ability to read the date out of the
embedded devices like super with the
data my square c is the eye passes GPA
or whatever level buses you find on
embedded devices so they're basically
enables you the ability to drive an
application fueling java address this
device has droid device drivers in java
I know all kind of better stop
so that's how cool and that's what
they're showing Thank You Andre</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
