here joined with dan allen and oz lock
and we're going to chat a little bit
about our killing and testing ja ve I
but first to introduce you guys so Dan
your kind of the what was the other
community catalyst communicates analyst
yeah and you're also one of the leads
for our could be our killin project yeah
I'm the community manager for are
killing project and I you know interact
with the community members but also help
with the marketing branding and the
message ok and aww slack here you're the
lead developer for the art Killian
project see technically technically SP
and trying to handle the decor
infrastructure of a merculian testing
platform
4-seeded all the exceptions it's on work
nicely together go call and what do you
get two guys doing at the DevOps
conference today or this week is we
actually are here with a little bit
different mission or approach that we've
done previous years we've done talks
before and this year we wanted to in the
theme and the spirit of this event we
want a hack so we really came for the
hacker garden yesterday nice I mean for
us dev ox is just a week-long hacker
garden every year we've always been here
we're at the tables upstairs in between
every talk doing something so so I think
you have the right place or the icing
show no it's it's within it's the
culture of their killing project I mean
we've had hacker gardens before or
hacker fests or whatever you want to
call them and you can be sure we were
the first ones and the last project to
be sitting there yeah then I remember
last year at the hacker guard I saw you
guys doing our Killian yeah in fact that
was all of the hacks we were doing this
year was kind of continuation of the one
we started last year also somehow year
went by in between all right so for
those of you haven't done the night I
can show before you can join us at night
hacking calm for the live stream and we
have a social channel there where you
can post comments as the shows going on
and it will show up on the screen here
will respond to the folks we've had you
know really good technical comments
folks just laughing and mocking the
presenters and also requests forum for
things to help the community like them
t-shirts
it's all good stuff and from the format
he has pretty informal we'll just chat
about whatever you guys want to see we
can show that stuff on your desktop we
can poke fun at other folks who have
shown up a night hacking or speakers or
people who can't even defend themselves
it's all fair game alright so let's
press up on the agenda so I guess I we
could start by you know what is this
arquillian thing why is the project
called something that I can't pronounce
is it hark Willie hark hark Williams hi
Killian or are Killian so yes Wendy what
are the origins of a ver Killian test
framework so technically well that's the
CD i spec non technically the name men
in black so it kind of the two kind of
converged at once literally so that it's
interesting so the CD i spec obviously a
new respect led by red hat but not just
in the Red Hat style and opens back in
all all regards and one of that was the
test weight and in order to have an open
test suite you had to have a test
harness so in the development of CDI
Pete mirror I put together a test
harness that you could write integration
tests and testament various application
servers that was basically the
predecessor to our Killian so once that
was done delivered immediately work had
begun ozark was in the community at the
time was hacking on test framework for
scene 3 and and probably thinking ahead
of where we were going to go with the
test harness and out of that into the
cauldron when some ideas in hacks and
out came our Killian so the name we
don't really remember exactly the time
and the date when it came up but it
actually works out pretty well our
Killians in the men
back they remotely control the human
body's father on earth whether they do
they protect the galaxy from bugs so it
just fence yeah yeah all right so we
hate bugs so we hate bugs hey things I
don't have seen controlling them like it
off or misreading things yeah there are
concerned they are killing me inside
your container tightly and that plays
into what our you know our killing does
is that it it manipulates containers
handles the life cycle basically it sets
up the integration tests for you so that
you just have to think about what you
want s and not all that nastiness of
dealing with application servers cool so
so is it a minibike one two or three
reference 11 and there's a one reference
to into butters it's the theme of one
okay that's good because I wrote to
wasn't all that good big three was
better actually and we haven't seen her
yet surprisingly yeah it doesn't suck as
much as two okay that's what happens
with cultural references everybody gets
to comment on well and we've evolved the
story around that and actually it's
getting the point now where we're kind
of mixing a lot of different storylines
but that's all right because if that's
the fun part cool you know it's just
like we were mixing software together
mixing stories together okay so would
you like me to show your desktop or you
can start there too I guess we're going
to go into
it was such well I was just saying
switch to his desktop he's got the
website up yeah so when I when I have
your desktop up will show up in the
upper right corner so just keep that in
mind and this is a slightly more tricky
switched them usual but that should do
it hey Keith can you be our stream
monitor and confirm that i'm showing his
desktop because this is one of the side
effects of using B and C as I can't ah I
can't see my screen anymore since i'm
showing yours ok it should be work what
will go that it's working so are you
showing us here what is the main are
filling the Lord websites this way they
were finally information about the
project modules innovation show people
the events Jefferson it was ranked
mentally all good projects in a good
website yeah it's interesting is the
development of the website is actually
an interesting part of the project story
because we developed the website in a
hack environment we were at javaone we
basically said hey we need a website so
we start hacking on it and we actually
developed a pretty extensive build
pipeline that actually puts this website
together by accumulating and
and stealing information from github
from gravatar from Twitter and you know
basically wherever we could grab data
lanyard so the events pull from lanyard
annika you know we you know we were
trying to get Mission Control Center if
you will for the project by pulling from
all these different places and one of
the key parts of it if you like us to go
to community and scroll to the bottom
and click on the whole yeah so we have a
full list of contributors it actually
pulls from github and the contributors
are such an important part of our
killian because we will branch down
every which direction we can in testing
and everyone brings something to the
table some interest some subjective test
framework yeah so we have about 106 that
we're counting heroes United my guess is
there Marcus is whatever yeah some
you'll see some night actors on here
yeah hopefully and hopefully yeah you
know this could be the future of who
shows up on this but yeah yeah you know
and we really it we really like
obviously a porpoise you know
open-source purchase an extended school
request we we actually value this as
much having the people who come forward
that we wanted we don't just want their
pull requests we want that I mean
they're part
we want them to be involved so it says
here you live in Norway I was like yeah
house has it up there right now is it
snowing now as if it's no two weeks ago
so but if you have one for my became so
no it's cold is getting yeah darken dark
and cold but in the summer you guys have
really long days to write yeah then it's
just bright and cold again cool and we
we were probably the biggest in Germany
so when we put out the website we
started watching the statistics we were
interested in who was using our Killian
he was visiting the site but not
necessarily you know other night so what
were they miss a knife had that injury
at hibbett joyful oh yeah right up yeah
in tribute to the so he works on forge
and forges like an automation she'll
probably talk about thing he does the
arquillian integration so basically you
can say setup or killing my project and
boom you got it
go all right so you're talking blog
about Kelly yeah and other random stuff
but we haven't seen in code oh yeah
listen up getting an itch yeah we're
getting at you too so let's let's get
into it so well especially yet but it's
an integration test the integration
testing framework that works either in
container or from the client side of it
so you can kind of become a part of the
environment that you have on their
testing get access to all that stuff so
yep then if you you need to at some
point to find the the the environment
that you're going to run in and that's
by using the deployment and basically
just creating a normal and enterprise
application deployment and in this case
being web archives or enterprise
archives and we're attempting of course
to reuse the component models that are
exposed by the specification that we
have so you checked regularly to be to
inject back to your CD I beans or
resources generous connection factories
and whatnot and from that point on it's
just a normal tests being or could be j
unit or testing g spot for behavior
driven and you start dumping around all
your database isn't what you need to
test and that's basically did the short
version of it and of course you have the
opposite side where you can be a key
clients and just poke at the remote them
p brunette
HTML and jax-rs web services or
politician be for them but it's not just
jogging I mean obviously came out and
CDI yeah application but that's one of
the things that you know we're trying to
get away from someone is that we are
just for job once we realize we can
control the containers well was it
container it's anything that really
started to stop if around the test so
and so I godís is for testing my own
javafx applications yeah we're actually
trying to explore stuff that's even
outside of web apps or enterprise most
most most java sex applications have
some sort of back end web services
things which you need to even test your
UI so people traditionally think of web
testing or UI testing as being you know
all point and click and you I automation
but you get the most value from testing
your business logic the hard routines in
the back end against the server instance
you need something like this to actually
set up the backend server you're talking
in and we've previously done demos for
instance where you have and you're
deploying one back-end deployment to to
the application server and then you're
connecting to a real Android device for
instance human poking from the Android
device to the parasites and an Android
the aura java Betsy why would be similar
from a testing model
and yeah I mean even if you were just
doing this how about with no back end
you might have let's just say you're
running this right you gotta start
database my seed the database the other
types of things obviously idea is to get
all that noise out of your test and
there's a lot of that where you don't
even have to put the noise somewhere
else that noise is just handed you can
do she Claire you know annotations or
whatever or it doesn't matter and if you
look at this test that's up on the
screen there's nowhere in where you have
at test there's no indication as to what
the environment honey can I get a hang
of the green bar yeah I'm really
uncomfortable I want to go in bar one of
us and fancy toys that there's no
there's no special needs 22 lr Killian
oo it integrates with both the or the
test runner that exists in the IDE or
even how Katniss and that's why we're
doing babydoll so exactly so you can be
within your ID and just go run ass jeans
looking at the other side of the body
server-side version of it it's an
experimental message is about yeah yeah
so is actually kicking Oh green bar
three bar alright rebar screen bar now
now he dumped some real hacking we've
got green bars you guys you guys have
earned the stickers sorry we're just
inhale as well or oh we're supposed to
have a failing test first and then yes
well you keep your supposed to change
anything so we can't just make it fail
after we get a green bar to make yeah
yeah we get our again yeah we can be
good we can make a film actually see
that is not just always a great bar you
get yeah positive yeah the best the best
tests I've seen coverage tests zero
assertions call method comment any home
method up we got a hundred percent test
summer in joisey yeah you ever seen that
kid yeah yeah okay Oh red bar yeah what
happened so Wilson oh yes so we got a
green blob what did we get green bar all
what do we write lies oh yeah we we were
run against them and CJ bows say a sense
of occasion sir
so I noticed it was pretty quick to run
the full test suite and arquillians
doing things in the background starting
and stopping servers so how does is any
special or Killeen does to make your
test Suites faster or make running
individual tests faster or it's actually
interesting that you is it just that app
servers will gotten that much faster you
got numbers faster I mean sk7 glassfish
and Tommy are all ridiculously fast yeah
yeah so it did enable incense there's
you a lifestyle of testing is now
actually possible yeah but he goes some
slow right you just you can start the
you have set up to do a remote alright
this remote oh that was doing remote
alright so so if you have the app server
already running and just use the 1-yard
a nice this if you don't have one
running it'll spin one up for the task
pull down basic and so you figure you
you're hacking in your ID right you're
probably gonna have an application
server running I think if you're doing
enterprise development so use that while
you're developing continuous integration
obviously the man is case makes an essay
so we do that we can also do embedded
containers and invariably people say
what can I run into betty container yeah
but if it runs fast when it's running
the real thing is
you're running the embedded container
that you know works in the embedded
container yeah doesn't work out in real
contain yeah exactly so now it's nice it
now you know and Betty containers are
the real app server is actually a small
enough and light enough and fast enough
you don't really need to test in an
embedded yeah you can use the real bad
yeah and I mean part of the problem of
doing the bed it is that you have the
fossils learner isolation problem and
you know that's a problem where well we
kind of have to fix that first before we
can give to using embedded containers
and relying on the results even if the
embedded container is exactly the same
as the main start in a different way ah
but oh by the way you will have all
these extra class pets they can take
samples I can't and so we that's we
advocate for you know having real real
tests so that little sort of stuff came
to a Killian so what else can we do oh
one other reason why and are killing
potentially could be or is faster than
the traditional type of testing or when
you have the full build you have to go
out into your build systems that builds
the whole shebang which takes half an
hour do and then deploy that mega file
that also takes half an hour to deploy
as this is based on the shrink-wrap API
that we use for defining the deployments
so you can very fine grain define which
classes which packages which components
in which files that you will include so
you can really pinpoint which area you
want to test and by pulling that out of
the main builds you first of all use
skip to build and then you deploy
something that is a whole lot smaller
and we have the other advantages of the
IDE doing the
biblical copulation and all that so you
just hacking away and doing run run run
run so that's kind of one neat little
thing about it so you want to open up
the thing that's building here go oh
yeah sorry there you go so you notice
the deployment annotation that's calling
this well it's a static method so you
can move it around and as we just care
to share between tests but basically
this allows you to control the
granularity of your your integration
tests you guys should just test like one
class and it will deploy to the
application server and just so you can
see how does this thing behave if it was
in that business or obviously you're not
doing a complete integration but you may
be doing exploratory testing you may
just try to Pharaoh does this thing
actually get intercepted by anything no
yeah like that has a nice fluent api
yeah and you'll notice that the API can
read a little bit more formally than so
where do you think a des manifest
resource ends up I mean what directory
do you think that goes to maybe the
manifest you know we could have just
said you know add add to zip file and
you would have to type meta-inf so we
tried to you know get the semantics of
all the deployment that you would have
so we also have like add or set web.xml
if you really like prison to what about
how so they have a different yeah a
different stabilized API all the same
stuff actually cuz that's you know
statically typed you can actually get
errors as you're doing things if you
mess up in your own yeah exactly yeah
hurt us and obviously the incremental
compilation is clear here I mean you
have done class the only way that's
it is compiling so well you I mean if
you another way to look at our killing
it's it's the testing framework that
there's the integration testing for me
that one's from IDs these are very few
of them run that way you normally have
to do it yeah exactly if you look at a
lot of the implementations of java ee
specs their test suites are the trophy
they're just scared well they're meant
to be yeah Brendan like and huge jam
monster exactly as soon as it gets
involved in their IDs cool so we you
know we contained it now I mean when you
look at a center of archival the
question always comes up is here but
what if I want to actually test my
actual web app it's built by my build so
you can just say well that's the one I
want to test so important we have a
example we import now another example
but not much more that
create 15 quarter yanks and caused from
that looks import from following
forestry for what everyone yeah it looks
pretty easy we have a hacking progress
where we're actually thinking about
creating an annotation for that use case
so when we decided what's going to be
using hers yeah yeah something like you
sing with a current project Susan
project artifact round she goes so now
you just testing the one you're
currently the module your intern we're
going down in making up the actual web
archive does into module and annoying it
and the other question said that sounds
like something which is an upcoming new
feature yeah whether it were the sort of
stuff are you guys working on to make
our Killian even better Oh always always
so I guess one of the big parts about
what makes our cleaning extensible is
that it's mostly just extensions there's
a core and what do we have well
everything else it stays with all no
internet yes that's a good model that
because you can accept lots of
contributions they prepare I'm unknown
depository and then seven year yeah so
there's a tiny core which is basically a
little limit pushing and then even the
things that you're seeing here is our
extensions of all extension extension so
it kind of ends up being this container
deployment
yes what you can interesting because
well the what we're seeing here is the
combination of the container deployment
and test extension well in well if you
remove the test extension then you end
up with just something that we can
control the life cycle of a container
into the appointments so that's where we
have integration with me or have a
achillion maven plugin the kind of works
like the cherry run for instance where
you can do through or you can find the
plug into a maven hype cycle to start up
the container and stubbly a big
container at nine so he's hacking on
something yesterday with wait oh yes the
exact same thing so you have that else
yeah all right so much a show but
basically simpler than you will have a
task that it's like Gradle plug-in that
will allow you to do the same thing to
call started top of the different
containers and basically handle only the
dependencies this is like yeah there's
who wants to integrate with all these
containers she wants to write all that
Cove so in the process of doing this for
a killing said oh by the way we have all
these container adapters they can start
and stop these processes can we use them
in any other way so yeah Fredo Forge
maven and
even use these things for controlling
them eventually the idea and Tommy is
leading in this room Jas was the first
one to maintain their own container
adapter Sammy was that person on jboss
related project that maintains his own
container adapter and what's interesting
there is that it releases with the
project we can use it for Killian
anything that wants to use that great or
maven then get it for free and you know
that the thing that is controlling the
container is provided by the project
it's the best way to do it etc yes is
that's the Tommy a Java API is for
controlling their container yeah exactly
ok let's see I'm in like right where
people like oh yeah there's there's been
a maven plugin for je bosse pas like
what was about four or five and it's a
long time but then someone who's
interested in for a while then they kind
of lost interest and then people lost
the ability to use Mabel to deploy to
jboss yeah we think that this model here
is going to prevent that by happening
that's more people are conversion at one
point so that will probably be split out
in our Killian right now the container
api's are part of the four but that'll
probably somebody out so that's really
have its own sub project within their
killing go so that's I mean in a sense
that's what has been happening in our
feeling is that we were getting more and
more involved these different things
even even though this is just is a JBoss
sponsored project like you have jboss
people working on it looks like you guys
are much more community focused yeah as
a matter of fact or killings more or
less become
sponsored by rena which is a model that
rennet uses for a lot of its open source
projects just we haven't seen like
necessarily coming out J post-purchase
but it's pretty natural go
but I mean obviously with all these
different container drivers I mean
that's such an important thing to be you
know a community doesn't necessarily
have a bias towards which he adapters
all right if the idea is to get people
you Billy yeah it's also it's good to
see the container providers and Tommy in
particular actually seeing our Killian
isn't important enough component that
they actually are you know working yeah
actual release api's which you guys
actually being be using their own tests
weeks I mean yeah he's our unions test
their own stuff so speaking about you
know eating your own dog food how do you
guys use our Killian inside of jboss
well its campaign is used for more or
less every projects the SAS richfaces
infants management definitely see you
guys should quite a lot of internal
contributions and but yes yeah attention
come from the public TV Department
basically they're big contributor to it
in a unless in a sense that they're the
ones who but forget the crazy cases that
the kind of have to fix consumption to
us go
another end has been luck we were
talking about the the containers or a
container attention and be the point of
exception being one there can be a
controller container controller on the
other side most testing frameworks out
there and to integrate with j unit or
something themselves and then and then i
might you Tim I get it integrate with
custom gene and then they tell you
integrate with the version you don't
want to use and so on there's always
some kind of mix so if you remove the
container and the appointment parts of
our Killian and then you just use the
test extension you can integrate with
the arquillians bicycle's instead and
then you will have the automatic support
for j unit and test of g and spark and
all the other frameworks and kind of one
go instead of having to write all those
silly integration in a yourself because
the test frameworks do a lot of weird
three cover up that weird and we
give you much nicer people to walk on
nice nice yeah I think we've we've all
been there yeah so I mean that's one of
the things that's helped us
kind of get some of the other testing
frameworks on board with integrated with
our Killian instead of me they can give
up having to worry about integrating
with all these different primers and
they get new ones that they haven't done
yet if I just say well if we switch you
on to their Killian eventbus then yeah
we you can integrate with the other
achillion extensions you get spa and
easy being at where we're at ECB Evan
you know Jay behave spa you didn't think
about this equation yet you get them for
free and now you can mix and match a
behavior driven development with our
Killian yeah oh absolutely and in matter
of fact we're kind of going that way the
are killing persistence extensions now
switching over using spa as its testing
for it nice so it uses it internally and
we see that a lot American are kind of
you start hitting the text you can't
because everything is at some point you
have to actually test it for but as much
as we can where r kelly and the fest we
are available yes i see i see a busy
pounding away if there is that's
something we want to say yeah pretty
much we do
I'm falling at nothing if you if you
really want to get into hacking on a
killing and the best place to start get
out that comic alien and you know get a
list of all the modules what's happening
you'll see so many different people
coming in doing so many different things
there was a great thing just to follow
yes we're going to show that this is one
of the ovation for the absence of
integration with Spock see you ahead oh
no that's the so while he's bringing
that up in more things interesting that
not only do we do the test runners do
somewhere sunny spot for instance also
test run I mean it actually has a event
notification see would actually need
that would be useful but when you go
back to integrate with someone right
genius testing g kind of like they give
you some rope and then in other places
they don't and so what we have to do is
wrap and wrap and raff to try to get to
reflect the real information that these
testicles when you integrate their
killing you get all of that basically a
kelly intestine is weakening rupee that
is running within spark and being moved
over to the container sunny said this in
the same process the other one in your
ejecting CD Isis services doing the data
driven solid bottom there with any
different hey I like the old dsl here
for manipulating data in and then
actually checking verifying it looks
like to hear right yeah so this is so
the wind then we're right that those are
actually feel you know
the framework they actually type a lot
of people like they're doing j unit to
just put / la chouette yeah so it's nice
to see it you know actually represented
in the test for and of course you see
the definition is not a method that's
actually a sentence given you know what
would you do when you have that is not
as almost almost a sudden you're like
we're trying to do it's almost a
sentence it's got some titles but that's
how you know this is live this is real
good we're not testing the grammar
exactly so one of the integrations that
were most excited about was actually
hacking on it right now waiting to find
out what John is done in the interim oh
awesome song facilities which you just
did to talk on huge audience in d'box
install was it's basically like taking
baby be too extreme business and so you
you break down the test in the high
level goals the features in
all the way down to the actual
assertions what they call the acceptance
criteria but the nice thing is that when
you break up your Tesla that way you get
these beautiful forts about where you
are velvet process which is great
because that's where post projects you
know fall apart is the ninety percent
how you coming here how far you done
well I'm not ninety percent you ninety
percent today one day gift though so we
Sydney's gives you that nice picture but
of course if if it's focusing on that
aspect I'm actually breaking up the test
into something through the same as the
testers and developers can all
communicate on it doesn't necessarily
worry about is how do you start the
container how you deploy some gin the
container etc so that's what our
Killians good we figured put these two
things together so ya know this is fans
you know like you can see that this this
was clearly done by like a business
focused person from acquirements down
because it's all spelled correctly and
it's all about beer yeah it's much more
interesting that yeah yeah no no more no
more pet stores protected bar judges
bear advise your application nice nice
so this is looks like an hour Killian
I'm gangrenous redstone achillion test
using the do please I said you have to
think of it as two cds two CDs CDs just
lucy's pcbs yeah exactly good god their
cities framework and so you can see the
top of it at story be advised of each if
you read in there that's what that's
what the application should do then your
it's a it's poking at the remote a price
just webdriver just poki procession
testing web pages and this is this is an
early stage integration of the two so
you can see that okay so I wish which
over how you structure as I say the
injected webdriver achillion actually
has an eccentrically enthroned which
hand is webdriver so we're actually
currently working on senior we can hand
off the management of webdriver to drone
and then soon these can use that so
that's kind of what we're working
trying to get changed yeah I want I
don't want your laptop to Don you know
be unfortunate so um please since I'm
kidding is one who's controlling the
container and the deployment as well is
also asking the server basically what
did you deployed so it knows about which
three IP addresses which porch with
what's the web complex which service
were in there which each of these were
in there and it can inject that
information back into your Testament so
we have like the arquillian resource
your elder should be the web content
that you just deployed so you guys have
put that out into property style or
something when you use for housing the
local machine the test for the staging
in the different departments yeah this
looks like this looks like what I wish I
had when I was doing a lot of Java he
like five years ago yeah it's beautiful
okay so to kind of wrap up what would
you like people to take away maybe some
let's how to help with the project or
you know like resources they should look
at to get started though Killian or sure
I mean how about we give them the given
grand finale yeah grand finale so we
have a we have a showcase that shows off
so I'll point two nights in a second the
URL for that we have a showcasing we use
this for our presentation do so in the
showcase we try to show all the
different extensions and containers or
whatever sweet as I decide well why
don't we create our killing universe
test which basically integrates every
possible heart merculian into one test
so here's the mother lode of all tests
so kick it off what's it do oh all right
well it uses a killing quality killing
containers it's using arthelene graphene
which is a slanting wrapper is using a
control to manage the life cycle cycle
the selenium driver it's using our
Gillian warp which combines the Inca
tater and the ankh on client site
testing and then using a concept from
graphene which is a page components it's
like page objects from selenium but it's
a part of the page is not the whole page
so you can inject reusable components oh
thank for instance for a jsf library
like which faces
providing their own test jars so you can
just inject those components when you
have a page do you not do care about
what type of or if they have change the
CSS classes or if they have changed to
you I these are names of we have clean
it clean java api for it go so yeah it
goes on to inject the driver injector
URL injected page reference run it on on
the client side but use warp to when
you're submitting the form piggyback a
server object on the same request which
is our verify conference here basically
in the ass to disturb that is done then
you inject d2b and check that the data
is actually saved so you know that it's
in the database not just being returned
in HTML layer and then of course the the
conference sodium in this case the
conference page and the conference for
our
so I guess not really this would be like
go first or Kelly and test you would
right yeah but but they put the key
about it so that's it doesn't look like
much code I mean it's mostly simple it
has a shitload of things but it's
managing tables as its managing web
driver aids you don't have to configure
webdriver when you have to configure to
say I want to do Firefox or Chrome but
you don't have to configure you know
would any of its sp2 sensible defaults
one of us it just kicks off the flag in
there guys we answer on yeah and so in
addition that you can change the
sequence and sometimes although it's bad
practice you do it sequence tells you
can actually deploy multiple servers and
so you may have to hit a web app on one
server and then check on longer server
to make sure it can pick up a JMS
message they actually do those 15 box
babe are right on alright so I think it
said 99 extensions adventures of our
community and francia so that's that's
an awesome thing blow you away but you
know in a compact way nice basically a
big thurs what is it the
camera that he's got yeah basically just
blow your way Ebola man yeah let's do
another yeah the streets to one more so
so so Manuel warned me about you guys
yeah what's he's like he's like well if
you think you have won our plan for two
thanks oh yeah you guys are passionate
that's good I mean the ones we've seen
so far is basically running against one
observer well you have multiple
scenarios where you want to either
deployed to different application to a
server to see how those application
works in between each other or you want
to point to multiple servers so in this
test case we're basically just with some
simple annotation describing that we
have three different deployments that
they contain a fitness bank cash which
is set up to be replicated and they're
being deployed to three different test
case or two three different containers
so the first thing is when it starts out
with the boys all the deployments and
then you will see in the background that
a fetus band starts to start to connect
to each other and then and as the
different test cases or the test message
goes it kind of pulls them out of the
test class in a sensitivity and it
becomes a callable so you have one test
message that is executed a web server
and then on
the next week to increment the cash go
down and see that we actually have the
same numbers then you do one on the
client just because again and I guess we
could have added warp in there oh yeah
dude that's basically you know there's a
lot of stuff independence also coming in
are killing and we're about just testing
again we were just getting out of the
point where we just thinking about the
global product test and trying to make
it really fun and easy well take the
topic of testing it's extremely boring
we make it a whole bunch of aliens yeah
with a bunch of an alien you know
thrones and robotics and whatever else
in Greeks in space at UC Davis am yeah
so if you if you want to get into our
killer we're killing that or clicking
the big green button you'll have a green
bar in 10 minutes or 15 minutes surface
nice that's the best way to start no one
component one arquillian test get your
foot in the door hack on it and
you know from there ooh nice whatever
you looking to you know the modules and
see what you find interesting but go to
the guys we've spent a lot of time
getting the guys because we know that
that those first steps are so important
so that's a great place to start whether
you're mean whether you're a hacker you
know your developer you're a person
wants to integrate with our Kenyan
you're a person wants to add stuff to
are killing everyone starts there so
yeah it's the best place to get Stern
all right well Oh says a man's life the
game started and got it's also
interested in Devon oh yeah hey gorgeous
so if you need that so language you this
because if you go it's good and if we
are missing a language we love their
habits yeah as I French yeah we have we
have quite a large French leadership now
nice away from missing some of the
French translation was actually
interesting because the French
translation was done by two different
people is the only translation where it
was reviewed by someone else who wanted
to make sure that it was as correct as
possible the French language well you
know that but they probably really
wanted was the originals in french and
all the others i just translations of
the master
they were arguing over whether that was
the right way to say that in technical
sense of got to hear that's a good diet
i think if you speak French you're in
good shape might be bearish in English
all right so I want to thank you very
much for having us all thank you for
joining me for the night hacking show
our next events at devoxx is we're going
to be sitting here tomorrow morning with
Heather let's say she's a 1050 central
european time but you can check the
ustream channel for the exact times and
thanks again for joining us on night
packing visit us at night hacking com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
