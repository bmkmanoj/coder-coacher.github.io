and I'm doing javaone interviews with a
bunch of different speakers and
luminaries who are going to be at the
conference javaone San Francisco's
taking place from September 22nd through
September 26 then is the largest Java
conference in the world so on skype chat
here I have Paul Bakr and tell us good
morning Paul so that's that's a very
nice room you have there is that your
official office work environment well
it's my working a fireman's and it's
also my living room I'm going to do work
from home most of the time and I used to
have a separate office but decided if I
work at home all day anyway then we'll
why not just sit in the living room and
F a little bit more space very nice very
nice actually the you can't see it here
but the the streaming room i'm using is
actually our downstairs living room
which i converted into a very large
office so I get ragged a slightly better
view here as well so we're building into
both in our personal offices yeah and
what tell me a little bit about your um
you know your job interests what's
what's new and exciting for Paul yes sir
so the company I work for us called
luminous and we're mostly based in
needless and then as i said i'm working
at home my most of the time i work as an
architect for luminous which in my case
means that i'm just writing a lot of
coats basically which is good yeah
because i like doing that and while
doing is doing a lot of different things
here we work for a lot of different
customers but for the last two years
actually seen their started working for
luminous I've been working on one large
project and the project is called the
full Sun and sometimes tweeting about
that as well and there's a project and
where we build a system that's be used
in high schools currently Ned land
somewhere else oh I do two pilots in the
USSR equal
yeah and their students and teachers
used as for more personalized learning a
file and experience with that we're
trying to well change that the way
people learn more or less conscious well
a lot of things wrong with schools well
at least in the Netherlands in a moment
I mean trying to improve that it's just
a long and difficult way but it's super
interesting nice you're very passionate
about education yeah well I mean I mean
I just do this well by chance brawl it
mmm-hmm but it's so interesting that
it's yeah it's absolutely good to work
on that cool so um while we were
chatting earlier we had we have a bunch
of people on the live stream and somehow
Jim Weaver was able to figure out that
you're a Metallica fan just by just by
looking at you so it's true so tell us
what your favorite Metallica song is Jim
would like to know um I'm not exactly
sure i like i like more of their old
songs actually so much more puppets
picture and the memory remains sometimes
like that and it was so actually it's
funny i was driving back and back home
and I was listening Metallica wait a
minute open quite too loud so uh yeah
I'm and it's eating it pulled over for
disturbing the peace in the Netherlands
there no as you know we don't have rules
in Netherlands show up everything goes
there all right very nice so I'm gonna
I'm gonna pop up a shot of your um
slides your desktop there and actually
that's that's your new book building
modular cloud apps with osgi so how is
that going that's pretty good actually
be gosh out we are finished with it yeah
it's always good when you're finished
with a book as an author that's a great
feeling so congratulations thanks you
know on the writing experience is great
because it's just nice to well with
things down on paper and trying to
explain concepts to work
people they have a quite difficult face
of editing and editing again and getting
feedback etc but now we are pretty much
true with that and it's coming out in a
few weeks probably right before that one
oh very nice so speaking of travel and
what are some of the sessions you're
going to be presenting on so that big
topic is obviously modularity that's
also when a book is about and this year
I have four sessions and it should be ok
because last year at size 5 and they're
all about modularity inch in some way ok
actually see that slide I i just changed
yep yeah ok so the first session that
I'm going to have this building would
like clarifications in java lessons
learned and that's an it's a one-hour
talk and there we i do not want to get
up inverted so i heard scratching the
background there and sorry mama this
might get oh very nice huh again how old
is your cat I bout a year old oh so he
here is it he or she and that's it he
and we have another one I was just a
sheen ok he jumped in from the camera
before so that's a pretty big kitty for
one year old yeah they are pretty big
well just beat him too much but that ok
too yeah bring it ok sorry to interrupt
you you were talking about serious some
session session all right so I was
talking about the first week I already
talked for Jeff one and this one is to
get up with Bert Earthman um well you
know aim of course oh yeah Bert's great
puts on a very nice conference as well
Jay fall yeah which tells are coming up
they're quite sounis in the beginning of
november yep and the call for papers are
still open today's the last day so I'll
certain you're telling me I should put
in the talks I've been delaying for the
past that's that's the hint i'm trying
to get yep
okay very good so you know how to be
talking about modularity what else what
else are you talking about a Java lon uh
well I just modularity actually so we
have a bunch of difference and dogs been
different ways to look at it actually
but it's all it's all about modularity
that's kind of my original beam through
all of the Java on the mountain very
nice yeah and also your bus yeah which
is nice actually to have a team like
that because then well just the thing
you're busy with all the time and that
makes sense very nice so one is first up
we are basically going to talk about
some best practices accusing a modular
approach we're talking about osgi and
how you just set up your architecture
for that it's a lot of best practices in
it from the project that I was telling
about the earlier you'd be using osgi in
a modular approach in that project and
we've learned quite a lot from that and
we're going to share some of that in
this one-hour talk cool let Stan that's
the first talk and then the second talk
is a tutorial so that's what is it to
our talk not even sure I three tutorials
are two or three hours at yup one I
think it's in a two hour range but you
know you probably task like a conference
chair someone who actually knows this
stuff yeah well I probably figure that
out before we actually have to be there
that's also about Blair and in that talk
we are going to do a lot of live coding
actually and we're going to show you ogi
from the ground up so um a lot of people
will probably know a little bit about oh
she I would never reused it they
probably think that it's really
difficult and hard to use and that you
have to go through a lot of painful
things to actually get them and get to a
modular approach and we're going to show
that's actually not a difficult and it's
actually something that everyone can
just start doing cool and and you're
gonna show live code it can prove to
people that it's actually not that hard
to get started those
exactly very nice so in this in this two
hours we are going to discuss some
architecture to start with and then
we're basically going to build an
application from scratch with lots of
enterprise like things on it like
usually move ODB and building restful
web service and stuff like that cool and
you have a third talk as well right yeah
so the dirt talk is modularity again of
course with us more about infrastructure
and deployments so the project that I'm
working on we are deploying in the
clouds we're running on the name of some
clouds and we do need quite a large
scale because well there are a lot of
students obviously and we need to scale
out to a school's real of students all
using the system at the same time so it
using the cloud for that but that's well
of course easier said and done because I
mean talking about it plowed the
scalability just that's quite easy and
you've been hearing that for the past
few years but actually doing it it's
actually well you need to set up quite a
few things and here we're going to share
best practices on how we did that and
what we've learned from that reclines
talk about provisioning with apache ace
which is project that the that you've
worked on a lot as well some things
about scale 0 sketch scaling and
failover and modular deployments and
Dundas raid the other side of fun well
I'm being modular and going to the
clouds cool
so you got a you got a lot of
preparation for java one how's the
session prep going with paul are you
guys almost there um well luckily we
have been doing most dogs before already
um another conferences so I Demi well at
least I get it get got kinda basics
already which is also good because well
the third and fourth time you're doing a
dog is always better than the first time
yeah yeah see you you went to those
other conferences and you practiced and
prep for java one right yeah more or
less maybe are a lot of fun person plus
especially together with Bert cool and
which is always fun but sold also good
for your dogs because they just get
better and better and better so yeah one
is going to be like the grown female
very nice and what are you actually
headed out to San Francisco are you
gonna fly in the weekend before I'm
flying in on friday and then I'll
Saturday we are probably going to do a
wine tour or something like that I'm
getting with a burden to other
colleagues of mine Marshall and Sandler
and we're probably going to do a wine
tour evolved into Central Committee damn
shorty someone yeah yeah now that is one
of the highlights of coming to sick bay
area's there's quite a lot of stuff to
do within yeah yeah there is niggas my
sixth or seventh imma jump one and this
year but it's always still fun to come
back very nice alright so we had a
question from the stream Jim Weaver was
wondering what example cases you're
using html5 for and what the sweet spots
would be so maybe I actually just that's
a question that's quite related to the
less talk to that nothing i just put it
on now on the screen and roll because
they are we going to talk about well
modularity still but modularity on the
client sites because we're going to talk
about modular modular javascript um the
project that I'm working on VR it should
work on all kind of different devices so
all kind of different tablets just
computers and it's all in a browser
search all html5 it's pretty good on one
side because you've got a portability
and green devices but well it's not easy
as well actually to get into JavaScript
because if you're going to do a lot of
client-side work well you're going to
write a lot of JavaScript codes and if I
look at myself at least I've always seen
JavaScript a little bit like something
that you know designers I should do I
don't really want to care about
JavaScript too much because well I was
doing the back end stuff and I was using
Java it's yeah maybe sometimes you need
to be able to do the full end-to-end of
the application so you probably dipped
your hand in quite a bit yeah so at some
point we just figured out what this is
not something you can just do some let
you I guys do this is some serious
programming work now yeah because we're
just doing so much javascript in a
moment if well we've been struggling
with that because you need best
practices for how to set up your code
how to be more jeweler and how to
maintain a large code base etc questions
that you would have on offense which job
is quite good good yeah and so we've
been spending a lot of time while
learning our shelves or teaching
ourselves how to do this in JavaScript
as well and well that's that's what the
last level let's talk it's about noon
dealt with solar mark or click on mine
cool and now you're going to share some
of your experiences and best practices
from working with quite a lot of
JavaScript and dealing with module
systems there as well yeah exactly
that's going to be interesting is first
I'm actually going to talk about
JavaScript on the only big corporates
and I didn't see that one coming
Michelle Peter yeah yeah very cool so I
look forward to seeing you in san
francisco at javaone it should be quite
a lot of fun any last words you want to
leave with our viewers know helps you
all if you want one
forward with cool thanks very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
