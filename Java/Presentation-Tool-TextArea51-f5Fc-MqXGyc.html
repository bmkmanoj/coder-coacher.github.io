streaming live from the nine hacking
stage right here at devoxx belgium at
the hacker garden space with me as
guests I have dan allen and huber
selenium phone open device you might
recognize the names because these people
have been doing amazing stuff with
documentation on the ask a doctor
project but today we want to talk about
presentations I think that you have a
couple of demos that will amaze all the
people around here so can you tell us
more about what's going on so I think
you said something about a presentation
console before we get into the because
today so that that's quite interesting
sure so first we start out by saying
we're kind of rejecting the traditional
presentation tools and saying what can
we do with the web so boo bear did to
talks at devoxx and each talk had a
different application basically that was
behind the screen so he's presenting
when he's showing up on the screen both
of those were custom designed
applications in one was a little bit
older 11 the new presentation council
would like two and a half weeks old okay
so we're talking fresh off the press
here and with the idea is that if we
want to have a better presentation more
engaging experience we need to treat it
like an application so I think it will
start with a tool that you bear created
called text area 51 for live coding so
this presentation is about CSS and you
could talk about CSS and you can say
this is how CSS works or you could show
how CSS works and this is going to be
much more effective and it's currently
what one of the top talks at this dev ox
and it's about CSS so our dev ox CSS is
the number one talk and I think that
that speaks a lot to the fact that it
resonated with people so we'll let him
show off some of this tool yeah so
basically I built this tool for DevOps
friends 2015 I would want you to do a
talk that's called CSS for newbies and
we address the really simple basics of
CSS and at first i was like maybe i
should use my own
and I'm gonna have a few code examples
repaired in many files and I'm going to
go through the files and I mean it was a
quickie so 15 minutes you don't have
time to fool around in there in the
project tree so I thought about using
maybe Jasmine all cut band a few online
code editors that exists because they
are really awesome and at the same time
I wanted to have some kind of slides so
i was like maybe i can build something
that sits in between so introducing text
area 51 work in progress title may be so
the idea is that i create projects on
this pain here i have the talk i did
here in Devil's Belgium which is flexbox
now make CSS great again with fun again
with flags box and so it was never great
to begin with I'm talking about CSS by
the way so in the in the tool I built
you have first to create a project so
here I have flex bucks in CSS so let me
undo and then you have to create
sections and actually sections are
basically slides that you will be able
to go through with left and right arrow
keys so you create your sections and in
each section you can create files so any
kind of files when in the in this
example there are HTML CSS and sometimes
javascript files so here i have created
an HTML file and to CSS files and if i
click here actually arrived so this is a
full screen browser and hear what you
can see sorry what you can see if i show
the header is the name of my project the
name of the current section and all the
files that are on my section and if I
press next here or if i do it with my
keyboard I can go through
my slides which I call sections and
actually I have a set of keyboard
shortcuts for each slide so as I can see
in my header that I don't display during
life cutting all my files are numbered
so index HTML is one color CSS is too
and index css3 so I can display using
one two and three I can display the
wicked editors and then with with alt
one out to an alt way I can display live
rendering with an iframe of the content
of the file so here I only do alt one to
present the final HTML that it that is
on the left and if i press alt 2 i'll
have an iframe presenting and a CSS
which has nothing really interested to
do so I don't do it but I can and it's
very interesting so what's great is that
I can prepare a few code examples to
show and when I need to just display
titles diagrams I just have to build a
slide and never display oh and never
display the coded never display the code
editor and when I only have one thing as
you can see the borders that are around
to disappear completely so then I just
have to remove my working header and
then it it just looked like a slide so i
can press next I explain my story about
CSS so there is this guy doing Java this
girl doing C C++ they all want to learn
about stuff and he is a full stack
developer and we despite the fact being
a full stack developer it doesn't master
CSS and that's when I arrived so as you
can see here I have the final result
from
last Monday but what I can do if I go
back to my project I can import the
project and I have I can actually do
snapshots so I just have to load the
snapshot that I do before starting the
presentation to have all the different
example at the correct starting point so
then it is the starting point and doing
that at that time in the talk i just
press one to display the CSS editor to
sorry and I start to fiddle around so
what you can see on the left is a text
area enhanced with code mirror which is
a project for the web 22 had Carlos in
taxing live editing and many kind of
things you just had to have to add
plugins so here I have keyboard
shortcuts to play on the numbers i have
all my shortcuts to remove line to
duplicate lines etc and then on stage I
explain about Emmett which is a CSS
shortcut system so i can just do the
text align center and do tabulation
which is great because it works in my
tool but it works in IntelliJ in Adam in
any any editor and I also added the
plug-in to do auto completion that's
where I can make fun of people only
using auto completion and trying to
vertically aligned stuff with CSS
because it says vertical align but it
actually doesn't work like that people
with a DD right yeah with autocomplete
driven development so I have lots of fun
with that true because as you can see
each slides I have prepared a few
examples I start by showing the HTML I
just have to press one and two at the
same time to hide the HTML and show the
CSS and I mean at that point you have to
be a shortcut master because there's
really a gymnastic of playing to display
that pain
hide it etc and here it's just a it's
just an editor I just like I've hidden
the CSS and HTML but we use it as a
slide and we act you're getting more
mileage out of that animation that's
what it is we actually spend two hours
in the in the plane and the train to
build that animation that we are showing
like 43 seconds but it works I mean the
the audience need that kind of
recreation to to trigger emotion I'm not
a doctor but I i really see that it
works heading some more friend and stuff
to to help people listen to you and so
then at the end of the talk i did some
crazy stuff because i have just like
intellij the alt J shortcut which can do
multiple selections so I do multiple
selections to work sorry so I do
multiple selection to select th a nks I
do ctrl C i remove a line and then i can
just do again a multi cursor move the
cursor and just passed it and then i
have thanks in my slides I just need to
add the do you have any questions and
remove the pain and voila and it
actually really worked on Monday and I
think that's why people connected
because I wasn't fooling around with an
editor I was just showing flexbox
working with a few enhanced animations
so that's the first two we wanted to
show and in a way I mean the slides
themselves were an application of
flexbox because the thanks is written
using flexbox so here we're kind of
demonstrating by using eating your own
dog food so to speak yeah that this this
looks so pretty interesting now I had to
confess of people that know me they know
that i am a desktop guy and we have java
fix on the desktop and the FX has some
looks like CSS is not a standard CSS is
not css3 is something that a subset of
CSS 21 and it will be very interesting
to see a tool that behaves like this and
definitely will have a much further look
into what you guys have done with text
everyone is it available somewhere in a
github repository this is applesauce so
the stories we are definitely open
source I mean open device but they still
has been built like at night and I mean
after 2am for devix friends 2015 last
year at this year I wanted to do this
token to do another version that I could
have been toast but so I did many
improvements but I again I got caught up
with time so finally I get back on the
previous version and at some point I
really want to remove everything that
doesn't make any sense because it was
coded only by me for me during nights so
we are we are planning on the next few
weeks to do a bit of cleaning and maybe
open source just to have some people
saying this is where this is not maybe I
can fix that etc so yeah perfect and so
you mentioned that you have another tool
that you want to showcase yeah so the
second tool yeah let me just so i'll
introduce why you bring it up so when so
we're working on a new framework called
bespoke and if you know reveal duchess
or dec GIS then the smoke is equivalent
in some ways but what's different about
it is that while those frameworks were
monoliths they're just an all-in-one
give you a presentation framework but
spoke is more of a plug-in ecosystem for
creating html5 presentation so every
single feature that you have in the
presentation is being provided by a
plug-in matter fact the core doesn't
even know how to change slides it only
keeps a collection of slides and knows
about actions and so something has to
actually do something on the next and
previous action and one of the plugins
is to add a CSS class
to the previous next slide so you can do
something with cssm actually make a
slide but the point is you can gut it
all the way down to the base and build
it your own so one of the we had we got
it all working and it was able to do
more than reveal and that's great but
then it didn't have a present presenters
console so we thought well we'll take
the one from DZ slides and I just I'll
just make a plug in and we'll add that
in and what we realized is that we're
thinking about this the wrong way is
that the presentation console is not a
plug-in for the presentation the
presentation console sits at another
level and as a matter fact it's the
presentation that's the payload and the
presentation consoles actually the
application because we're you know when
you have a presentation console I can
reveal you press a button and you get a
presentation console popping up but why
do you want to have it on the same
screen or the same computer as where the
presentation is what if you want to
separate them well they're kind of
hooked together so and how do we send
information out to clients and okay so
we'll get into all that but basically we
realized wait a minute there's no way
the presentation can know about all this
stuff we need to think about the other
way so bear said what if I create a new
console and we make it so that it can
control a bespoke presentation where do
we go from that so that's kind of where
we are here in about two and a half
weeks ago or so Oh bear started to put
this together now obviously we've worked
on other presentation consoles like in
DZ slides and bespoke Sweden knew how
other ones worked but we didn't ever
take this approach so I'll let you go
you you may see that as then said you
have to separate the tool that you used
to present and tool that you use to
build the materials and you can you can
compare that to being our console to
being like some kind of VLC for your
slides it's it's the player and maybe
you created the video with any other
tool I at first it will work really well
with bespoke but it could work with
anything so how does it work and
so basically it's just it's just a web
page so what you can see right now is to
iframes on the left to display the
current slide in the next slide and then
a pain that displays your notes and you
can see that we are really focused on
writing our whole speech for
presentation we really think it makes a
difference to have a great storytelling
to have prepared in advance exactly the
best word to to transmit your your
thoughts so we designed them I've worked
on several presentation console on these
slides etc and it's the first time I'm
giving so much space for the speech it's
really like a teleprompter and so the
other interesting thing we we came with
is build it with a modular architecture
so everything here is a component so
microservices yeah it's a bit like that
yeah so basically the iframe in the top
left corner is is just a component and
it's used twice so as you can see the
the iframe viewer is just the same
component it's just that the second one
is configured to have a shift of one
step so it has one step ahead on the
under global presentation and that's
where you are well I've built a few
components and people will be able to
build anything people can have maybe
like the third slide on their screen but
they also can think of it as a framework
for authoring too I mean when I build
HTML presentation I have this huge
screen like 32 inches and I want to
display many like a grid of four by four
slides and I want to just fit around on
the CSS a mile
top and see everything your life renders
you know so what you see there is what I
have on my laptop when I present and I
also have another page which should be
there that they synced with the main
page so the screen is a bit small but
what we can do is maybe do this yeah
well sorry yeah you can't really see the
notes anymore but it should be okay so
we don't need no stinking presentation
but that's a huge debate with the
undressing and so yeah as you can see
the same component is used three times
and everything is synced up with the bus
of events and we're using broadcast
channel which is an ape browser API
standard that's in chrome and firefox
it's just like the the plastic cups and
the wire you know like I speak there and
you can hear it at a deadly other place
so on this page the two components have
created at work at a broadcast channel
named fubar for example and the page on
the right to and so when I pressed left
everyone is listening to go to the next
slide and just jump so that's why it's
really effective and I can even say to
this page maybe you could have multi
equals three and trigger a grid of
slides of three by three so let me
refresh yet I don't know why it takes a
bit of time to load but well but the
idea is here and as you can see now
everything maybe yeah everything is
synced up and I can see like eight
slides in advance
I mean why not if i'm editing slide it's
really efficient so i will show after
the zoom stuff but for now sorry for now
we also have other components so the
current time is a component the stop
watching the time or two so i can change
the i can change the initial duration of
the talk and then then if i press start
on the timer i just have everything i
need and the setup doesn't have to look
pretty it has to look useful and its
really efficient so everything is synced
with the notes you can look in your
notes maybe like this and if i click on
the notes that's corresponding to the
text i'm looking for i can click on it
and display it that's really really
really handy during questions when you
have someone saying well I didn't catch
what you said like 20 minutes before
you're like okay was talking about this
maybe I can do that and we can also do
it with this so people should be seeing
a super nice controller replica which is
bluetooth so I can do it really
wirelessly so apart from the fact that
it looks pretty cool on stage it's
really useful I mean speakers are using
remote controls like the logitech one
and it's great remote control but a
clicker it only has two buttons so next
previous that's it I have next and
previous okay but i also have like other
10 buttons and i can do very much
interesting stuff with it so let me find
that slide way it makes sense so i'll go
back and display only one slides here
and for now I still have to refresh this
but I mean it was built two weeks ago so
sorry okay this is wrong with a very
alpha version software has no letter
before alpha right yeah so as you can
see I hold the remote like this and it
really fits in my hand I just have to
press our to do slide next I can press L
to do previous you shouldn't normally
have to do previous during a talk but it
that's another debate then I have the
special button so let me just find a
slide where I use the special button
it's actually here so here I'm showing
an application in a smartphone screech
and where the important stuff are in the
top so if I black press the special
button it zooms on the on the phone and
what's interesting is that I have an
indicator on my screen that the special
button is pressed but under on the main
screen you're supposed to have maybe
like sorry this kind of of animation so
I have animations on the main screen
like okay I'm zooming I'm going to
another staff I'm assuming no yeah I'm
assuming again then i have several kind
of zoom and it works pretty well with
that special button and on my screen I
don't need the animation I just need an
indicator that the button is pressed and
for now we've only been using this
button I've tried stuff where this one
zooms on the current slide when you
display code examples it's quite handy
if you are a few feet away from the
screen I've used this one to zoom the
note for now we we disable it but it's
really great well the last thing i want
to show with this console is that i use
the d-pad to progress the slides on only
on my screen and during the question
it's just awesome so you're like oh you
asked a question about this I just have
to do this and find the stuff and press
next to sync it again and I mean it's
it's really nice as you can see i also
have so it should be and to the audience
that it almost looks like magic it's
because they can't really see what he's
doing with his hands when they're asking
the question and then all of a sudden
the slide appears of what they were
asking about from that they've seen
earlier and i actually think that
there's a model of presenting here where
if everyone's seen the slide once you
know your own slides they've never seen
them so now they've seen them all once
you almost leave a little bit more time
for questions and you can almost go back
and they get to see the slides now in
the context of having seen the whole
presentation maybe that slide makes a
little bit more sense to them so you
planned for this a little bit exactly so
I can I can take back his light from the
presentation but I also prepare slides
for after the question slides so here in
this presentation I have a grid of
progressive web app that I display while
I'm waiting for the first question I
also have some Twitter accounts to
follow but if someone is like Oh is
there any quotas on the storage of
progressive web app I can just move
there and don't change the current
screen I did say well there is this AP
of this specification that's worked on
right now and I've seen a few people in
the audience like wow okay and we what
we need right now is to talk about this
kind of practice to to have the tools to
do it very efficiently and to spread the
world I think this is actually I'm very
very excited about what you can do with
these two and I can see how the audience
can react to a much more interactive
presentation given that you are able to
deliver content that they asked and they
were
perhaps not sure that you prepared ahead
in this case you did and you have more
I'm just wondering is it possible
because some some conference will ask
you to have the slides in such a way
that people can consume you later maybe
see the PDF format maybe it's another
way it is this again something that you
can give to the audience in like a zip
file and they can play around and do
their own exploration navigation the
slice or besides that can you also
deliver a PDF or a static presentation
of course given that it's a website I
mean we publish them and it some of the
interactive features may not be
accessible to them they don't know what
the key bindings are whatever but for
the most part the slides work the other
thing is since the console is
controlling and driving the presentation
the console knows about a lot more
things than perhaps would have been
originally there in the source so it
knows when you switch slides we can
record that information it can know
which slides were shown in which slides
were not shown and so so forth and we
can then overlay that back in a post
processing step to generate something
that was very custom for that particular
audience I mean no bear gave his
presentation Devex Morocco progressive
web apps and decided not to do part of
the presentation so those people don't
need those slides they didn't see them
so we can just eliminate that so it
actually gives us more flexibility I
think then if you were to say to someone
will give me the export of the
PowerPoint presentation you wouldn't
have the ability to do this and the
other thing we are working on is trying
to have one ascii duck source or are not
especially in one file but i mean a few
file one repository organization that
could help you to produce slides and the
the equivalent of your slides are as an
article so yeah the notes and the speech
we prepare is a very oral type of kind
of speech and it wouldn't work as an
article but you have to use the same
code examples some of the same
images diagrams yeah and that's where
it's really interesting here you can see
my my google my jet ability talk and
here there is a sequence diagram that
has several steps so what we worked on
is maybe having some kind of putting up
the image at one place one place in the
article and being able to go through the
steps and not without having to put the
separate images on the article which
would be a nonsense yeah why well should
you have the that article up with the
little animation well Dan Hubert thank
you very much this is very very
interesting now we'll definitely be
keeping an eye on this and that please
make sure to announce when you open
source this thing and shout it to the
world because I'm pretty sure there will
be more than one speaker that will be
interested in having access to these
tools definitely so people can check out
bespoke now and this will be part of
that group of tools and just follow what
we're doing with that alright one last
thing because it's only components on
dress will be able to lay out the
speaker console without so much space
for the notes oh okay well thank you
very much thank you everybody catch you
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
