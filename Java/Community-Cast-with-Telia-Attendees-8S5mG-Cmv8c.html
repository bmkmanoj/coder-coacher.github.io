the community cast stage and I have two
gentlemen here from teleus systems and I
was learning a little bit about a
platform that they have for developers
so I thought we'd talk with them for a
little bit and hear about their
experience here at our dev and so
welcome Victor and Eric thank you okay
once you Victor tell us a little bit
about yourself right so my name is
Victor I'm here from Talia company and
where we are it's my first time here so
adjust this down a little bit okay so
yeah now it works now I hear ya so I'm
27 years old I'm here for my first time
at read em and I'm really blown away by
the D conference and it's something that
I think that you have really nailed here
is the networking and you know bringing
people together in a way because because
that can be hard even even though you
have a like a big conference with bigger
speakers or and the stages and stuff I
think here you have that really nailed
up yes my first impression so it's a
unique experience for you being it's
your first conference but also you've
been kind of hanging out here on the
open area where there's all the
opportunities to meet people yeah and
busy area all through here but all the
days of the conference yes and so maybe
Eric you can tell us a little bit about
yourself and the platform that you were
telling me about this available for
developers who are interested in
building hello everybody Eric third time
here me and
my colleagues there one reason for us
being here is that they all love our dev
we quite simply like many of you I hope
and what we wanted to bring your to your
attention was that Delia has broadband
routers in 1.2 million Swedish
households and it has opened api's to
those broadband routers so that in
something called Talia zone or premium
zone so at no cost you as developers you
as the guys who have the power that's
what we talked about Bella dev a lot
your power any opportunities to change
the world you can go in and develop
context based apps so you can develop
apps for instance eeka together with an
electronics company called electronics
lock company called glue they have an an
app where you can you can buy food from
Ikea and the door will you will get an
SMS you'll be able to open the door for
the courier to put the door in the
fridge or you'll be able to adjust the
heating of your home for when you're not
home or for instance Victor here is
developing a Spotify playlist that will
adjust depending on who's in the home so
that's called Talia's own and it's
available free of charge for you to try
and develop apps on to 1.2 million
Swedish households okay so Victor maybe
you can tell us a little bit about what
you're building so it's an open platform
and you're a developer and so you came
up with this idea maybe tell us a little
bit about the idea that you had of what
you're building so yeah so it's it's a
great opportunity for for developers and
companies who have services and they
want to make them context-based and then
wanna you know get cause people or telia
broadband customers they want to make
their home smarter smart home so yeah
now people who are having these routers
in their homes can have different
choices of applications that can create
the smart home yeah they want to make
their Damona help with you know
automating their lives making things
easier and so as you had you heard some
of the examples but
the api's that we are opening up is
basically so so when you're you're
coming home when you're leaving or when
who is in the Italia sown with you and
ways of using that is as you mentioned
you know for example when you're not
home so reduced the heating and you can
save a lot of money it's a it's a
partner we have called money at us but
yeah so there's a there's a great
opportunity when when you know and you
bring bring smart services together so
what was the application that you're
creating okay so that what I'm working
on is the called coplay it's it's a it's
a cool play yeah it's a something we're
working with together with Spotify so
it's basically smart playlists that can
change dynamically based on when your
friends come over for example you will
have you know their music in the will
influence what Hardy playlist if you're
having a party so that's a fun way to
try out V and see how the API is in
working cool so is there a URL that
people can go to to check out the api's
they want to if they have an idea of an
application that they want to create for
the smart home yeah absolutely if you if
you think that this is you have a great
idea or your stuff that you're working
on you should go to premium zone com
premium com okay read more so it's free
and open if you have inspired idea after
attending or Adam you can go there so
maybe share with me what's your
highlight of or ative so I know you
mentioned meeting the people here in the
hall what it would have been some other
highlights for you so are I think
actually the one of the keynote speakers
today jurgen jurgen was is the highlight
so far it was super inspiring
for me cool what about you Eric was your
been your highlight might I mentioned
that Jurgen actually holds a second talk
today as well well yeah it was great
Jurgen brought me happiness as he talked
about the subject for me I think el
balcón was absolutely best talking
about integrity right when I bring up
teljes own two people here they talk
about yeah ok so you you'd know where we
are but we we care about the integrity
about that subject very very much we're
half owned by the Swedish state and and
I think alaba Connie's is he has it's
very important message very important
message integrity yes and we work very
hard to be in compliance with the coming
GDP are as a consumer from May 2018 if
you give up your personal details you're
entitled to know exactly why for how
long and to have them erased or 22 for a
company to give you their full data at
some point so and we we care a lot about
that that's important yeah and we did
have the talk yesterday morning's
keynote talking about privacy and the
concerns that we all should have around
that topic so very very timely talks I
really enjoyed the context and kind of
the humanity of the conference mingling
in with the technology and meeting all
the people so great conference thanks
for sharing with us what you've enjoyed
about or ative your passion enjoyed
meeting you thank you much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
