tritium let your imagination take
control very creative way to make
animation very interesting too that was
like really important it's had me bet
javon programming alice is used to
create extreme ulations or animations
like movies or just commercials alice is
kind of like the animation layers
participe how animations work and I
think that's really cool I think alex is
a really cool program it lets you anime
characters animate whatever you want the
creative way to express what I feel and
what I can accomplish I really like the
fact that Oracle is promoting on Java
graph is pretty good it has more of the
programming aspect to it there's a lot
of writing the code rather than do
dragging and dropping so Green for three
software along the other software's I've
done this is obsessed
yeah ten years later Honor I think I'm
going to get into a technology industry
maybe a video game designer and
applications and software engineer or
something like that I like to one day
create some sort of a robot or something
that could have emotions and easily get
along with people my interests me is
making applications for example for the
iphone or any other of current device so
it'll help people I want to be a
scientist I can do about how people
think about Java like you should
seriously be like oh it's so hard you
know like only adults should do it or
sitting like that but then now I think
oh so easy
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
