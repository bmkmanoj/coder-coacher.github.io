glad to interests our carnival latest
technology and our latest solution for
quantanium management's we are kind of
building the whole solution from device
to data center which means we have a
jabot embedded technology on the small
device but we connect this device to the
data center back inside with also Java
technology actually we started with a
kind of our bomber experience based on
you know sunspot history little device
it has got various sensors and it also
has a small Java VM inside so it runs
small applications and also it kind of
gets the information through the sensors
so based on that technology we make that
kind of device which is called container
measurement device so what does it do as
you can see on the video on the right it
is installed on container you know when
you ship a container through maybe by
ship or airplane many things happens
like attempt try to get into the
container or when there is a car
accident you know the continual Brooks
and get some when it is hard than you
know the contents in the container goes
wrong so we put some sensors like nice
okay so intrusion sensor and temperature
sensor and moisture sensors something
like that so the java by a job
application inside is a collecting data
out of them but when we try to you know
send all the data through 3g network
equals just a lot of money and it costs
us a lot of battery you know the
container can take about maybe one month
sometimes more wormans to the
destination so we put our logic using
java application so whenever there is
something significant like some
intrusion were sudden change of
temperature or humidity then we sends
the data and to the network and we
allowed them that there is something
happening we also built again to
application so we track where the
container is country now thank you
everyone for listening my kind of
introduction yeah you can come visit otn
then you can get more information about
java in bed and our content management
system thank you for listening</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
