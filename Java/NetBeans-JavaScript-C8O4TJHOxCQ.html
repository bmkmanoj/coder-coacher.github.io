teching live stream from da box 2015 my
name is synonymous I'm interviewing here
Gretchen will anger from netbeans and he
wants to share some new things about
netbeans and JavaScript support so I'm
like in the new 81 release very very
feature centrally is about JavaScript I
think yes sir what do you have to tell
us so thanks a lot for having me young I
want to show you a whole bunch of small
things what the main feature that
netbeans ide a tot one is coming out
with or has come out with in the last
week is support for nodejs so it's as
simple as opening up the new project
dialog and going to the html5 JavaScript
category and choosing your no joyous
application you click Next and you click
finish and you specify which kind of
packaging or build tools you want to use
you have your project and they're a
bunch of templates like node HTTP and we
have a web server we've created a web
server in how long five seconds right
maybe seven it may be and but this
really cool features like this like if
you want to use a different node module
you can use cred completion here you can
see here all the different node modules
that are available together with a
documentation built into this and and
then when i use code completion here so
here i have included HTTP so when i do
cut completion on HTTP i see the method
calls from that node module so if i had
a different module here than i would
have you know different code completion
here based on the b module that i'm
using so it's really nicely I'm cut a
context-sensitive code completion in the
javascript editor so the javascript
editor has been enhanced so if i were to
now run this right so i run it and you
can see ok here is the server running
and now i can go to the internet browser
and i can place this in and here is my
hello world message now there's also
debugger so i can set set breakpoints
and i can then step through the code so
i can start a debug session debug and
then when the breakpoint is hit you know
we can step through like you would and
the nice thing is it's integrated into
the same debugger infrastructure
as there is for java so this is the nice
thing about NetBeans the integrated
story you know we have the Java debugger
and the JavaScript debugger plugs into
it and the C++ debugger and all these
different debuggers it's it looks like
it's one thing the same thing with the
editor but these are obviously all
different editors but they're all have
the same kind of a usability and
appearance as the Java supporters so the
JavaScript support now is able to do
anything you were used to have in a Java
right so that sounds like very good and
also and so now imagine that you want to
do front-end development with node right
so you can say html5 application with
node and then click Next and what
happens now is you can specify that you
want to include Express which is the
most typical front-end framework on top
of node so you can include express in
here you can see there's a special panel
in the options window for for working
with with these tools so if you look for
node here so here is my NPM path and
here's my Express generator so if i
wanted to use some some different some
different template with it instead of
the standard that comes with with
express i can add here command-line
options on the end here and that will
then be used when i run the Express
generator and also with with the NPM
command I can add some special commands
at the end here and that will then be
used together with that no generator so
first clouds nodejs support whisper
that's right that's awesome yep so and I
already about to say and you think a
oracle jet yes yes being a new whatever
javascript framework thing right exactly
I said we would support it as well so i
want to show you first of all kind of
the the reference example that is used
okay with with oracle yet so this is the
work better app and this used to be
expressed in ADF in the anode expressed
in javascript if one thing that you
notice is when i switch to a smaller
screen size automatically this
responsive design and this is built into
the built into the framework there's
nothing you need to do for this and it
looks really cool you can you know it's
you can click in here and you know it's
a complete application
you know see skills that relates to this
and you know see the employees you can
see all these gauges and this is really
the cool thing about America jet if you
can actually get to the 2d page let's
see yeah bit of a network problem yeah
but there's on the Oracle jet page you
see a whole bunch of data visualizations
including these these graphs that you
see here and there's maps and charts and
a various a bunch of these different
things and that you can use in your
application so the support that NetBeans
has is by means of a plugin I've
installed it and you can get it at
rights not in an 801 by default it's not
definitely fold you have to go just you
guys go to tools plugins and you go to
the to the available plugins and you'll
find there's one code or a co jet
support this one you need to install
that and what you then get is this
template gives you a starting point and
it gives you also hear a sample there's
a song in here that's good and the other
thing that's really cool about this is
what you see here is i'm not i don't
have java in this IDE this is Jack your
HTML Javascript distribution of NetBeans
Wow so the hcp of phpstorm or another
tool that is or webstorm that is purely
focused on on front-end development site
yeah if you using NetBeans you don't
need to have all that java stuff you can
just it's a download bundle that purely
has the front-end tools if you're just
going for javascript just go for the
javascript HTML 5 download Riedel and
grace skip there yeah and then once you
have this so with that plugin installed
which I have in this case so let's take
a look and what it gives you is now you
know for years already we've been
preparing for the release of of of jets
and Oracle jet is a is not a framework
like like angular is a full stack frame
work yeah it's not a library so it's not
jetty is but it's a toolkit and it's a
toolkit in the sense that it's based on
top of libraries so it's based on top of
knockout or type of require on top of
jQuery jQuery UI on top of that our
JavaScript components and these are
these here if I look here you can see
here in libs there's this ojay and in
there here are a whole bunch of Java
scripts components which are
added on top of that stack of
open-source libraries so here I can see
I've jquery I've hammer for from my bow
a touch I've knockout included here
unless required so it's it's modular
thanks to require there isn't a a
modular system curated for jet it's just
using the existing require and there's
data binding but not its own data
binding but the data binding some
knockout ok ok so in each case it built
as a combination of our existing things
that we try to make a provide additional
glue example yeah and and also so once
we are actually so all these things you
see here this is very much knock out you
know ok I'll servable erase like if
you're familiar with knockout there's
nothing new you need to learn all you do
is that you that you start using some
very cool components so a modular system
thanks to the much of a system provided
by require we have things like these so
here we can say here so these are the
these are the modules that need to be
loaded into this you know as it just
require is nothing special here but then
if you look in the HTML some so this is
these are the this is the JavaScript and
here's the HTML so look in the HTML and
here there's all kinds of stuff but you
can see here data bind ok now this
becomes interesting cuz this is from
knockout but in the data bind there's
this ojay component so this is a new
feature of knockout that you can declare
components like this and so we've said
we've declared here LJ menu you can see
here that that because we have selected
a menu so the idea is that we here get
the code completion that relates to
Romania and if we have a different
component we get the code completion
that relaxed particular component so
with a plugin installed you get
context-sensitive code completion of the
properties that belong to the currently
selected component right and the here
declaring so that's that's basically
that's basically jet it's really useful
if you're combining this with the Oracle
cloud and Java one this has been
released as a to Oracle cloud customers
to use as the basis of the cloud
applications but the plan is for next
year and for this to be on github so
this will be open source and
and I cannot get happen yeah yes right
this it will be the first organically a
hopen source project from within Oracle
it will be on github so you can really
consider this and compare it to two
other frameworks and tools and libraries
okay but one small thing I wanted to
show just generically on NetBeans
outside of jet outside of node if you're
just creating a normal website so my web
app so here's my website I'm just
creating website now just a normal
website okay so here it is okay and I'll
run this and it opens into the Chrome
browser and I've installed here this
netbeans icon so this is a netbeans
plugin for chrome that is freely
available on the Chrome Web Store so now
I switch this to smartphone portrait
okay just to to make it smaller so that
we can see because we don't have two
monitors here yeah so we can see the the
browser next to the development
environments this development
environment so it's going to make it a
bit smaller yeah and shares on the
screen and so just you could share them
next to each other okay so but the cool
thing is this so the first cool thing
was we can switch resolutions are the
cool thing is we can connect the browser
to NetBeans so now look at the bottom
left here as I move some our mouse is in
the bottom left as I move up and down I
can see something happening in the
browser and so let's add some more
content here so I add two more lines and
our press ctrl s and I didn't fix the
browser you know it browser refreshes
itself so now let's let's add let's add
a stylesheet here so new style sheet
styles and in my stylesheet i'll have an
h1 for colour scene nice code completion
and it's also nice for the completion
you can see which browsers support the
Gaia you know the CSS accusing you so
okay so we say h1 is red okay so now
next thing is okay so now we need to we
want this this to be referenced inside
of our HTML file so very small thing we
can do well you can go back here we have
it open so okay so in principle when I'm
showing it here I don't know well in
principle it should not open bet it will
I've insulted clever low plugin of my
own okay so instead of that what we can
do is just drag and drop
the magic last year's edges the magic
line but there's also a bunch of little
code templates so you should check out
the card template so I'm in an HTML file
and if i type you can see here script
ser then I automatically get that script
basically and so now we can say here
styles so there it is and now so it's
not it's a prince again slightly and
let's say that the type is at CSS and so
now let's make this an h1 you can see
immediately the this is yeah and it's in
updates itself in the browser good so so
like awesome support yeah so that kind
of out-of-the-box support for for
working with its so what I've done is
I've installed a plug-in that
automatically opens a file whenever I
click on it I don't need to double click
yeah so that's a side effect other bits
you from dragging its ineptitude fun
writing things around alright so it's
really convenient when you want to just
simply click on the on the file you see
a click on it and it opens but it makes
it's a problem when you try and drag and
drop the half and so all right okay so a
bunch of stuff that you can play around
with and use it productively the
conclusion is like try it out go to
NetBeans org download the NetBeans
javascript editor thing version that's
right and give it a shot so should be
fun and also take a look at oracle jet
hopefully we're actually on doing more
try to get the solid learning if you can
get to the page going away if you go to
our jetted org so dark and you see you
see the application you can download
this application as a starting point for
your own application and you see all
these charts and graphs and okay things
like that right thank you very much
thanks for telling us about nepeta
javascript and uh showing here thank you
alright so welcome back to my checking
live streaming from the box 2015 absent
guaymas and now i have
with me Galen Paul Anderson from
Anderson's suffer group doing trainings
and staff roll around programming
languages NetBeans javafx so couple of
things so and today they are here for
telling you about a like java facts on
top of NetBeans and how all this works
and how you can make really great apps
with this so um welcome thank you thanks
for having us here this is our first
time the dev ox and and it's everything
that that they said it was so we're
having a good time that's good great ok
so what we're going to do is we're going
to show you like Sven said we've been
very busy with our clients helping them
move to javafx from swing and also we've
been helping people with the NetBeans
platform to as an infrastructure for you
I designs so the program that that we
have here ok I mean maybe you can bring
that up yeah let me figure out whether
they it's always about this it's not
your so being like yay I found it ok so
there you go there it is you're on all
right ok now this is a little you I that
we designed that shows and teaches
people how to use javafx effectively and
it's it basically is a program that
monitors blood pressure readings and we
have the readings and a table and we
also have some very nice javafx charts
and everything you see here is out of
the out of the package so Gayle can
interact with it she can click on some
buttons and when she does that you see
the charts immediately upgrade and
update themselves and we're using a lot
of really nice binding and listening
techniques to make this all happen she
can also go in and select a reading and
we apply some drop shadows and give some
nice user interactions to to the user if
you look at the bar chart down below
which is updating the maximum minimum
and average values as Gail clicks on the
buttons you can see the number of
readings changes yeah she does that she
is changing each time she clicks on the
buttons and we thought we'd just show
you how easy it is in javafx to to
update something like that it's actually
one line of code so let's go to the the
code right now it will show you how
we're doing that is this like a
yet they talk about binding stuffy air
ducts the same technology or so yeah we
just gave our talk and we talked a lot
about using javafx and using different
finding strategies different also about
observable lists and how they can be you
can attach listeners to them and use
them and how everything to be
interconnected and and the importance of
you of having javafx properties in your
model data so great yeah so yeah so
let's go ahead and scroll down to that
statement there or we can show you how
we're doing the title this is a
standalone javafx program everything's
out of the box there it is right there i
think it's online 296 and what we're
doing is we're taking the title property
of the bar charts title and we're using
a binding expression here which uses a
library binding slotkin cat that will
concatenate those strings together and
then we go out and we get the size of
the bindings systolic reading which is a
numeric binding and then we convert it
with the fluent api out string method to
a string and then we can create a string
that updates the title property so in
this one statement with a bind anytime
the length of the series for the
systolic reading is changing either
going up or down this the stat charts
title property is immediately updated
with one line of code so as you see that
and that yeah that's what it is okay and
then I think I'm going to show them how
to add a reading and some of the
bindings we use to control some of these
buttons here so when once when you
select something it puts the readings in
here and when you deselect it it clears
them out and it puts the date to the
current date and time well my computer
thinks that it's 3am because it's on
Kelly no wonder i'm sleepy but i'm going
to add a reading now and when i do that
you'll see that that this changes so i'm
going to go into the current date and
time
frame and add something on the
twenty-third that would be in there and
now you see the Add button has become
enabled because all these fields are
filled in if I get rid of this the Add
button goes away so again that's binding
an easy buying statement yes that's okay
and now you see this readings title that
we showed in the binding before showing
17 readings now yet okay so Paul you
wanna yeah so let's show you how we're
doing that again it's one line of code
spread over separate lines of course but
still and so gales going to scroll down
there now and there it is okay it's a
line to 27 what we're doing is we're
taking the disabled property in the add
button control and javafx and we're
calling the bind api and then what we're
doing is we're looking to see with the
fluent api is if any of the text
properties for the three blood pressure
readings are empty see those are the
calls to the is empty and then the ORS
are saying you know are they is this
empty or this empty or this empty and
then we also have a property that we
maintain in the program that says it's
okay to add or not ok to add and that
one statement handles the enabling and
disabling of the add button without
writing any listeners about writing any
callback codes or anything and this is
the part of javafx that that we really
like because not only is it easy to make
the UI's design the UI's but it also
helps you make them work correctly ok
and and I just wanted to say a couple
words about how this is structured and
that is that we use F XML to define the
UI and we used gluons seem builder to to
build it which is a standalone program
that you can get and but you can go to
it from the F XML in in the netbeans ide
and and that helps keep the as you know
as it keeps the the
the view separate from the controller
and the model so I I think we want to
show you so you're using XML a lot yeah
they were projects yeah we we kind of
use it by standard and that helps also
when you go to if you want to use the
NetBeans platform that's really help
structure your job FX cold if you're
using so that's what I want to just so
great device so i don't know if you want
to talk while I'm doing this because up
to close yes oh and yeah and a note on
that yeah this the scene builder tool
from blue on is is really great are our
clients are using it because when you
when you when you use the tool to drag
and drop and it generates the f xml code
then you as the java developer don't
have to write as much java code because
it gets rid of the tedious boilerplate
of creating creating controls and then
calling setters to configure them
because you can do that all in the
declarative way and f xml ok so what
we've what we've got now is another
version of our program in the NetBeans
platform and now we've got each one of
the the chart the charts and the table
and the controls are all in separate
windows so what we've done now is we've
added we've enhanced the UI so that you
know as he has even more capabilities
for example Gail could take one of the
windows here and float it and as see
that's a great thing to do in this
situation since our screen is a little
bit oh yeah and I can know so so
floating is puppies platform I think yes
it is okay and it's wonderful because a
lot of times a lot of our clients are
really interested in visualizing data
and that's what they like about java
effects see notice that with that Gail's
got this window floated in the NetBeans
platform but as the windows changing
with the new range of blood pressure
data all the other windows are changing
too so you know it all it all works
great and of course you know there's a
redesign of this that's required because
the other program was standalone but it
works out pretty well oh and then she's
but their use of the topics components
and the xml was just like the same as in
the south
Joan so in this example we we divided
each separate window into its own module
and that meant that we took the f xml
code and we chopped it up so the parts
that were the line chart so let's just
look at this one for example this only
has the line chart code while in the
buttons so it's very short and that's
really nice because it's its own
separate module and and it really helps
maintain a an application better so you
had a like a very large I've xml file
for the whole application we saw first
yeah and you just like a split it up
into a couple of different right okay so
could you have been going for a separate
f xml files for the basic application as
well yeah I think you can do that by
with include stuff yeah so so
transformation process would be even
easier than yeah that's right yeah okay
again you know the NetBeans platform
encourages you to you know ma july's
your application so it all just fits in
really well as well yeah so shall we
show them just a little bit of animation
okay yeah yeah I think maybes always get
you know it's like really visual candy
for uh yeah so why don't you read read
doc that back and yeah if one I don't
know if this will show up out here if
you delete a reading but one of the nice
things you can do in FX if you delete
that reading right now yeah move that
downtown one of the nice things you can
do in javafx is you can put up statuses
for people when she clicks on the ok
button yeah over on the left there you
could see something and then and then
you fade it out and and this is very
very easy to do in javafx with fade
transitions and and it helps a lot of
people with the UI to see something
instead of it just being you know
eliminated immediately the other thing
that that we couldn't resist doing
because you know javafx has a reputation
for spinning circles was we decided that
we might well why couldn't we do this
right
this has no redeeming qualities
whatsoever except it sure looks cool and
it's very easy to and this is so easy to
do in javafx because it's a rotate
transition and all we're doing is
applying it to the parent of the scene
graph that you see that that's showing
the line chart and then we just tell it
to rotate you know rounded z axis and
and and it's really cool so there's a
lot of effort and a lot and a lot of
interest in javafx and the netbeans
platform to build really sophisticated
you eyes like these so did you n we
encounter any problems with integration
one jar of x and swing so that means a
swing application so you have to use the
integration of Java X and swing right so
you there's a specialized component in
javafx called javafx JFX panel that
allows you to integrate a javafx content
into a swing container and so we use
that for each one of these windows and
you also have to make sure that you do
any updates to your job FX scene graph
on the JavaFX application thread and
there's ways to do that swing has swing
utilities that invoke later that swing
users are used to using javafx has it's
also a platform dot run later that you
use the same thing so there's I think
there's a hidden secret property to make
both the threads one there is a hidden
secret property to make both threads the
same and we have used it it does work
okay odd but it's it's at the current
time it's non-standard so we tended
since we're into the training teaching
week we do it the standard way but as
far as I know there's no problems with
using hay they switch it off by default
to just just in case anything we have
might happen right will be on by default
it will be bad so right I agree just
give it a shot if you would like to
those things okay hey great so Laura
let's all day from the from the platform
perspective from javax so I'm great to
have you here thanks for doing this are
you thank you very much man</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
