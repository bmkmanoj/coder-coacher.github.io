technology Network hi Tori hey are you
pretty good been ok I'm doing great this
is Jim Weaver hello you don't know him
yet you should because he is a java
evangelist and a java effects expert
he's a guru his sessions have been
packed here at javelin India right
you're my favorite person to it that's
awesome Tori thank you you're welcome no
I'll say anything to make you feel good
oh really shake that yeah yeah ok so
tell me some of those sessions you've
been doing here well the did a keynote
the technical keynote and talked about
javafx and 3d right and the multi-touch
and those kinds of things so when you
say multi-touch just like swype zoom all
the things that people assume they can
do on their phone exactly like on phones
and tablets to swipe and zoom and rotate
and wranglers types of things sure right
right and I also saw you did some
textures and lighting right thought a
lot about 3d concepts and you remembered
the session very well because I did I
covered three things 3d geometry
lighting yeah I'm cameras right like
camera action and you you've got them
all yeah that's awesome yeah good it's a
shame I can't program it's kind of sad
well we'll work on it so tell me about
Java eck effects 3d is it baked ready to
go is it in early access where where are
we with javafx 3d is part of JDK 8 ok
which is in early access ok and so right
now it's in development a lot of it you
can play with but a lot of it the javafx
engineering team are relying on input
from the community on what things are
prioritized to move forward with javafx
3d so it's it's very much something we
can play with but also very much
something that is fluid and
and ready for input which is really cool
because everybody knows they go and look
at some software and say ah why did they
do it this way so here's your chance to
actually try it and give feedback and
you can actually change the way that
Java effects 3d is going to be
implemented absolutely yeah that's right
right so now is the time I know you can
go to what Java effects community Dom
that's exactly right okay that's where I
gotta look for it so tell me what some
of the other sessions you've done is
that pretty much it oh no oh I've been
so busy with sessions it's written
really rewarding though because the
Indian audience has been so sharp and so
welcoming and inviting it's just been
very very just just so much fun and so I
did the the keynote yesterday morning
and then this morning I did a hands-on
lab that dealt with javafx and an html5
and kind of leveraging the strengths of
both and yesterday I did one that that
helped introduce people to javafx and
also the new features that are in jdk 8
as they relate to javafx and then in
just a few minutes I'm going to do a
deep dive into javafx 3d wow that's
really cool that's but it's it's been a
lot of fun yeah yeah so tell me about
the end of Indian developer audience you
do you sense a difference or developers
the same all over the world developers
and not the same all over the world and
I can't say you know better or worse
what I say is different and so each each
it just seems like each community has a
different texture flavor and I feel and
the Indian audience is so well
come in and so friendly and so you know
like courteous and making sure that
you're comfortable in that year you know
and at the same time so so sharp in the
questions that they're asking and how
quickly they pick up the material I know
I'm generalizing but that's been a
really really nice experience I was here
last year and so I got to hook up with
some some some friends from last year
are teasing that just absolutely
wonderful experience and it's really
rewarding when you do a session and you
get some good questions absolutely
paying attention and you're not just
talking to crickets I mean it's the hol
that we just did the hands-on lab it's a
two-hour hands-on lab and people were
there 45 minutes extra just doing some
extra work and and exploring different
things and asking questions and it was
just a real joy because you could tell
that we're really really interested
because it gives half the class stayed
for you know at least another 30 minutes
just just out of interest great was
really cool great thank you Jim
absolutely tutorial I appreciate your
time and I appreciate you always for all
the work that you do back atcha yep
we'll be looking for you online all
right thank you this story wheel with
