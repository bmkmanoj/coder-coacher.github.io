Steven Chen I work for the Oracle
technology Network as lead Java
community manager I'm joins I the the
honor of being in the presence of the
dr. Deborah cater thank you glad to be
here
yes yeah so apparently you're a-- you're
an expert in the subject of deprecation
and I was I was wondering there there
seems to be quite a lot of deprecation
going on but then the deprecated things
never leave us why is that well it's a
long and sad tale so deprecation was
introduced in g and and not all of them
for good reasons and so that caused a
lot of outcry in the community and there
was fear that a lot of things would be
removed that would cause a lot of
gratuitous e and compatibility so
basically the deprecations ground to a
halt and very few things were removed so
I think basically this is part of the
idea of an API life cycle where you
introduce new things and new things
replace the old things code gets
migrated over and then the old things
eventually need to be taken out and that
latter part of the process has never
really come to fruition there is a bunch
of stuff in the prime the platform that
we we shoot that needs to be retired
maybe yeah thread does stop what's out
maybe thread dot stop thread that stop
yeah we retire that probably well one of
them thread dot stop the thread dot stop
that throws sorry the thread that
stopped that takes a throwable argument
so they're actually a couple overloads
of thread dot stop but anyway so what
are the plans for making deprecation
better than the current state so you you
mentioned at the was a Java Council
session that you're working on a on a
Jeff yeah that's right
so what's how are you gonna how you can
improve the life of almost Java devs
okay well part of the issue I think a
fundamental issue is that deprecation
has been very confusing because
there's just one bit which is something
is deprecated or it's not there's
nothing about why it was deprecated or
what's going to happen to it and so the
idea of this Jeff Jeff 277 I believe is
to enhance the the deprecation mechanism
and so what we want to do is add more
information to the deprecated annotation
that well that basically narrows it down
and tells developers what's going on
with a deprecated API and in some cases
but not all cases some cases things will
explicitly be marked that they are going
to be removed yeah but so let's say I'll
just come with a theoretical example
let's say that some API is marked and
they say for removal in Java 18 leading
up to the release of Java 18 how would
how would I know that this is going away
and like what how would it prevent me
from in the transition from Java 17 to
Java 18 is simply not being able to
upgrade right well so there a couple
things going on one of the one of the
issues is that the at deprecated
annotation only issues warnings at
compile time and you know we have this
we support this thing called binary
compatibility which basically says hey
you don't have to recompile you can just
run your old binaries yeah the new
version using a third-party library not
even realized its use can't up for Katie
yeah which then it breaks then your code
break you don't even get a warning right
so so that's one of the problem that's
that's a that's one of the problems with
with the deprecated annotation as it
stands is that it only issues warnings
at compile time so another aspect is not
only providing more information in the
annotation itself but also to add new
mechanisms that provide warnings at
different times so we're we're thinking
of a couple things which is one is to
add a mechanism at runtime to detect
uses of deprecated API s
so you can run your program and enable
deprecation
mornings and so then you'll get those
warnings at runtime no matter who no
matter who is using the stuff so like
you said you have a third-party library
that it's using something deprecated
that'll issue a warning run warning yeah
and then there's a there's a third
aspect that we were considering which is
to do static analysis yeah their class
possible with the byte codes actually
drag her out that you depends upon a
that's actually with modularity you
could actually identify by module which
of your dependencies causes the you can
narrow it down to which module but but
actually if you do if if you do just
deeper static analysis you can find out
which class it has byte codes that that
have a dependency on something that is
that is deprecated soon to be deprecated
soon to be removed to possibly cool all
right so I'm gonna I'm gonna throw out a
bones who are our hecklers who are not
engaging properly so sorry they're neat
are there any garbage collectors that
you think need to be deprecated I'm I
have to admit that I'm not up on the
garbage collection all right so our
official hecklers know what which is the
newest garbage collector for immediate
irrigation I think you can guess by the
context which was the name of our
heckler is yeah that we'll leave that to
the audience to to surmise right okay so
this was an exciting interview about
deprecation I think you have something
to show thee yeah
well know about conference yeah so so
everybody who's attending dem ox gets a
conference t-shirt and it has an
interesting feature that you can you can
write anything on the front of it using
chalk and what people are encouraged to
do is write the name of their favorite
API so dr. Deborah caters favorite API
is at deprecated the deprecated
annotation nice very good so thanks very
much all right
thanks Steve and it's great oh I mean uh
uh dr deprecated err and it was great
interviewing you live at the dev ox
night hacking stream right thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
