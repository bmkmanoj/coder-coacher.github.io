this is andrew simon are alive from the
nine hacking stage right here the hacker
got a box belgium 2016 and here I with
my with me I have David Blevins as my
guest they became you say some words
about yourself sure I've been big long
participant in Java EE and open source
for 10 15 years or so first started a
project with a friend of mine open ejb
in 1999 then we started in another
project Apache Geronimo in 2003 and then
recently or recent dish patchy Tommy in
2011 and then we launched off Tommy
tribe about three years ago which is a
basically a company to support Apache
Tommy and is very open source in Java EE
focused company we actually became java
ee licensees this year Oh
congratulations we're we're very
invested in the space you know we're
passionate so I suppose that it's based
on that extensive experience that you
have in the Java EE space that something
recently also appear which is called
micro profile now I have to be honest
with you and with the audience I have I
am a desktop person I have fairly I
currently make any use of java ee
technologies so could you tell me more
about microphone files because I I've
been hearing stuff about that but I I no
idea what it is sure well so it's an
it's kind of a collaborative effort that
Tommy tribe Red Hat IBM and PI are
launched off with ljc and now sell Java
in late June and the intent was to kind
of come together and see if we could
move things forward in terms of micro
services in our spaces and bring the
ideas together so for a long time a lot
of us have done things like uber jars
where we would package all of the server
up into one executable jar with the web
app and there's no like traditional
server you just have a jar you can move
around
executed we've also been really really
working hard to get our runtimes down to
like very little time to start like two
seconds and that's something that people
don't traditionally think of when they
think of it like kind of an eee server
they think of like you know minutes they
think of WebSphere that ships on DVDs
and so all of this type of movement in
terms of trimming everything down and
making it really small and really light
we've all been doing that independently
and so we decided to come together and
make these things up you know come
together in one project where we can all
collaborate and make open infrastructure
about you know how we're going to work
together and try and go faster than what
we've been able to do in the past in
terms of exploring the micro services
world at a pace that matches change in
microservice technologies concepts
things pop up very quickly like circuit
breakers and bulkheads and people like
what is that and yeah that will be the
question that will ask exactly and so
it's not any easier to answer as a
vendor and so to answer those questions
you really have to experiment it's not a
standard thing that you're doing you're
just experimenting you gotta make a
first step into the space and you want
to do it quickly as possible with as
much feedback as possible and ideally
you want to do it with the other people
that you intend to standardize concepts
with later and so what we have created
is the ability for us to explore these
kinds of concepts quickly in a way that
isn't trying to standardize anything
just trying to see what's useful for
people and ideally that those ideas feed
into the JCP and standards body if we
can make that happen and then we can
ultimately overall go much faster than
we've been able to go in the past right
so this is one of the goals of the micro
profile is it a group we see that a
second source and the foundation world
we originally just started as a bunch of
us contributing to a github project and
so knowing that that's not really enough
because it makes kind of unclear IP
concerns and and governance issues we
put a proposal together to move all the
work into the Eclipse Foundation where
there is very you know a very very
steamy out process for everyone to get
involved and basically help explore the
the changing space of micro services
together and so you know the intent is
to make this important step into you
know moving the effort into an open
source foundation like the Eclipse
Foundation and then see what we can
learn and take the good lessons and
ideally move them into the JCP and that
would ultimately be a really great
circle of life for technology because we
tend to move independently and then when
we think we're ready we come together
and we try and standardize but that's
when we're done right and so we have
done some things well in the
standardization process we have done
some things poorly every time we try and
guess and innovate in a standard it
doesn't go well so examples of that
would be like cmp container managed
persistence in the ejb was an attempt to
innovate with a standard and you have to
get it right because you're going to
live with it for ten years we didn't and
it became an albatross around our neck
for ten years drove a lot of people away
the flip side of that using the exact
same problem space was jpa which was
born out of high
so you have something that organically
grew in the open source space proved
itself to be valuable evolved reached a
point of maturity transitioned into a
standard and when JP a was born we had
two more hibernates within a year we had
a Clips link and we had open jpa so
suddenly as an act of transitioning a
good idea into a standard at the right
time we had two more of it which is an
amazing accomplishment it's the polar
opposite of our experience with CMP and
the missing link was incubating these
ideas out in open source with people who
are willing to be on the cutting edge
and innovate with us and so what we're
hoping to accomplish with the micro
profile is provide that for the
microservices space which is changing
every talk every conference there's a
slightly different spin on what gets
talked about keeping up with that you
can't standardized a new thing every
week so you have to be able to explore
these things quickly so you can suss out
the good ideas from the bad ones come
out with the best of best and then go if
we standardize this will have three more
of them and we'll be able to build on
top of this and go faster perfect is
there a way that they the overall java
committee can get involved with outcome
what kind of feedback do you use
spectrum from people well what else can
can we do you know to make sure that
that the movement gets much better that
the speed of development reaches up to a
place where you can finally say perhaps
is now it's time to get in talks with
standardization sure I think there's
everything that you can do I mean
basically it takes people who both want
to use and innovate in the space with us
it's a community it's not just vendors
is that there's Java user groups like
Sal Java and LJ see but are also
independent people who will come and
contribute to the project so you know
some of the concrete things we're doing
now is
hey we're all supporting these uber jars
we all have the ability to set the HTTP
port but none of us use the same flag to
do so why don't we agree on a flag
that's not really hard we just need to
agree on what comes after dash D and
before the equal sign and pick a name
come in there and help do that kind of
thing if we're going to have a servlet
or something that's going to give out an
HTTP 200 if the server is okay let's
pick a name it's not a crazy hard thing
let's pick a name there's a lot of
low-hanging fruit in the space we have
an a project that we're using to flush
out these ideas so it's not like a
traditional we originally started to try
to do something traditional like a pet
store which is like one application and
we thought that doesn't actually match
what's going to happen today we have to
have like four applications because you
can't show microservices with a micro
service singular and nothing else in the
space so we took the idea of an overall
application split it up into four
services I and we had each vendor right
of service all that stuff is in the
github project if you want to get
involved go to a pull request against
that project if there's something that
you see in the space that's not solved
dig you dig roll your sleeves up and
solve it so one example is there's no
service discovery so when we need to tie
all these things together there are hard
color to IP addresses well if you have
an idea on how that could be solved go
fork the repo do some hacking and submit
a pull request there's an independent in
the community ivar Grimstad and he has a
nice little project he calls it Snoopy
and you know he's wondering are you see
how could people get involved it's like
why don't you just contribute that
you've been working on a technique to
broadcast the address of servers to a
center point and then everyone looks
each other up from that it's missing
it's not in the demo because we
don't have it why don't you hack it in
there and see how Co works everybody
could then come try that out in their
own code in their own environments in
their own enterprises see if it works
for them and if it does then we've found
a win and that's kind of the process
that we have to do is is if there's
something you need simply say so and
that helps people know what to work on
next right if there's something you've
been kind of hacking on in your
enterprise hack on it in the micro
profile github repo because it's
probably needed by this little demo app
and in which case you know the thing
that you're doing in your small corner
of the world in your four walls of your
company you could just do that in the
project or there are a bunch of other
people working on similar things
encourage them to come to the center and
hack so this is not like a let's make of
API that's going to live for 10 years
type of initiative this is let's roll up
our sleeves and try some things out so
if you are trying things out in your
company now come to the center try
things out there bring ideas back to
your company's leave them there in the
center open source with everybody else
but let's shift our gravity to a sharing
point in the middle and see if we can
make some new things okay perfect so you
mentioned in the github repository quite
a number of times or so it is a URL for
that repository if you go to micro
profile dot io there are links on that
website or if you just go to simply
github.com / micro profile that's the
repo well there you have it folks that's
your ticket to contributing to yet
another open source project that can
help everybody inside the job our
community but David thank you very much
that was very informational especially
for me because I have no idea but
microphone profile is I don't keep tabs
on what Java is doing these days so it's
pretty good thank you for thank you so
much thanks for having me see you guys
later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
