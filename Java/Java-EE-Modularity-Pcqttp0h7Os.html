my second year here in Russia or your
last year as well and this year was all
about Java and modularity because we had
well to talks actually about doing with
liberty in java using osgi and showing
people that is actually not that
difficult to use and then start using
that to build modular modular
applications that all fits very well and
in the clouds using using some java ee
api's and doing it in a more modular
rate than most people do that today that
I whatever said the first day and this
morning we did a hands-on lab about the
same about the same subject just helping
attendees to get started with a guy and
get started building so much our
applications including some restful web
services with Yorkshire etc I sort of us
said that was all good so there's a lot
of exciting stuff coming to the Japanese
days hearing a lot about Jackie 7 of
course which is coming pretty soon one
of the most exciting things in there i
think is at the Metro curse API because
petrol consistory something that you
want well that I want us for a very long
time already bit but which was not
really available anywhere unless you
were moving to show more obscure and
less common frame and frameworks there
let's stand out now in the pits like the
modern browser way of development very
well so I hope to get shooting that very
soon after that API sir well finalized
so that's probably for me the most
important part of Jackie 7 but there's a
lot more interesting stuff in there as
well yes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
