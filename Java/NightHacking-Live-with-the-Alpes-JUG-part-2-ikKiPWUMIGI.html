kick the network cable and kill the
camera feed kill the strain all right so
we're back live again all right so let
me be mines focusing the camera again
for me same thing the outer ring is the
one yeah perfect
see I've got I got my own riding jacket
on and I got a little night hacking logo
put on the back so I can be a walking
billboard okay and these guys he can
tell you that I actually did I actually
I'm riding around Europe on a motorcycle
in the winter but it was a nice it was a
nice ride today it was sunny and very
nice views on the mountains as you go
through the pass alright so there's my
desktop again and all right back to the
presentation alright so we're mostly
going to use seen builder today and the
way seen builder works is it has three
panes on the left it shows you a list of
all the controls that you can use on the
right it shows you the properties for
the currently selected item and the
center is a visual builder you can drag
and drop things into to create your UI
and it's it's different than on swing
building tools or some eclipse you I
based tools which generate code this
generates a special for Michael F XML
it's an xml-based you I language and
that's what you tell your job FX
application to run as the UI so you tell
it display this F XML and it gives back
a note in the scene graph and then you
can tie that into your application with
controllers which interoperate with it
so it means that whatever you do in here
in the scene builder you can see updates
in your application and then you can
edit the xml directly and then seen
builder will pick up the updates so you
can actually roundtrip your xml with
code generation typically if you change
the generated code it can't figure
it out again what would you guys use for
you I from eclipse RCP for your building
Arab just code no no no tools okay
alright so that's seen builder which
I'll show you and the next thing is
native packaging this is something which
is a new feature so previously they used
to recommend doing applets or web start
for your client applications and these
both have problems with deployment
different different issues what's better
than this is building native
applications and there's a new packaging
tool which comes with javafx which will
automatically build a dmg file for Mac
an exe for Windows or a package for
linux and it will bundle the Java
version you tell to so that you can even
if the person doesn't have Java
installed on their computer they could
still run your application and in the
future it's going to support deployment
to desktop app stores the Apple App
Store and the windows market and d VN
repositories and there's actually
there's already one java application in
the app store have you guys seen it so
ensemble is the first java javafx
application that's actually in the Apple
App Store you can if you have a Mac
computer
you can actually download here's
Ensemble and it's written entirely in
Java and Java FX code and installs as an
application right out of the store so oh
and here's the developer who did it
Scott Scott Kovich these are our local
matt grupe and santa clara office so you
guys let's see who is a Mac you've a Mac
so no excuse for not having ensemble
it's also it's a great it's a great way
to already have it installed is a great
way to test out job effects capabilities
it has little demos of all the different
animations here's the new canvas element
which lets you do immediate mode
rendering and this is a little fireworks
particle display using the canvas and
for everything you can also see the
source code so you can get an example of
how to build the application so it's a
good way of seeing all the components in
action here's charts tasks all different
controls available so it's a good way of
checking out the capabilities of Java
effects and having little examples of
how to use them
oh so we got burned on lon bring on the
on the stream do you guys do you guys
know Bruno so he's the one of the
Brazilian Java user group leaders and
right now it's it's summer in Brazil
which is a nice it's a nice change from
the very cold weather up here so what
you should do is you know we have Java
one Brazil coming up in December so you
can convince your employer to send you
to Brazil in the summer hang out on the
beach and then Bruno can come over here
and would you guys like to have Bruno
speak at your user group alright so
let's tell bruno the alps jug invites
you to speak and the winter so you can
ski snowboard yeah because missing out
on all the good cold weather oh we've
gotta off our first our first night
hacking laptop here very nice
see nobody else put it on yet you guys
don't want to tarnish your company
laptops all right so um I think the one
other thing I'll do now is I'll show you
a really quick example of how to use
team builder so do you guys have any
like idea of something we do with the
user group logo quickly maybe some
animation or special effects or maybe we
can we can apply a bunch of special
effects to him and see what happens to
him all right let's do that so we'll do
we'll take a bunch of the javafx special
effects and then maybe add a button so
you can test it out on the user group
mascot all right so can you can you help
me again with the focus and hopefully i
won't i won't kick the camera and the
wireless network
alright so i'm going to use netbeans for
this and seen builder and what i'll do
is i'll create a new project also what
can I get the user group mascot okay
that would be good alright so we got
enough beans up and you guys you guys
will be doing this shortly so you
probably want to pay attention ok so I'm
going to create a new project let's call
it pick a javafx project type and an f
xml application it will give us the
boilerplate f xml code and we'll just
call this alps jug test alps jug special
effects okay it all looks good
all right now could the new project let
me close these and inside the project
there are three files one is the java
file the Java file has just a basic
application so to create a Java flex
application you extend the application
class it has a main method that's just a
normal public static void main but it
calls the launch method which is a
static method and this this starts the
javafx application thread and calls you
back and your start method so you
override start and then this is where
you do your rear of your application
logic since we're doing FX ml the only
thing the start method is doing is it's
loading the f xml file from the
classpath and then setting it as the the
root of the scene graph so you could
even load multiple files and have to be
different pages in your application or
you could manually add elements to the
scene graph with different layouts but
this is just you know the boilerplate
template to use f xml and then showing
the scene makes it visible and there's
there's two other file zips one is the
controller file which I'll get to in a
sec and the other is the f xml file
which it's just xml format so you can
see it has an anchor pain which is one
of layouts a button a label inside of
there but you don't have to edit
manually if you double click on it it
will open end scene builder and here's
scene builder this is this is a Grenoble
local developed applications that Java
javafx Grenoble team which built this
alright so do you have a picture for me
you sent via Twitter
let me try this Twitter
okay yeah I got it
cool
how do I save the picture
alright well this is not how you're
supposed to do it but we can take a
screenshot
and just grab him
alright so now we should have our little
guy there we go alright so first thing
I'm going to do is I'm going to drop him
in the project what's his name wish I
call this flu what's it was it with a
bird's name Finch okay Finch and let's
find the project folder Jeff junkies the
official neighborhood okay so this is
Jackie this this is this is juggy okay I
thought it looked like jogging as I was
asking for the name earlier brute Bruno
has a juggie puppet so Bruno Souza he's
the brazilian guy with the jungie puppet
the Finch okay so I'm just going to drop
it in the classpath here and then we can
load it and from seen builder let's add
an image and the image view we're going
to choose the file
oops so I think I have an older version
of seeing bill drive one out so I did
something it didn't like hold on a sec
let me reopen it okay imageview
oops alright well it doesn't it doesn't
it doesn't like maybe I should get the
current version of seeing builder and
not use an outdated version we see what
I have javafx seen filter now I have a
newer version but it opened the older
version for some reason
alright let's try this again I'll shuck
there we go and now we can put the
atmosphere
Finch okay so now we've got to finish
and you can preview inside of this tool
by just clicking preview in window and
you get a small preview on scene builder
or you can also just run your
application that beans
and there's there's juggy skiing okay so
um which which affect you guys want to
try how about how about we can add let
me show you the different effects and
ensemble
alright so we gotta drop shadow Gaussian
blur inner shadow reflection sepia tone
which ones we want to use for him
reflection ok so the options are you can
change the opacity change the top will
top and bottom opacity how long the
reflection is where it tapers off and
then the top off said if you want to
make it look like it's a little raised
up off the table but let's just use the
defaults and so what we'll do is fix the
layout here this layouts not that good
so go back to seeing filter and move the
button down oops
make him bigger
come on
alright and then we'll call this ad
reflection
okay so now we're going to save this and
it'll update RF xml file and then in our
project now i'll show you how the
controller works so the way the
controller works is you can get access
to elements by putting at FX ml and then
creating a variable with the same ID as
that element so if we want to access the
image view then we just do a def xml
private image view juggy
import the right image view and seen
builder should be smart enough to
associate picks up that juggy is the
element we added to our controller class
so seen Boulder and netbeans kind of
work together to do code completion and
seeing builder based on the code
analysis and netbeans but you can also
do use same builder stands along with
the clips or other tools you want to use
it at that beans okay so now we have an
ID for this juggy and then the other way
you can do things is if you have a
method with a deaf xml is the annotation
then you can call this from your code so
you can see that the button here already
has ADD handle button set here so I'm
going to create a new method and we're
going to call this ad was it add
reflection
and then we'll change this to add
reflection and then do juggy dot set
fact
and we'll just choose the default
reflection options
alright so let's try running this one
now
okay now we've got juggy and we click
Add reflection there we go now he's got
a little wall big so i guess the default
is it gives you a pretty long reflection
and actually it's on top of the button
so now we can't click the button anymore
so you won't want to change the ordering
of our control so the buttons on top
because you can see the reflection
actually is below the buttons below the
reflection here but anyway gives you a
quick idea of how do you seen builder
and java effects together do stuff
quickly alright so that's seen builder
this is our corporate disclaimer don't
use don't base your company decisions on
things I just finished telling it and
then my twitter handle but I think it's
time for you guys to do some hacking now
because I've been doing all the talking
and hacking so let's flip things around
why does first you guys you guys have
any questions and I'll pop open a chat
to any questions about javafx racine
building
the action signaled I like rock a lotta
good so yeah all right are you
synchronizing the connection ID with the
java class okay what would it mean
synchronizing i mean if i change the ID
in an action in javafx sin build oh yeah
I which is synchronized with the Java
code in netbeans okay so if you change
it in one place about work you have to
change on the code and change it inside
of scene builder but seen builder will
help you it'll give you a list of
choices from your code so for example if
you change them you're in a pins first
then same builder will give you the
drop-down mmm does exist some tools that
are directly embedded which is doing the
the bridge between the quad on the DUI
to defeat the a fix xml definition with
you I oh how is it something that is not
done country is so Sarah I mean I want
to these two things to be linked when I
update in one side I would like that
with a day to do I look like the
controller to automatically update it
when you change your FX smell so that's
it that's probably a good feature
request so one of the things we can do
so if you if you ever noticed something
in javafx which are not happy with
thanks thanks Dean Dean Dean is
mentioning that iTunes is yelling at me
ok now it's happy so one of the things
which you can do is you can submit to
the Java fix JIRA foreseen builder end
javafx and you can put in enhancements
or bug requests or other things I think
that's a good enhancement so you you can
go to javafx giro kunai kaam create a
new account and then create a new issue
so seen builder feature so synchronize
affects the melon controller a scene
builder and then you know you can follow
the rest I'm not going to do it on the
street but this is a good thing to do if
you ever have notice something and we'll
finish following this out and submit it
to the scene builder team ok so any
other questions about seemed older or
javafx no no you guys are eating you
can't duck from the camera ok so what we
do this will do with you hacking now and
we're gonna project but before that what
I'll do is I'll close out the stream
with folks online because it's it's not
all that much fun to watch you guys just
typing
so on let's see if folks on the street
does anyone the stream have any
questions or want to mention something
to the Alps jug before we before we hang
up doop to do so before we end the live
stream any comments or shadow call-outs
to the Alps jug
alright so looks like nobody nobody has
anything I want to say it right now what
we did get some comments from Brunel ins
Antonia earlier alright so thanks
everybody for watching the live stream
and I'm going to I'm going to save the
broadcast and end it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
