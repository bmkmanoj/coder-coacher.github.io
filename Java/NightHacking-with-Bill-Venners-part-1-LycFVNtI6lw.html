all right so say say hi to the folks of
a night packing stream for you I'm not
hiking to claudias one of the Duchess's
from Paris and I was just out there
recently for a nice event with you which
you guys put on with code story the
other night how you enjoying devix yeah
I'm little sister and we have 60
and the Mystics fun dishes oh very nice
all right welcome so if you want you can
you can hang out and watch they'll get
interviewed or or not it's up to you
Thanks you see this is what you get for
for dropping by the night hacking corner
you get hit on you gotta live streams
whether you like it or not so we got
doing it on on the stream and for those
of you guys to go to the format I'm
hacking is a live show all this goes
live on ustream it gets put up on
ustream in the java youtube channel
immediately after i'm also putting the
vocal parlays now and you can interact
with us directly by going to night
hacking calm there's a social stream you
can type into and optionally it will
publish up this Facebook and Twitter
well you can also go to the E Street
channel and do the same thing so who's
Jamie did you said Jeremy or somebody is
on Oh Julia Julia punk he's an
right right on France tonight he's one
of our night hackers I interviewed him
this is past week says it recorded yeah
it is imported miscreants well alright
you don't know what you're getting at
zero and it's a very very high tech
lighting camera setup yeah but less
intimidating the real audience yeah even
though you have a real audience okay so
bill belt then Julie it would really
like some scholarships work thank you
once you tell people about with scala
fest is small test is a test framework
written in scala you can use it to test
anything on the job a platform that it's
mostly used to test Scala code some
people use a disgusting java code ignore
that it is just designed to be make
things as simple as possible for the
user make code really clear i think what
i try to do it the starter languages use
its flexibility to make things really
clear yeah four teams of people working
to get it's very good for a dsl because
you can express things and scholar that
nothing like Scala or Java because they
can look very clear they can see their
kind of cryptic I said it gives you the
power yeah to make it look however you
want the flexibility yeah and so my car
tomorrow is about simplicity because I
sort of fact that this state
widely used its kind of maybe including
a third of the doctor phase and other
the doctors are a lot more tolerant to
complex in fact not just power and a
pump that's code then complexity that I
think someone would I like it yeah so
they might like it once or twice but
when their application breaks every
major or minor release and when they've
gotten used to certain patterns and then
the language designers decided that
maybe there's a better way of doing it
and you can't do it the old way anymore
sometimes that's not as yeah so you know
that's what my talk is about is how to
keep it simple how to use status so we
said it's a very good you only so you
could jesam stuff or not call you
but that's yeah that's basically my
thing this week before and I gave the
girl I do training together under the
name escalate to software span of
training and consulting and we ever did
nine hours of style this is just Monday
and Tuesday this week to a while which
we are doing that at to university talks
upstairs when was the beginning
Spiderman was advanced fella I mean so
they had an afternoon where between the
beginning and get ready for the victims
and then we had a lab which you Scott at
poems k NS a-- metric really well so I
think those telephones is a great way to
get into Scala actually for beginners
you can show you the stuff you just show
you the stuff well I was gonna talk
about firms yet oh when so i can meet
let me set for folks on the stream how
they get skull cones smell offense board
i think i'm trying SC ala ka ogen sk ok
NCAA Tournament
so that is me
I could give it a sector to learn all I
show people my desktop right
