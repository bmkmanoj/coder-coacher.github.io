chris know so how you doin press free
good so you gave a talk here are an
agent of technology so what would
example of an agent of technology be
well some of them most basic or familiar
let's say accessible examples would be
the Roomba it's a vacuum cleaner unlike
any vacuum cleaner that's come before it
the narrative clip is one that I'm super
fond of that not a lot of people know
it's a camera but an agent of camera
just like the Roomba is an agent to
vacuum cleaner there are lots of other
examples that like people don't even
think of as any sort of special
technology but your spam filter is a
piece of agent of technology even like
way finding apps that do real-time
recalculation of routes it's an agent
working on your behalf interesting so
all of those and I believe they're a not
just an interesting subset I believe
there are new category so what's the
what's kind of the significance of agent
of technologies for your average
developer well I think one of the things
that categorically distinguish them in
my opinion is the fact that they play
out over very long periods of time yeah
if like when we design and develop tools
we're thinking about how does a user get
in the flow of it how do they do their
task well what to know what affordances
do you give them what features and
functions do you give them in order to
accomplish that task but an agent is not
about giving those tools and in fact
it's about hiding those tools and
allowing your users to set up what their
goals are what their preferences are
what the rules and exceptions are and
then letting that play out over time if
it in fact like if you think about the
Roomba it's doing its job best when
you're not having to think about yeah
vacuum is give it the parameters and let
it run it run let's do its job and the
only time it needs to contact you is
when there's a problem or when you want
to get in there and play oh hey room but
I've got like a spot over here that I
really want you to pay attention to
or it can tell you when it's done or
when it needs it stray empty but those
are exceptions by default when the thing
is running it's out of mind interesting
so if you are if you were kind of
looking at the advances in technology
over like the past ten years yep what
would be some of the key like milestones
and agents of Technology where there was
like a groundbreaking shift like
something happens you mentioned the
roombas an example I think that's
probably about 10 years old by then yeah
I think so probably about a decade year
old it's about that old I mean if you're
looking for milestones or products it's
sort of a messy it's sort of a messy
timeline I'm partially because it's a
natural evolution of designing a piece
of technology that maximizes the benefit
and minimize the amount of work yeah and
that kind of depends on the foresight of
the strategists involved with the tech
or of somebody on the team who's like
hey I think we can do this a little bit
better you know the the folks at
narrative which is a camera you just
wear and it just takes pictures
throughout the day and then at night it
processes them and says hey here's what
I think the best ones are what do you
think like that just took somebody being
smart about it like oh yeah so it's not
particularly like bleeding-edge
technology but it's an interesting
application of again this thing yeah or
you think technologies I think there are
certainly things that have to be done
you you have to have a data stream that
your agent can watch so whether that's
the stock market or just light coming
through a lens in the case of the
narrative or a dirty floor as a data
stream as far as the Roomba is concerned
that data stream has to be constant and
available so certainly like web services
have to be on for the majority of what I
imagine agents to be in the future yeah
again so I've ever I have a different
line of questioning oh okay i'll let you
finish your thought first oh i was just
actually trying to enumerate sort of all
those things like if you're going to be
watching a data stream you have to have
those services if you're going to be
reaching out to people you need a very
rich way to get ahold of them anywhere
they are so the deep penetration of
smart phone technologies is pretty
important because if my stock market
agent which is a product i'm working on
with schwab right now needs to contact
me i don't want it to go to my email
because i may not be near a desktop at
that moment so this ok so maybe even the
the proliferation of mobile phones
actually opens up an opportunity for
agent if technologies because you can
use apps or use that as a data source
not only a data source because this
thing is collecting a ton more data than
we normally think or could but also as a
way to reach out the agent needs a way
to have a conversation with you and that
could happen on the desktop but since
they are working twenty-four/seven they
need to be able to contact you 24-7 with
problems yeah so mobile phones are
accessible way to do that yep so what i
was going to ask you is I wanted to get
your thoughts on how like crowdfunding
projects like Kickstarter other sites
like that huh influence the way people
are innovating on technologies
I certainly thought and actually this is
pretty pertinent to this morning because
of the Kung Fu project or the
presentation from the Kung Fu guys I
think it forces you if you have to
market your idea in progress it forces
you to think about what the value is why
would somebody pay money for this and it
gets you focused on that value now in
the case of Kickstarter it may be it may
not be the value of the final product
but the value of the thing you get out
of the kick starting but you still have
to frame sort of the value of this movie
or of this app or of this product yeah I
mean you're basically putting forth of
some sort of vision for we yeah the
advertisement for it and increasingly
see a lot of people developing small
devices or coyote products or like home
automation things and even if there's a
company backing it will use Kickstarter
as a marketing medium for getting the
idea out to the masses yeah totally
because it makes you feel like you're on
the inside of some cool new trend that
nobody else is going to have which which
is just a product which they're about to
launch totally and in fact I got bitten
by one of those i don't know if i should
mention the name but I i saw this
product it was sort of marketed as this
Internet of Things device that I could
use to chat with my son sort of remotely
like right miss nursery and I thought oh
that's going to be cool I do a lot of
traveling but there was a weird bait and
switch like they had so tailored the
communication to Kickstarter that I was
suckered into it and then when I got the
real thing they were like oh and here's
how much you pay for communication and I
was like hey wait a minute that was not
mentioned any time before this and got
really upset and I think they I think
they felt it from a lot of other backers
purchasers because later they were like
oh we were sorry about that price let us
lower it I'm still liking now yeah you
for that was a nice malty bait and
switch so getting back to agent if
technologies are there any examples of
agent of technologies which have come
out of crowdfunded efforts which you can
think of not yet I've only collected
literally about a dozen of them for the
book that I'm working on yeah but just
yesterday at my second talk where I was
going through two case studies of agents
one of the guys in the audience came up
afterwards and told me that watching the
presentation he had gotten a business
idea that he was going to approach his
friends with and I suspect they would go
to kick daughter do on the project yeah
yeah I should I even ask your listeners
if you know of one I would love to hear
because I'm in the process of collecting
them have a really big body of examples
from which to sort of draw yeah my guess
is if there were any it would be in the
past three three to five years yeah I
mean how long has kickstarter been
around now I don't know but I mean I
think originally a lot more of the stuff
on crowdfunding was booby game type
stuff yep but increasingly as it's being
become easier to prototype and fab
devices a lot of its shifted towards
tangible things you can buy yeah and I
haven't handle they'll prototype and
they'll show you a Kickstarter project
and then you can actually buy a fab
device at the end of it yeah that makes
sense yeah I see that is true and as
long as they don't bait and switch you
on the advertising campaign I'm fine
with that yeah so okay so we've been
chatting little bit of agent
acknowledged ease and you mentioned the
book which you're working on so why
don't you describe what about that so
I've got my my prior book that I
co-authored with Nathan cheddar off or
Rosenfeld media was about science
fiction interfaces and an analysis of
those as if they were real world
interfaces yeah I think that was the
subject of your talk last year it was
good memory good memory and so I'm
writing the second book with Rosenfeld
media again and right now it's got four
parts it's in progress that may change
but the first thing is sort of to make
the case that agents an agent of
Technology is its own category that is
genuinely distinct so making the cases
for why that why it's cool the second
part is to prevent to present a model of
use which is to say okay I bought in i
believe this is distinct how can I think
about it my product or service as an
agent so that I can do it well the third
part part whoops are the third part is
really to talk about why I think they're
cool and it goes from everything from oh
it's just the natural evolution of
technology which I believe I believe
it's a threshold technology that once
you cross it there's no going back in
the Peter Singer sense and I even think
that if I absolutely stretch the idea to
its limits I suspect that the the future
of the human race may be tied up in them
partially because spacefaring with
biological entities is a risky business
true but the farther out a robot goes
the longer the communication distance
our time is and so the farther out we do
spics a exploration with robots the more
we're going to need them to be able to
act send me at autumn a semi-autonomous
and the fourth part of the book is
really about making call to action to
build a community of practice around
developers you can develop agents
artificial intelligence scientists who
can help with machine learning and
designers you can make those things
accessible to real world people so
that's pretty cool it's almost like
you're
you're taking science fiction and you're
turning it into you're making it a
reality in fact that is I will say that
the initial idea came to me from a very
particular moment in science fiction and
you a fan of a fan of firefly um a
little bit ok well there's a scene I
won't presume you've seen the scene
there's a scene in the pilot where mal
is defending a valley from an incoming
spacecraft and he mounts this anti
spacecraft weapon on that that has a
heads-up display and if you are a super
nerd you'll notice that the there's a
weyland-yutani logo at the top of this
HUD so like somehow joss whedon is
implying that this lives in the same
world as alien butt on that heads up
display there are two separate radicals
the little crosshairs one that's clearly
where the weapon will fire and another
one that's saying well here's where the
bad guy is
and of course we know what mouths job is
is to align the bad guy reticle with the
weapon reticle pull the trigger sink the
spacecraft's and save the day but if we
look at it from a real-world perspective
you have to ask if the gun knows where
the bad guy is yeah why is it waiting
for mal to aim it that's called dramatic
suspense it is ultramatic suspense and
it just it's stupid for the real world
even if it's mostly right for the movies
yeah and it pointed out to me that when
you have technology that can actually
make that connection and we just don't
use it so it is in fact science fiction
that pointed this gap out to me but as
soon as I started going on to the real
world and saying well do we have this in
the real world I found out that the
answer is yes and very small parts and
parcels and that's why I like right now
the talk and the book tentative title is
called the dawn of agent of technology
because I believe we're right at the
threshold where it's going to start
being a thing I'm and it like if I had
my hope of hopes there will be a
separate conference dedicated to it in
about five years where we're talking
about and maybe we're talking at that
conference and I'm sitting back smoking
a cigar exactly adding might as well or
you're going crazy because you're one of
the people running it or that yes I'll
be sweating nervous like for Emily and /
exactly alright cool well it was great
chatting with you so I have a little
gift for you so this is a 3d printed
Java Duke Oh who's the open-source
mascot of the java programming language
and was Duke printed right there on that
very planner that very printer right
there that you're looking at sweet all
right and this talk and all the others
which we've recorded at the board of
conference will be available at the
night hacking website so go to night
hacking calm and then you can watch all
of the interviews that myself and
Frederick from code snack did here in
Malmo Sweden so thanks very much Chris
thanks much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
