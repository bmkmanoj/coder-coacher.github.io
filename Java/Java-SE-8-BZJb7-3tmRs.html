Network and I'm here today at devoxx UK
with Stuart marks thank you
so Stuart you working on the lambda
expressions so tell us about the lambda
expressions do they affect how do they
affect the JVM and the compiler so so
the lambda project is it's quite
comprehensive it affects the the JVM the
compiler the programming language and
the class libraries all at once so there
needs to be support in the JVM to handle
new byte codes that are being generated
by the lambda compiler there's changes
to the programming language
specification but even if you take all
of that I mean it provides us it
provides a certain amount of value but
what we also need is changes to the
libraries the the class libraries and
the library API is to to really make the
lambda expressions useful to general
programmers so and one will so all this
is part of the Java as e8 right yes Java
SE 8 ok and so you have also a
presentation today so what is your
presentation about ok so I have a talk
entitled accelerated lambda programming
and basically it's going to focus on the
the class library changes and the class
library api's for lambda and I think the
the difficult one of the difficulties
has been that the the project is so
broad that it's impossible to compress
all of that knowledge into a single talk
or even into two or three talks and so
so in my talk I'm gonna be focusing on
solely on the class libraries and tell
us some or tell us some of the libraries
well the main new library that is being
added to the support of lambda is called
the streams library and so briefly a
stream is a what I the way the way I'm
describing it is a multiplicity of
values and so in sort of classic Java
you have objects and objects can be
mutated the idea is to think about think
not about objects and mutating them but
to take a stream of values
process them into new values and the
advantage of that is that they can be
processed in parallel and lambda
expressions can be used to parameterize
the operations that occur when you chain
together a series of operations using
streams library so the lambda
expressions is a big change for Java a C
and a lot of developers are actually
wondering how it's going to affect them
so can you give your opinion and what do
you think those changes will be yeah I
think that in in a sense I think you
might think that that Java programmers
will find all this new stuff very
difficult and and I suppose some people
will on the other hand when we talk
about the Java community it's not
necessarily people who program
exclusively in Java there's this idea of
the polyglot programmer who programs in
in several programming languages all at
once this Java and on variety of
scripting languages Java Script so forth
and compared to Java in in certain
respects these languages are more
advanced Java is one of the last major
programming languages to get lambdas or
closures or any-any constructed of that
form and so so in that sense Java is
catching up with other languages and for
polyglot programmers it dealing with
lambda will probably not be difficult in
fact for these kinds of programmers
they're saying why they dislike program
you job because it lacks certain
features that they're used to in other
languages so I think they will pick it
up very quickly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
