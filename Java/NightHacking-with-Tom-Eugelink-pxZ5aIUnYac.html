alright so we're back here at j fo for
our third interview today with Tom
usually is that you see your last name /
link but you jerk wildenburger thing you
chillin cool dude okay it's a it's a
Dutch thing I I learned I learned guards
real name because you actually know how
to say it with a proper Dutch accent
Garrett groom will tidy would you say
guards name that's it's a German name
goon mud but first first name hey yeah
that yeah I can't say that head
tickets him shake it looks here well he
can tell booth yeah so thanks thanks for
doing the keynote this morning with me
today Jay Paul you're welcome that was
there was a lot of fun we actually did
some live hacking in front of a keynote
audience and today a mini night hacking
interview on stage yeah next time please
be earlier the day before so we can prep
a little bit better I'll pray to the
traffic gods and might the GPS gods
because the jihadist didn't help as well
so just to highlight some of the things
which you were showing at the keynote um
so you showed a modified version of the
scheduling conference scheduling
application yeah I did was a a simple
simple modification just the schedule
data so instead of def Fox we were using
the joyful sessions to be displayed and
you also showcased a new agenda control
which you're working on yeah which is
entirely style belen metro oh and I
should probably introduce you first
because not everyone knows who who tom
is I see I know you because you have
been on jf extra is helping me out for
quite a while and we actually met in
person here for the first time last year
J fall correct but let the let the folks
on the stream know a little bit more
about you ok well i'm a i'm a software
developer and I like the
the promise that Java Java X has in the
way that it has a unified model for both
controls and graphics and that the
possible power that can be achieved with
it
don't currently exist in the platform
but eventually get pushed back in for
example the the grid I work down in
javafx 13 ended up being the grid pain
which you see today in javafx to
rewritten by much better coders than me
that's how it grows okay so I'm gonna
pop up your desktop here let's say that
that you know about you what do you what
do you what do you have up on screen
eclipse okay you are do I have my
presentation you do you know you're good
you're good all right I got it yep you
know no no that's no that's not it no no
that's that's me I need to stop it thing
you asked me to install yesterday
there's one okay yeah that's that should
be you should be up now and what's your
IP address check that quickly for me 169
254 173 23 no not that one
okay read that out to me okay Oh 6925
for 154 173 okay so we should have a
desktop video for you in just a sec you
actually you know what you should do
join my my Wi-Fi network night hacking
with a password of Steve on Java and
then I'll be able to see on your desktop
so apologies for for folks on the stream
you have to wait for us to figure out
the desktop normally normally I'm pretty
religious about setting this up in
advance but I guess we got a little too
relaxed on this one and conveniently you
guys can edit it out on the parlays cut
which will help out things okay
right right I so yep light knocking
carmax to you phone java yep I should do
it and then give me your give me renew
IP address and we should be good restart
desktop yours owner give me new IP
address ok
I'm gonna need to recourse the new one
see we're getting we're getting a
behind-the-scenes tour of what goes
would I go through with every single
presenter before I even go on the air
okay 86
hold on the cross I need to restart this
one yeah
new okay and we now can add in video
there we go alright your desktop is live
alright so what are you showing us now
basically you're showing us a code in
the font that's too small that's that's
that's a problem for starters name how
can I increase this no idea high
resolution
see I haven't lived here and then for
the recording just chip he'll be fine
let's see general text editors additives
text editors Wow font size maybe I'll
see Carlos on funds to look at that okay
text and edit I'm getting there yeah
yeah looks pretty good 14 no bigger
bigger bigger you to thank you to think
like egregiously large presenter fonts
let's see what 20 does ah yeah that is
that's better that is humongous okay no
nobody on the stream click the play and
they can't they can't see what you're
coding okay so onward onward onward okay
well this is the the skinning thing we
did this morning on the keynote the demo
with the calendar picker and the end the
agenda yep yep so um why don't you run
the application for a show people what
it looks like yeah okay then let me
first remove this kidding otherwise I'll
spoil the surprise
ok
oh this is the demo as it started out
this morning it's basically it's i'm
going to show the source code it's a
agenda control i had to name it agenda
because the word calendar is already
already used in the calendar picker yeah
is that a formal English word agenda can
it be used for such a control or baby
maybe announcer okay and secondly we
have the calendar picker and they are
bound together get through the bind
statement so whatever date is selected
in the calendar picker is used to
display the agenda yes that's a great
use of javafx binds to do what you'd
normally have to put an event call back
on yeah and it's it's something make you
have to get used to yep it's not very
very common style of coding you use it
in business models J goodies binding but
it's not common in user interfaces it's
a really powerful a powerful technique
and well there's a little image that
will show up and then this part i'm
using a border pain to set the the
agenda as the central component and I've
indented it here the color picker in the
image is going on the left yep and then
basically a scene is set up and a custom
CSS stylesheet is loaded basically
that's it cool all right so when you
read this application right now the
stylesheets empties you're just going to
default control styles yeah so this what
you wanted to make it a little cooler
what would you what could you do well
you would start copying CSS stuff in
there and you have a Deveny CSS stuff to
copy of there yes I do the problem is
that i don't know how it is with other
java people but CSS is not my cup of tea
so it takes some getting used to but it
really is powerful in separating out the
styling from the
whitespace you get old it go to the ball
yeah live the gloom here that was easy
to do that was long a couple eyes that's
just one line add some padding and
currently i'm loving microsoft for
introducing a design style that i can do
as well being the rectangular blocks
with a column applied so no fancy
gradients you're talking about like that
Metro yeah a metro stuff it's easy now
we can also do design it's like a it's
like a designer built by developers you
can't really code yeah but somehow
Microsoft makes it look cool so what
I've did and what I've done I've been
I've been designed not coding toppers
you can't design again I'm flying back
my previous statement in my head okay
okay okay oh god okay so what I did is I
applied am some padding to the to the
toggle buttons to the day buttons in the
in the calendar picker and basically a
little bit of padding drop the border no
radius nope curved curve rectangles all
nice and angular background increase the
font size a bit and then you get a
little bit of Metro style going on you
know but this is of course it's only for
this button these two are separate
controls basically being used by the
calendar paper so they have a separate
styling so we need to copy on that as
well
macy so this is the part where the list
spinner inside the calendar picker and
you can see that in the Indy the CSS
addressing part is being styled yep so
that's like a control under control yep
okay so we're going to start it now
that'd be a little bit microsoft team I
like this part somehow that's it makes
it work yeah even advanced controls are
pretty easy though you know style yeah
so but then you see that if there's all
gross then you need to add a little bit
more white space here and the text gets
out of alignment because it's so small
so I'm gonna add some stuff that also
does some tweaking there a little bit of
white space around the label make a font
the weekend bolt increase the the week
number size highlighted a so if we're
going to do these minor changes typing
one hand and I really support this on
its own yet although my canoe okay so
actually it was about yeah a little bit
little bit of work but it it has
definitely has a microsoft Metro of
styling to it but this is still a little
bit flaky DD and gender control and the
power is that you can't really style
these these appointments I mean that the
color that I using simple as a class so
you can change that but in the end
that's something that's basically
determined by the by the data that's
being provided and loved by the the
application so what we're going to do
here is we're going to
okay well this one one other thing I
would like to show first start getting
ahead of myself here we've done the
basic look but you start selecting
tiles and all right to do all that stuff
for for those of you who don't know a
lot of the actually all of the javafx
controls which come built in yep are
styled entirely using CSS so there's a
huge javafx CSS file which all controls
get their default look and feel from
mm-hmm so so now if you start clicking
then you get a nice dotted border okay
going around okay I'm one of the things
I like to show at this point before we
continue to the other part is the ED
arrows the arrows also are now our art
of style because they're pretty pretty
tiny going to start the application
again those are small small arrows and
because we made them big they should
have a little bit more body to them yeah
and the arrows are actually drawn using
let me get to it because it was at the
bottom here okay yeah those are some
funky as SVG SVG SVG H statements which
basically tell the drawing that to move
to a certain place and draw a line
another line another line ok the the
current ones simply our triangle so like
a three-line statements and this one
will make it a little bit more I have it
a little bit more body so if we're gonna
start it now then you'll see that the
arrows will be bigger the thing is the
other styling elements and when I click
it turns blue are still a still apply so
you're only changed what you need and
the rest remains as it was
okay okay now now if you finish this one
we need to work a little bit on the on
the agenda and there's the this text x
getting out of out of style we have
maybe a little bit too much lines here
that aren't needed and of course a
little white space so let's get those
CSS statements over and you see that's
here a little bit of padding and little
background some incrementing of the
header full font and we're going to lose
the lines that are on the head apart so
up okay go okay
and then it's sir yeah it's getting
there I'll be back in just a sec I'm
gonna crank up the volume folks on the
stream have been mentioning that our
audios not as loud as it needs to be
okay that's even louder now so the only
thing left actually is the it's a scroll
bar because it still has a gradient in
it and apparently gradients out so we're
going to replace that one also with
something a little bit less
old-fashioned okay okay again this is a
standard control and then so the shirts
that you can basically skin anything as
long you have the same limitations as
you have with HTML that you can skin but
only where there's a hook available you
can't just simply start skinning any
everything okay yeah very nice gray yeah
that's a lot different
thing to do it like this and i'm very
curious if if it's a powerful and
flexible enough in the current setup to
actually allow a styling to be imported
like synthetic on swing there's this
whole series of skins and and which look
really good but i'm very curious to see
if the CSS you could do the same thing
with CSS yeah basically yes but i'm
curious if it if it will our workout
okay yeah sorry cool no that's that's
very interesting so what are those what
are those sort of stuff did you have
that you want to show anything did it
did a show the actual usage of the agent
i don't think i did yet that you have no
no no that you can it's basically it's a
reimplement ation of google google
calendars or you can come off
appointments around and if they
overlapped and they'll pop you can
select them and then they'll share space
and it actually did the challenge worst
was to figure out the algorithm behind
the layout yeah how to do that because
one of the interesting things is that
appointments can connect other classes
so basically this one connects through d
to this set and that's the interesting
part of the algorithm how to know how to
do this ya see it all have fun building
this didn't you and no no because this
was my initial draw it yourself
application and the first time I did it
I did it the swing way yeah and it
didn't work out the this technique is
different the Euro you're focusing on
overriding methods instead of listening
and binding so I wrote the initial
version and then scrap the whole thing
and start it again from scratch and so
it design-wise what did you what did you
find that you did differently when you
were doing javafx versus swing okay as I
said the I have a nice example of that I
prepared it we didn't use it but the you
air is it it's here in swing you have a
tendency to okay let me show you this
what I've got here is a little border
pain yeah border pain has a label on the
top labeled in the center and that's
basically all there is to it if I start
this one probably will begin somewhere
yep then you get the standard water pane
layout okay so for the agenda control I
basically needed to start drawing inside
the center area and by myself and the
primary method to do that and what you
see in a lot of Java fix applications
and basically in inswinging applications
as well if you override the layout
children method and in that method
that's being called every time the the
scene is read it on you start putting
sizes into it you start telling the
children to move or to size or just as
you want to have it and basically that's
what I'm doing here what I'm trying to
do is to get the content pane to be
always the same size as the few part of
the scoping because I don't want to have
a horizontal scroll bar but if I resize
I'm going to study a gender control
again but if I'm resizing then I want my
additional space to become available to
the days so basically this is the keep
your
border
is that it's all the way to the left
here and it's not around the center
label is here but it's not actually in
the content pane because the counterpane
is white and this is gray the content
rain is totally collapsed on the left
side and certainly do it you wanted at
all and if i start to resize then you
see that it'll grow but it also has that
little yeah it won't it won't stick it
won't be the full size you can't really
show it right now it's a little bit
stubborn so what you actually need to do
is you need to start listening to things
and in this case you need to start
listening to the bounce property and
then you'll get to correct events to lay
out the children so basically that was
the the rewrite I to do I had to switch
from the old override methods style that
you would use to doing it validation
listeners on listeners and binding
binding was also the second thing that
came along okay you can also show that
if you're interested because I let me
see I need to open the agenda skin he'll
be here there it is if you have a if you
take a look at the SU gender control
then what you see is that the the days
actually are separate paint and the
paint's contain the appointments but I
need to align the header pain to the day
pain if something rose and both need to
grow yep so basically what i do when
setting up the screen
we find the code where is it there or up
control arta haha that was a pretty good
one handed control click ok and I need
to search what I'm looking for need to
find what I'm looking for ok I think I'm
in the wrong place did you do today
where did I put it
simply control by now yeah i think you
you're probably one of the bleeding edge
control developers at this point
building applications and using javafx
in ways which people haven't really
tried yet well that's the idea you see
if i can find what I'm looking for and
you like binding a lot well the thing is
that once you start on the path you
you're you're you're you're getting like
oh but it's much more better you define
it once say okay bind these two and
after that the decision takes care of
itself janna it's a very nice pattern it
kind of inverts the standard a venting
pattern where people think about
listening to events and then doing
something on the call back to more of a
push mechanism once an action happens
it's pushing changes goodbye to your
model or to other controls inside of
your user interface yeah as usual I
notice there it is look area the the day
on the main area they had are always
season sink and define it went once and
then it's off your plate so cool alright
so let's chat about a first side to give
you I to give you one of the night
hacking stickers for your laptop there
although use such a nice new york city
logo there I've got more levels put it
on another one you'll find you'll find a
good use for the night hacking sticker
yeah thank you and for your significant
other Duke a Java do to thank you ok
let's been great fun today and we have a
question on the stream okay so this
question comes from Jim Weaver huge m
he's watching I assume from from his
home in Indiana mm-hmm and he's
wondering how you arrived at the twitter
name TB are not okay well my initials my
middle names I've got two are named
after my by both both my grandpa's and
so my initials are Tom okay Bernard
avert earthlink TBE so that's what i
usually use for my neck but when it's
not available or too short then i'll add
or not to be or not so it's based on my
initials so it's like a pun it's a fun
yeah it's like a twitter pub yeah a
twitter handle pun yeah so so we
actually we asked the same question of
bed many of n Evans from let the java
community I know his name and don't know
his neck so his nick is kitty list okay
so ki TTYL ly s T
any idea what that might stand for well
it probably has to do something for the
kittens ok but says good you got half of
it no nobody gets it nobody i hope i
hope dad's watch because we're picking
on him nobody gets his Twitter handle
but you're going to reveal the secret or
not yeah kitty kittens of a mix of
kittens and catalyst kittens catalyst ok
oh so use it it's recognizable yeah
recognized well enough pick young
people's Twitter handles thanks thanks
for the question Jim now now we've we've
discovered the secret of your Twitter
handle ok so I'll actually have to run
to my own talk which I'm giving in a
couple minutes
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
