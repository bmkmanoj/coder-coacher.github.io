Duchess to talk to all the other ladies
that I meet and besides Duchess I also
do programming with kids so for example
def fox for kids we're going to help
organize one of the events in the
Netherlands but I'm also a volunteer for
organizations that send role models to
primary schools for example or even high
schools so I'm a role model to young
girls but I also help kids in general to
learn how to program and in a program
that's trying to get programming in the
curriculum of schools hi my name is
Regina terracotta I'm a Java developer
