interview third one of the afternoon
with burnt Mueller so we're going to
chat a little bit about bytecode class
loader and class transformer but before
that why don't you tell us a little bit
about what yourself your professor yes
I'm a professor of computer science I
also wrote some books about jsf jpa and
are also working on the expert groups
for JSF 22 and jpa 21 cool and you were
speaking earlier at the conference here
at jamba Lance no talk is at 4pm and
have will be very glad if you attend my
talk so please remember 4pm in the
winter garden alright awesome so this is
an interesting topic because I think
this is something which has been
possible for a while but not a lot of
people have taken advantage of what did
the api's you're using for your class
loading get edited or appeared at 15
Java 15 yes ok but I think at the while
there's very few people who are actually
using this other than it's very unknown
knowledge and hopefully after the talk
and after the interview which it's more
known cool all right so why don't you
walk us through how we can hack our by
codes yes Oh in my talk I will first
talk about byte code and then class
loaders but at the end i will show an
example and to do some class
transformation and therefore i will jump
into transformation if you doing some
transformation you have to define an
agent an agent is deployed by a jar and
you have to write something into the
manifest there is an attribute in the
manifest kenri transform classes so you
should put it on true and then you
allowed to read transform classes you
have to register your class transformer
there is an interface called classify
transformer and there is an
instrumentation API where you can add
some kind of transformer so these are
part of the durable Java core libraries
what package is instrumentation I had
the packages java.lang instrument and
it's a public API and everyone can use
it probably it's not so there are not so
many use cases for application
programmer but if you're a framework
developer probably you will already know
it cool so what can we do with this yes
okay so let's jump into it what I want
to show you is how you can pass all your
unit tests so this is a class which will
be tested and there are two simple
methods get the canonic last name and if
it's if it's right it will return get
class cat canonical name but I will
return the wrong name and there is also
add method which will which is assumed
to return the sum but i will return the
product that's not incorrect for a
certain class of numbers yes but in
general it's not correct so i will show
you how the unit test will pass very
good okay so i wrote some simple unit
ists there are two methods yeah okay so
for three and four that is not correct
it yeah you're a zero it would win but
yes so those tests will not pass so you
get red in your IDE and the test will
not pass okay so is it complicated to to
convince J units that the tests are
right no it's very easy
so if you try to do some transformation
you have to implement the interface
class file transformer there is a
transform method which holds some
parameters but these parameters are not
important at the moment so please
apologize that you can't read it so the
important thing is I will search for the
third class of j unit and for this class
I will call the message transform assert
no magic in there this is the method and
I'm using java assist you can use our
bytecode manipulation tools you know but
i use on java is assist and what I'm
doing is I get a handle so this CC is a
handle of j unit and i get a handle for
this assert loss so I'm asking the
handle to get to give me all all the
methods all the methods defined in a
cert and I am searching for all the
methods starting with a search as your
equals asserttrue assert false okay and
if you already looked into the classes
of into the method parties of j unit say
they are doing the tests and if the
tests are wrong they throw an exception
so we need to do is have a method which
doesn't throw an exception in or pass
yes so this is the trick java assist
allows me to replace the complete body
and i replace it with return so it's
very easy all the methods doesn't do
anything they simply returned and that's
all so after that I did I explained it
in in the slides before
I will not do it now you have to write a
callback method called agent Maine this
is called if you contact if you contact
this agent to the vm so this is called
back method and this callback method
simply cause transformed classes and
this simple transform classes runs what
I show you before so after that I'm done
I'm finished so what I have to to change
as the last part is in my class which
has to be tested I have to ensure that
the agent is loaded and this is also
very easy there is a static initializer
and I run the load agent method and so
the agent is loaded it gets the j unit
assert stuff replaces the method bodies
so no exceptions are thrown and the
tests will pass so it's kind of fun it's
not a real example but probably you will
mention how to to do it in your own yeah
so like you know a lot of people are
probably heard of test-driven
development you know going and fixing
things writing the test first and fixing
them so this is a white coat driven
development yes it's not for you but for
example for the German and I think there
are too many Germans here for example
you can use it simply for fun but also
to to get more money from your boss so
this is the trick really very nice so
any recommendations in practice for what
people could use this technique for if
you used for example visual visual vm
and there is some button to to
instrument the classes and I I haven't
looked into the source code of visual vm
but probably they will do it on the same
way
they change all all the methods to to
get some monitoring data in there yeah
yeah so they're using a similar
technique like those two instrumental
classes for for monitoring inside of it
then you know certainly if you're using
something like Jay rubble they probably
do something like this too i'm not sure
if as they do it the same way but
probably they are doing it much more
intelligent yeah yeah cool all right
well thanks very much for the short
interview on the night hack east asia at
java hood thank you and i hope you enjoy
your session and you know I Lee's hang
around for the end of the conference and
watch birds full talk at 4pm thank you
all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
