technology Network we're here at javaone
India talking to members of the java
community I've got Adrian to yoga with
me hi Adrian hello how you doing I'm
doing well how are you I'm great so tell
me about your role in the java community
yes what I do I'm a consultant this
right now mostly working with continuous
delivery and what we are doing it's
speeding up the development process
reducing time to market laughs and
reducing time to market a nice thing
about that it's it's not just about
technology but it's about organization a
lot of people about culture and about
technology that's what I like is to work
both on the organization and the
technology into half half interesting so
where do you live where are you I live
in the Netherlands okay I am myself and
from the egg okay I work for a company
called CBR or Xavier and Dutch which is
an efficient and we have offices in the
Netherlands and France and then India
where we are right now but then in Delhi
excellent so we really wanted to do this
interview because your title is one of
the more interesting titles here at
javaone India how to put your big fat
war file on a diet right is that the
title as re it's for your big fat were
fat ok so tell me a little bit about it
what do you see well like like I said
what I want to do usually is to speed up
delivery of software and many companies
they deliver software every three months
some two times a year companies that are
doing okay once a month but what we're
aiming for with continuous deliveries
that you're going live with software
multiple times a day Oh agile edge oh
yeah the ideal form of an agile and what
many companies have left is very large
deliverable sometimes even on this
hundred and fifty megabytes right now
which before going live you have to
build you have to
test on multiple levels unit testing
integration testing functional testing
you have to actually put it live if you
want to do this multiple times a day you
want to do this very quickly so the
larger your deliverable is the slower it
will go okay that makes sense if you can
make it smaller it'll be easier to speed
up delivery okay so it's just part of
the larger scheme of what you're doing
it's part of the largest game okay
excellent so you were talking about
cultural differences so tell me you've
worked in the Netherlands and here in
India so tell me a little bit I must say
I did not actually work I mean in there
okay but we do have of course a lot of
people from India coming over in the
Netherlands yeah of course there are
cultural differences I learned a new
word this week actually okay it's called
the word jus got you got you got you LJ
you gaaad it's a word for fixing things
in the creative manner how nice to
quickly get going again um what does
that very nice thing about it is you'll
deliver your product quicker and you get
things going but it might be that in the
long run the fix was just a little bit
too quick and on the long run it will
start hurting so I actually also
mentioned this words in that
presentation yes and I said a lot to me
it seems a little bit like technical
depth which is a common term in IT and
those are things you might introduce
sometimes to reach that line what you
want to get rid of as quickly as
possible so it's the debt for
introducing whatever is near process yes
and what I encourage things to do in my
presentation is to take responsibility
of their deliverables of their work what
you see if you see these very large
deliverables and you ask the people
anything how did it get so large more
often site yeah it grew that way so I
told the audience can tell you one thing
it did not grow that way you made it
that way I software does not just grow
reading lights when you're sleeping what
you have to do is to take control
control regularly go back to the drawing
board and see hey are we showing are in
the right direction is the architecture
still like I want it to be like it
should be for it to be maintainable for
it us to deliver quick and then do small
redesigns whenever necessary yeah so
you're I guess you're saying that
developers need to spend some time
pruning a little bit right yeah you just
can't let things completely grow only
working on functionality it goes at the
cost of your quality thanks every now
and then built built time into the
process to improve quality and think
about the entire deliverable yes exactly
as you have to step up as a team to do
that if you're going to wait until your
product owner comes up with that well
you might have the ideal product only
from heaven who does that but usually
the products only only think about
functionality I actually want the
quality but they don't really know how
to manage that one of the teams do so
you have to get an understanding a
common understanding between the team
and the product i need to do that well
the official opposite team for this take
responsibility not just one person who
the team look the whole thing Wow so
congratulations for coming to java
oneindia and I really appreciate you
taking your time thank you Andrew thank
you this is Tori wheel with the Oracle
