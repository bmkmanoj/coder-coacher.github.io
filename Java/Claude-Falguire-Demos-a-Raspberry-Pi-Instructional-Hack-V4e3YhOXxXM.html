technology Network we're here at devoxx
and we've done some really exciting
hacks with raspberry pi so I've got
clawed for Gail with me hello Claude
that's all right um so you did a hack
here I want to see what you did yeah I
build the game actually I didn't build
the game today but I add the game that I
did for another challenge that was
usable with key and mouse so I've ported
it to use it with the leap motion so the
game is a is a sort of adorable that you
move out of a maze and when as long as
you as it moves it creates some cards so
it's 24 for kids and to learn that when
what is the program and what is the
sequence of a restriction in the program
next idea to catch them with a game and
then learn them the basic of programming
oh so you're sneaking programming in
behind the game that's excellent so come
let's take a look at your hair the game
is is written in processing and in Java
it took me a very few time to integrate
the leap motion it's very
straightforward weather what took me a
long time is to replace everything is
done with key and mouse so it's take
more time than doing the leap motion
thing so to play the game the robot
start and you can stop it when you close
your hand and it start again if you give
the appropriate order
Claude that was really cool thanks I
can't wait to try it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
