Apple released java SE 8 with java
ethics developer preview release her arm
this release has been tested on the
raspbian weezy linux operating system
with armed v6 hard floating-point but it
should work on other arm platforms this
release gives arm developers an
opportunity to kick the tires of java SE
it before the scheduled release in late
2013 in addition to the new java SE
features this release provides specific
support of hard float GPU on the
raspberry pi the support for hard float
GPU has been anticipated by a number of
developers as our viewers are aware the
embedded space is changing rapidly in
two ways technology advances lead to
faster processors that consume less
power than ever and low-cost memory has
exploded with the advent of small
devices the java advantage for embedded
devices comes in many ways a familiar
development model robust and secure
environment highly portable and
widespread community support for
headphone environments java SE 8
Developer Preview features JavaFX a rich
and flexible UI toolkit that is also
available for desktop applications with
JavaFX developers can preserve existing
investments by reusing Java libraries in
their applications there are a few
features of the javafx api provided with
this Developer Preview are not supported
for this release including webnode media
changing cursor type and any java api
that requires x11 such as the WT and
swing java evangelist even shown says
this is a great platform for doing small
embedded projects a low cost computing
system for teaching and great fun for
hobbyists Richard bear JavaFX chief
architect reported exceptional
performance for Java versus GCC on the
JavaFX experience blog and went on to
say that JavaFX will own the display on
the Raspberry Pi until x11 support shows
up as both Richard and Stephen point out
the download page includes setup and
structions for raspberry pi device as
well as demos and samples developers are
also encouraged to try their own
applications as well and to share their
stories via the JavaFX or project
feedback forums if you have a raspberry
pi or other arm devices it's time to get
started with java SE 8 develop a preview
release that is all the news for this
edition of Duke knows news thank you and
good night
