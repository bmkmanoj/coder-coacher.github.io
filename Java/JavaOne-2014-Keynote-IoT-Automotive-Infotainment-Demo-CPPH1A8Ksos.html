outlined with Java embedded I'd like now
to invite my colleagues Jasper pots and
Richard bear on stage for a
demonstration hey guys here how's it
going well we'll do the handshake yeah
okay you guys last year chess it was
cool robot arm that was greedy printed
dukes I was worried you guys set the bar
extremely high for this year it was a
challenge okay so what are we doing this
year well so Jasper's genius crew has
been working really hard to try to bring
you something it's a complete end-to-end
demo similar to last year where we had
sensors devices touch screens Java ME
embedded java SE embedded we've got a
cloud we've got EE we've got EE 7 we've
got websockets we've got a sink I oh
we've got a connect and a TV and a web
browser ok so a big ball of different
stuff we put it all in there ok so can I
see it please look let's unveil it
yangtze there we go
okay it looks like a car they have a car
if we have a car so has what am I
looking at we've got some touch screens
your your dashboard you've got your
console display over here on the side
with maps and music and everything we've
got pedals we've got accelerometers
we've got a fan we've got lights on the
vehicle we have an IOT gateway that
talks to the cloud service we've got a
couple good embedded boards here for
driving in the displays touch pads for
interacting with it Jasper on should go
hidden yep show the folks such a guy so
we have different views we can switch
between the different views so we fought
you know the old sort of buttons were a
bit you know old school so we could have
touch pads on the steering wheel we can
zoom in and see 3d maps we can start a
car remember to press the brake first as
you can start driving on stage and
hopefully we're not getting any k 6th
force well we have to find something
that was gonna break so as he's hitting
the accelerometers and the pedals over
here one thing that you can see is that
but behind these we actually have three
different k 64 boards that are running
java and me that are on here one is
behind these pedals and another one is
down here that has like a temperature
sensor and a light sensor on it and you
can see that the display goes into night
mode when it's covered and all that
information is on a bus that runs inside
the car talks to the clouds to the IOT
gateway which then is talking as you can
see on the diagram up there talks to a
cloud service that we have running that
talks then to an application that's
running on glassfish using a sink I oh
in order to compute the information and
then it uses the WebSockets to come and
communicate with the display that we
have over on this side so as he's as
he's doing that you've got all the
different sort of sensor values that are
in there unfortunately the car is not
going to start oh I forgot to mention
this is an electric car and okay so
there's a start button there's a kick it
from behind button and you guys can
figure out so when you guys were
building
as you know we've talked a lot and I'm
out traveling around and meeting
customers and things we do see that
there's a change that's happening in
particular in automotive with IOT and
that there is a need to kind of change
what was once kind of fixed development
it goes with the car to have something
which is more adaptable in automotive
that's right so for example in this case
where we were doing an electric car one
of the things that you want to keep
track of is what's the battery behavior
like so you can imagine that you have
vendors who are producing batteries out
of a bunch of different factories and
you want to be able to keep track of how
well they're recharging each time you
might be wanting to do the same thing in
terms of like the brake capabilities and
the other sort of components that go
into the car and by collecting all that
information and sending it to the cloud
the automotive vendor is able to give
consumers a better user experience a
better consumer experience because they
can for example realize that you're
coming up to some point where you need
to have maintenance and they can send
you you know proactively information
that says this is your particular case
they could use some big data analysis in
order to figure that out well and not
all cars where the same right that's
right you're driving I even wear
something out faster than someone else
is driving that's right so hopefully
we're going to get her yeah we're we
helped piston we got the crew this is
off all fond of running on bleeding edge
stuff so you know these little guys the
K 64's have 128 k I ran around really
tiny and now Ram is for the entire
virtual machine plus whatever code you
know stack is there we're getting a
reboot plus the whatever user code that
you have running which is actually
really phenomenal they were able to to
get a virtual machine running a mess ok
so the chess gods was the demo God for
chest was really kind to last year his
back this year and we're going to reboot
yep yeah
oh it came back up I came back up so can
we stop crying see if he starts all
right let's probably start motoring
along here there we go now we're driving
thank you so tell us what's happening
now is he's accelerating so we have Java
server sound running we can generate all
the sound effects we can we have 3d maps
we have to do maps we can show our route
over here first are really driving sex
running odds are effects on the and the
dashboard displays we can also see on
the Left we have all the telemetry
running through the IOT server and
through e run running web sockets so the
whole sort of things we have all of our
senses or brake light comes on when we
break and we can switch into nightly so
Richard that's showing us break
acceleration and battery usage that's
right and you can you can see how it's
affecting the battery as time goes on
here so let's go to another screen this
is like I was talking about before kind
of like some big data analysis you know
over a broad span of different consumers
in this particular case we're seeing
that this batch of demo batteries is
kind of coming along and it has a
failure point it's somewhere around
14,000 miles well hold on we're not
driving 14,000 miles today we haven't
quite gone a mile yet so yeah we need to
go 14,000 miles well sorry you know hope
you have plenty of time today so we're
not driving 14,000 miles today alright
well Jasper just kick it up to 88 miles
per hour 88 miles an hour yeah
and here we go we should wait for the
reboot and you can see we're looking
along here and we can sort of see what's
happening to our battery as time goes on
and you know if I were a really good
vendor I guess somewhere somewhere
around here I'm going to warn the
consumer that it is time for them to
come in and change their battery because
oh and it looks like we've we got a
notification or a notification here that
the we got slattery maintenance required
within the next four hundred miles oh
shoot did your phone you brought a phone
i'm sorry i got a text uh it says your
2014 Duke DeLorean requires battery
maintenance within the next four hundred
miles local service stations reserved a
Tuesday 9am for me so sorry but we're
going to have to go get this fixed also
of you guys thank you very much for
helping out thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
