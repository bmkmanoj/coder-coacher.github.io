don't know me I work in the line tools
team so I take care of the compiler
implementation but over the last few
years I had fun with playing up with
many valhalla features and today I'm
going to talk about one of such features
which is what our reflection you may
wonder what as a reflection has to do
with val ala in the first place as you
have seen in today's talk with that
Brian Gay reflection is an important
part when it comes to inspect
dynamically the content of our class
file and if we are going to change the
contents of those class file well we may
as well we may as well better change
reflection because otherwise we won't be
able to see those changes in the
classified as usual as great as my
slides are going to be please don't make
any business decision based on that and
let's start with the basic definition of
what reflection is and as we do all
definition will just pull it off
Wikipedia so wikipedia says that
reflection is just a mechanism for
inspecting classes interfaces fields
methods at runtime without knowing the
methods of such interfaces will the
methods or compile time great it also
allows the instantiation of new objects
and invocation of methods the way i read
this is really pass this into two
different blocks I see one structural
layer which is basically what gives me
access to the gaps of a runtime type so
i can ask a class i can get the members
of a class for a given member such as a
metal they can ask what are the
parameter types of that method and such
but there is also another layer which is
operational reflection the operational
reflection is what allows me to actually
call a method once i get my engine on it
so you have a java language method they
want to call it i have a class i want to
instantiate any object that that's kind
of what operational layer does for me
and you may now ask well why do I care I
am a JVM s word or a GV n guru why do I
care about reflection well turns out
that few years
we were discussing about implementing
languages on top of the IBM and Charles
as a very good blog entry about what are
the main issues about trying to
implement the language of rock on top of
the BM and the main problem is really
getting around the limitation of the N
Shake with invoke virtual and invoke
statics so there is two way too much
java based semantics built on top of
dose op codes and we want to get free of
such assumptions so yesterday solution
was simply to use reflection as a
workaround not to be overly restrained
by Java semantics but this was not a
great solution because it was still too
strict because you had to have a real
job class with a real java method on it
and it was not giving very great
performances right because you need to
have boxing all over the place and yeah
that kind of sucked today solution is of
course in bak dynamic 292 so I can I can
have a much sharper tool in order to
create method endows method and loss of
a sharp syntax so i don't i don't have
any boxing and what's even better is
that I the client can decide a linking
logic so I have a lot of flexibility and
a lot of performances too because the VN
can see through the co site and can
optimize it that will essentially so we
don't need reflection in more right well
sort of this is an API that you should
all be familiar with it's the metal and
look up a PID which we have talked about
before and as you can see if you look
closer there are a lot of classes inside
right if you want to look a method the
owner of the method is going to be a
class but there's more there are metal
type thing is and what are those method
types where there are just a bunch of
classes you get a class for the return
type you get a bunch of classes for the
parameter type so that's how you
describe a method signature so the real
and fundamental problem with reflection
is that right now we are using the
reflect
as an entry point for getting access
into this Wonderland of method and those
features and if we don't have a way to
describe the signatures in which we are
interested in we don't have access to
such world so if you are implementing
your own language and you want to have
interoperability you need a way to be
able to speak about the signatures that
can appear in a class file and Balala
news flash is changing the signature so
we need a we need a way to be able to
describe them and that's kind of the
angle that I'm taking in this talk of
course in order to understand better
reflection we need to see our reflection
evolved over the last few years and so
we'll start from the very beginning when
reflection was really simple with a very
straightforward semantics so if you're
going to work with very simple classes
such as java.lang.string there's not
much to learn about reflection when you
have an instance you just get the class
which represent that particular instance
once you have a java.lang.class on your
end you can do a method look up such as
in this case where you look for the
method called length and then you can
even call the method by cooling invoke
you get some result you can use the
result however you like and it's pretty
much to look forward right reflection is
rubble based on these the subtotal
assumption in which if you have a
declaration you have a unique type that
comes from the Declaration and if you
have a declaration you also have a
unique runtime type that come from that
particular declaration and if you work
under this sweet spot assumption well
that's pretty powerful illusion because
i can actually pretend that the domain
of my source types is exactly the domain
of runtime types so i can basically use
one in place of another for example if i
look at the members of string
reflectively i will get the same members
that i get when i press control space in
my ID and that's the same thing and
that's a pretty powerful abstraction of
course we know better right source types
are not runtime types and so
source type in some sense is less rich
the runtime type as more things such as
a class loader so the compiler knows
anything about the + loader but of
course if you try to load the same class
twice which different class loaders
guess what you get to different
java.lang.class out of it and there are
also some more subtly shoes for example
accessibility the way in which the BM
does access checking is different from
the way in which the language does
access checking and for example in this
case we have a package private
superclass we have a public sub class
which in air is a method which is public
call em and then we try to call this
method reflectively from a different
package and what happens here if the
compiler didn't do anything we will get
a straight illegal access error because
the vm is seeing an access from a
different package straight into a method
that is declared in a package private
class well but if you try to run this
example it actually works well it works
because Java Sea is actually a bridging
the gap here and it's it's inserting an
accessibility bridge inside the class
sub in order to ever reflection to link
with the method in the public class
instead of the method in the package
private class and if you ever feel well
who cares yeah I don't want to know
right this is just too ok there are
corner cases everywhere I mean in in
most cases perfection just right well it
works but if you start piling up new and
new features on top of this very basic
use case then things start to get a
little bit more convoluted so let's
consider for example in our classes
right in our classes how r could they be
well they are all about letting you
declare clashes not only as top level
entities but also as nested entities
well one thing as you can see in this
light is that then you have to worry
about what means for an inner class to
access a private member of an outer
class which wasn't allowed before and
what does the vm do about it nothing the
roci completely removes and wipes out in
a class
is from the picture when you compile
right so you get a bunch of top level
classes the picture is completely flat
and of course they were see we'll have
to add more and more bridges in order to
let you access that problematic private
member as you can see we are still in a
sort of sweet sweet spot but not so much
because right now yes there is still a
single source type for like a
declaration but the source type in the
runtime our candidate they have
different properties the source type has
some notion of lexical scope scoping
while the runtime type doesn't the
runtime type is the split and what does
the reflection do does reflection expose
a flat view of classes or does it expose
a more chapter view of classes well it
can does both so at the at the very
basic level reflection is still the tool
for getting access to a descriptor so if
your field as a type of an inner class
reflection will give you an inner doll
or something class for death but at the
same time the reflection will also
expose you the declaration property that
this inner class came from so you can
still ask reflection questions such as
give me your declaring class give me
your enclosing method and stuff like
that and now is this implemented well
the Java C compiler will need to add
some extra attributes on the classifier
because things such as for example the
modifier of an inner class or things
that are not represented in the bytecode
so these are added back as bytecode a
surrogate and reflection guess what it
reads the very same attributes and then
it kind of manchas them and presents
them in a way that the user can
understand it kind of works well until
it doesn't so these are generics so we
we have turned our complexity knob a
little bit and now we have generic class
decoration a generic last decoration is
just a class declaration with some type
parameter anti parameters are just types
that I can use in the declaration
wherever I like and clients can define
what is the binding for those type
parameters so i can have a box of
integer i can have a box of string
and for the from the perspective of the
client they're basically just the same
just with different type instantiation
what does the VN deuce do for this
particular cross again nothing CC will
completely wipe out generics from the
picture during compilation this is
called airasia this is what Brian talked
about earlier and since the race version
of box here is lossy because it's using
object instead of X the compiler is to
bridge the gap once again and insert the
synthetic cast at the youth side because
otherwise the code won't verify because
I for example when he call get on a box
of integer and getting back an object
and I'm expecting an integer an integer
so I need a cast what happened here is
that we broke one leg of our diagram
there is no more I want to one mapping
between a declaration in a source type
now we have a single declaration that
can lead to multiple source types on the
other end oratio come to rescue because
it still collapses all the possible
source types into the same runtime
artifact so if I have box of string boss
of integer box of double I don't care
they are all mapped back into the single
box that class abstraction but with
reflection and generics we are actually
at a breakage point because with with
generics reflection is starting to do
some weird things so since reflection
want to expose the generic information
that is available at the time of
declaration so let's say that you have a
generic superclass the reflection will
allow you to see that generic superclass
is it as it was written in the source
code which means we now have a new
hierarchy which is called holographic
type which is used to represent any type
that is representable in the signature
attribute that was stuck there by Darcy
why did why do we need a signature
attribute again four separate completion
and again reflection is kind of parsing
that attribute and exposing that
information back to user
how does this work well so and so as you
can see if i have a class called sub box
and the class as a superclass which is
generic i can ask the same information
into slightly different ways i can ask
what is your superclass and i get our ol
box or i can ask what is your generic
superclass and i get back a box of swing
Wow and this is actually the number one
most exploited trick to fake or
ification I think a lot of EE code uses
this in order to fake some sort of type
ramification at runtime this is not the
end of the string though because in jdk
8 we are the type annotation so you can
annotate not only declaration but also
types and the problem now is that class
is both the type and the declaration so
if we add some method for getting
annotation on the type abstraction class
will inherit it and so class will be
coming earth in earthly ambiguous and
could expose both Type O notation and
declaration annotation that's just too
messy so what we did instead was to add
yet another hierarchy called annotated
type and this hierarchy is basically
just used to reflect information about
type annotations so now we have yet
another accessor we can ask the
superclass the generic super class and
the annotated superclass there are all
different types and with different
properties but they are all there and if
you think is just super class you're
wrong it's not just about super class is
about super interfaces is about the type
of a field which can be generic
annotator or whatever so basically we
have a a bunch of access or spread
almost everywhere across the core
affection API so this is kind of the
analogy right the poor car here is a
java.lang.class and we kept adding stuff
on top of it until the car can barely
move and guess what we are going to add
me on stuff on top of it right because
we have still to get to level a bit yeah
right so with Valhalla
you can annotate that I variable with
the any modifier which means the type
variable is any file if what I variable
is an if I the very cool thing but also
the bad thing is that the time variable
will actually stay available in the
bytecode so if you could take a look at
the Java p output for this case file you
will actually see X's in there which is
actually pretty cool and another
difference is that if you have a
specialization like a box of in that
specialization will actually stay alive
in the bytecode because the static
compiler like Java Sea knows that the
type for box of hint is going to remain
sharp all the way down and so if you
call get you're going to get an int back
not an object and you don't need any
boxing or any caste or whatever good but
what it means for our diagram is that we
also broke the other arm of our yeah of
the diagram where basically now if we
have a single declaration we also have
multiple runtime types and guess what
it's even worse because they r I T of
the shorts types that can come from a
single declaration easy is different
from the era t of the runtime type that
can come from the same declaration
because some type are raised some other
types are not so we can have box of
integer which is raised and box of ink
is not a race so go figure and so there
there is a bunch of things that belong
our reflection need to think about of
course as we have seen there is a bunch
of new constant pool entries that are
kind that they are coming with Balala to
represent pretty much the old
information that can revolve around
specialization so we can express generic
types we can express in America Rays tie
variables and such in a structural way
and the first challenge of valhalla base
reflection is to be able to expose
information to such constant pole
entries because if we don't this
information is going to show up in the
scriptures if we are not able to reflect
over this information we are not able to
for example look up a method angle that
shows up this information
a second challenge is to actually
provide access to the specialized
metadata so if I ever box opened I may
actually get be interested in knowing
that my box is being specialized with an
end this is something different from
what I had before where everything can i
went back into the same artifact now we
have different artifacts they may want
to know about the difference at runtime
the results the question about what to
do about legacy concert such as food of
class forget class as ryan told as
before is not clear whether such concert
refer to the template class or the
deranged specialization or to something
else and last but not least I'll deck to
implement operation plement operational
reflection in an efficient way because
if you look at
java.lang.reflect.method.invoke API and
that API is boxing because it's using
object as parameter type is using object
as a return type so there's no way you
can call a method reflectively on a box
of fiend and not get boxing so that's
another problem that we have to face the
three goals that I'm gonna set up to
evaluate any kind of solutions that are
going to come up in the next few slides
are basically easy of use so I want an
API that is very simple and why does it
have to be simple while because
reflection is simple as we have seen in
started off from a very simple API where
there were very few concept to learn and
I I'd like it I'd like to keep it that
way abstraction fidelity is the second
requirement so I want an API that
remains true to the nature of the things
that I'm going to reflect over while
with class I can I can't really say the
same thing because glass is trying to be
all different things to all different
people and the third point is
compatibility so I want an API the
disabled to guarantee to make some sort
of guarantees about compatibility so
that i know that i can use these new
entities also in a compatible passion to
operate with legacy API such as metal
band or look up and such solution number
one of course is the obvious solution of
let's add more straws on on our on our
car right let's double down on
java.lang.class we will just add a new
specialized little like for fin Dodds
species will add a new where method an
object of course get species they will
both return some form of class and class
will have some some outer return
information about what is the actual
parameter type for the specialization
that can be done either by having class
implementing parameterised type or maybe
just by subclassing class in some way
well class is final well which we go
either way but anyway that's the idea so
we have a box of fiend we can get the
species for box of hint and then we can
ask the species what is your actual
argument okay that works and then we
want to do a lookup we want to look for
the mass of colgate we can invoke the
metal if you pay attention the
invocation will actually do boxing on
the return value which is undesirable
because the whole point of balada is to
remove interactions but it kind of works
it sees your view is easy to use
certainly it is compatible yes because
i'm still using the online class but it
really sucks in terms of kind of getting
a nice representation for the
abstraction of play here so let's look
for something that is a little bit
cleaner in terms of modeling and what
other API do we have around in jdk well
another API is the source with actual
API that was introduced in jdk six we
have an API that is mainly targeted that
compiler writers and annotation
processors so it's an API design for
reasoning about the programming language
elements or source types not run hang
tight but these are very flexible API
it's all defining term of interfaces and
the mirror term and since it's defined
in terms of interfaces you can even
implement this API and provide an
implementation
fork or reflection on top of this and
that's what Joe does he did it's false
was likely more modern API so the return
values the aggregate values are returned
as collection not as a race which is a
nice to F because then you can
interoperate nicely with strings can we
build Bala reflection on top of this you
think we can we can define a mapping so
a generic declaration will be some kind
of element or parameterised I would be
some kind of mirror we can also have
some kind of compatibility layer so we
are we are able to map murals back into
an effective object so for example if I
ever the clear type i can go back to a
class if i have a executable element
which is the java.lang model lingo for
method i can go back to a
java.lang.reflect.method.invoke field
and those who will probably need to add
a few mirrors for the types that are non
the notable in the source like the race
token or the any for I cards and such
what does solution to looks like well
let's start off with the box a fiend we
get a mirror for that box as we can see
we get a little bit of verbosity year
because we have no language support for
getting mirrors out of a box of in but
that's not that doesn't bother me at
this point in time we can get the type
argument we can print out the type
argument and then we have the look up
what used to be a one-liner using core
reflection it now turned into a bloody
nightmare right we have five lines or
very thick code where and the biggest
problem here is that we have to go back
from a mirror to an element because yes
this API is clean but unfortunately
lookup is a function of a symbol or of
an element and is not a function of a
type so if you have a mirror on your end
you have to go back to an element and
then to do the look up from there and
then go back to the mirror well and
what's worse is that this API is overly
general so for example things like
filtering by name is not easy because
this API represent
games as interfaces so there is a
general named interface and it to do a
name compare this one you have to call
content equals it doesn't really fly
right so it's definitely a cleaner
solution in terms of abstraction
involved you have a clean separation
between declaration and types it's
compatible because we added an explicit
compatibility layer on top of it but
what really what is really bad about the
solution I think it's easy of use we
can't really sell this to the average
programmer I think in core of lecture
you just have a single abstraction here
you have to you have types and
declarations and you're constantly to go
back and forth between the two even
without look up for example if you want
to know the package of a class you have
to go back from the type the declaration
because package is a function of the
decoration is not a function on the type
so all sorts of tricks arise because of
that distinction so guess what we have
to come up with something new right and
we have to create something from scratch
the basic idea that i'm going to use
here is to try to play a trick new and
to convince you that i can use a single
abstraction to model both declaration
and types how do i do that well i can
say that box of x is a declaration and
box of in is a type and this is nice
it's actually a story that has been
exploited by C sharp reflection and I
think it leads to a nice simplification
of the user model because now there's
just one abstraction that you have to
think I'll learn about so this
abstraction the root of my hierarchy is
called runtime mirror a runtime error is
basically the API point that is able to
represent whatever abstraction can
appear at the bytecode level so what you
can see is that all mirrors are created
through factory methods and you have
common operation such as kind query type
of quality subtyping and such and
of course nightmares can support
multiple access or entry point so this
is our taxonomy if we look here these
are all the descriptor that they can
express today they are all utf-8 this is
both valid for classes or raisin
primitives but if we look at valhalla we
we get a bunch of neat stuff here we get
values we get generic types and all are
represented in terms of new specialized
constant pool entries and the key here
is that all that is representable at the
constant pool level as an equivalent a
term of the runtime mirror API of course
we need to be able to support
specialization which means some of those
mirrors are going to be specialized
about when a mirror is specialized
herbal a mirror will basically offer an
extra API point to go back and for the
specialized representation and the base
declaration representation so if I have
a box of x i can ask box of X mirror to
get get me a specialized representation
for box of in and that will work and I
can also go back from box of into box of
X another important use case of course
member look up which we have seen as
fail almost particularly with the
javelin model API so we need something a
little bit better here and the way I
went around these is to provide explicit
look up classes so in order to do a
lookup you have first to retrieve a
lookup class once you have a look up
class you can specify a set of custom
filters and then you gather the result
of this look at you can get the result
in two ways if you are interested in all
the possible matches for your lookup you
call a method called fine though if you
are interested in in a unique metric
equal a method call find or fail which
either will give you the unique match or
we'll just throw an exception so these
are a few examples for look up if we
have a mirror for box of X we can look
for example for all the fields and that
works
or if we are interested in a particular
method for example we can get a method
look up we can filter by name and
specify yet and filter by return type
and say okay the return type has to be
the mirror for x and then i can call
find or fail and that works everything
is declarative in its api so there is no
other wire default like in co reflection
where for example if you call get the
clear members so sorry get the clear
methods you get only the metals declare
in that specific class but if you kill
if you call get metals you get all the
publicly inherited methods that have
been declared by either yourself or any
super class here you can decide how much
stuff you want in your row kappa of
course doing strict look up with generic
metals is a little bit of opinion
because as you can see from the slide
generic metals can introduce their own
type variables and if i'm going to do a
lookup looking at this from a client
perspective if i'm going to have to
match this generic method I'll decked
out there to a specified the signature
for the metal because i don't know about
that I variable I'd of time right so the
way Brian came up with a nice idea about
this which is well let's just add a new
filter method which accept the lambda so
I can pass a lambda the lambda takes
seen the tie variables declaring the
generic method that I'm about to kind of
evaluate for a match and spits out the
potential signature that I want to match
again so in this particular example the
lambda will return the parameter list
that contains Z essentially where C is
the input of the lambda expression and
of course it wouldn't be a reflection
API if we didn't have some sort of
operational feature right so we need to
have a way for calling methods creating
instances and how does this API go about
that well it doesn't it really doesn't
offer any support for operational
reflection other than allowing you to
project these new mirrors into
abstractions that already exist so for
example if you have a class mirror you
can go back to a java.lang.class if you
have a method mirror you can go back to
a java language that mess
and you do this by calling the special
reflect method the trick about the
reflect method is that you can only call
it if the underline mirror is ty
valuable free so it must correspond to
some type this representable at runtime
if you have some type variables in there
it won't work it will throw an exception
because there's no life type that exists
in the vm if you have type variables in
there you can also project these murals
into something different so for example
if you have a towel and reflect method
you can project it to a method n low and
that's actually is a nice solution
because it gives us an answer for I'll
do i do operational reflection on
specialized classes because if i get a
method endl i don't have to use the same
API for all the calls I just create a
specialized method and for that and
that's gonna work without boxing this is
how the last solution is going to look
like so I have a box of hint i can get
the mirror for box filled with my
factory of course again it is very
verbose because i don't have any
language support for it but that's fine
then i can specialize the box of X
mirror with in 10 get Ibaka fiend then I
can inspect the parameters and as you
can see the look up now got a lot better
I can just get a lookup method and then
filter by name and then call finder fail
I get my my anthem on the method and
then I can project it back to our
collective method and call it or I can
project it back to a method and your
question clear guitar yeah
all right yeah yeah there's an obviously
mistake here yeah it should be in that
class yeah sorry yeah the question was
the dead yeah so right it returns are a
list of runtime errors
yeah yeah
and this is actually a relatively easy
to use there is just one abstraction
which is runtime mirror yes we have some
subclasses like a ray mirror cost me
around primitive mirror value mirror and
they may not even get it to the final
stage but there is still a main entry
point to this API I like this API
because it remains true to what its goal
is which is to be able to remain true to
what's available in the bytecode so if
you have some bytecode descriptor you
have a mirror for it and you have a way
to express the mirror and it's also
compatible because we can always project
these things back into reflective
objects so we can still create a mirror
for box of int and then convert it back
to a class and then pass the class to
the method and look up API and be fine
with it of course there are several open
issues this is just the start for
example there are few weak cups around
generic method translation as Brian
shown us this morning generic methods
are sins dated as in your classes and
currently this is the only place in the
new API where we kind of fake and fall
back into the same bed tricks that
traditional reflection does so we kind
of try to I'd the inner class from the
user and that bites us back because when
we get a reflective object for them
generic method we get something that
doesn't exactly have the same properties
that the user expects but we can
probably put some patch on it in some
way of course I didn't even cover
packages or modules for packages I don't
even know whether something is needed
they are kind of a leaky abstraction in
the java.lang package API maybe a string
is just as fine and maybe we don't even
want to expose this ring if you are
interested in in the package you just
map the class mirror back to a divalent
class and you get the package from their
models could be a similar problem I
didn't speak a lot about integrating
source reflection and runtime reflection
but now if we have two api's which kind
of do the same thing wouldn't it be nice
if we had a unified way to access to
those API from the language so we could
there for example a way to
have a type token to exert a type token
out of any expression in the Java
language and then to project this type
into either a runtime type through air
asia or back to a source reflection type
mirror all element api point of course
we are going to need language
integration because we are not really
too much into creating mirrors through
factories is to just two turbos for the
main user so and that kind of ties with
BM support so what what is the support a
vm is going to give us I'd like to think
that murals are the equivalent of today
java and class so there will be some
sort of representation for the new code
sample entries in the vm and maybe
mirrors could be just a java view of
those vm internal representation but it
may be something else of course that's
the end of the talk really there is a
bunch of links the first of the valhalla
repo which contains an implementation
for this API then there's a link or the
Javadoc this new reflection API and then
there is a kind of the long version of
this talk is a break up that contains
all the design the sheet this is
decision behind the new reflection API
and can the path that brought us here in
the first place</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
