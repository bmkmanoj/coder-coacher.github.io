here in tarina with the local java user
group and we're yesterday I was in Basel
so I just drove down this morning it was
a very very nice drive through
Switzerland and I'm joined here with
Roberto and son Simon and these are the
user group leaders for the local jug and
we're going to we're going to chat about
some things which they're doing with
their user group and company projects
which are working on talk about things
like project lombok and speedy and also
hack a little bit with the Raspberry Pi
which we have in a corner here they're
barely on screen and just to explain the
formatted show so it's all broadcast
live on ustream go 2nite hacking calm if
you want to check out the live
broadcasts while we're chatting you can
send messages on the social stream over
Twitter or Facebook and then it will
show up on our screen here and we can
respond in and interact with folks and
it's it's fairly informal will probably
run for about 45 minutes or however long
we feel like it and so we're not having
fun anymore all right so why don't you
guys introduce yourself so Roberto you
you work at the company here which were
located at all seal Sally Sally Sally
yeah we do we welcome with semantic
topics on with a suite of NLP natural
language processing so we have a we are
a team of developers on linguistic we
scraped the web and then we analyzed the
contents to show to the company's what
the people say about them we are still
growing as I and we were call also on
some some other technologies such as
hell DF Sparky where and so on ok so so
what sort of Java technologies key is in
here well I'm a back-end guy I'm the
tech leader but I work mostly in the
back end so we have a lot of code
written in Java we've all bed what we
did the last five years we've used you
seen that's a library from the Apache
foundation to right sir changes we use
another final form Apache called women
women women is an unstructured
information management architecture when
I jawara pipelines and
the Lord of all the technologies in my
spare times I'm I brought a JDBC driver
for a non sequel to be called oandb
let's graph the database and we we use
it a cashier open as an open source you
can you repeat it back various you know
we could further open source yes you use
knocking lowers and you also contribute
back yeah we try to do to do both so you
wanna introduce yourself seven hey I'm
Simona birthday I'm on the jetty team
the server container we mainly provides
support for the jetty server container
and helping customers in tuning and
writing application on jelly we also
sponsor another open source project
called comedy which is a web messaging
framework used to for example right chat
applications or you know application
they are driven by server side events
for example streaming stock prices or
news or sport news or chess games or
board games in general in online games
too I'm mostly a network protocol guy
and as we did a low level yeah a low
level stuff heb and other protocols and
WebSocket recently we follow the spec so
basically we implement the circus
specification and although the
technology related to that so we're you
know we have a good knowledge in that
and recently we also worked on a new
protocol called speedy which was
proposed by Google which is supposed to
be which is really interesting it's
already widely deployed
and let's see maybe we have some time to
talk about it okay yeah we can look a
little bit more into some of the
technologies you guys talked about all
right thanks for the introductions guys
may get us back and focus there we go
all right so maybe to start off with if
anyone on the street has questions for
Roberto or so they say so so long Simon
Simon I'm s we're talking English for
uncle see ya you're fine with Simon
because I'll mangle your name if I try
to say that time especially so let's
maybe we can look at some of the
technologies you guys you guys mentioned
which you're using let's see okay so
I've got our desktop up and the browser
that looks like that was some random
site I ended up on a Wi-Fi network okay
and what's the maybe we should start
with is our public website for a seal
seeley seeley w JV save and Judy I it
like noche LSU hi yes so you guys have a
four letter domain that's pretty good so
it's only four letters for your for your
witness so what part of this do you work
on
lomita vision Oh blog mater yes la main
brothers and then this I think we were
talking about this earlier but this song
like captures public tweets and kind of
does metrics on them English very good
yeah it's it's a it's translating it now
there we go is this some online demo
does the demo actually work you probably
probably you probably never go here
those elves enough like a guy how about
how about on your stuff oh yeah we do
you want to install a firefox extension
so yeah sure sure adults yeah and type
in search for speedy SPDY yay i won
we're shy speedy support in address bar
okay is that done yeah don't know if you
have to restart the browser I don't
think so okay well have you and then go
to WWE com
yeah you can see from the green arrow oh
yeah okay so speedy is active for that
released awesome website is being served
in speeding okay and you know so it's
like it's like an alternative for HTTP
yeah it's a it's a problem that has been
designed to improve the HIV limits that
we're hitting now and for example we
have a we maintain a blog and talked
about speedy and all the goods that
speedy brings to the world and there are
a bunch of measurements done by
third-party people that says that it's
already faster than a cheapy brother and
we are presented in a java one session
if you scroll down there's a there's a
daemon tool that we presented the job
one and shows how your website could be
you know way faster if you just try to
upgrade and use a speeding and stuff
that's gone this way that's the demo
presenter the jungle one cool cool help
us here java one session i was good
backin was
count of people packed oh wow well
congratulations yeah yeah was that kind
of a smallish room but it was good it
was there was a good interaction and
especially feedback it's been great ok
let me out when you love people know
where they can find this side you how
did you enjoy San Francisco when you're
out there Oh san francisc is a very nice
see they always enjoyed it it was a sort
of this great weather when I go there
now I have many people to say so
sometimes to get a frog and you know
rainy and stuff but I've been there
several times and always going very
beautiful sunny day ok see worth her
last year though last year i think last
year is the first year on number
training during java one was old funny
now it we had it was the first year we
tried to do something outside between
the two buildings so they rather than
having a close temp they opened it up in
a different but this year is really nice
in San Francisco alright cool this is a
little bit about the speedy protocol if
they want to scream his questions for
Simon about the speedy Furcal I'm sure
you'd be happy to talk about it more
yeah absolutely and also some of the
some of the social social data mining
you're doing and ceiling okay so let me
let me show you guys some javafx stuff
so what we're going to do is we're going
to we're going to skip over the
presentation because I people people
Austrian obscene enough presentations
and will just flow just do some hacking
so let's let's get a little javafx
project from scratch and then we're
going to deploy it on the pie and we're
going to try running in a pie and that
will be our hacking session mom alright
so
go to start up that means if i can see
that be a splash screen now with a
picture of a picture a picture a todos
on the way down alright so I have I've
egregiously large fonts but also high
resolution so they're probably canceling
each other out if you have trouble
seeing the fonts on the stream let me
know increase the font size even bigger
all right so we're a new project from
scratch you've got have you guys ever
heard about the scene builder tool yeah
so it's a visual tool for building you
eyes I think it's part of the fastest
way to get started with Java flex if
you're new so let's create a directory
no app default platform yeah looks good
alright so now we got a sample
application this is the basic structure
of any Java flex app um extend the
javafx application class just like a
main method influence well the standard
public static void final public static
void main method and then called launch
which is a static method to kick up at a
star student especially we're talking
about threats before you say did a
question about this stuff related to
some of the work you don't swing before
right right so was it what was it you're
trying to get the swing team to do well
the key point is that if you if you have
to run a code that takes a lot of time
and thread then you freeze the UI and
that's the typical problem that you get
with you know swinging application or
even Java facts and so the solution so
far have been something like you know
either manually starting an interactive
doing the start in the background but
then you have to you know be aware of
the fact that you don't have to touch
the swing components in the other thread
so it's a difficult way and it requires
a lot of skills and a lot of you must be
really precise in what you're doing so
another solution that came up over the
years I think there is now like three or
four versions of it is the swing worker
and which is a good solution allows you
to hide a little bit of all this
complexity but still you have to make it
a lot of attention of you know not
touching swear components into the other
threads and you know posting new events
and on the queue to make things happen
now if you several years ago we I was
working around a big swing project and
it turned out there is already a can of
a solution in the JDK itself when you
pop up a modal dialog what happens is
that you have indeed for example you
click on a button and you pop up a modal
dialog now the event handler for the
button that actually pops up the dialog
stops there doesn't proxy the past when
you show the dialogue but still the UI
doesn't freeze so there's a kind of a
solution already it's a it's based on
the mechanism that makes modal dialog
work and it's really cool because the if
you can if you can use the same
mechanism then your code we can
very easy to read and it's very easy
also to manage things in a way that you
don't mess with components and you still
keep your UI responsive for example you
can resize windows you can do other
stuff than normally end up in you know
freezing the UI and you know painting
those great rectangles around so okay
because I know when you place for the
modal dialog stuff in swing when you
launch a modal dialog your good stops
like that necessarily that's exactly
right so it would the idea be that like
on the on the swing event dispatch
thread you would say you know I'm giving
up control here exactly and then it
would go do other things excitement is
another will come back yeah the modal
dialog how it works is that when you
start a modal dialog basically you're
saying in that tread you start another
it's called an event pump which runs
normally in the swing event thread but
I'm but with the when you start a model
dial you start another pump the pump
only pounds the events and dispatches
the events for the dialogue but if you
have precise events were you know you're
you know icon izing your main window or
stuff like that still the painting is
going on so yeah we're the solution on
open source project for this is called
Foxtrot it's on sourceforge spin updated
up to the jdk 7 but we have to do some
kind of bad hacks in order to follow up
with the JDK versions but it works fine
gives a new programming model and I
focus the redesign yeah the first one
gives a good programming model and I
think it's worthwhile to explore the
wallet it's basically leverages the
existing dialogue features that are
already present in the
the only thing is that they're not
really exposed as a public API so on
this project Foxtrot we actually do some
trick in order to access those private
api's will be good if you know with some
effort from these maintained and I like
well I think maybe will be interesting
is to do a version of Foxtrot for java
 well yeah why not yeah be
interesting to know the difference is
I'm not very knowledgeable javafx but
I'm why not yeah yeah no we can give
that a try what's those two child
effects out first but okay so that the
JavaFX event thread ma let me let me
just describe that quickly so folks know
how it works let's bring that things up
again so the way the way the event
thread model works is when you call
launched it starts up what's called the
JavaFX application thread it's similar
to the swing of anticipation but it's a
different thread and then from that
thread is same thing you want to keep
all of your UI calls on the application
thread so the start method here gets
called back on the Java fixed
application throughout all the event
listeners get called back on the
application thread both it's a little
bit more forgiving than swing is you can
create new javafx objects on a separate
thread but you just had to make sure
that you only add them to the scene
graph after on the application through
itself so you can build up like a whole
new screen with buttons and controls and
layouts just don't connect it to the
main scene graph until you're on the
application of growth right it's the
same in swing you can create new things
and swing well theoretically yes until
you link them into
can order stuff there's three others
bugs another all right you find them out
when you get a deadlock yeah but it's
similar to so Scylla range of effects
you have the same problem that if you if
you run along stuff in the yeah so we
can we can we can demonstrate the
problem if so let's let's just run this
and she have a sample app all this is
doing is loading a little you I from the
Suffolk small file okay so see it seems
to be working now what if we listen I
click when we click the button what if
we had a really complex calculation like
sleeping for 10 seconds yeah wow that's
not 10 seconds inside me two seconds but
it's a good cool well thousand or
something well what's up
a thousand is only one second or into
that one off Becca that's right again
yes oh don't don't try this at home it's
very bad very bad coding practice click
up are you guys broke em yeah try to
resize the window yeah it's dead dead oh
so freed up for a sec because I clicked
on the button all the cute up of this so
you have the same problem you have in
swing because old yellow that's that's
pretty good we got an exception well the
events will queue up and wow okay yeah
don't do that don't do that I don't
create with it okay we're back hmm yeah
so this this probably loves a bug bug
fix alright so meet let me show you guys
what we have a cell phone to show you
guys the what the f xml file looks like
so it's just an xml format for declaring
the UI so this is one of layouts anchor
pain which lets you anchor things to the
corners and you know just has a button
and a label but rather than doing this
stuff manually it's a lot easier to open
this up in seen builder okay and here's
your scene builder
so this is this is a pretty easy to use
visual tool for defining your UI so
let's let's do something very creative
welcome to turn em out that you can use
some CSS Styles here FX font size a lil
it's big resize things oh I like your
look up for the job let's put your drug
log on here where can I find on main
page goes whoo jug three no both 1800
for a sec I have it yeah there's ever
than I but you can pick the gutter
I wish I should have saved up rather
than copying okay what do you needing
the telefax you need the URL ah just the
day we're just gonna work output of it
what I say lets her just fun for
downloads meant I was
not desktop know where I says it
that's just tough go go there yeah
logos a stunning ok so it didn't it
obviously didn't get strike
I was faster that time all right jug
Trina all right so we're going to take
this and we're going to put this inside
of the scene builder application so
first I'm going to find where our
nephews project is trucked arena and i
think i created the netbeans folder and
drag that image in there those projects
jug torino now I guess I didn't raise
their work i create this i created it
and of course because i wanted to not be
able to find it later cheb tarina source
all right we're going to stick it right
in here so it's easier to graph from the
classpath this one probably
ok
and then okay now you've got the logo
and let's use seen filter and put it in
your image
thank you
ah
sub tree up there we go and
we'll do something how about we um spin
the cow so you click the button mole
hole oh that's cool just for fun okay
there now we've got our our junk torino
application FX background color side up
back home coming it's a good background
color yeah oh boy how about yellow light
blue it's okay
ok
so now we got to spin the cow all right
first of all let's try this application
and see if it works so you can preview
stuff and see the Builder here so it's a
little like preview but it's it's not
active and then we can also go back to
NetBeans and try running it should
cool
okay doesn't quite work yet but we're
getting there all right now to spin the
cow so we have you know this wheat we
can click the button and it calls back
on our action Handler and the way that's
done is if you look at if you look at
the f XML file the button calls handle
button action you can also do this in
here if you click on button and go to
code so calls handle button option so
that calls that calls a method in our
controller class which is here but this
will call this method but if you want to
manipulate objects the did the other way
you can add an F XML annotation and then
create a guy here and all inject it so
let's let's inject our cow it's a boom
okay see this so it's very easy to edit
their spendable ok and then were going
to label this guy put an ID on him so we
can actually referring him so Oh
let's now change my keyboard traffic so
much
are you happier
yeah okay he's happy now so normally it
gives you in the drop down menu here if
it's not listed but I have a nevermind
of dance project they're linked together
okay now we can we can rotate the bolt
it's really easy to do animation to jog
effects I'm going to quit line now so
people stop seeing all my emails
whatever it's really do animations and
javafx so we can just set up a new
trance transition to do rotate so was it
rotate transition oops we're going to
use the Builder builders our new style
of coating applications kind of groovy
builders but it's valid Java syntax so
apply this to
the ball and we wanna
help me out here hello fashion what are
you not happy about apply to image
okay wrong one I think I want node ok
notice bowl and it should be an image
for you about image my bad so an image
is the file an image view is the other
the visual visual rough around and you
can have multiple image views refer to
the same refer to the same image cool so
we have on Mike Mike Talon Kenton you
read the code so let's he'll tell us if
you can see the code or no okay so then
we got the rotate transition we probably
should set the angle I'm just going to
rotate to from angle is probably zero
all right baby shoes your to angle or by
angle let's do by angle it's a double I
bet it's random say see that's your
apples okay and then bill do with this
video it creates the rotate transition
yeah so supplies it now it doesn't apply
that's a good point we have to actually
play it so it just returns the
transition and we are something and then
you have to play yeah okay dark to cash
thanks
oh that's a spinning nice so the default
is rotate around the center yeah yeah
you got a gig excessive rotation points
it's the kind of timing oh yeah we
didn't we didn't we didn't set the
duration to so it must be using a
default you can we can set the duration
ourselves so we do durations this is a
duration class and then you do duration
dot and you can do this way you don't
mess up Knowles that goes by side so if
you want to have it take maybe five
seconds to spin the ball and maybe we'll
make how many rotations may be my
reference conversations let's spin them
yeah pretty for one line of code the
world let's say five lines of code all
right so let's get this working I really
gotta fix the label here too but let's
get this working yeah so while the ball
is spinning um can you do other stuff on
the event I yeah yeah that's a good
question you can there's a separate the
animation happens on a separate I'm okay
and enforce this event to refresh the UI
yeah so I think we can actually click it
multiple times you also see what happens
if we spam it oh okay
the bull is spinning maybe we should
write something better so you can see
here even though it's after play it'll
still have in the media because this
fire is often a separate thread so what
is the what is the sound of the boat
like me and cut out of those okay got
blue moon what is he mmm okay I've seen
builder the position was horrible so
let's put on here okay okay let's try
that
actually that's that's a good point we
have to read to make the count
acknowledge to woo so all right last one
clay now it's quite a couple times and
it stops the previous animation looks
like yeah Pass here's time so you notice
this does by angle so it depends on what
angle it starts out is worth the angular
as it was talking the previous imitation
seems like a RT at the angle that we
stop and yeah I Tricia so you just go to
something new I did I didn't know that
it's a behavior all right let's get this
guy working on the Raspberry Pi where's
Mike let's see the logo jump around the
entire page he wants to see it bounced
around alright so you can you can help
us out packet and send us a snippet all
right we're gonna playing the pie will
make it fills relevant all right so I'm
going to attempt to show the Raspberry
Pi we have running here so first a
little bit about the raspberry pi let me
let me point the camera at it and
explain to people with the hardware is
too
okay savio the raspberry pi is a very
inexpensive embedded board it costs
about $35 us euros to I think it's about
35 years and it runs full Java on arm so
it runs the Java arm edition all right
let's get a closer look at home so you
can see here in the center there is the
processor it has a arm this arm six
processor it has a system-on-a-chip as
well that's the smaller guy up there and
then outputs for hdmi so you can drive
monitors you can drive up to a 1920 x
1080 resolution under an SD card for the
memory and then audio outputs and USB
inputs and then finally is powered via
USB so it's really easy to power it you
don't need a special power adapter you
can just plug it up to a normal phone
charger so pretty cool hardware and it
runs java you know about this the other
Raspberry Pi this is a model here but
there's a seat on the yeah well that's
not
yeah so this one that we have here is a
B model but it's the older via model
which has the older d model has 256 but
if you order a B model now you get 5 12
and i think that like that the a B model
it's like a reference to like some old
some old British car which there's an
old old British car which used to have a
and B models and they were topping that
so it's like using 256 megabytes of RAM
runs linux and Gemma in the implication
that you're putting on Donna f-holes the
connector for you is there a connector
for the Arduino platform when I'm right
oh I know maybe yes the this connector
is for arduino McAuliffe under know
anyone here this one is for Allah isn't
a thera-band yes so you can you can mix
um mich Raspberry Pi and are doing oh
yeah yeah I want to do better yeah
trying to replace the rack of silver
Ciera quenching in the West
whatever the rock of ours is emergence
of Isis I'm just buying just my
then you server a new big server with a
lot of lights but now i can change idea
and bite it alright so on let me let me
see if i can actually get this off on
screen using VLC as you can see if
you'll see is a little flaky alright so
I've I have a hack to get this working
but it's not very pretty this version of
VLC doesn't actually pick up my capture
card correctly but we can tell it so
we're gonna tell to use this 1920 x 1080
but then we're going to this is the
wrong string here so we're going to
force it to use this string by clicking
right there that's magic
okay and let's reboot the pie because
it's not coming up immediately alright
so there we can see tha oh maybe maybe
we can see it but they can't see it okay
now we can all see it alright so here's
the Raspberry Pi Buddha we got a
keyboard and a mouse oh we need one more
thing we need a need a USB stick to copy
over our program because i don't have
news now where you yeah i'll give it a
cooking
okay so we're going to do is we're going
to take exactly the same jar file we
just ran a desktop copy of two USB key
love the USB key we do with silver fina
s SH er I mean I'm SC fears or network
coffee and says well if we had it
networks and then we're going to run it
try running it with the javafx version
for the pie and see if it works so you
have a standard Linux looking for the
raspberry pi and then you just run
medline yeah so it's running debian
linux on it which is really easy ok I
got that and we still have her
just arena head you know
John Trina and we're going to take the
jar copy it here
ok
Sprave that to the pie okay so we only
have two USB ports I don't have a hub
here so we're going to disconnect the
mouse
oops Frankie boy
all right now we're logged in let's
mount our USB Drive so now USB is right
on this ticket okay so there's the USB
Drive Jesse Java Trina
okay so we can copy that jar file here
now i'm going to edit the watcher
scripts actually let's copy it first
watch her to launch launch jug bring up
ok
we're using VI and we're going to change
the jar file so this is just loading a
certain version of Java the jug torino
jar file is adding in the javafx library
jf x RT
Oh
Oh
oh there we go the shift key got the
cheese the main classes one I know but
it's not working right now keywords
we've got a unhappy pie
overheating anything it's not too hot
all right let's do this reboot thanks
for the key we're done with that hold on
back
bahria let's see if there's any
questions on the stream water cans so
apart from the coolness thing factor of
raspberry pi do you have any example of
actual interesting usage or something
you didn't think of and safe wow that
runs some raspberry pi oh yeah so one
thing I can show you guys let's actually
something we're working on for dead box
next week is so we want the signs
outside the room for the conference Deb
ox's you guys know about them this is
the biggest Java conference yet yes so
they have big signs outside the door or
either of you guys been into us a long
time ago I'm not recently so they have
signs outside the door and they show
which sessions are currently up and
Jasper and did a really nice
visualization for this on the Raspberry
Pi so I don't have the actual
application with me but everyone will
get to see it next week at that box but
on this is a short video which shows it
running
and this was taken on the Raspberry Pi
hardware running at 1920 x 1080
resolution so you can see like there's a
slight shift of the backgrounds and then
you have these little robots flying back
and forth with the signs and I think for
the final version they're doing
additional performance tweaks to make it
even faster but you can do quite nice
things with like you know digital
signage using HDMI output home
automation using the device inputs maybe
Arduino hooked up to it there's lots of
cool stuff you can do the pie actually
the Raspberry Pi site has a lot of
projects there which people are done
with them I read involved in additional
projects the classroom finals on the
contrary by and low-cost Raspberry Pi
connected to a medium sized computer to
do we're already beyond VNC to allow
meter students to work on computer yeah
yeah there's lots of cool stuff you can
get them all right let's say what
happens to our scripts
okay swap file yeah you were anything
the prettiest version all right I just
headed anyway all right
okay so we got to change the program
name and we got to change the jar solo
change the jar first jug Trina the next
will change the program name oops
so if you delete against the line Dola
Dola d pretender you just type donor you
go at the end of the line but if you
take DJ then dollar dollar oh god here
have been expert a bi expert alright and
let's check what our class path was for
this project DM mean class okay so Jeb
torino dot okay judge arena that's
pretty easy
sure oh okay all capital
All Right see if we can make it work
okay so it's using the egl library so it
uses 3d acceleration on device we're not
running in X windows so it's just going
to kind of open up full screen take the
whole screen Oh welcome to chuck tree
house
okay I was hoping this mouse for work
you can try other way with us working
it's working that's just phone oh you
know what it is it's the optical on the
yeah yeah there we go come on spin the
bowl yeah flu all right so just like on
desktop nah so this is actually saying
yeah it was first time yeah hdmi to hdmi
to this little box which then goes into
Thunderbolt yeah so this is nice like if
I'm presenting I don't need to carry a
TV but we could we can hook it up to the
TV in other word yeah
alright so i think that was those a
google doesn't need a fan doesn't me the
fame to be cooled down now you can feel
the chip is a little warm but not but
not much not too hot and this is one of
the nice things about the arm chips if
like it was an intel chip it would be
frying no deep you could bake and
economics right nothing the armed ships
are nice
you
alright so i think we're we're back live
again alright sorry about that so are
now looks like we will delay on the
camera to our camera in the battery in
the middle and the audios hooked up to
the camera so it cut out both
simultaneously as those we're almost
done there we got through the hacking
and we showed the download before before
the camera got out so what sort of
questions did you guys have about javafx
or raspberry pi I'm pretty amazed by pi
by the small device can run Java from
Java I've got enjoy effects on zoo run
them on the wave too right yeah so you
can run it as an applet web start or you
can also do packaged applications for
desktop and the Java one website was
written using Joe effects right well
maybe one year not this year okay yeah
actually let me give you guys both
something so since you guys were brave
enough to come here and be on the live
stream so you get a limited edition
light hacking okay laptop sticker see I
know come on okay but you got eat a mac
for it i think its own if you are back
late you can attach it on you I tried
see I tried really hard to cover the
Apple but the last sign
Lux the your beard this is actually on
one of James Gosling's original Duke
renderings 3d do Frederick's so it's a
Gazette one of the one of the nicer Duke
images and Duke is open source so you
can use it in the image images user
groups well it's great alright well
let's see mike has a question gsm or gps
add-on for the pie that could work with
javafx see wants network and gps so you
could probably do something with them
like i know even for doing touch screens
they take advantage of the USB input
Mike so if you had a USB edgy gsm our
gps module that worked with USB and
linux then you could add it to the
device pretty easily if you want like a
hardware solution using the pinouts or
something that's a little bit more
integrated then probably i would check
the Raspberry Pi forums and see fela
don't know before then you load the
Linux driver and then give a java api
for gps gsm um so I know that Java ME
has some of those api's and I think
they're working in the fressy also
probably soon we'll have a lot of those
device a POS well but not quite yet so
what I have here is kind of java SE
forearm which you can download off the
website and javafx forearm currently
release
but i think they yeah it's just another
Android it's another linux distribution
so probably the drivers are affordable
right yeah well right cool well thank
you guys thank you soon thank you much
and I hope you guys watch the stream as
I'm going around and visiting so the
next stop tomorrow I'm going to be in
grenoble ok and I'm going to interview a
manual fuken art in the afternoon and
the evening we're going to do another
user group session ok that's cool and
then you're going to be owned and then
Paris Lyon Paris Brussels awesomes and
dad's work but devix of results yeah so
should be a good trip ok thanks thanks
so far yeah thank you guys so much and
thank everyone for for watching on the
stream sorry
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
