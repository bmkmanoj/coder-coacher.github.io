every year at this time I know the team
is very excited you know about the seven
because that's a place where they would
have the abilities to get the necessary
feedback as well a brainstorming
discussions on the various features that
the team is already in the process of
being developed or feature that the team
is thinking you know that you know we
should basically work on this year's is
our ten year anniversary of this event
and you know within within our
industries in getting getting an event
you know running for ten years in the
significant achievement you know the
seven studied from a little gathering
that the gem and the team put together
you know ten years ago and basically
over the next over the past ten years it
has been a tremendous place for April 12
in the description it's very discussions
as an added to ecosystem to help us you
know develop all the key features and
bug damages lend us I can tell you it's
been a tremendous discussion tremendous
feedback that were critical to I know
delivering in a Tuesday Java platform
you know the necessary capabilities that
we have in that we need so you know big
THANK YOU you know to all of you to be
here you know certainly that's a
commitment you know again you know
please provide you know all the
feedbacks on the current features on the
features that the team is planning to to
develop in your Oracle you know we are
fully committed in a certain me know we
want to keep you know this tremendous
platform in this technology vibrant in a
bus in terms of the Java language in
terms of the JVM and so certainly you
know Java is great
you know the JVM we believe is the best
one or anytime for the cloud we love all
the linkages in on top of the JVM so
please continue to drive innovations and
basically you know we are you know key
to continue to advance certainly no
better performance better you know
capabilities better functionalities you
know that's where we want to keep to
continue to do our job so 9 you know as
you know you know this year is very
special because you know we are looking
to deliver to deliver you know July 9
you know Java 9 is you know nasty in an
improvement in over the years you know
the team and many of you have
contributed to these new release you
know Java 9 is ready freedom from my
hand starting to modernize as well as
advance you know Java and the JVM
technology you know into the cloud you
know clearly in a bunch of new major
items you know modules in module is all
around you know better API
encapsulations better way for you as
liberal library developers JVM
developers language developers you know
to be able to package and protect in API
access but also module is around the
modernization of the runtime itself to
be able to provide new tools j-link
to be able for application developers to
be able to customize their runtime in to
only what the application need
tremendous improvement in term of memory
footprint security you know why do you
have to carry called out your own time
if in fact you know you'll need it and I
can tell you cava is a place where you
know we are still seeing your fair
amount of inner abilities so tremendous
improvement in terms of compactions
improving density as well as including
security of your own time we also very
pleased to introduce a new compiler into
the Java platform you know the alt
compilers trying to move into the
unifications of technique computations
as well as dynamic computations you care
about
fast data you care about concision sub
jacquard äôt you care about
performance then you get into dynamic
computations clearly you know lot of
work also we are introducing into the
static compilers without next
generations in a compiler technology
build in Java in a project graph so
certainly starting to move the platform
into a place where all the code in the
platform at some point we hope could be
written in John tremendous improvement
and finally ended the list
maybe the slipping features in 9eg Asia
I believe you know strongly that J shell
is going to significantly improve the
approachability of the Java platform in
terms of making easier for people and
developers to be able to try experiment
on the Java platform so sorry something
they're looking forward you know clearly
you know there is you know more
transparency also that you know the
Oracle team as well at the ecosystem you
know working on the pen GDP is trying to
bring into in a more transparency in
term of defining features for jab
driving those Jets through the open JDK
where every support within the ecosystem
within the open JDK community can see
the various state of where where the
switches are and something is our plan
to continue to provide less friction for
external contributors to be able to
contribute finally we have weekly build
so you know please get access to the
early access build pride at the feedback
you know we are not close we have
clearly very close from from the delayed
overall you know we are looking for
actually good is some route here so let
me knock on it but you know all the
telemetry you know on the platform in
term of capabilities function et
stabilities look very good you know
clearly you know we are six seven weeks
you know away from from the lounge still
you know we're in this place where you
know join engineers working on the
project for three years this is very
exciting time
you know this is basically where you're
getting ready to deliver to the entire
ecosystem a significant upgrade to the
Java platform you know very exciting at
the same time very stressful in some
place where we have placate it incoming
bugs but you know software you know very
good so kind of you know moving forwards
and starting to look at okay so we're
delivering nine now let's forget about
what we could do to moving forward and
certainly you know when you are in a
part of a platform that have been there
for many many years you know it's not
that there is a lack of backward
features we have you know massive amount
of features you know and basically the
challenge you know for us at the record
as well as for you guys is to figure out
what are the most important features we
should be working on and that's
something where we need your help we
need your help in terms of providing us
you know the key feedback in term of
what is very important for us to work on
so clearly you know the industry is
moving to the cloud the cloud is
introducing you know a new way in term
of you know containers to be able to
deliver services and clearly docker is
becoming the primary technology that
virtually you know every cloud providers
are building their plan of how
structures to be able to deliver
services and so we are very pleased to
you know you know months ago to announce
a significant you know collaboration
between rock wall and docker and Java
inductor to ensure that Java and the GBM
runtimes or first class it isn't in the
docker environment so what does that
mean that means that we need to ensure
complex
complete you know interactions between
the docker containers and the Java
Runtime need to ensure elasticity of
kosis control of processes will commit
the formants you know that there is no
performance degradations
is joining java
the container at the same time you know
we need to ensure optimum and scalable
manage abilities service abilities
within dr. so certainly you know we
studied to make some progress you know
in the latest releases in terms of
addressing some issues that people were
running into when they were running in a
Java in the docker environment and but
there are certainly more work for us to
do typically you know we're kind of
looking at the high level in a larger
theme you know for us when we are
looking at kind of up other set of
features that we want to work on you
know clearly you know security has to be
a number one priority
there is no Java there is no JVM in the
in the cloud if Java in the JVM is not
secure and we need to continue to make
progress in this area so we can provide
cloud cloud deployment and protect your
providers better capability that strong
strong feeling that if you use a JVM
technology any languages when you go on
top of the GBM then you get into a
secure secure runtime density and
sharing a lot of the cloud is around
consolidations where customers like to
move their own crema system into the
cloud and typically you know they want
to get the maximum patching of services
into a single system and so it's so
important that we continue to improve
the density of Java and also if you fork
a new instance of Java on the system you
don't get basically complete linear
increasing of the memory size we need to
be better in terms of the JVM technology
to be able to share between two GBM
processes if we can to connect improve
the overall density of job and the JVM
runtime continuous support and startup
you know clearly the world of micro
services is moving further forward in
the plumbing model into smaller pieces
that interact with lot of order or
smaller pieces but it's so important
that we can shut up a Java container as
fast or if possible as close to an 80
contain certainly the work that the team
has been doing around study compiler
your fingers moving in the direction and
there is more workers so that the team
is thinking you know to work in this
area you know clearly performance always
very important especially as a model in
the cloud is moving into a place where
you pay for me what you are using so if
you can run you know 500 stirs at the
end you build is going to be patched
angle so that's why you know we need to
continue to focus on your phones we use
the SCP is between great GPUs lot of
system now especially around
machine learning artificial intelligence
algorithms that are vectors in base that
you need basically need to run on GPUs
to get original performance and we need
to ensure that the Java platform the JVM
can take advantage of those capabilities
on GPUs predict abilities is kind of
part of how can we take this wonderful
wonderful memory management system that
the Java platform is providing it makes
it basically completely transform so
there is no performance first time you
know there is the GC that basically help
all our developers is not becoming an
issue for all our developers certainly
in a lot of innovations in this area and
you know certainly an area that we need
to continue to drive the platform to
reduce the performance degradations on
the unpredictability that Java is
bringing to 12 developers service
abilities serviceability a scale large
cloud providers at some point may be
managing median and minion of GBM one
time other we provide the tool to scale
I will provide the necessary
instrumentations into the platform
itself so it's easy for people to
recognize if there is a problem on this
specific area we need in some case may
need to build special capabilities in
terms of telemetry information directly
in the VM to help us he'll just let
operators to manage this content and of
course developer productivity clearly
you know we need to reduce into this
perception that Java is variables Jedi's
kind of list all the technology know we
can use Java we know a person in this
room that you know Java is a great
language but of course need to evolve
English so you know are the color
factions in that my last slide you know
clearly we need you help Java the JVM
technology mean you help and that's why
in some way you guys are here
we need you help around helping us
editing the entire Jamaica system JVM
ecosystem to move to gdk9 move your
product move your entire organizations
on gdk9 move the tool moves you know
libraries because as soon as the entire
ecosystem is on gdk9 on modules on
encapsulations
you're going to put us in a much better
place to be able to advance we know in
many cases why people cannot uptake the
version of Java is because a library and
applications is using internal replies
in nine for the first time we're going
to provide motivate of control but we
can protect if your library developers
your platform developers even has now we
have the ability to protect access to
the dental area that's very important
then we need your contributions in
openjdk and contribution is not just the
curd that you care about I understand
this is for many of us we are strangled
with associates yes
I'm running Java in the specific
environment and I provide you at
contribute to open JDK this piece of
code it's worked well in my environment
but we have to work as a community
please you know the next mile in terms
of ensuring that dispatch for this
larger patch will fit into the entire
JVM code all the Java code will fit all
the all the possible deployment of the
java technology is important if not you
know you could describe that you are
contributing is becoming a liability for
us and that's why sometime I know some
time you get frustrated at us in Tamil
well you know we have these great
contributions why you guys are not
accepting this contribution because we
are responsible for the entire ecosystem
we need Java to run across all those
writing written and all those others on
the onion and we need to work and act as
an entire ecosystem and that's why it's
important that you know when you
contribute you do the contributions to
the end of all the implementation of
those features and you know finally you
know I think it's important for us you
know to continue to evolve this
wonderful technology and platform in a
going forward as one ecosystem as one
you know communities so I appreciate you
know all of you to be here today and I
wish you know great conference and need
a sink
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
