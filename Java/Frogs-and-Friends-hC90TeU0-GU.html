frog you're getting better in my last
name every time we do this yeah well
don't count on it I'm in consistently
better so we we were we were recently in
jail together yes yes but first first
things first we are in Belgium we need
to act like belt like Flemish like
Belgium's like we should drink Belgium
bureau yeah okay so we have some
wonderful trappist fear that Tom brought
for us at the conference a real Belgium
thank you don't appreciate it yeah
cheers Cheers wow it's good whoa it's
good oman alright so this i think anakin
i think we hit the climax to the
interview so the record of it the rest
of it will just be whatever because this
was the best part yeah it was amazing we
can just drink beer for the next five
minutes of them Wow yeah no no it was
good hummus really good show it is good
yeah yeah so we were stuck on this
island together in jail jail yeah yeah
like I don't like sharing a jail cell
with you man and but there was no soap
and although we went to the shower room
but we actually were addressed so that's
okay yeah ok so we were self civilized
realized GL Sandy's so this this is a
long-running tradition for the J
froggers to do that event that's the
first year that we do this frogs and
Friends events when we take the
community leaders and put them in some
place that they won't be able to escape
so it can be on the boat or only on an
island the whole idea is you cannot
leave earlier than we decided we will
let you go that's a good practice ya
know and you you always yours you know
you put us out at really late hours of
night and sketchy parts of San Francisco
but you armed us with weapons each year
yes yes oh well that's that's part of
the deal right when you come back
and you go through the streets of San
Francisco you should you should be armed
with something if you walk one block in
the wrong direction from java on san
francisco i think your life is at risk
yeah and every year by the way these
block is getting closer and closer to
the venue by the way this is what i
notice the keys yeah so i think every
single year I've had the honor of
holding up the J frog cruiser boat or
whatever it was good yes you are
absolutely the frequent flyer of their
only two right here I held up the boat
to alcatraz yep and last year last two
years I held up your cruise boat right
right there either at the venue at the
dock so I can also go directly to the
docks of my motorcycle home and then
relate and we laid there as well yeah
well yeah yeah so we try to put you in
the car so you so will control the
timing but it never never quite works
with me yeah but it's our pleasure to
wait for you but you guys always have a
big announcement as well at each of the
the frogs and Friends cruise absolutely
yeah so you know for the benefit of our
are the folks who are watching who
weren't at the frogs and frends crew as
well what was the big announcement this
year well this year was really special
for us we introduced a new product which
is not happening every day that's the
third time in history of Jeff frog so
actually the second time in history Fred
of Jeff rock because artifactory existed
before Jeff was the company announcement
also the product yes so m-jpeg Mission
Control is the latest addition to our
product family and it is what it sounds
like its mission control for a
monitoring and management in multiple
artifact or instances and in the future
wintering accounts of course and on many
levels on operational level the ability
to provision changes in multiple servers
from a single point and on more
high-level vision providing the
technical decision makers with the
dashboard that is populated from the
knowledge of what's going on with the
software in their organization so
artifactory inventory being a systems of
record for a software development
process they have the outcomes of
this process actually can provide a very
accurate a picture about what's going on
so who's the who's the target market for
a part of factory Mission Control well
yeah so we wouldn't call it mission
control if we were target Java
developers obviously because these terms
kind of overloaded yeah in the Java
world and and most of the users will be
in again on an operational level a
system administrator a DevOps engineers
that oversight the deployment of
artifactory clusters in the organization
and a on a higher level it will be the
technical decision makers in such a CTO
VP of R&amp;amp;D and those guys yeah but this
lets them see what's going on kind of
have like a overall dashboard seat all
the deployments of their application and
the true difference of these there's
boards from others is that it's it
actually uses the factual data yeah and
not manually fitted data as as the tools
that we have we have today so the truth
is not out there truth is in there right
and and the Mission Control I should be
the tool that will visualize these
truths about the software development
process inside the organization call so
Mission Control was this year I think it
was two years ago you did ben tre yes
and last year it was the bean tree
premium Yeah Yeah right very good but I
mean you know the first announcement of
choice that's the yeah of course yeah
Ben Tre as a product it wasn't yeah that
was huge that's also taken off really
nicely there's a lot of open source get
what are some of the open-source
products which are using yeah so betray
their primary i would say that four for
four hours geeks using macs then the
biggest proud we take is in the home
brew it was it all right nice and they
serve bottles of homebrew cheers cheers
from ben tre and that's huge and people
love them apache projects we see them
starting on but starting to be on board
ben tre of course my beloved a groovy
and aerials yeah it was a big deal yeah
all those guys and a lot a lot of
different a lot of different projects
and some projects not in java space at
all like homebrew but others as well
like Ruby installer for windows of all
things right oh yeah yeah so we see we
see a tremendous growth in in usage of
bin tray in packages than being
downloaded and upload to Ben Tre and its
really app starts to pick up and the
open-source activity of course is except
of being something that we want to
donate to a to the community it's also
proof of concept of scalability of this
tool and this is where big guys big
organizations begin surprises step in
and say you know what if you can serve
the biggest open source java repository
in the world probably you can serve our
downloads as well yeah now that makes
sense and I think what kind of sets you
guys apart as a company those that you
really have a big focus on the community
you do a lot of things to you know like
you're speaking at conferences engaging
community members building open source
projects and talking about the work I do
that since we are all in the software
making business and make software for
making software developers are our
natural audience and and this is what we
do and as bruna mentioned and his
wonderful keynote every company today is
a software company which means that in
every company we have people to talk
with and that what makes whatever we do
here so so important and and I glad I'm
here yeah cool so thanks very much for
joining me for an interview and now
let's let the fun part
let's enjoy cheers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
