another episode of the groovy podcast
right because it is actually a night
hike an interview with me borrow
achieving a major achievement in my life
conducting and night hug an interview
here in the place warmed by giants like
Stephen King so that's your bucket list
right this one goes off the bucket list
you're finally accomplish this with
major there's like 80 points there you
go that's a huge strike and today with
me ken cousin my co-host for the groovy
podcast and a very charismatic speaker
in the groovy community thank you also
known as carving chem except not but
yeah you known as Cod Lincoln um
frankfurt's for no good reason man woods
knows you at corny but now do you know
why that's dangerous to call me that my
last name my first name and last name
both start with k so you throw Kotlin on
there and that's not a good combination
you see what I mean oh yes so I'm very
reluctant to jump into that say tell you
what we need to do we need rest same way
from it being give your middle name
right but we can we place right the
first name all the last name safely also
would help if I knew anything at all
about Kyle well I know I know the whole
world a call and that's about all I know
that's that's an achievement as well
talking about the truck what I was
speaking about it at javaone of course
was groovy oh yes yes I'm much happier
to do that me I like it I like that so
let's do the interview park now that
that is kind of my job description now
that i think about it get you back into
track right right ok so now i'm begging
track ok now i'll try to do the
interview part ok very good so Ken yes
analyst tell me what you talked about
the gel one this year oh well I have to
talks at javaone the first one is about
groovy and Java 8 so that we're focusing
on lambda expressions and streams and
method references and how groovy can
work with the same thing but also how
groovy goes beyond that and has a SD
transforms like memo eyes and and tail
recursive and also has all the
other features that groovy breaks to the
table that you can use even in Java so I
just did that presentation and that was
a lot of fun because I got to do a
pirate example by the way should I
mention that story again yeah so that
today is the international talk like a
part of date and I wish I made it is 12
30 yards s okay good Galligan gone right
so at any rate I needed to come up with
something pirate related and I was
really struggling and Tim Yates it was a
giant in the groovy community yeah I am
right right gave me a nice suggestion he
pointed out a website that by the way
has the URL that ends in PHP so that's a
little scary right there but it's a
website that take strings and replaces
them using a dictionary replacement with
pirate terms so it can automatically
convert a string for you so what we did
and what I put in the presentation and
the github repo is I use groovy
metaprogramming to add a pirate method
to the string class so that when i put
in a string and invoke dot pirate then
it would reply with the pirated string
so instead of saying hello world it said
avast ye world you know and and that's
groovy magic right there Ruby magic as
we all know jazz swing as a final cost
you can all right extend it and add
another method I did make a bit of a
promise to the attendees that I did
expect that to be the silliest demo of
the entire conference I don't know if
it's going to achieve it but tell you
I'll tell you where exactly i'm going to
beat you no no deaveon hear about at
pokemon annotation yes of course that
was Dan that was saying woods and in
fact I encouraged him to do that I was
the one who stood it showed him that the
try-catch got him catch them all try
catch block right and he's the one who
ran with it made it at the at pokemon
AST transform and i'm going to show it
in my a student's formation talk did you
give him credit of course oh ok its
credit because that one I don't know if
he even wants credit suicidal not giving
credit to Don boots we should give him a
nickname too oh yes let's go down or
something I don't know yeah yeah think
of a way I we got to think about well
he's Danville upper I suppose just what
developer that's good enough we should
probably talk about something related to
the any rate my second talk right is
let's convene it was that so I heard you
have a second oh but actually before I
mentioned that the other thing I did
that was fun in the in the first talk is
I also did the cat pictures
demonstration but not just generating
see that accesses flickr remember flickr
oh yeah before yahoo bought actually i
should say that remember yahoo yeah
right yeah any rate yeah i know rim shot
any rate what i did is i have a restful
web service or rather I access the
restful web service at Flickr and I
download cat pictures in JSON data in
JSON format and then parse them and use
a swing builder to build a little gooey
out of it and what I did to make a java
8 interesting is I actually did parallel
streams so that I downloaded all the cat
pictures simultaneously before building
the GUI and everybody like that yes
leverage Java streams in the groovy code
right that's actually a big deal talking
about that I have a technical question
Oh easy one um we have a closures in
groovy yes we have lambdas in Java right
they are pretty much the same pretty
much not exactly right so I remember
discussion before Java 8 actually got
released in the global community of how
we're going to support them right all
the groovy closures going to be going to
be translated in the bytecode to Java
lambdas changing the semantics of what
the groovy closure is or we will have
them separately and we will have two
features which are pretty much the same
so what was the decision and how it was
that out okay well first of all I didn't
do it so I'm not the expert here but I
can tell you what I've heard okay now
anytime you're in Java 8 and you want to
use or rather anytime you're in groovy
and you want to invoke Java 8
functionality and you have a functional
interface and everything and they expect
a lambda you can provide a closure so
that always works now of course in
groovy closures you don't have to have
local variables mark final or
effectively final you can actually
modify them which is not a good thing
right that's a side effect but it's just
a constant
when said the decision yes I also
understand that the last time I talked
to the powers that be people like yeoman
and everybody gilma Forge that in the
next version of groovy or possibly the
one after that they are going to support
the lambda syntax and the method
reference it texts I don't currently
currently use groovy closures wherever
they expect lambdas are method
references but they will eventually
support both and I think that's a good
thing because otherwise you would have
the conflict you're just describing that
the closures aren't really lambdas now
of course the lambdas in Java 8 are
closures because they do involve the
execution environment as well but that's
the sort of semantic battle I'd really
try to stay away from yeah actually yeah
so I don't know if that directly answers
your question but as a normal conference
speaker what i did is i just took in a
different direction that i could answer
it went that way we are all consultants
we know how to answer questions we have
no I you know what the definition of a
consultant is by the way I can someone
be that far as your watch tells you what
time it is pockets the watch and then
sends you a bill for it exactly met a
good one yo and I heard a pearl joke
recently yeah I'm pleased going downhill
but then yet then out then I'll stop but
a million monkeys typing in a million
typewriters will eventually type a Java
program right and the rest will be pearl
programs ah a rate wednesday i'm doing a
talk on Spock so I guarantee that that
will have more trademark and copyright
violations than any other talk at this
comment yeah but it has to write because
I at one point I considered doing a
Spock talk where I made no Star Trek
references whatsoever and if somebody
said something I just stare at them
blankly and I couldn't do it so instead
I embrace the madness exact it's called
you know I have been and always shall be
your friendly testing framework you know
and test well and prosper and all the
all the idiotic things in between I have
I have a question on Spock okay the
rumor has it yes that the development of
spoke is kind of stale no actually a
Peter another reader be so yes is being
extremely busy any company we cannot
name
what i heard is there not enough going
on there their pile of pull requests
that are not been accepted in this kind
of stuff a tell me that I'm wrong the
last I heard they are actually building
up to a 1 dot 1 release I mean one point
O has been stable now for several years
which is good because it took us forever
to get to one point oh but it seemed
that one point one was in a release
candidate but I haven't heard anything
in a few months I think we'd probably
have to talk to I don't think Luke
dailies handling that anymore who's
handling that now that's my question oh
okay exactly i think we're going to have
to find out but it is at least stable
and active and of course it's the
built-in testing framework inside of
Grails among other places and there are
other frameworks that are compatible
with it like jab and stuff so i don't
see it as something that's going to stop
i just i don't think anybody is being
deliberately funded to work on the
framework and therefore the pace of
change is slowed so but i also don't
know that the outstanding issues are
anything that are killers it's just in
various improvements that people would
like to see so it really relies on
people freeing up some time to put those
things together I guess supports to some
of the newest frameworks like support
for spring boot and others well-being
are being on the table for a long time
and not being picked up well Spock
already works with spring and has for a
long time you could add in the spot
spring jar and therefore use the spring
test context with the dependency
injection of the fixture and everything
in a Spock test that all works fine i
have a demo of that I don't expect
spring boot to change that in any way
however what we will spur some
innovation I think is the fact that j
unit five is on the verge of coming out
you know they've got some release
candidates coming and they've adopted a
lot of Spock related stuff of course so
I imagine that'll get the spark people
going well you know we're gonna have to
reestablish our lead we've got to keep
moving here that reminds me Cortland
grew you know I hear you're just not
going to let it go or I'm sitting as you
can and and every time thinking about
you I see this little kettle that used
to be the log off coughing back well it
will be interesting to see you talk to
the Gradle people and find out how their
progress is coming with
script or whatever and whether they
really are going to be building plugins
using outlet and we will actually have a
great opportunity to do that as we are
going to record the new episode of our
group or every podcast tomorrow and we
expect to have a solution call from a
gradual development team on the show as
well as gamma Forge of course the
project lead off Carew as well then I
hope we'll be able to find some other
groovy guys well Ben mush goes around
and he wrote the Gradle inaction both
keywords for Gradle so he might be a
good guy so we can call we definitely
can call Ben and I think about a couple
of other names generally dear audience
if you still do not watch or listen to
the groovy podcast episode tomorrow will
be a great one to start well it's
available on iTunes and elsewhere where
anywhere with an RSS feed and if you go
to no fluff just calm / groovy podcast
you'll see a page with all of the
YouTube videos and audio links available
and you can work with that directly or
do your subscription through your normal
podcast consumption channel whatever
that might be are you going to mention
your triumphant win in the Gradle the
bowl that you had earlier today cheers
and then yeah but I think um is going to
kill us because we're going like three
folded time the normal interview things
she doesn't know is that she that we do
this but yeah okay you're right you're
right so our normal podcast not the ours
ours goes like 30 minutes right we have
the Russian ID podcasters record with
bunch of guys normal length of the
opposite in two and a half hours so I'm
not even getting started yet it's
alcohol involved just curious Russian
podcast talking about Java and stuff I
know it just seemed like a natural you
know but no I understand no I get it we
can wrap this up and I I do want to
thank you very much for giving me the
opportunity to be on the night hacking
podcast it's that's one of the things on
my bucket list you know that's my dream
fulfilled now here we get very happy to
do that gout that as well and I'm
looking forward to seeing this
distributed in all the normal channels
we will get them and we will actually
convert it to an abnormal episode of the
groovy podcast I think right there we
will do that how much self Markley do
you want to do look it's theirs it's not
ours you know okay let's stop yeah let's
be nice I mean they're doing us a favor
and letting us do this oh yes oh yeah
but now we heard josh is already got
anything you want to say to finish this
one does his Salander drags me out of
this page go ahead thank you very much
for the opportunity we will see you
again at the conference thank you a can
you have replicated coughlin a
brilliantly today thank you and now the
recording we stopped but we are still
broadcasting so now loving bed what show
