late in the day and the party's tonight
I really appreciate you guys coming in
rich and I certainly appreciate it we've
got a Raspberry Pi up here if you want
to take a look at it and then an
application that visualizes actually
supposed to visualize the data off the
Raspberry Pi but we're not getting a
signal through this giant Faraday cage
that is the building anyways this is
visualizing air traffic data with the
FAA satellite based surveillance system
and Raspberry Pi so the goal today here
is just a very short spiel about what we
do we're going to talk about innovation
and disruption and how IOT is growing
very fast and then we're going to go
into a very specific use case around the
Raspberry Pi for air traffic control
data but there are many other use cases
this is just a great inexpensive end
point and this solution could be used
over and over again for many different
types of use cases we'll go through all
the components that I assembled this is
a little bit more refined there's a nice
case that comes with this one but you'll
see originally I had a pizza box and and
then rich will talk about the will do
with the demo and rich will talk about
the future of IOT and disruption and
innovation briefly so we're giving away
a book Kindle version of this book this
is the Oracle cloud book that we've
recently updated with over 100 pages if
you want it be entered into the drawing
just email hello at viscosity na komm
and we'll get you entered into the
drawing I'll give you a secret if you
send us an email we'll send you a free
copy of the book you can download it on
Amazon and it's always being updated
Oracle changes their cloud screens every
every couple of weeks so we're keeping
it updated if you want to get in this
drawing yep
and you put in a card in the bag the
Jeff ticks around then we'll put in the
drawing and if you're here when we pull
your name then you win good hot cool
not everybody has a card if you write
your name email on it sure you could
take a card and write your email on it
if you want do you want to get the
drawing
oh that's Hello at viscosity North
America na komm yeah I'll have another
slide at the end we'll just send you a
code for a Kindle book and then that'll
just keep it updated use their reader so
a little bit about me I'm from Austin
Texas I'm an engineer and developer
those are my twitter handles I got
involved with apex quite a few years ago
I really liked it as a low code platform
before we really had a word for that I'm
co-author of that Oracle cloud solution
guys that were given away and I'm a
co-founder with rich anaemic of
viscosity in North America I'm also a
private pilot which is why this subject
is very interesting to me and I have a
passion for the red grape my wife and I
have a very small vineyard in Argentina
where we run Oracle and pick grapes and
make some wine and so viscosity this
year we we will have by the end of the
year have given more than 100
presentations around the country and
worldwide we give presentations through
Latin America Australia New Zealand
Europe rich has been to China India UK
so just and and we're only about 50
people in our company so it's just it's
one of the things we really care about
and it's
it's something that we do to try to give
back so at the core of viscosity is a
very robust data visualization
predictive prescriptive analytics
application development practice you can
engage us for assessments proof of
concepts training full-blown projects
and manage services and we do pretty
much the entire read stack and quite a
bit of things outside of Oracle as well
just a sampling of some of our clients
we believe in innovation and innovation
we think is necessary for businesses to
survive especially now and we've also
written over a dozen books on data the
cloud and Oracle including rich has a
book the Oracle 12c performance tuning
it's the best-selling book and Oracle
press turn it over to rich and he's
going to talk he's gonna level set us
with IOT so why do you need to innovate
Peter Drucker said it best the
enterprise that that does not innovate
ages and declines and in a period of
rapid change such as the present that
decline will be fast so I always like to
say take Lou Holtz Lou Holtz always says
you want to win later remember win
what's important now I think what's
important now is start to learn those
pieces of what you can build you're
gonna see one half you can build but you
can build anything your mind can think
of and that's the key to this how many
people are familiar with this Gartner
hype cycle this is like coming up this
side here it's like these are things
coming on these are things you're so
sick they're talking about them forever
you want them to shut up about them
they're overhyped and it kind of goes
down I don't know if that's ever going
to take off that BAM it takes off and
people are actually using it and how
many years it takes to go through this
hype cycle is based on the color of the
thing so something like quantum computer
is going to take
more than 10 years so you could see in
2013 was kind of all about tech you know
big data predictive analytics the cloud
to some degree if you look at innovation
and how you're really going to make that
impact your innovation is something new
you look at companies today and Wall
Street will back a company to wipe out a
company that's been in business for 50
years why because the company that's
been in business for 50 years doesn't
innovate they stay in the past they
don't leverage technology they don't
leverage big data they don't leverage
internet of things they don't leverage
robotics and what happens is let's say
you invented the Telegraph way back when
it's picking up people start buying it
now tons of people are buying it and
then all a sudden nobody's buying it why
because maybe the phone came out some
new technology passes it up you always
have to be able to say what's important
now is to be able to realize what
technology is gone it's the Telegraph
and what's the new technology the
telephone no matter how much money you
put in these old companies will put in
all kinds of investment in the old
product and it doesn't lead lead to very
little we saw a postal mail also there's
a lot of email doesn't mean there isn't
postal mail it's still there there's
probably people are saying I told you a
mail wouldn't be big look at postal mail
still doing great a telegraph went to
the telephone I remember my son seeing a
dictionary he was leaving college and
somebody had thrown one out and he's
looking at it like it's an Egyptian
artifact I'm like what it what is it
he's like it's a dictionary an actual
one he's like who would ever use one and
I'm like well it's not used so I guess
nobody now it's going faster email I'm
going to snapchat Instagram people send
you a picture you know you don't know
what it is they don't care right can you
keep up USB is not in the cloud I
remember my daughter saying what are you
carrying a USB for and I'm like why so I
can move the file from here to here
she's like why now why would you ever do
that that's idiotic
and I'm like well that's Microsoft
PowerPoint and you got to move to
another computer that has PowerPoint
they have paid for it on that computer
too
you're gonna carry it somewhere else
you're gonna carry it everywhere how
stupid is that I thought you were smart
but it's starting to move to where if
it's gonna go to implants robotics first
it's being implanted in a robot but
pretty soon it'll be implanted in you
you know the computer was on your desk
then it was in your pocket and it's on
your wrist next thing is gonna go on
your wrist it's coming Google why are
they so successful because they're big
on innovation ideas come from everywhere
they realize it's not just the top guy
who has the best ideas focus on data not
politics
sorry innovation not instant perfection
creativity loves restraint I don't know
about that one IOT coming fast you're
looking at it right here it's right on
the desk you could build anything
Jerry's gonna show you how I ot inside a
manufacturing plan machines just talking
to machines they don't need to talk to a
person you see it in all kinds of
devices in the consumer area whether
it's wearables video audio in your home
this one the baby one that baby moves
the bottle starts to warm up so when the
baby cries the bottles already warm this
one is like a refrigerator tied to your
bathroom scale so it's like you know
we're not going to unlock the
refrigerator until you buy more of this
stuff there's a tight button IOT right
on your washing machine you press it you
get tied you got a four-year-old you're
getting it a lot of tide and they know
that so they give you a Doritos button
now press the Doritos button that's a
little better
no we'll just give you a LexA and the
little kid can say Alexa send some
Doritos how much
a truckload you know it's coming
tracking animals with IOT they're
tracking you with IOT there's a little
sensor in your shopping cart you know
here rich went around he bought some
milk circled the Oreo cookies multiple
times didn't buy any why because Tec was
you know distracted so think about
disruptive type of innovation how you
disrupt your own company with innovation
it passes something else go after the
low-level people first doesn't use a lot
of what you have then start going after
the higher ones but leverage big data
IOT robotics let's see one way how to do
it with Gerry thanks rich
so I just want to play this is a video
that went viral on YouTube and it has a
really well done visualization just to
give you an idea of what air traffic
looks like is there any sound it should
be yeah
so early morning we have this whole
train of airplanes coming from the US
right over to London
and it start to gets busier you can see
them be routed into holding patterns
that sort of thing
look at these guys those are military
planes right
so the way they track this is all this
data is collected sent out by the
aircraft I'm sorry these are the
military planes yeah
sent out by these aircraft and they
visualize it in three-dimensional space
these are a lot of helicopters going out
to the offshore drilling platforms out
of in the in the North Atlantic
so anyway so how does this work so we
use two systems we use what's called the
ATSB
air traffic control system and this is a
ship-to-ship communication that's
installed in aircraft and it's actually
mandated to take effect in even the
smallest aircraft within the next year
and they've also released the same
technology in two satellites so there
was some dead spots over the Atlantic
but basically ground station ground
radar contract planes that used to be
the only way to track planes and now the
planes since they have very accurate GPS
and radios and they can transmit their
locations to other planes and to ground
stations ground stations can also track
aircraft that don't have any signals and
then relay that through the system and
we're listening to that signal here with
the Raspberry Pi unfortunately I can't
get a signal through this room but we
did pre record some data that will show
you so how do you assemble this yourself
it's it's it's not expensive right I
mean the Raspberry Pi is a $30 computer
we bought two radios both 1090 megahertz
and 978 megahertz an 8 gig micro SD
memory card battery and some
miscellaneous cables and you can put
this whole solution together at the time
I did this a few years ago that you had
to do this yourself with
software-defined radios and that sort of
thing but now you can buy the completed
kits for less than $100 and one of the
easiest ways to get going is to simply
download the image from Stratos has been
packaged up and they have you know
single band for a $94 dual band and then
they can just send you all the parts you
even get a nice case and then go
download the software the current
version off of github and this guy named
Chris Young gave it to us so thanks for
him and then
it capitalizes on a piece of software
called dump 1090 that was written by
this guy sent salvador Sanfilippo kind
of an interesting guy but basically he
takes the radio signals which are
digital and streams that data out into a
file that can be visualized or what
we'll do is actually capture the output
of 1090 and push it up to a Oracle IOT
node and one of the tools that we use is
called net cat it's been around forever
the tcp/ip Swiss Army knife you can use
net cat just about on any kind of
program so if you've got a computer that
is transmitting some kind of data run
net cat on it you can see what's going
across the wire you can take that data
and throw it up to an IOT device and
very easily you know
now that's becomes another IOT device
even if the device wasn't written for it
dumped 1090 clearly wasn't written for
IOT was written to do one thing and
that's to transmit your location to tell
you about where you are in the airplane
but but we're gonna use it to actually
capture data and stream it so another
tool we use is IOT cloud service this
comes in many different flavors it's
almost a software-as-a-service product
so if you look at their fleet management
and some of their other application
layers that they built on top of IOT
we're using kind of a basic layer which
is the Oracle event hub which is
basically based on it's a Kafka it's a
managed Kafka service and I think we
talked a little bit about the components
so to put this thing together we'll just
I used a Raspberry Pi 3 that's that's
one of the newer versions
they've even got some smaller ones but
we put the heatsinks on on this thing go
ahead and install the antennas you want
to make sure that you match the antenna
for the radio because
you know that's that's gonna be you want
to get the best signal you can get I've
gotten on this one up to 70 miles away
so at this time I I had put a little
piece of paper to separate the two
pieces but the thing thing lights up it
comes to life it's kind of it's kind of
cool you know you don't you don't see
that a lot and just pure software so I
needed a case so I took this pizza box
and a battery and just taped everything
down and then ran the cables outside
okay kind of see how we did it there and
then I took it flying and it worked so
that was the first iteration a few years
ago so what do we do next that that
application was reporting data locally I
was visualizing on this this application
here called for flight you're welcome to
come take a look at it so told me where
I was and what other planes were around
me so that was great but now I want to
get the data off of this thing and
stream it to the IOT cloud so what I'm
gonna do is find the process and the
port that dump 10 90s running on and
then run netcat in this case there's a
derivative called Kafka cat that will
take the output of that port and push it
to the Oracle event hub if you don't
want to use Oracle event hub you can use
Kafka or a really nice derivative of
Kafka called confluent which gives you
some database features and allows you to
store you know virtually infinite data
so you can come back later and get to it
it also gives you a REST API to query
that data and apply some schema to it
because otherwise it'd be pretty much
schema-less
basically what we do is Kafka cat
becomes the producer of data it produces
data on what we call a topic and then
that goes into confluence or the Oracle
event hub
and to get it into the Oracle database
we're using Oracle database as a service
which is another Oracle cloud product
and it allows you to store both schema
tables as in the traditional sense of a
relational database but we can also
store Jason or schema-less documents and
we use an adapter called coffin connect
and we push data to this database
through JDBC and then on top of all this
we built an application that basically
is html5 and JavaScript and we use the
Java Script Google Maps API to visualize
the aircraft locations here's kind of
what if you do netcat on the data this
is kind of what the raw data looks like
they come streaming out I've gotten up
to 300 rows a second from this thing so
it can stream quite a bit of data with
very my new aircraft positions or you
can kind of chunk it down so it doesn't
stream as much but that's kind of the
nature of things as as we switch from
kind of a batch program to a streaming
program we're going to be ingesting all
of these streams and later we will apply
some schema types to them so here here's
an image of kind of what the record
types look like what those fields mean
you know we have aircraft idea IDs hex
hexadecimal identifier altitude latitude
longitude you know any specific alerts
or emergencies and then there's even one
that basically tells you if the
aircrafts on the ground by this is just
another vision of what you can do with
Kafka you've got these producers you can
stream data to multiple nodes on
multiple availability zones and you can
consume it when you want to so the first
one is we go into the demo so since
we're not getting any signal on this one
I'll just show you real quick what the
producer and the consumer look like
so there's some data that I streamed let
me go let me zoom in here sorry guys
hmm
okay this a little bit better
I need my mouse back anything
oops they didn't like that sorry
now I wish I hadn't done that I still
have it
a spinning beach ball of death here
looks like it's coming up
this is play music these are actual
good God okay I'm going to I can see my
screen here so let me just gather these
windows and sorry about that
okay let's on
all right so let me I'll just zoom in
okay so here we go
actually don't play a song Jeff don't do
that the song that he has on there is
down down down down down okay well sorry
few minutes yeah I don't want to mess
with it anymore but I'll zoom in here in
a second okay
well anyways I had done this previously
so here's what that data stream looks
like so these messages come from Kafka
and then what we can do the raspberry pi
will actually push those messages on
there and so this is what that looks
like so we've got you know producer and
let me see if I can go in here
so ad SB is also a mesh network but only
if you've got there's two versions of it
there's a dsb in and then there's a dsb
out only really modern aircraft are
equipped with a DSP out but in one year
they'll all be mandated to do that so
they do relate ship to ship information
from the ground station and the ground
station is responsible for picking up
weather as well and the weather the
digital weather information is broadcast
over something called T's B and that is
also relayed from ship to ship yeah you
can see better and at the end I'll show
you a kind of a a crowd-sourced solution
where you can collaborate with other
people that do Raspberry Pi as well so
anyways we got producers and consumers
that's what I was trying to show you
about that I apologize let's just stick
to the slides and then the demo so and
slide show
and so basically we use this Kafka Avro
console producer and consumer commands
and this is kind of what the database
looks like and what a message sample
looks like coming out of the Raspberry
Pi above a wet oh I got you
well those are so those are in feet and
that is universal in aviation and the
speed is given in nautical miles and
nautical miles are based on the
circumference of the earth so yep that's
a good question the u.s. introduced a
normal system and then you introduced
they don't call it a quarter pounder
with cheese over there all right so
we're moving so iot-cloud again this
allows you to do this in a graphical way
versus the way I try to show you you can
explore the streams and give the demo so
I'll just want to show you the
application that we've built and so you
can see this is written in Oracle apex
has anybody used Oracle apex yep
all right so Oracle a for that simple
these extremely simple to use yes so low
code development platform
and I want to run fly tracker
okay let me login
all right so I login I want to watch all
of these okay and so this is just the
last data set I've got the refresh said
- hi
so that's you if you were up in the air
this afternoon
it's basically that's I'm sorry this
thing's trying to but basically that's
it my planes okay there we go okay so as
I've showing you the track and the
orientation and it's moving the aircraft
so this is some data that we recorded
earlier a little chunky the data because
I had trouble seeing through some of the
buildings but that's kind of the idea
and that network is extremely slow
that's basically the demo and if you
want to see kind of the code it's really
simple there's one page to this
application or there's two pages a login
page and then this page sorry the
network's a little slow here and if I go
to the map region blows up and make this
bigger so basically you just set up the
initialize the map all right
create map and this is a neat function
here this is plot all flight paths and
this is user defined JavaScript function
and this plots a single flight path and
that's for if we only want to plot a
single plane and then this one plots all
the flight paths and this is just a
straight out of the textbook Google Maps
API okay
let me do this
let me turn it back over where we're
going next turn it back over to oh yeah
any useful use cases so I did look on
the internet and I found there's a lot
of people that have put their toaster
in IOT they've both done it as makers
and they actually have productized this
solution but I was looking for some
real-world use cases of course the
obvious one is air traffic control it's
already in used collision avoidance for
example but you know you might use it to
survey a competitor maybe a Gordon Gekko
is flying to you know Erie Pennsylvania
to buy anacott steel and you want to you
want to know where he's going
that would be a really easy thing to do
you can crowdsource a worldwide tracking
system if you get a bunch of these and
get people to participate and that's
actually been done so I'll show you how
to tie into that later curiosity maybe
you live near an airport and you always
wondered where that planes going maybe
the you know the Airbus a380 a huge
thing right it's just flying over I was
like hey were they going fleet tracking
so we're where is my fleet and I
actually had an interesting use case
from a cargo company they wanted to know
when the plane was on the ground because
for some reason they didn't you know it
wasn't their planes it was different
planes and they were always scheduled
differently so they want to know when
that plane hit was touched down so they
could mobilize and they had no way to do
that reliably this would be $100 way to
do that event correlation the tax man
here in California you know you guys
have a lot of taxes so you know use tax
you have a very expensive airplane ten
million dollars you might want to know
where when that airplane is is using
your your county and asset valuation so
used airplanes have different values
based on usage if planes just sitting
there rusting it's gonna really affect
its value okay so crowdsource aircraft
tracking so flight aware is I don't know
if you've used it it tells you gain in
four
but also where planes are it uses
exactly this technology as part of its
system and if you connect the Raspberry
Pi if you build one of these in
connected you actually get their
enterprise $90 a month solution for free
so now you can have an API that you can
interrogate that's worldwide to your
point earlier and that's for free so you
can write API calls and build
applications on top of FlightAware just
because you've connected a single
Raspberry Pi to their network let me
turn it around to rich he's going to
talk about where to take this in the
future I don't know where you guys will
take it in the future to tell you the
truth
but it's I mean it's up to you how many
people ever watched Twilight Zone
you watch it today I'm telling you half
of the Twilight zones there already
happened or you can see them in
development so right now is the time but
why and this is the reason why why
because when you look at something like
8-bit that's 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 8
times its 256 you know back then when I
was playing video games you know get to
scream 255 on pac-man what happens
screen splits buffer overflow it's too
high so we got the 16-bit and what
happened we got Windows because people
could put more code that was addressable
or memory this is the amount of memory
that's addressable for each of those
32-bit 4 gig now if you happen to put a
sign like use one of those 32 bits for a
plus or a minus instead of 4 gig you
only a 2 gig just to let you know which
some people do but 4 gig what did we get
when it when when a hit kind of
mainstream 32 bit got the Internet I put
it in miles per hour
windows was one mile an hour the
internet was 65,000 miles an hour
looking at it bit by bit 64 bit the jump
were making now were you starting to see
more robotics you're starting to see
stuff like IOT
you're gonna invent some I'm sure give
me a Jerry a few shares don't forget
about us 300 trillion miles an hour
you're gonna see a robotics I mean it's
gonna be substantially different and
then after that 64-bit - 128-bit five
trillion trillion billion miles per hour
it's gonna see implants and mass I mean
let's look at those numbers again it's
just the way it jumps you know god I'll
be obviously wanted things just start
going fast right now so you've hit the
right place at the right point in time
you're literally in the right place
start leveraging this technology 2015
wasn't all about tech anymore all the
sudden was all about robotics human
augmentation you know building your home
to be connected
that's what became big you know you go
to Honda a robot takes you to your
meeting pour you a cup of coffee along
the way they don't have this yet but I
figured in the future you know you go to
a company they're probably gonna have
this da Vinci Surgical System I don't
know what it was ten twenty million
dollars only they're gonna be like you
know on the way to the meeting you want
to get that appendix out you know you're
showing some sense or some pain there
we'll just pull that out on the way
we'll just carry your deer meeting how
about that available now all of these
things they're already there so what's
the hype cycle in 27th 2016 2017 won't
come until 2018 but it's all about
implants you know human augmentation
taking prosthetics and starting to
augment them so they could put them
inside you taking computers at
nanotechnology putting it inside your
bloodstream so you can wirelessly
communicate with stuff Larry Ellison
invested in a company where you take the
pill and it can tell you what you ate
tell you exactly what's in your stomach
it's there today
you know it's instead of Instagram it's
going to be just implant you know the
picture is gonna pop into your head I
guess this device down here at the
bottom this is one Israeli company
it's in your bloodstream you know you
spin that little dial based on your
blood flowing and it will power devices
you know so if we're in the middle of
the desert you know you can use that or
you can use it here
I think I'll plug it in myself they're
already implanting into the brain it's
already happening now here's a mouse
they put some implants in and it runs a
more complex maze works today
here's a lady uses a robotic arm to get
a drink it's there today because of
128-bit and 256-bit which is about 1/2
of Google if you know what at Google is
goog ol1 with a hundred zeros on it with
256 bit you're gonna get about 1/2 of
Google but they say that you'll 2045 you
know it'll be that point where you will
transcend biology you know if you cut
off your arm is it still you if I get a
prosthetic is it still me what do you
think who says yes who says no ok what
if I get a new heart people would get a
heart transplant in the beginning people
were not sure it was gonna be them when
they woke up what if they could 3d print
with my own cells a kidney they've
already done it with them with mice is
it still me people are working on
whether they can print your face when
you were 30 years old and burn off skin
and print on a 30 year old don't laugh
it's happening right now they're working
on it so what happens when you can go
into my brain and print everything
that's in there and I print a clone and
he knows everything in me obviously we
split at that point into two different
thing is it still me anymore who says
it's told me now anyone because that's
what's gonna happen when you hit 2045
you're saying it will absolutely be
possible we'll start to hit this where
you're transcending biology they call it
this singularity if you've ever read
very Kurzweil stuff it's the guy who
invented the reader for blind people
it's one of his inventions
but it's that moment in technology where
things go so fast that there's a rupture
in literally human beings they can't
handle it anymore and they say that
point is gonna happen in 2045 there's
not many things that go on time that
they say this is coming in the future
that I haven't seen in my lifetime
downside is security anyone see goes to
the show this used to be a cartoon
anyone see the Japanese cartoon ghost in
the show came out in the 80s it's very
good just to let you know but it's about
hackers that will hack into your mind
you know and how to prevent that you
know right now we're just hacking into
Equifax well as you build implants
somebody's gonna figure out how to do
that I like this one I tweeted this a
little while ago but it's like you know
hackers 30 bucks in Bitcoin or the next
time I smell smoke I just might let you
sleep sorry you know this is the
internet of ransomware of things your
Roomba is like you know why were my
hacker some money or I'm gonna blow dirt
all over this place how long will it be
till that happens until they lock your
refrigerators a little lock you out of
your car starting to happen how do you
be competitive in the future and the
answer is any great technology you're
not gonna beat robots in AI and the
answer is you're going to be the guy
implanting things to compete with that
robot
Cyberdyne systems oh that's an
interesting name built a Hal suit that
makes you much stronger if you can't
walk you're able to walk you've seen
obviously Apple watch virtual reality
but the goal is going to be to start
implanting things in you so that you can
compete with those robotics final
thoughts anyone remembers Star Trek
didn't it look futuristic way back one I
mean look at that phone they're using
what if you put out a phone today that
look like this people would laugh you
out
the business what is that ancient thing
where'd you get that ancient Egypt
things are accelerating tremendously
ghost in the shell' people who those
used things of the world its passing
away ghost in the shell' is about even
networking different minds together you
know you're you're kind of networked in
this room right now but they're gonna
physically do it in the future some
people think you know that's impossible
I always say nothing's impossible when I
came here twenty years ago I had to go
to a company event it was raining I
thought it's impossible to get a cab
this is before the days of uber and all
that and right then a cab went by and I
was like taxi and it just kept going
I like taxi I can't believe it
one went by and he won't stop there was
a red light so I ran up there and I
looked in the window I'm like taxi
and he's like all right he goes where
are you going and I told him he goes
alright I'll take you I was like sorry
to put him out I mean he maybe was
off-duty I don't know so then he takes
me there and I'm like how much is it and
he's like noticed there's no meter and
I'm like wow there's no meter why is
that
and he goes cuz I'm a pizza delivery guy
and it looked like a cab because they
had like the thing on it and I said well
why did you take me he said you were
just so insistent and so how you gonna
create the future you you have to
believe you can do those impossible
things
now we go for Jerry well that's it I
hope we covered kind of what you were
looking for again let me close with this
quote things may come to those who wait
but only things left by those who hustle
Abraham Lincoln again hello at viscosity
na komm if you want the book Julio much
she coddled
the first warning you get your first
pick one of those three
Peter Erikson air traffic control
systems I'll see if he's here he's got
to be here that's him
Richard go this one this one's already
got a song on it it includes a chip take
whatever you want it's all yours
