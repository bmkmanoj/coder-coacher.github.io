Paulo at TDC my name is your aqua he and
I work for Oracle for the Oracle
technology Network my guest today is
Ricardo Ricardo hi so Ricardo you so
what do you do for a living well working
as senior software engineer at redhead
I'm working for developing and
integrating meteor solutions for our
cloud portfolio okay and so and you
wanted to talk to us today about tamest
at open JDK - yes for the community you
have something like Mission Control or
any other
tm2 for monitoring single or multiple
idioms so no matter if it's local its
remote or if it's on running on cloud
thermostat is the open source project
we're working on to have some kind of
monitoring and control system for open
JDK okay and so you wanted to demo you
would a quick demo about the - alright
yeah but so show us we want to see it
yeah before show that I like to show the
architecture of thermostat as I as I
said thermostat is uh is that - for
monitoring single jin-heon locally or
multiple gems in multiple servers so how
can we do that using terrible stats so
this is the simple fire architecture for
thermostats as you can see there's a
back-end storage using MongoDB you can
use the single MongoDB instance or
multiple one would you be nodes in a
replica set and then
we have process running in each server
which is the thermostat agent and this
is the process that collects all the
information regarding the JVMs
and then at les you can see all these
information use the a GUI client
graphical interface a CLI or even a an
eclipse plugin okay so you can monitor a
bunch of stuff right storage your
database data flow and so first yeah so
okay this is my term you know I had
multiple terminals because I had
multiple virtual machines running it in
the left term you know with a bunch of
output is my web storage we call the
company not for thermostat that we store
all the information with one way to be
called thermostat web storage and then
the three terminals in the rights are my
three VM is running the term start
agents so basically all I have are
servers with thermostat agents
configurate you to capture all
information regarding the relative Java
process now let me show the graphical
interface for thermostats so this is the
graph counter face for thermostat as you
can see we have three agents which
represent each server
I have agent one agent 2 and a g3 and
there are some Java process running
let me run another Java process in agent
3 so it's it's a job application server
and let's go back to 8 &amp;amp; 3 and there it
is there's my new Java process running
so there I can collect some information
about Java and the process itself
can see the user ID start times top time
if I if the process is stopped the
process ID there I have the CPU tab
where I can see information about the
CPU usage for the Java process I have a
profiler
I have cabbage collection garbage
collector and even a memory and there
you can see each heap region being use
it now the heap analyzer where I can
collect keep dumps and this is IO this
is thread this is JIT compiler
information classes and this particular
tab is another open source project for
red head and if tables itself
it calls Whiteman Whiteman is a a2 for
debugging running Java processes using
some kind of rules so for example let's
say I want to intercept java.lang string
and using some random methods and I need
to print out the information about the
moment that the method is called so I
can write a rule in vitamin and inject
using thermal strategy the run in Java
process and then I can collect more
information about the Reina Java process
so for example I can generate our
template here and then as you can see
there's a rule named class the metal I
can use helper class at the point of
interception if I have conditions and
then I have methods to collect
information about this moment when the
JVM is running so
that's it that's the demo for the
thermostat there are lots of information
about thermostat in the wiki also
there's the CLI I didn't prepare a demo
for the CLI too but it's kind of the
same thing but using the terminal and
you can collect all these information
using the CLI to you the graphical
interface and also an eclipse plugin
okay so is that something that you use
also on your day to day development yes
every time ah okay very good okay thank
you so much for talking to us thank you
thank you for that they will it was
impressive good thank you
Thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
