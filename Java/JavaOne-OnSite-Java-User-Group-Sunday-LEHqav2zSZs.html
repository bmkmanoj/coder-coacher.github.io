technology Network we're here at javaone
2011 talking to community leaders and so
I've got Bruno Souza hi Bruno hi this is
Bruno and I'm one of the community
leaders for the JavaScript community
java.net tell me where you're from as if
we can't tell because of your flag yeah
so I'm from Brazil and I was founded and
helped run one of the largest JavaScript
award it's it's joe beaser society so
Java that's is based in San Paulo and
have presence in several cities in
Brazil okay when you say largest in the
world tell me what numbers were talking
here well there's there's some larger
user groups in large than us but we're
about you know 40,000 people okay 40,000
Java developers well there's a whole lot
of Java developers out there right right
they say 90 million developers so i
think i think that's job is a very
trading community there's a lot of
interesting people there's a lot of
developers out there and I think the
Java Sea groups today they kind of
conglomerate's maybe I don't know I
would say like 200,000 developers around
the world and and i think that's that's
a pretty impressive number for user
groups and i think that but there's this
room to grow more right we have to reach
a few millions before at me memorize a
script that would be great absolutely so
you're here at user group sunday tell me
a little bit about what you guys are
talking about so we're talking about
exactly this right how do we grow these
groups community how we can bring more
variety to the java developer how we can
make more actions that to reach more
developers how we can promote java and
help grow the excitement of java so
javascript is all about us you know
developers having fun developers meeting
each other and getting together you
don't know that we're talking about java
and one of the topics they were talking
here is that developers are like shy
group right so we all know that's hard
to get relationships and networking so i
think obviously groups are good place
for you to go have a beer go eat pizza
go discuss some technology for your
friends and actually meet people right
it's a great place okay so if I'm an
individual developer i'm working with
Java or I'm just new to it how do I get
involved in a jug so these things to do
is go to Java ads on the JavaScript
community and you go there you find if
there's a user group in your area and
then you get in contact with user group
if there is one in your area if there is
not one here maybe you can no just
invite a couple friends should go have a
beer and maybe you want to start easy
group right so I think that's the first
step is to see if there is a group
already established that you can just
join in participate every user group
needs help for its members to run we are
all run by volunteers and so you know
any time you can vote user group if you
want to give a talk or if you want to
help out in in organizing events any any
time spending the user group is very
valuable time okay great so I'm going to
switch gears here a little bit because
you have many roles in the java
community and one of them is you're now
a member of the JCP the java community
process executive committee right more
or less yes okay I mean so we're not
switching roles too much so so Java
right was elected and it was indicated
by Oracle and it was elected for the was
ratified let's say for a seat and eating
the EC on the JCP and so I'm I'm
representing so Java so we are still
talking about user groups so so job was
the first job as a group to join the JCP
a few years ago and we are now together
with the London community where two goos
two groups that were voting into the JCP
now so we are we are bringing to the
java community process a little bit of
the view of the end user right you know
the the end developer that's that's
having to deal with the technology that
having to use the standards have to use
all the products and what those those
developers are thinking about the future
of Java so that's that's our role in
trying to bring that into the JCP so
how's it going so far so the JCP is a
very interesting thing I think that it's
interesting that javi's groups and the
JCP are our last technical
environments right because you know
we're as Java scripts are creating
events we are organizing parties we are
organizing meetings so there's nothing
to do in terms of technology right we're
just kind of Nabal in the technology and
the JCP is the same thing right there's
a lot of you know discussions about the
process itself and governance and and
anything like that because and then the
Rio technology happens inside the expert
groups not inside the EC there's active
community right and you know it's an
interesting thing it's it's so it's very
political but it's really the process
that involves taking to technology and I
think the JCP its fundamental for java
because it is the place where big
players in small players and us right
now even even as the individual
developers and user groups that we can
come together and you can discuss and we
can all agree on how the technology
should evolve and if you think about
this it's the role of the standards
process in bringing all those diverse
parties together it's a very very
important role and you know i don't
think that java would be such a wide
adopted technology in such a pervert
pervasive in specially the corporate
world and everywhere if you was not the
f-14 down in JCP so i think that's you
know it's one of those things that it's
you have to do it right and i'm very
glad to participate in this process it's
it's refreshing to actually see the
discussions are going on in terms of
bringing the process to be more
transparent last heavyweight mean in
helping out the developers to
participate making things clear so the
companies can participate in a better
way and I think that's we're doing fine
there's a lot of things to be discussing
in the JCP we're just starting there is
a series of steps during student going
to need to take there's some some
heavyweight discussion is still going to
happen and and there are some corporate
interest from different big players and
you know some special ones particularly
that are very power from the j
CB that we might have to bend a little
bit and a little sausage making is
happening right so there will be all
these kind of things and I think that's
it's part of the process and I'm very
glad that we are actually able to
participate we are actually able to
contribute we're actually able to be
there sometimes is one of the things
that the fact that you're there already
change things right even if you even if
you don't you know it's of course it's
it's a large thing right it's a large
process a lot of legally is a lot of a
lot of legal documents and so sometimes
even if you're not able to participate
in the defined details the fact that
you're there you're paying attention
what's going on you're broadcasting this
already changes how everyone else
participate right so I think this is
kind of part of of the beauty of the
standards process because the more
transparent we make the more everyone
behaves right well that's cool I'm glad
you're really involved one last question
tell me about the mood in the java
community how do you sense it so i think
that's a lot of things have happened in
the last few years you know son with the
problems at sun had an oracle taking
over and that kind of it slowed down and
put fries and excitement around job and
we know that some other technologies
around where I mean you know more
exciting let's say like this but I think
that a lot of things have happened in
Java in the last couple of years so and
and I think this is very good you know I
think that the developers are asking we
in our user group we have a large crowds
coming back to our events there is you
know Java is the most user development
technology or right now right so so it's
not something that just disappears right
so I don't think it is in any risk of
disappear at all but as some I think
there is a there is a new wave of
excitement right now I think the openjdk
helped a lot of that you know we have
the Java open source really open source
now the refs implementation of Java is
open source now so I think this just
brings a new wave of excitement into the
technology so I think this right now is
things going and doing good great thank
you
very much Bruno I appreciate I know
you're busy guy but if you're here at
javaone look for the man with the flag
and you can talk to them all about Java
user groups and what's going on in the
community for the Oracle technology
Network this is Tori wheel thanks bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
