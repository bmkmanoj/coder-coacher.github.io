technology Network we're here at devoxx
UK talking to members of the java
community and i have the honor of
talking to jamison McGivern take james
are you doing no but thanks yeah have
you gotten any sleep in the last several
months uh an hour or two here cuz I know
you're on the steering committee here at
devoxx UK that's right yeah it's been a
great show thanks so thank you for all
your work oh it's a pleasure knowing
people enjoy it it's been really great
so you're you gave a presentation on
security that's right encrypt the
mathematics behind encryption really wow
ok so I'm going to call you a security
expert will you take that mantle I'll
accept that one yeah great ok so I get
this all the time is Java inherently
insecure a Java stuck not inherently
insecure you the programmers might
introduce our own insecurities but as a
language you know we're constantly
having the Java security updates rolled
out so any insecurities inside the JVM
are quickly patched and sort of
developers shouldn't worry too much
about those just as long as they make
sure that this hanging up today with the
security patches that coming out from
Oracle ok when I'm writing apps as a
Java developer what should I say what
are the things i should think about in
terms of security a security should be
baked in from the beginning like people
go you know test ed you should have your
test written first with with security
needs to be felt thought of from the
very first moment you know if you if
you're using spring framework for
example the spring security has loads of
extra nice features built in so you just
use that and you get extra for free so
taking security you know it's a first
principle will help ensure that your
application is secure all the way
through to deployment excellent so your
session was on
so it was the the mathematics behind our
essay which is the most popular
algorithm used in HTTP ssl at the moment
and then looking at the new one that's
coming on board which is elliptic curve
cryptography ECC that's correct yeah
which is a very very strongly used in
android and it's going to become more
popular on the JVM and server side
because it's it produces the same level
of security if the smaller key sizes
which means that it runs faster with
less memory less CPU less energy so it's
a much more efficient sort of encryption
algorithm that's comparable to RSA okay
stronger faster better so is RS a good
enough at the moment a lot of people
aren't using big enough keys on our
essay so you should be using at least
ten 1024-bit keys this year and by next
year you should be up to 20 48 so that's
quite a big jump that is being
recommended whereas with elliptic curve
cryptography at the moment 256 is
sufficient to be equivalent to 1024 RSA
so it's quite a considerable speed
change for the same level of security so
you have to pay attention to Key says
it's really important you have to pay
attention to a lot of the parameters
that go in with RSA the key size is
pretty much the only parameter you have
with elliptic curve cryptography you
have which curve you're using how many
points you've got on that curve so the
extra number of parameters that you can
twiddle with you know it's it's kind of
like the garbage collector you know you
can really highly tuned certain curves
for certain but applications so you know
mobile applications you might use one
curve whereas if you're doing VPN SSH
sort of connections you might use a
different curve because it's faster for
that fascinating so if I want to learn
some more about this where would you
recommend somebody go look go start the
best place is safe crypto calm they've
got a list of all the latest
cryptography curves and implementations
along with links to the various security
announcements they've gone with them or
additional security notes that the
experts have come up with and of course
Rob Schneider on security as a blog post
is
I everyone's favorite security guy will
get the address part of that and put it
on the on the tagline so thank you very
much James for dropping by appreciate
your time talking to you everything you
do for the java community thanks Tori
