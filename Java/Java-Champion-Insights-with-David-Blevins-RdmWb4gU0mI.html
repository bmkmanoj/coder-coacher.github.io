with the OT and advocacy team and I am
grateful to be the judge java champion
community manager and i'm joined today
with a one of our java champions david
levin what hip 11 sorry ok and i wanted
to just kind of give people an idea of
exactly what java champions do who you
are you know because you guys do so much
for the community so first question is
what do you do for your day job sure
well so I work in a small little startup
called Tommy tribe I started with other
people in the open source community and
we support Apache Tommy the app server
that we also built and so we have a good
time just kind of going around in
championing open source and Java in
general ok and then what do you do you
know obviously your expert in the field
you know how do you give back to the
community is it more through the open
source definitely a couple different
ways so traditionally I started out in
open source and over the last you know
10 15 years have progressed more towards
encouraging people to do the same and so
you know I started out making a little
project called open ejb in 1999 and that
later on got used into another app
server called Geronimo but I started to
get involved in the JCP about 2004 in
the ejb three-point expert group and
that has affected me quite a lot and so
I've done what I can to encourage people
to do the same and to get involved in
just Java in general at a standards
level ok because things can change and
they do when people just participate and
it's probably the one most valuable
things that you can do for yourself and
for the community and so you know
getting involved and giving to the
community and give
to the standards makes you stronger
makes the ecosystem stronger and
everybody comes out the better and so
you know I go around travel a lot and
talk it at conferences like this and and
I've seen a decent number of faces go
from audience attendees to participants
in the in the expert groups and I think
that's fantastic and it makes me feel
things we feel great when I see that and
so we we also recently ran for a seat on
the JCP to try and continue to to do
that at a much bigger level you know so
we're all in on the on the Java
ecosystem and it's fantastic and you
know we're really love to see it go
forward and love to see new faces in
there because for something to last for
20 years you know you got to have new
blood so you got to be out there
encouraging new people to get involved
in helping them you know coaching them
and you know kind of helping them find
their way in the door because it's
difficult oh yeah it's difficult to try
and get into standards and
specifications and to the get to the
whole community process you can't just
say it's open and then just expect
people to show up you know you've got to
go out you've got to encourage them to
do so you've got to show them examples
of how they can do it and then you know
coach them and encourage them and you
know congratulate them and and give them
accolades and thank-yous when they do so
and so you know it's a lot but that's
generally what I try to do to you know
give the people the life that I've had
well I'm sure the you know we all
appreciate that and your contributions
you mentioned the vote is that still
open is there somewhere where they don't
I don't know if the votes open anymore I
think it's done you know probably by the
time this is published it will
definitely be done okay just case but
yeah so if it is open do vote
we're certainly happy to have the vote
but yeah so it's it's it's pretty great
so you know we're blissful participants
in this wonderful ecosystem if if I can
go from a contributor on an open source
project to helping to employ people who
also want to contribute into standards
that just goes to show how much they
give you more than you give them and
it's it's a good it's a it's a good
reason to try and be a champion because
and in your act of helping other people
you always you know come out better as
well and so it's you know champion is
not a one way thing you know just like
being a teacher you're you're also a
student it's very much one of those
things well thank you so much again for
all you do and enjoy the rest of your
day all right thank you so much
