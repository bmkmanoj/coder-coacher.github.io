hiking session with Russell wander hi
and for those of you don't room Russell
he is doctor dr. winder currently
teaching which was universe cools at you
know is just a visiting professor to
whup Hampton University okay as I said I
know actually doing much teaching there
and also very well known in the groovy
community for doing against as working
on GPRS talking about GPRS at several
conferences on a regular basis unit
whatever sort of cool stuff have you
been any recently recently and started
doing a revamp of sort of SQL language
and some guy started it some years are
back gee SQL so trying to revamp that to
provide a nice domain-specific language
for working with SQL things and even
more recently than that did a lot of
Gradle stuff for groovy FX and they said
ah come and join the team so I did
Barrasso and then once and then I
realized that I didn't know anything
about Java effects I feel so teach
myself something about it cool so for
anyone on the street tweet out to us on
the social stream and tell us how the
the audio and video is working we have
an excellent internet connection this
time aight aight megabits per second up
which would should be more than enough
to push all the bits we need to get
stuff live but we need to know if it's
coming out of the on the end user end to
see if it actually comes through in
people's computers i think the NICU
stream down samples for folks but
remains to be seen how well that
actually works so before we get started
I have to present you with our little
gift this is a night hacking kunika and
you can put this on your laptop or
wherever else you'd like to probably
somewhere else but well I tend not to
put the stickers on laptops but yeah
I've bling tomorrow I must go ready the
Apple sign anyway I tried I tried really
hard those you can't see it's it's a
beautiful Apple out their best shining
right through stickers okay so we're
going to hack on i get free PO today
what's what's the mood really well
you're getting involved with the group
FX i thought it's going to be
interesting to do quadtrees because
quadtrees collision detection it's the
sort of thing you really want to to get
involved with and the hidden behind that
was the idea that quadtrees nice fork
join type structure and youthful join
framework it's what jeep ours is built
on so the idea is to try and put those
together and to see if using gps we can
make quadtree algorithms goal I
lightning on parallel hardwa so I just
started tinkering trying to look at
various bouncing ball type things and
found a few mohsen in JavaScript one or
two in various other languages and of
course there are one or two already in
javafx so I've been trying to mine those
for ideas of design and structure but
not just ripping off their code even
though it's all false okay so I just put
together beginnings of colliding balls
it's git repository and so its standard
get place maybe under Russell / groovy
balls alright so on let me let me give
this a try I'm going to pop to ok so my
desktop with wonderful full effect and a
doctor yeah
let's let's swap in just feel will go so
we can actually see ourselves and you're
gonna give me I get your all right well
good hope is it on github yeah all right
where should I go so if you go to me
first and then / groovy balls with a
capital G and a capital B what's your
idea I think it's just Russell okay
Russell gray balls yeah okay so so folks
can play along breaking breaking
breaking is not good we got somebody few
was telling us about the stream quality
oh that's very serious this bit disown
me okay well one thing we can do is we
can try on lowering the bitrate on the
stream for folks and that might help to
actually putting out 2 megabits yeah
shoot go out what might be going out but
folks my type you having trouble right
receiving that much data so the
recording will be great alright what's
good with it longer and see if we get
anybody else but we have one person who
told us the screen is breaking so let us
let us know okay so say thanks
hmm ok and then I'll meet tweet out to
URL mmm Julie thanks for folks here you
want to play long they get have your
okay let's go back to github I should i
grab that all right I see you get
instant can't connect Jeff what we'll
keep trying mark the saying you can't
connect hmm that's not our problem oh
that's I used train as ah so we're
feeding it up but some people are not
never connect
what to do to what sort of files you out
in here we're all client sorry do you
have an ID project set up for Chanel you
know he's just in his cradle cradle yeah
so if you you can either generate an
eclipse project or a idea project or
just go straight in on with netbeans if
you've got the Gradle plug-in there's a
real funny thing up yeah and I've get
them told me I had to try and have been
7 3 beta today I was at a cemetery bit
on my future no it will work on 72
because there's a Gradle plug-in
available for netbeans I know works
because I've tried it right so you'll
have to download it from somewhere I
don't think it's in the repository you
go to gear gems I'm gonna try a tres
cool all right go for it
don't hate ear chance pie kitchen he
refers to the original as well as having
sorry he's his own original as well as
pointing to this person is update of it
okay there's 2011's obviously no it's
not that one there's a much later when
than that so if you go into his blog he
would give a pointer to which is the one
I've used but that one was 73 Peter due
to 22 feet
this is long i Donna that's the only 1i
I just took the download file its kind
of these netbeans I don't want actually
build a problem probably not
I thought have these couple of sources
oh this one you know you might be
surprised to see me and that one I don't
know they actually printed those them oh
yeah print them here I presume well I
wanna put it as in today is that an
English language edition looks like
English yeah but I don't I don't see any
now this is an American English not you
cannot wait they need a translated
version when I see you I wanna see do
not have to collect years I'd like if
you don't mind putting your monochrome
there sometime oh yeah absolutely before
I leave Ramon okay so we're gonna we're
going to forge ahead because our buddy
Tom he says the internet the stream is
going great I cool so um what will chest
Tom and keep forging ahead fine ok so
how I done wants them then this should
be a download file you can just pull out
Reyes was weird and like button just
about here somewhere wow this is not
optimized for my browser obviously and
there's some way I get this into
netbeans right I think oh I know I know
that beans has an option for you can
just just using a location with volumes
yeah downloaded
director
it looks promising
right
some plugins required groovy kit ok so I
probably get a groovy they're just
horses turned on is there a separate
groovy plugin which is also not enough
named repo oh you probably have a puma
son just had it yeah yeah okay so some
other one of these grab it
I thought the groove he was in the in
the repository is it I thought Greer
supports just in there and that means
it's certainly 73 beta very good because
groovy support sadly sort of died away
for a bit in netbeans and then came back
with vengeance okay so like when I my
early maybe it's not I've seen that 70
days emissary to know be this annoying
Oh
1971 1572 is out that means for Gary
so maybe maybe is that I have groovy
support but I don't have okay it looks
like Ruby sports just included maybe as
I have groupies for Graham at the right
version of grease afore because it's not
a plug and I think it's just built into
the ID let's just double-check that well
I've seen a groove your projects
oh okay what's Howser denebians 73 cuz
you said this fix yes certainly does
yeah certainly on linux anyway I've
never actually tried on anything
no that's not good vishwas Rao download
your name left hand side
alright so well while we're getting our
ID set up this would be a good time for
Flip's to ask Russell questions and
we're we're following the social stream
as we're we're getting stuff set up and
or not as the case may be netbeans sites
not responding that's no good google is
responding so I've entered in which is
good because otherwise are streaming
won't be working but NetBeans dot org is
down either that or you've conspicuously
blocked it on your level is nice total
freedom out I know it happens we got so
many people to go try this out that
we've got a denial of service attack on
my nokia inside in which case we we can
sort of blame kitchen because he's the
person who suggested I use netbeans yes
yes all right so since it's a Gradle
project we can we can do all those
Gradle goodness from the command line if
I don't know so he can I have some
version of Gradle and I do let's just
try that pretty balls Gradle green all
run it should work yeah good old guy
online now that's not good that's it's
at least that's progress we got error
bounds exception seven compile groovy
right index pounds section 7aa your
installation of Gradle is version 6 and
doesn't understand 8 ok def cradle been
Gradle ok what's the best way to update
cradle um-hmm how could you bring it in
by download let's get question but I
have a cradle holder I got second time
on video that's reliable
people being helpful griddles wants you
now yeah yeah okay thanks thanks Andre
thanks very much Andre Andre is watching
along and laughing at our horrible a
horrible setup of Gradle so for those
who don't know Gradle it's it's
something you should be using instead of
ants hey I thought I said whether you're
hacking groovy oh yes you should you
should there's a surprising number of
people who still code using ads it's
just I I do some Java training and
they're a surprising number of people
who want and training I keep suggesting
to you should either go together a dork
last enough well they asked I do try but
if they won't go for Gradle I say at
least a go for maven aunt is for
consenting computers only really yeah
I'm not very happy without I gave up on
a long time ago which is why i wrote
ganked in the first place because I just
got so infuriated with XML as a
programming language okay so we've got
universal afraid
area new version of Gradle Gradle 12 so
Audrey's right Thank You Andre and just
to make all the paths happy I'm going to
you I'll dump it in the same place it
was previously and I way on emptiness or
paths I have to know I just use macports
on Maui sex so you can use it to suck
down coat install cry i have lag ports I
should've done because there are lots of
people who manage to keep macports up to
date with Gradle groovy and Andy can't
though so no that's not good is there a
dash version second grade all you've got
jvn aight i guess i should nail work
well do
okay cuz of our solve all the
dependencies so ah right ok so in the in
the file I've probably been very
personal and i'm using groovy two-point
1.0 snapshot which is my build of get
head on a daily basis so if you just go
into the label do what i'm going to do
just quickly is so we can use this as an
editor at least i'm going to create a
new project from existing sources right
wish me i wish i had a java project this
will these be a start it'll show us the
files
chief yum is an option for studying up
groovy ecosystem project so Andre says
use GV m he's probably right all right
very wise last time I chatted with Marco
I thought it was only working with
grails at the moment whilst they were
betting it down and then they were going
to introduce groovy and the other great
technologies and once they got it all
sorted so I don't know where the GBM
would do grails today ok so it picked up
the groovy files which is going to be
the problem is groovy sports my guess in
the plugin is we have proper groovy
support but we don't actually have well
we obviously don't have since exhaling I
droopy all right I take that back anyway
we can now use our idd with no code
highlighting to edit the Gradle file so
which we change if you take out that
just put two point zero point four
Oh with my water and off uh-hmm with a
glass somewhere aah over there oh yeah
that was probably with the camera there
you go okay can't find the javafx
sources how'd you link on the javafx
sources and you're built oh because it's
not Jay Assad yet it's not automatically
in the Java bill so you have to actually
pull the javafx jarring manually so
there should be a long that calls it in
now that will be my personal address so
you need to I need to change that and
used a Java home so the right yeah so is
there a Java home variable yeah or the
worst you just do system getting to get
job at home but yeah you should be able
to from there just trying to think what
the best route with the that was I mean
to further refine what my purpose so
what's doing this order will archive my
path figure out the Delta opportunities
and then figure out the environment
variable and substitute that and what I
should do is get one of my laptops so
I've got my laptop is I answer these
questions a bit more quickly okay
instead of waffling you want to round do
that why yeah why figure out what my
java scholars
find the camera safe as well there's no
wires okay so i think on max the java
still ends up under library java okay
now we can pick a 17 or 18 jadian so i
think this is the path you know the copy
the path you're not evil I don't like
showing of path on max they they look
hiding it from you yeah I know someone
goes for now imac i found that the only
sane way of using is to have the path
showing at the bottom so you can even
click into all the greyed out yeah i
managed to get it sometime so there's a
status bar where you can get the biscuit
trail or something crumbs or whatever
they're called stairs park path more ego
and that actually allows you to get into
grayed out ones how do you copy oh I
guess you don't oh wait wait I got a get
info on this path and then I'll probably
can't get close enough
I'm not entirely much more into debian
linux okay so home and then what's wrong
hole jari lib the JRE lib it should all
be there it's just a question of getting
to your java so everything up to here
should be the jdk folder yeah that
should work for me to find out what the
right yeah I'll follow I'll find out
what these icy effect Ashley compiles
yeah and then you can we can figure out
the path yeah we need to put that in to
grow my channel
contents home Jerry live jf x RT all
right just make sure mm-hmm will copy
the whole path oh I think I missed a
foot directory in there because that is
not long enough when I copied before I
just I miss so that's right wow we got
Ruby balls well it's just it's just a
tiny little beginning so so must be
using some sort of operation because
when I cross off for each other turns
white yeah first of all and one of Dean
or gyms examples of doing timeline work
on groovy effects I just sort of
borrowed that to give myself a green
ball going in one direction and then
I've added a red one going in the other
direction simply to have to force me to
use more than one variable because you
end up with a model and then there's a
view on the model sort of classic MVC
style so you don't actually have to do
much work with the timeline and then you
get an animation comedy the full title
the class is called which actually keeps
a monitor on all the progress up to in
between the frames that's the area
closer and tracking yeah so collision
takes one of my functions so groovy I I
just love the way you can create
instances of anonymous types and
in grooving so what I've got is a whole
collection of balls here evergreen when
I read one so the Deaf is set inside the
scene right so you can you it's all
reminiscent of javafx script a script
and which got thrown out I am over yes
so instead just use groovy effects
because groovio X is 2 javafx to what
Java FX script was to javafx one yeah
and for folks for folks who are using
using Java effects or looking at using
Java effects you don't need to be a
groovy hacker to use groovy effects it's
a good entry point for anybody starting
out with Java affects the documentation
is really good I've been impressed with
all their docks ok so here are some of
the things that folks with them sitting
on the social stream
so Andre Andre under under this is it
like work I think we're distinguishing
the men from the boys who has a 2
megabit per second pipe and can actually
consume our street I like I like your um
your new twitter handle your new twitter
logo Andre that's that's very nice yes
yes he has the night hacking sticker on
his own I was wrong as he needs to learn
to spell all right you get the name
spelt wrong there that's not gonna
happen no you're already did i'm afraid
he's a heel 1s in two hours instead of 2
in 1 l yeah but i tried to get it right
everywhere I don't know he's undressing
only but uh Helen curse analysis to get
it wrong yeah cast off cool so stage one
that's one other thing we can do with a
the camera later is so that part of the
setup is all wireless alright cuz we can
walk around and show interesting things
if you liked it I'm not sure there's
anything really that interesting around
here apart from the schools yeah
actually what so worth it I always see
in your presentation the squirrels as
you have a squirrel so where do the
squirrels hang out well we normally have
the trees over that side but because
we're having the outside of the house
painted and we were as Steve so we've
got scaffolding on the outside of the
house where they re rendering it and in
the meantime all the trees have moved to
the other side or our backyard okay so
their own part of trees yeah
everything's pottied around here okay
and they normally play out the front and
out the back but they were here this
morning mara focusing as squirrels will
start closer and the Robin comes and the
j &amp;amp; the magpie and the who do we have
this afternoon a valentine crow the
black rose yes they not around at the
moment but they do come from time to
time and we had a dunnock this afternoon
it was obviously coming back to we was
born last year and Alec yes about typos
it's a little bird is so a bit like a
Robin bit like a sparrow grey version
sparrow okay dinner and sleeker we had a
nest of them out the back last year for
them I thought of whom I think two
survived and well I'm just pretty good
progress yeah pretty good guy in the
interim what I should be doing is
finding out what we should be putting in
that yeah that would be great and then
I'll commit the changes you're making
yeah yeah sure no problem as I was
looking at them so I'm have any folks on
the stream been able to get the the
groovy balls example running from
Russell's repo we've we've got it
running here
yeah apologies for the rather
opinionated pals in there which said
this will work on Russell's machine and
hard white path not a good idea okay and
to Andrea's comment about Jeff xrt
missing on a class path that will get
fixed in Java 8 the initial merge of
javafx into the JDK they didn't want to
muck with the boot classpath midstream
because it was in line or at least it
wasn't a major but in 18 they're going
to change the boot class panting cool
effects are Tito charts you go through
the muck with your build script anymore
but for now the best you it is
putting it a path to Java home there's i
have an example of way to do an ant as
well which does the same thing and that
way you get the system javafx version
yeah messing with the boob classpath in
Gradle is a bit annoying a moment
because it doesn't allow you to prefix
you don't use it as a host fix like
saying that it assumes you should never
ever does it well yeah yeah which is
normally a sensible position but because
i'm testing and building the jsr 166
jars okay i have to get one to this one
sec sighs it's douglas parallelism stone
so rather than people having to get it
from the concurrency and treasure so you
go on work on three powers yeah
motorcycle a silicon transistor and jeep
ours basically wraps all of the j's are
166 stuff okay so then we provide a
groovy face to the for join frameworks
and all the rest of the goodies in jsr
166 e which is the package that goes
with java 7 or jsr 166 y which goes
the java 6 okay to make what should be
in Java a when it gets released but when
they were doing the jsr 166 why they
also created an extra 166 why with a
thing called parallel right and that
class is just so cool that we use a
great deal in in G pals ok so much that
comes out and sadly it's not going to be
in jar 80 was just it's so it's this
yeah the the issues of the Java right
and the lambda expressions the extender
method about that serum yeah I think
it's still defender methods of the
moment line what we'll just call it week
multiple areas girls was very strong
last week a bit ago that dirt tasted it
not to be confused with that I thought
he gave very strong message on that one
I thought it was very good very good
message there you go um but because of
this issue with changing the library the
parallel array would have to fit in with
the proper design and dug in and the
crew were too keen on Ashley because
there are some other things coming up so
he wanted to work on what currently
under the heading of bulk array which
would be fully parameterize fully
working with the defender methods so
what we've done is to take a friendly
fork of the parallel array and Sergey
particular value problem we've included
in G path so that we're separated from
any other problems yes then anybody who
wants to use the new parrot was a
parallel right yeah should use two bars
absolutely that's probably best way to
use yep and yeah you can do what will be
coming out in Java right now
in Java 7 or groovy in java 6 is what
fast i wanted to do with jeep ours and
it all just works which is very cool
well alright see ya la oh I need to get
magical encounter I did this in this
incantation yes now where the heck did I
put it yeah roger has been helping us
out with everything else he should how
do we get the path to it's the
properties we need the system properties
yeah so be system dot properties dot
user dot home something or java go home
so this point where i grab if i get a
groovy console out i see i see this
before in cradle scripts I've just don't
another magical incantation to do come
on Google
cradle okay cradled out properties orbed
uh cradles I javab out how Java home for
the cradle hold process now that's the
actual thing itself open dolphin you
should be able to do prima system
properties dot Java go home yeah I found
on her system properties are clear
exactly same system properties and then
job home will give you the Java your
ally that's right yeah yeah yeah yeah
well it's because groovy allows you to
access maps with a property syntax or by
using square brackets it's six of one
half dozen the other but that should now
work
listen you don't like the quote maybe
system don't put the cheese you end up
with a hunky character from coffee
tastings no no no strings on strings you
have duplicated sunpuddle selling
outside yeah yeah not quite no court and
beer maybe Java homes returning
something other than what we expect Java
home Jerry with jf xrt najar before I
has should be correct
okay home is our way to print out the
bar variable and the scripts here yeah
you can just use a print line statement
good idea right there yes indeed yeah
sure maybe
okay Jerry is impulsive house upon the
Java home gives you the address of the
JRE not of the JDK oh yes it does get
you the JRE no added guys rekt fixed
cool so that all right let's get out of
it changes home if he is no no no no no
build a cradle get ignore wats clever i
sided the files for the NetBeans but
which is fine well no it didn't add
everything so like oh okay you should
all that suck if I can edit this than I
will I will get rid of well two things
one is you don't you don't want to
answer in your project that's just evil
did thought that you want to use adds so
much that it on definitely on your gauge
done anything okay one second thing is
oops did I like to leave bill dr. Ariel
oops
whoops wrong
bring it back
ok and we make a change that should be
vajayjay and the quoting issue ok let's
try not to delete it this time you've
gone back to wrong version groovy yes 20
to 20
ok ok ok vodka
all right now we can whack build.xml
manifest and then hack to get it on file
which is not showing up here it's really
weird Oh charming visible files and
netbeans
so thick knows everything
beautiful okay so now we have one
addition to ignore all the NetBeans crud
yes and that real file change okay so
fix the blood scripts no longer be
Russell specific
sink
committing to master
alright well supposedly I should I push
dementia okay what else we do it later
with wizard so they're going to get
pushed to fly and put it in so it says
unsafe to come out which I don't know
what that means it should get a master
what sex oh heck I need to make sure you
can write to that repository don't I
because you didn't fork on github to do
a pull request which is that problem so
when I go here and administrate and say
collaborators and what's what's yours
give on Joel
yeah there we go
that should give you a right permission
yep excellent excellent so I can now
pull that down least I hope I can yay
bachelor australia for folks yeah i've
got all the changes here it's an
excellent so i should now be able to run
this on here and it still works
and that you push the star fixes for the
door okay so many works thanks pretty
Falls example take your loss
russell on this corner so then rustlers
for one more for you yeah that's me
definitely cool oh I'll carry on the
netbeans as you are as well
so the next stage I was thinking is
either introducing better path all of
natural physics in here because this is
me just leading up towards having to use
core true I don't know what you're
describing the beginning you want to
quiet area stuff and so what what do you
want to visualize what's red and go let
me show on here at least to you good
won't appear the folks online and the
example project that this all the java
effects project that I've been having to
look out for ideas to turned into groovy
effects so if I go frogs and others work
javafx Geographics ok so this is think I
can just do aunt run on this case a
full-blown netbeans project
so what this guy had done sorry I should
remember his name up on taneously
forgotten it is to allow you to just do
that sort of thing that's classic
bouncing bouncing balls and John Fox I
think they sell this one before baby I'm
sure it's a fairly well-known one and
where I got it from was a kid I do a
config minus L um I must have downloaded
zip file so where did I get it from
there's my notes that tell me
I hadn't noticed txt file with their job
passing but let's rely on google RX
thanks there we go a candid javafx balls
number one item excellent so it's this
chap ok Hoss Paul ok so was the idea why
pull us up to focus on strength his is
just really a bouncing balls demo and
you can increase this number of balls
and do the decrease the size of the
balls and you can have lots and lots of
in there and the idea is that the
collisions require country or those that
require kwatra processing but normally
you use some form of quadtree to do the
processing but I'm not a great fan of
Java when it comes to these things and
so I was rewriting it effectively in in
grooving I didn't want to just line by
line encode it or because I think that
would just missed the point because
what's in it what's idiomatic in javafx
is not a going to be idiomatic in groovy
effects so I didn't quite guess far in
the two days I've been acting on this as
I sort of hoped due to building works
wave and life and stuff like that ok but
so here's an F games project on your
trade opening
as he rolls but the eventual goal is for
the Grails and groovy exchange in
December is to have some nice demos of G
pars managing the quadtree to get away
from the usual g pals demos I give which
is trying to find values of pines or
doing the sleeping barber which is
another favorite though it has to be
said the calculation for pi is now found
its way into the groovy performance
tests oh yeah your enlightens that just
took them
so you should just build because yeah
extended the reason okay so I i I'm
telling funky build issues here but the
the reason that you ended up with the
sources just sources because he provided
download is usually good yeah just a
download and he did an older version
that be and this is why you never check
in at the ends project files to to be
your master I've gone into the habit of
using Gradle to hold all my dependencies
and then either just using NetBeans
directly on the Gradle project or
creating an idea file or an eclipse file
or if the worst comes to worst the real
ID which is emacs and bash for those
people who don't like Phoenix VIN and
actually when I was at Ascot I was
giving a talk all right next door to the
room the dim gai can you guess who had
more people in the room then God he he
his his room was too small so they
actually had to escort people out and do
it in a larger venue because we couldn't
physically fit all of the benefactors in
the world I presume you go few Emacs
folks to come and heckle yeah obviously
I think that's that's the geek the geek
debate over the past century yeah VIN
versus Emacs it's like your clips vs
idea this is netbeans that's a
three-cornered one isn't it yep okay let
me just try one more thing before we
give up on the Java scripts falls down
it sometimes the easiest way to get
somebody else's nevians project working
is to simply create a new project and
then import the source if NetBeans
doesn't crash while you're doing it
which it is it for me all right all the
JavaFX Falls project javafx GFX boys jf
x 2 goals i think is the name of project
their effects to your balls right here
javafx two balls ok
area alright so I'm just going to steal
the source and put it in lie and let's
not the codger chocolate flex falls
through or as negatives project yeah it
is I guess I steal this and put it
inside my new javafx Falls project which
is not there anymore okay
Wow
think i'm going to crash the
it won't open up in your project dialog
for me
yeah that's pretty eyes so this is about
one time when you open up then yeah they
want it in quite seriously post
okay so so why don't we do this in the
for the sake of reasonable time you are
let's pick something interesting which
we can change in the applications of to
show you progress towards your eventual
call and then we'll do take some
questions off the stream so good match
this tree and see if any was posted
questions sure you sure and then we'll
do a little walk around and see if we
can catch squirrels or around the light
and will call the day that should take
like 15 minutes I guess
Wow nothing's going crazy crazy
that's what I'm have guy do oh yeah
by weight and I know there you go yeah I
expect I guess is the encoding software
to be consuming a little bit of yeah I
mean how many cools of using them love
you hey yeah i think it's physically for
the house i'm so hyper everything no I
avoid hyper-threading I just generally
switch you off yeah okay so let's wish
project is yours really balls on a
closed recipes so no penis doesn't
actually try
that happens
now all you have Tory those gritty boss
all you are is have done text editor for
groovy files okay and what we want to
what's your it was just small step
towards progress and close your next
thing I was going to do is to actually
do some collision rather than just
letting them pass pass through each
other there's actually two have some
form of collision so I can point it out
Steve on here and then you get to to
show the folks on online i got but the
the point at which we're getting some
collisions is actually handled by this
beast a year causing traffic and he
sought it's actually probably in the
wrong place but I was really lazy
because I didn't want to find out what
the symbols white green and red should
have been as because I changes to white
in the center because you're getting
collision it actually you change them
both to wipe that's right and but what
we should be doing in here of course is
the physics okay so this is where we
want to change the ok got it so you want
them to go and when they collide they
should have bounced yeah some somehow
yeah well I guess given given you two
balls and they will intersect directly
you can you actually you know in advance
here your balance is going to be afford
to you an ID degree turn yeah pretty
much but in this is where you get wants
actually figure out the position of two
walls in the shape and then do a proper
bounce off ok so the M and we can
actually change the game by not having
it go out at exactly 45 degrees because
this thing's square because moment
always doing is moving one ball from
here
to there in two seconds and then sending
it back okay probably the other thing we
need to maybe a first step towards this
would be you actually need a way to set
a velocity for the balls mm-hmm and when
they collide you just want to change the
velocity and have their their own
animation work so the road and this is
where my lack of javafx knowledge comes
in at the moment all that's happening is
that you're setting the end point for a
single sequence this there's only
basically the one keyframe in here set
by the at so saying at two seconds
that's what will happen yeah so so one
way we could do this there's probably
many ways to do this one more way to do
this would be to to set our tick to
maybe we're going to recalculate stuff
every 10 milliseconds 3 20 milliseconds
yeah and then rather than going all the
way to the edge we would just go to the
current value plus our you know green
ball velocity and chills but but let's
just arbitrarily do this well doesn't
have yeah because we can then put the
velocity into the bull bottle as a
second stage yeah
and this one the red red ball starts at
the top right yeah so the Red Bulls
going for the folks out he's going that
way and the green balls going that way
so for us the red balls going that way
the green balls going though okay so the
green ball starts on top left yeah
that's the bottom right yeah the red
boiling starts you start on the bottom
lines i started toasted are at the top
right till crying because you animated
him to arena with ya so he's going down
with zero so you start here you go up
okay okay so will be the X positive and
the y- initially right ok so our
effective velocity is so we're just
doing both the Foley to the moment yeah
let's say we'll see what happens mmm
what's the worst that could happen the
balls will live somewhere right
okay so folks on the stream questions
for Russell and Twitter stream please
this just touch somewhere to start it up
again yeah I just hit the button but the
only button on it uh-huh Steve Jobs
butter this okay findings can't be
casting longer we're being told to use J
box2d for the physics I guess so it's
probably good idea certainly works for
me the the URLs been put up so that's
JFX box2d we'll be looking at that
that's for sure look at that all right
so we're not actually updating the
position we're just removing 5 pixels
and then going back and then moving 5
pixels then going back but ok so retreat
our timing loop is working cool
auto-reverse let's not auto reverse
that's what we don't want to reverse
maybe i'll make it happier just because
reverse happens every every time you get
to the end point yeah we just wanna call
it well notice okay that's not it so we
vibrating it over 20 milliseconds change
x 2x plus 5
cycle count indefinite you're not
actually changing the trip back anyway
no I was relying on the timeline to do
the movement closing track wasn't in
there but at the moment all it does is
decides whether to paint them white or
green or what already are sincere binds
to the why I want to I changes thank you
you're clean okay so the blue the Bulls
data is basically a model on which the
glyph is an observer all right now we're
incrementing all X X plus 5 and let's
game decremented for some reason like it
like the animations reversing okay maybe
add 20 milliseconds oh let's check the
timeline properties and see what we've
had available to us
so our first keyframe should be oh you
know what you know I think it is so the
key frames going to get calculate off
the initial position and it's probably
not going to reevaluate the property to
get the movie so we actually need a real
key frame as what is the ad because that
will give us a key fine but that's what
I should shoot the movie own I think
that's what we might need to do is I
final think we can do this with the
standard key values in Java
because that's it'll calculate initially
what the the two values are it's anime
18 but it won't update later uh-huh so
far we just booze put a call back at
action all the key frame and then I do
the incrementing in the action rather
than as part of the key value right so
if we get a keyframe there should be a
an action on this that we can set on
finish that looks promising
eventhandler blankets finished okay so
add 20 seconds okay so what's the gritty
syntax yeah so as well as the the
suggestion J box too I was also this
idea of using Gradle and javafx so
there's a there a child or FX cradle I
assume as a build system for doing this
well interesting yeah so we can that
probably does all the magical figuring
out where the javafx yes doctors yeah
it'd be nice if you didn't even a
special it was departed jdk please go to
the hizmet that is presumably the chalet
JSOC needs creating passing know maybe I
mean I don't think they need really need
to go JSL working to put in to operate
because it's only to be enough it'll be
open source mm-hmm and part of openjdk
so then I'll be fine alright cool but I
think the main thing was there more very
compatibility with existing apps by
dumping a whole lot of additional
classes on the classpath and them
getting production issues soon makes
sense
and somebody the product management
group who actually knows what they're
talking about all correctly at some
point um miss speaking okay so we need
to we need to point on finished handler
here can we do this where's where's Rose
Andhra we need him for groovy effects oh
if you unfinished is a function that you
can applies oh yeah absolutely and in
there you can put i can put hi flatwork
am I going to get accomplished in there
all right ollie
okay I gotta rent on closure or because
that it gets the right syntax on visa so
you tryin mettler example home finish
I'm finish they take an event handler
okay so this is what we should do
unfinished at 10 milliseconds oh you do
an unfinished call in and then put it in
there yeah so whats there must be a type
involved there somewhere I think it was
like this unfinished unfinished and then
I was just going to print mine they
don't give it typing okay let's try
look
no convince
it works who does next lesson hey
amazing all right and I'm going to dump
all this change stuff in there but in a
different format huh so I going two
balls dark green data objects it's not
going to work should do I guess anyway
so so spoiled having ideas which
actually know what I mean this is quite
thankful sorry don't apologize is not
hey what's the idea which bike to get
proper really supportive that's just not
acceptable and real sport well ehm was
saying that they have a no on the job
gone all right how's that well it's
early progress now we need to set so
sexy but put those put those into a
variable velocity and then when when
they intersect will change the velocity
to be something different ok so we've
learnt array of balls are we do yeah it
sort of right he's actually a hash table
how would you like to do those
velocities velocities an object well I
have to admit I would I'm thinking sort
of nvc ish and so I've gotta be mobile
instance which contains all the
variables that are then observed awesome
what's our radius ok because you need
the radius to know when you're so so if
we put in there a a pair so DX and dy
for now we can make it prettier later DX
dy to represent the the velocity in the
x and y direction so your inputs your
doubles or repair some special variable
at the moment I'm just using individual
fields just because it was quicker okay
DX do you are I guess we can make it
more sophisticated later I'm just
I'm screwing up the indentation your
files so no worries with that's easily
fixed okay so we then need to give them
an initial do do this is a groovy ism
will be on your constructor this that's
right so when you've got parameters that
look like they are in fact a hash sorry
a map then it creates a map and then
writes the values into the null
constructed instance it's just it's just
like Python now why is it using DX and
dy I've invented those because that's
the difference there so if we just
rename those something different so that
X minus other acts the system CX CY yeah
voice for religion yeah yeah wish me
ok and now we want to do this plus equal
to false puckering update about dias
do I yeah
ok
okay and now the balls if we'd
everything right they should still be
doing their thing yeah they should just
go forth because what we've done is
changed the way that hands run anything
about it oh wow we lost the red one x y
y should have been negative 50 it went
the other way so we just plus equals it
yes double negatives yeah a weird full
of off by one error
okay it's another they're disappearing
and now we can do something slightly
more interesting in the collision yeah
so if in the collision when we get
coverage we could change the velocities
and just okay so I guess what we'd
really like to do is we like to get the
so if we know two balls have collided
one of the things you could do is you
get the center of both balls or actually
any point on both balls yeah you can
calculate the angle based on the
position like if you have two balls like
this and you know that those the
radiuses you know that that's the thing
yeah yeah so that'll that'll determine
which side of the balls is touching what
I suggest is to partition it down to the
smallest possible problem is to actually
assume that their point particles ok so
just collide them when they X and wire
as though they were together yeah and
then polish it for proper physics as a
as a next stage so you just assume if we
assume their point particles and they
cried
we're so really what you need to do is
you need to know that the incoming of
velocities of don't I really the outcome
of also gather here yeah so I think
they're coming in there's point
particles you just get what's called
specular reflection yeah such as though
they hit a plane exactly but a plane the
plane is is the perpendicular plane to
the intersection of the end of the two
velocities okay so i could i can
calculate this for an algorithm mm-hmm
probably all these physical libraries
people recommend to do this already
they've already got it yeah but how do
you want to do that well I was just
going to put something quick and simple
in so what's the quicken something is
just to assume that they going to
because they're coming in at 90 degrees
just send them off at 90 degrees okay
sorry what do you want to put here Eric
wasn't sure we could do something really
amusing and just put an arbitrary
numbering some about software so they've
been BAM something weird and wonderful
directions yeah okay let's let's just
make the varsity's random yeah go for it
balls dark greens odd because we're not
going to change your colors now okay so
this is where they so what I'll do is
I'll add its cliff the the model because
the mom no glyph is the actual the green
circle home so she dating you dad around
the velocity
smoke a function of do this first cool
ok and home
no worries it's using real tips which is
quite frustrating yes no worries elbow I
guess so I'm good no promise
what's here that's a real time ok so to
give to give it a random velocity we
want to keep the UM so so our actual or
actual velocity is the square the I just
randomly dumping a DX and dy just to see
what better of it like we can't we're
gonna change the speed as well true if
we change the random DX you want and
that's true so we have a velocity which
is an x and y coordinate what we want to
do is going to get a new random velocity
which has the same speed yeah Chris
speed is just what five square plus 5
squared square root yeah whatever those
yeah coin so the new one so I think what
we want to do is let's change the book
let's change it to be a velocity huh
angle right and then all we have to do
is change the angle this should be
random angle and then we make the angle
a random number ok in our velocity
calculation alright so now for now our
let's just do this for now we're going
to do nothing here just to show you does
nothing because we're going to we're
going to before we actually do this
we're going to test angle velocity so
the pile once we change the other
wonderful angle and we'll change this to
velocity and angle you a fan of radiance
uh I can deal with radians or you like
like you like I can do with degrees
degrees I don't think
all right rather than go saintly here
I'm actually looking to compiling now
this we know have a DX dy to get the DX
and dy component we take the velocity
and I multiply it by the as a groovy
shortcut from the side no Neeson angle I
forget my sine and cosine it's one or
the other yeah you sort out details
later but you get lectured in ever doing
man of things just beyond terrible just
we just claim there's a Higgs boson
entered into the field okay so this is
red red angle side
and this should be current velocity
times cosine of the angle i think sine
and cosine are take radians brother yeah
we will have the math is all
automatically in because it's part of
java ok and then for these now our
worlds your velocity five and i will do
an angle where 0 is 0 is 0 that boy a 1
by 5 wait these guys will go off
somewhere yeah they learn some weird
direction and i wallow justice yeah it's
good for it we don't actually know on
that is some day yeah this is something
in some parts are oh I got something
from poverty goodbye one expected I hear
you token pointy laughter I'm leading 0
/ shouldn't have to it was a double with
the five is a double yeah that's a
frumpy aspect of the National subjects
it's the green one the green one was
good fish and the red one was not the
red one wanting them went in the wrong
direction they went in some direction I
mean pilot problem is I think he's
probably going to be going down from his
position roll it up so if we if we gave
it minus point to try to keep things
between zero and one vote I guess
there's that one spy and radiance
I think one is pie we might have to go a
negative 1 to 10 random number to hit
run because pie is half a circle
regulans still no with us
okay go through a pie that would be one
would be 50 degrees oh let's make sure
our red now it's actually right to do so
no confuse ourselves brother wrote the
song cosine okay we started on the
bottom right okay I gotta do put in the
middle yeah he's good starting him the
start position is his letter down arena
where yeah okay my eyes are green I've
got width and height backwards long way
around some days it's just fortunate
that really hey marina way to the same
so yeah okay perfect hey excellent
question is why wasn't there a test for
it whoa so it's going after them that
direction now I just thought of another
little interesting Ronald so we checked
football collision with each other we
don't check football collision with the
edge that's correct to the moment yes so
if we check from all collision with the
edge to keep the rules in ok so I'm fine
by starting the center because it'll
bounce around for a while cool so our
collision Shack if the two balls green
ball stuck reading of data okay we pick
a random angle if we intersect with the
edge I think we can actually do just
reflection off the edge yes
which is going to be a 90 degree law
again if struck bounced off the edge we
can calculate let's go see what we r
minus point to put soon so I'm thinking
the easiest thing to do look but let's
not worry about veg collisions because
then you have to actually calculate the
bounce right otherwise you get any weird
down six-four you're actually not facing
the middle of it you guys you're just
okay so when we did point to it went
down that way but we might need to do is
strongly point today because that's plus
that's plus specially plus pi or prized
180 degrees
area
no already running
excited
I can nice going that way so y plus
little bit more another point five let's
get that doesn't
well he's definitely going up
so we can get rid of the start them both
off really problem is since we haven't
gotten angles perfect it's not they're
actually going to hit when I add in
reflection off the rules so ok ok so
anyway I think I think we've made some
good progress so if you don't mind we'll
take our changes application rball model
and we'll do a velocity angle walls so
we can change the Durga
exclude good excellent has changes are
in special grab them all right all right
let's go to questions for Russell so
folks watching on the on the live stream
what sort of stuff are you curious about
Russell's work on G pars du du thing
much for Gant anymore probably that's no
i I've grable even hope you well when we
had a meeting there was hance myself
yahan person I'll sir in the garden room
at groovy and grails exchange 2007 well
enhance finally decided there was no way
he could do what he wanted to do again
and started Gradle and in a sense that
was the end of Gant being a build
framework and I think I was right it had
the wrong core in it and I still think
it's useful for some stuff scheduling
and there is spontaneous econ remember
chapter 9 who invented gynt which is
worthless no it's it's actually a
mechanism for doing system tests rather
than unit or integration tests so it
revolves around starting a process and
he uses gank for scheduling in there and
that was nicely aliases and though I
keep finding people i'm doing java
courses and make you say are we are we
using again browse their vehicle who is
out there it's probably a perfect of
course again did have a fork which has
now become the groovy front end to end
in the official and distribution so I
make sure that Gant works it's in the
distribution still but no that's not
being worked on because nobody's putting
any bug reports here we go if you want
if you want to see changes Russell make
changes and Ganz file bugs and not
feature your classes
hahahaha that's some people some people
think of a feature a bug is the future
request is a bug and vice versa mmm all
right so you think we're y'all seem game
for singer I guess we could we just look
at your feeders new features um then it
really is quite a mess out there but
you're welcome to take a look round if
you want it's up to you there's an awful
lot building work out there you saw it
on your way in yeah yeah so it was
interesting alright well we'll leave it
at that then let me check double-check
the stream kill okay looks like no
additional questions for you uh-huh so
we'll call it a day thanks very much for
joining the night packing car has been
opinion thank you and for those of you
on the stream who want to watch future
events I'm going to be interviewing
Stephen colborne tomorrow we'll be
talking about some language stuff I'm
sure who they will have his favorite pet
peeves about everything and then Tricia
in the evening and then after that it's
all other person tomorrow it's gonna
call barn and so it's also least your
sounds like a heck of a busy guy oh no
no actually this tricia and then the
ones in java community after that right
so there's a knowledge AC meeting or yes
and what I'm some stuff in the live
stream that should be fun alright so
thanks everybody for tuning in and I
hope you guys enjoyed this um this
edition of night talking with Russell of
winter and this is a nice evening window
internet wonder will wonder' usually
yeah okay with Russell one it's actually
looking like a bit like night now yeah
it's cuz we all the lights off</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
