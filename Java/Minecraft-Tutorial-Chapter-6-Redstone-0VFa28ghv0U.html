play minecraft this is the sixth video
in my minecraft tutorial series and
today we're going to talk about redstone
let's go into my redstone world now
first what is redstone redstone is a
logical on/off system that can be used
to create elaborate and simple
structures now I'm going to get some
items out that we're going to use to
build something this here is redstone
dust the main component of redstone then
there is a redstone torch I redstone
repeater comparator and a hopper to get
these items you can go to your the
redstone tab in your creative inventory
we're also going to need a chest for
some later things so let's build
something now I'm going to put a
redstone torch and to bed start down
this redstone is on because it's bright
then it's not on it's really dark so on
off on off redstone can go up to 15
blocks before burning out a redstone
torch creates a 15 current or the
strongest current rest i'm going to have
so here we have three blocks 4 5 6 7 8 9
10 11 12 13 14 15 and this red so here
is off now if i wanted to make it go
back to current 15 i could put a
repeater just like in the real world so
the repeater is on now so i have a 15
card so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14
15 and that's off repeaters can also be
set to a certain amount of delay so
right now this is the shortest delay but
i right click on it to make it the
largest delay you can see just a delay
between these two parts turning off and
same thing when it turns on there's also
so order to play settings in between so
this is 12
three and four they get more noticeable
the higher the number is now we're going
to talk about comparators the first
thing you want to know about these is
that they can carry a current array long
distance so this here is the current of
one right then I put three competitors
or even more than that then i have the
same current of one and you see it's a
part of one because this one is off
that's the bit that's one the best thing
about computers the next thing you can
do with them is you can do subtraction
so if I right click on it the torch is
on then this here is the first number
and this is the second number so if I
make the purse over 15 which is the
porch and this one is 13 because 15 14
13 then I'll get an output of two
because 15-13 is to the next thing you
can do with comparators as you can
measure how much stuff is in the chest
or any compared any container really so
here's a chest and use a comparator
pointing away from it then if I take
some say diamond blocks and then I put
some in here so if I put one sack it has
a card of one by another stack there's a
current of two but another staff aren't
still 2 and so on every you every one
fifteenth of the container you add the
current goes up by one because there's
15 possible currents then the last
important thing about comparators is
that they can measure music discs in a
jukebox so if I take these two random
visit desks and I put this down so i put
this comparator down why should i should
make it 215 because you never know what
each music this to be so that's up to 15
let's say i take this first one and put
in there it's at one so this must be the
first music disc
but this one it goes all the way to like
12 so let's last means a disc so i'll
pick these up and i'll break all this is
the last basic western component we're
going to talk about our hoppers which
are my favorite personally if I dig this
hopper and I put it down here and then I
can I draw this 2 jukebox into it go
down to the bottom hopper cuz this
hopper is pointing at that hopper then
if I put a chest here and some more
hoppers fill a jukebox in there it'll go
down to the chest because hoppers can
put things in chest another thing you
can do is they can take things and
chests now chest aren't the only thing
they can take things from they can take
them like furnaces and other containers
but not all so I put the jukebox in
there it'll go down to here the last
thing important about hoppers is if
they're powered by redstone then they
won't give it they won't give anything
but they can still take things so if I
get building materials out then I power
this hopper right here for instance then
I can put the chest into their seem to
work this this feature of hoppers is
kind of buggy so it doesn't work
sometimes if you if you want to learn
more about it you can go to minecraft
wiki and you can do that for any of
these redstone components now we're
going to go on to some to some things I
already built this here is an automatic
chicken farm and here's how it works the
chickens lay eggs which go to the
hoppers and into the mine cart with
chest then the minecrat will chest will
go all the way up here and it'll put
them into the dispenser but till then
fire them back at here and make more
chickens then this this hopper hopper
pulse right here well sometimes
unpowered just pissed in which will open
up and let some chickens fall into the
death chamber where they will the jobs
will go to this chest here sometimes the
minecart stops because some chickens get
in the way so you have to repower it so
i can do is i can put some medicine here
cover it with a torch and then the mine
car goes up without the minecart working
the whole system basically fails and all
the chickens will die now i'm with the
shirts and other things that i made this
here is a redstone elevator so if I you
can see it's all closed right now and
rest up on the pressure plate it'll all
open neck get inside and I'll start
closing and pushing me up sometimes it
gets stuck like this so I have to do is
I have to kill myself to get out of it
there's just no real way to get out then
I have to fly back to it so I'm flying
they're flying like an old bird and then
open up again it's best to not move when
you're going up because otherwise you
can get messed up so here I am at the
top and if I want to go down I can just
press this button and it'll take me down
and when i get to the bottom i only have
about one second to get out so i have to
do it quickly and get up the wiring is
all in the back and the green or lime
wall has the wiring for ascending or
going up and the cyan wool has the
wiring for descending or going down now
i'm going to show you an automatic
furnace so for someone to clear my
inventory and then i'm going to get some
fuel out not feel cool and then some
time in order to be smelted then it says
here to put the peel here so i'll put it
in there and the hopper will take it to
the flat and then I put the diamond ore
in there and the hop roll take it to
this loss and i'll start getting smoked
it then I can stand here and wait for it
to get smelted
looks like it's done so it'll throw it
out and meet this is what I call an
ejector little sense when there's
something in it and then it will fire it
right after that so you can see I told
the doctor basically ejects the item out
now we're going to go back to the
chicken farm so I can prove to you that
it actually works so I'm going to go
down the ladder and you can see here
there's a little bit more than before
not much more because there aren't that
many chickens right now but there is
more so let's summarize what we learned
today we learned about what is redstone
you learn about some basic components
and then we looked at some structures
that I had made this video also
concludes part one of the minecraft
tutorial series in which I taught you
how to play Minecraft part 2 in which
you will learn how to write a minecraft
mod is next thanks for listening and
happy minecrafting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
