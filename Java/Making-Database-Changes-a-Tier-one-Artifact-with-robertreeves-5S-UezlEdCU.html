doing some night hacking interviews we
have our first interviewee here today
Robert Reaves
hello Robert want to introduce yourself
hi I'm Robert Reaves CTO and one of the
co-founders at gadigal so data Cole
maybe you can tell us a little bit about
what data Khalil and what they do okay
sure
well it's a little known secret it's a
real real challenge to update the
database when you release an application
and so what we do is we automate that we
bring DevOps to the database and kind of
like what we've seen application release
automation products like those we our
database release automation that sounds
interesting we talked a little bit about
that before the interview and I saw that
you have a little bit of an intriguing
title I guess maybe you know to pull
people in to see your talk what what's
the deal what's the title share the
title birth well it is making database
changes a tier one artifact and what
we've seen is that there are two paths
to production one for application code
and one for database schema and logic
changes that's inefficient all right
what we need to do is align those
database changes with the application
code changes and have them go through
the same process and and there's a lot
of things you can do to make that happen
data Calandra are just going to talk
about the benefits also it's right after
the happy hour so we're letting people
bring their drinks into the talk so
should get kind of rowdy okay right so I
I did already inquire about those
questions so when does the wine start
and it is at the afternoon break so your
talk is right after the first wine is
open all right that's cool so we were
talking also you were mentioning I think
well you have kind of an interesting way
of talking about things so you said it's
time to bring the database in so how do
you expand on that a little bit what you
meant by that
well I one of my favorite slides in the
presentation is this picture of children
from the distance and they're in a
circle they're playing and in the
foreground is a picture of a
a small child and and what I what I do
is I say oh and here's a picture of a
database administrator being invited to
an agile scrum meeting they're not it's
all the application developers and
testers and all this fun stuff they are
doing cool things and it's fun and our
database administration which frankly
they're in charge of the most valuable
asset that a company has that the data
the transactions who bought what when
and where they're not invited to this
party and frankly they haven't been able
to benefit from things like agile cloud
DevOps and they're getting killed with
changes as we adopt micro services and
containers so our hope is to bring them
in invite him to the party let them know
that they're important they're doing
good things and give them the tools and
ability to succeed and align with the
rest of the company to go as fast that's
actually I like that and then you're
saying else you also talked a little bit
about in terms of the database
administrators how they can kind of be a
bottleneck right in terms of the process
with devops so maybe share a little bit
about that we don't give away too much
because you can always go and watch your
talk but maybe share a little bit about
that for a couple minutes and then we'll
wrap it up sure well I I don't think
they mean to be a bottleneck alright and
nobody wants to be doctor no but
unfortunately with the way sequel is
it's it's a declarative language so they
have to look at things like oh there's a
foreign key and I'm going to go and make
certain that columns in that foreign key
have an index already applied that
that's DBA 101 well it's tough to do and
it's manual and and and those things
wind up being the bottleneck not because
DBA s are trying to be a bad folks they
want to be successful they want to help
the company but that's just the tools
that they've been given and we're going
to talk about how we can fix that what
we can do to speed that process to make
them more successful and frankly get
them to start doing the things that they
really want to do the reason why they
became database administrators in the
first place
alright thanks for sharing that with us
Robert actually I really am very
interested in what you had to say I
think that's a cool concept bringing the
DBA into the team I mean I never really
considered that they were excluded but
being a collaborator myself I agree I
think that's really important to make
them part of the team and I'm curious to
hear more about your talk maybe maybe
I'll join after my first glass of wine
now I out I'll save that for later at
the dinner all right nice to meet you
thanks for joining us all right okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
