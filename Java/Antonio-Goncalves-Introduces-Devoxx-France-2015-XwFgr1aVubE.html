Network and I'm here today at the Vox
France with Antonio Antonio hi hello
everybody from France so Antonio you
have a special theme for devoxx France
this year so tell us about it well in
devoxx France since the video since the
beginning it's our fourth edition and
since day one we wanted to have a key
notes a bit like alloted so 20 minutes
keynotes short ones and you know the
just key notice the speakers that will
make a dream a little bit and this year
when we started to think about our team
of course being 2015 we thought of the
20 years anniversary of java the java
language so we thought a what could we
do about this 20s anniversary and we
thought a you know when we started
coding in java back 20 years ago we
didn't recant think about what will
happen in 20 years time in 95 we started
encoding lines of code and we didn't
know that Java will become what it
became so we wanted to ask our key
notice to push us further into the
future so the theme is in 20 years so we
are asking a bunch of of people to to
you know tell us what will 2035 will be
so we have Brian guts we will be talking
about the Java language in 20 years time
and but also we will have two speakers
that will talk about robots in 20 years
time we'll really have robots at home
will robots will be more intelligent
will they be doing things on their own
because one is will be talking about
robots and curiosity and also we have
people coming from the bitcoins so there
will you know tell us what they think
the currency will be in 20 years time so
you know devoxx is a technical
conference but we like our keynotes to
to make us dream a little bit and this
time it will make us dream in the future
hopefully thank you any thoughts about
what do you think about Java in 20 years
I don't know i will leave Brian goods to
answer this question what I know is Java
knows to reinvent itself you know this
morning I was quickly having a look at
reactive Java so it's quite funny each
time there's there's a new buzzword a
new technology in a different spectrum a
different language bang Java is there
and and knows how to reinvent itself so
I don't know what Java will be in 20
years time I just know it will be there
but in a different shape thank you so
much Antonio thank you for taking the
time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
