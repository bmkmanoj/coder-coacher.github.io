technology Network we're here at devoxx
talking to members of the java community
I have Martain Verburg with me hey
Martine hi how are you I'm doing well
what's your accident were you from I'm
confusing born in Holland raised in New
Zealand and now living in London UK ok
excellent so you are a member of the
london java community that's correct yep
all right things going there very well
we have a really large passionate user
group there about three and a half
thousand members and we run events
almost every night of the week now oh my
god everything from talks to hack
sessions too informal pub meetups it's
incredibly vibrant I now certainly no
longer know everybody in the user group
like I used to when I first helped start
at five years ago and it's just
wonderful to see really it's taken its
own own life wow that's cool and you're
also a java champion yeah very
privileged and honored to be one it was
a group of people I looked up to very
early in my career when I was younger 15
sort of 14 15 years ago so yeah bit of a
shock really when I was offered that
last year but so yeah very nice be
polite reserved well deserved and you're
a big part of the adapter jsr program
yes yeah so um in London we complain a
lot because we sit in a cold damp City
and sit in the pub and Mona lots and we
were asked by the java standards body to
maybe stop complaining so much about the
java standards and actually help do
something about them so we started that
program about two years ago and we
really just trying to provide some
developer developer advocacy for java
standards coming in so but its technical
due diligence and things like that early
on in the process as opposed to it being
all too little and after the fact right
excellent so are you looking at any
particular technologies now are you
looking at eight and giving the feedback
yeah so we've done a lot of work on on
Java right so we've done a lot of heck
days on lambdas for example we had Brian
Gertz actually fly over and work with us
on that one the spec lead for a date and
time is actually
javanese group member Steven Colburn
nice and a couple of other colleagues of
ours Richard Warburton and Jim Goff
helped him finalize that and we're
actually going to hold a one-day
conference early next year for Java nine
and specifically we're going to have all
the sort of large players in OpenJDK
we're also going to invite the large
users of Java in London such as Goldman
Sachs Credit Suisse the National Health
Service the British government is nice
and we're gonna sort of have the two
sides talk to each other and see if we
can help guide where Java nine should go
from from some feedback from consumers
of Java well if I wanted to find out
more about that would that be out on ljc
or um it's on our adopt OpenJDK okay
group which you can find on java.net and
yeah just sign up to the mailing list
we've got a few hundred people on there
and we were organizing it through there
excellent that's pretty exciting so tell
me about the sessions you've done here
so two sessions one on the habits of
highly effective teams and another one
called the bleeding edge and both are
really stories from myself and my team
transitioning from this traditional
large enterprise world into the exciting
world of startups which has been a heck
of a roller coaster rides but well worth
it yeah and yeah so that the habits of
effective teams is really talking about
breaking down all the formal structures
and communication barriers that you have
in large enterprises and I think at one
point I ran into the camera and told all
managers out there if you make your
developers sit in to our meetings you
suck and don't do that subtle yeah well
the engineers are on my mind far too
valuable and the equation power should
be used to make stuff not certain
meetings and doodle on a piece of paper
so good point so give us a tip about an
effective team what have you found at
your startup oh well I guess a practical
things or guess we're talking to an
engineering audience here is take away
manual tasks and make everything
automated so that goes right from you
know deploying your codes or QA
environments to production so use the
all the DevOps tools such as chef puppet
vagrant and the list goes on and on but
also apply that to the rest of your
daily life in your company so don't fill
out timesheets manually don't fill out
expense claims manually use something
like
it's a fire we just take a photo of the
receipt and send it on and any task that
you do that's not part of the core task
of creating cool cool software automate
that away and yeah you'll be a lot less
frustrating minimize your time on the
time on the board yeah lots of great
services out there to help you know so
what's at the bleeding edge the bleeding
edge for us is actually a bit of a move
away from a lot of the java ee
traditional stack our core products so
i'm the CEO of j clarity like a
performance tooling and we it's a hosted
service on the cloud so you've got this
really massively distributed service
which has to be sort of eight and Kronus
message base so we have messages that
get pushed from it from client machines
that run our little demons back to our
host of service and we couldn't do
things like run a Java EU server on our
little on our clients machines right so
that that that whole stack is just
unusable in the space so right we're
using a technology called vertex which
is a java JVM based sort of messaging I
guess you could call it know Jace on
steroids for for the JVM ok yeah and
it's working really well for us and sort
of the usual suspects on the front in so
html5 angularjs that sort of thing and I
mocked up quite a bit now talk yesterday
the bleeding edge due to take a look but
so we are actually using MongoDB as a
vacant ok we're still very much for 350
on MongoDB it has led us down on a
number of occasions but we're we're
hoping it improves well that's life on
the bleeding edge yes you live and learn
well great thanks for coming by i really
appreciate taking a moment to talk to us
and if you want to learn more find out
about the ljc on java.net or check out J
clarity thanks a lot thank you very much
all right five more teen boy
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
