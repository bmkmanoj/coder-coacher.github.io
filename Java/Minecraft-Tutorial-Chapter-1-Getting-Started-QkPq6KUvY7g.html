play minecraft this is the first of
hopefully many videos in which I will
teach you how to play the game and also
how to Madhi so let's get started so
first things first we have to register
an account you have to go to
minecraft.net then click on register and
you get this register link we have to
enter your email and this will be very
important because you'll be using this
to log into minecraft then your password
then confirm the password there will be
some other information you will have to
enter so enter that then click on
register
I've already been disturbed so you have
to look back to minecraft.net and say
login and sign in after you put in your
information in then all you will have to
do is say download now which will bring
you to the download link and this will
be the download for your specific
operating system but you can also show
all the operating systems here so I
already have it downloaded so next thing
I have to do is go to store then you
have to click on this link it won't stay
this it'll say click login or register
to make a premium account but mine is
already premium so this is what it says
and it will cost $26.95 I already have
the launch already so let me go there
now ok so here is where you enter your
email address you use to log to register
and your password then you say play and
then it will start up the actual game so
this here is the main screen of
Minecraft or as single player
multiplayer a few other things and the
version so we're going to talk about the
single player so here we are in single
player and this is a single player main
menu is create new world cancel recreate
and some other stuff which is not really
important right now so we're going to
create a new world there's three or
three modes in Minecraft the first one
that the
primary modes the first one is survival
or you search her resources its crafting
like you have to make stuff and you gain
XP levels and there's health and hunger
so you can die of health or you can die
of losing health or you can die of
starvation and gets it then there's
hardcore which is the same exact thing
silent mode except it is love at the
hardest difficulty and once you die the
game is deleted automatically lastly
there is creative mode or you have
unlimited of everything you have free
flying and you can straw blocks
instantly just one click then here we
have our world naming screen where we
can name it to whatever you want
now I in my opinion the best name is
something relevant to what you're going
to do in the world so here I'm going to
name this demo world and I just like
making the grammar correct
so now we're actually going to create
the world first and make it survival and
to create the world you have to click on
this button here saying create in your
world right now it's building the world
and generating all the blocks and
structures so here I am on this new
world and to move you have to just w4
going forward asks for going backward a
for going left and D for going right and
space for jumping now each world is
different unless you use the same seed
now what is a seed a seed is something
you can enter in the game to make the
world generated a specific way to find
out the seed for your world you have to
open up the chat bar by pressing T and
then type in slash seed which is a
command now a command the iPod output of
a command will come will come where the
is where it says seed and then all the
numbers and yeah that that's what that's
all for seeds and there's also another
helpful command which is slash help so I
open up the chat bar with T again Ivan
slash help Thursday
slip-on it won't work if you have caps
lock / help tells you every single every
single command that you can use in this
game so I will be showing you the
gameplay in the next few videos but for
now let me show you how to quit the game
you have to press escape to get to this
menu here and to quit the game you have
to click on save and quit to title so
let me show you without this and I go
back to the main menu so if you want to
go back to the same game you have to
click on single-player again and then
click on this once click on the demo
world once and then say play selected
world and you'll go back to the world
and everything is totally everything
will be exactly the same so let's
summarize what we did today first we
learned how to create an account and
download the launcher then we learn how
to start the game and create a new world
we also learned about the different game
modes how to quit the world how to
resume the world and some basic controls
thanks for listening and happy
