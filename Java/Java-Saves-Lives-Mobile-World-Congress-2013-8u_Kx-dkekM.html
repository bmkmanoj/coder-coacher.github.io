technology Network we're here on the
floor of Mobile World Congress learning
about Java embedded devices and the
future of mobile i'm here with novena
srini hey Naveen hi naveen is director
of product management in the Java group
so he's got a cool demo that he's going
to show to us so what do you have here
Naveen actually Tori it's a very
interesting demo the you you at home
right and you have a grandmother at home
yes something all the way to Barcelona
aren't you worried about her absolutely
I'm worried about her absolutely
likewise I do have a granny at home and
you know lover to debt and that's what
happens so what we do here is an
interesting demo that actually showcases
how Java from the device to the data
center enables interesting ways and
solving problems real world problems
that we have today ok one area here is
this is a sunspot device that runs java
in a very low footprint on bare metal
and what we have here is this is
actually attached to my granny at home
and the moment she falls down she's
falling down I'm sorry there's an alarm
that goes off automatically exactly but
what it does it waits it waits for it to
actually turn up and sees whether she
can pick herself up you give her a
minute because you know she might just
accidentally fall it could be just a
false alarm right but you actually
notice no she's fallen down and it looks
serious and then luck goes off ok an
alarm goes off because granny fell down
exactly and what it does it sends a
message to the data center to the
Gateway here which has java embedded
suite here which is essentially a
middleware a lightweight middleware for
embedded devices ok it automatically
goes from the sensor to the gateway and
sends the message out to the data center
through the Gateway to the data center
where an another goes out to the local
hospital they're saying hey an aged
person is needs attention and an
ambulance is sent ok apparently it also
sends the credential to the ambulance so
that the ambulance gets temporary access
to the door other the person can't open
the door around Oh interesting ok here
you have an NFC reader at the door and
the moment the ambulance tones up and
the person comes in here
well uh the door is open and the person
comes in walks in dix karo granny fix
her up takes it to the hospital and all
12 okay so this is a whole thing from
the sensor to the gateway to the data
sent to to the data center to the
ambulance so the ambulance has access to
get inside the home exactly Wow and it's
all done through java's on the base
right and what they also does shoot the
interesting statistics and when the door
was left open on this on any output on
any device and any tablet of your choice
and what shows you statistics on how you
know you've seen when the dough has been
lost open how many successful attempts
as it made how many unsuccessful
attempts have been made what is the time
between last response and current
response and while that's happening it
also helps you actually add control its
and you know access control to other
people there by using Java card as a
dual authentication layer okay so this
is Java car yes what happens if you meet
some new someone new here and you invite
them home saying go take care of my
grandmother while I'm there right the
person can doesn't have to be with you
the person game going from other part of
city where you give them grant them
access to that and that person get
accident okay so they have the card you
give them authorization they can get
into the house exactly cool certainly
java makes the difference across lives
so Java saves lives excellent so thank
you Naveen this is very interesting so
we're here on the floor of Mobile World
Congress you can get more information
about Java and devices at the Oracle
technology Network thank you thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
