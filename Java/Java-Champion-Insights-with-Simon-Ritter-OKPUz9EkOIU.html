with the otn advocacy team and I manage
the Java champion program and I'm here
joined with a fairly recent Java
champion what's right Simon Ritter so
welcome and thank you for joining me
thank you and just here trying to kind
of help the world know a little bit more
about who and what the java champions do
for the java community ok so can you
maybe tell me what do you do for your
day job right so my day job is working
for Azul systems where I am the deputy
CTO Knox ETO deputy CT apt ok yes sorry
I described as being the understudy to
the real CTF ok but large part of my job
is is about actually interacting with
the java community because as all as a
company whose whose business is java you
know we produce java virtual machines we
have commercial one which is designed
for low latency applications big memory
applications and then we do also build
at the oakland jdk which we provide a
zulu free downloads them still support
contracts around that so our business is
all about java and a lot of what we want
to do is to work with the community
because we understand the value of the
community in terms of you know all of
the different aspects of java from
specifications development all of these
things so a lot of what I do is coming
to conferences like this presenting I
just did a quickie session at lunchtime
on lambdas in jdk 8 but not lambdas as
you would use them in any real-world
application it was I described it as its
John the gym but not as we know it and
it was completely off the sort of radar
kind of typing lambdas but then I also
got a bought this evening where I'm
going to talk about streams and good the
bad and the ugly so that's a bit more
practical and helping people understand
more about how to use strings
effectively and I'm going to get Stuart
remarks to help me with that who's one
of the you know the streams engineers
from Oracle dr. deprecated ER doc did
every day yes and so you kind of touched
down a little bit you know the java
champions are all about you're not just
experts in luminaries but you also do
give back to the java community yes you
know what do you find yourself doing to
do
yeah I mean there's a whole range of
things and one of because you come to
content conferences like this another
great thing is being able to interact
with jugs so the Java user groups and
that kind of helps get out and two more
the grassroots people who are involved
in Java and again you know presentations
talking to people you know they do a
reasonable manner blogging getting
information out to people tweeting the
usual sort of social media things really
just finding any way that we can to
interact with community and help to
promote Java not so much as a sort of
commercial thing but promoting Java so
that people get the most out of it and
it's really helping them with their
careers because you know once they
understand more about a particular thing
in Java then it helps them from a career
perspective as well yeah I you know I
came from Sun but I'm definitely
learning over and over again that you
know the java community is very
passionate and it is yes yeah it's a
great community part of absolutely yes I
mean it I gotta say it's a favorite part
of my job in this job favorite part when
I was working for oracle favorite part
when i was working for sun was going to
Java user groups because you know you go
and do a presentation and you turn up at
like seven o'clock in the evening or you
turn up on a Saturday morning and there
are people there actually want to listen
to you and you think how is this
possible you know is like they're giving
up their free time to come and listen to
me talk about Java and you're not
driving in with any no well maybe some
t-shirts sometimes and you know pizza
and beer yes cheers Cheers oh I do like
Belgium bin that was the whole reason
for the term yes well thank you so much
for your time and for all the
contributions you make to the java
community okay great thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
