javaone where we've just finished
announcing the ninth annual Dukes Choice
Award winners and I'm excited to have
Baruch here with me from J frog hi hi so
congratulations Jay frog has been
awarded the innovative tools for
developers category this year sober tell
us more about artifactory and what
you're doing for developers thank you
it's been very excited to get this world
and we're flattered and honored with it
the interesting thing about it juki
worked as the community is the community
world and our two is being driven by the
community from day one well actually the
need for the tool came from the
developers we ourself working then time
in services company and our customers
suffered without something that will
manage the binaries efficiently so we
just came indeed it it started with the
developers from the developers and for
the developers and that's the that's the
place we stayed now and we're really
excited and proud to be here yeah tell
us where we know this is actually the
first binary manager and so what is it
that it actually enables developers to
do and how is it that you're making
their lives easier well this tool is
about controlling the binaries that the
team in the in the company uses
introduces so as the source control
manage the source code the binary
repository manager manages the binaries
we since we are oriented towards the
bynars and not towards the source from
day one we are being able to do very
smart stuff with it like meta data like
correct structures and being smart about
how to manage and how to use those
binaries that's great so again
congratulations on this important win
and we enjoyed having you this week at
javaone and we hope to see you back here

thanked
