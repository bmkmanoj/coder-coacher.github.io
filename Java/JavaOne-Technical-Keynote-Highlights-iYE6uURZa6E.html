say that observed that 2014 2014 has
been a banner year for Java Java ME 8
has shipped java SE ate his shipped and
work on Java EE eight is now well
underway the key to javas success and
it's motivating goal ever since has been
to improve developer productivity by
addressing real-world problems in a
practical approachable language and
platform lambdas may look like just
another language feature in reality
they're going to have a huge impact on
the way we program they're going to have
a huge impact on library design which
enables us in turn to write user code
which is more readable more reliable
more expressive and more performance and
a lot more fun to read and write with
the next version of coherence with a
Java right we basically allow you to use
out-of-the-box language features like
streams and lambdas on top of coherence
infrastructure we've been working on a
unified solution to these problems for a
while now and that's in project jigsaw
which is currently slated for Java nine
so the goal of jigsaw is to define a
standard model system for the Java
platform and use that to modularize the
platform itself and also applications
not just cover SE applications but also
Java EE applications eventually
