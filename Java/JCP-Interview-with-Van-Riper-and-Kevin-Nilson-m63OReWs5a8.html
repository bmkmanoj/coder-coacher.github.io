co-hosting the event and really happy
that Oracle kind of stepped in and asked
us to invite several of our members and
the event tonight's going great awesome
yeah I mean anything man this has been
it's quite an upgrade I've from our
usual pizza and salad it's been a great
event and having people it's like james
gosling in the audience is a real plus
alright so for both of you who's your
favorite JCP member wow that's enough
that's a tough I don't know Steve I you
know there's a lot of names out there I
could think of but I guess it's van
sitting here all pick van is my favorite
JCT know why I could see that yeah yeah
and van what about you you know I'm
gonna get serious for a moment i was on
the ec for about a year representing
google and there was one member that i
really wasn't i me not i I was
appreciated all the members but one
member i particularly was impressed by
his passion and dedication to what we
were doing in the JCP was was Gil guilty
so I had to choose one that would be
mine Wow yeah no guilt a great guy he's
actually been interviewed on the the
night hacking program several times and
he always amazes me that you know he's
one of those people who knows a lot more
than I do
you don't put me in that category Steve
you know more than I do well there we go
he's also he's a lot more than is that
that's not I mean it's true he knows a
lot but I was really speaking about his
commitment to the community aspect of
the JC yeah yeah now he's really good
but earlier he he went with us to
support java on Brazil and he was
helping us with presenting at that event
really passionate about helping the
community and the user groups and he
travels around the world ya know he's a
great guy so good choice and then all
right so second question what were you
guys doing when the JCP was founded in
nineteen ninety nine Wow in 1999 so I
was in college just kind of studying
computer science yeah doesn't so
exciting yeah most of my coursework at
the time was was in c and c++ so no
actually dummy very little java in my
university studies and then after
graduating in two thousand one went out
and did java certification and that's
where later started my career early
doing java yeah okay so we must be about
the same age that's scary who looks
older man yeah you whippersnappers sorry
so I was actually doing C++ programming
since the early 90s and in 1999 actually
it's funny story is when i started doing
java so end of 98 I left Adobe I have
been doing a c++ development on a
program called Adobe page mill which is
a web authoring tool yeah and I decided
at that point that I took a little time
off at the end of 98 and then I sided at
the beginning of a nineteen eighty-nine
that I wanted to start doing web
development myself so but I didn't want
to do it in C++ so I actually picked up
a book on how to go from for a C or C++
programmer to learn java I taught myself
java and i got my first startup job at a
company called like carrion
a few months later in the in February
March time for a 19 regulo had some good
books her learning java proceed
developers yes I actually started
learning java at the beam 99 taught
myself and got my first startup job
doing java web development cool yeah
then you know I'll answer the question
since I poke both of you guys yeah I was
think I was still at University almost
graduated and I was working on sheets
sorry could you say that again she's I
was working on the sheets hypertext
environment for editing text and
structure it was a it was a university
project for a job ID yeah i remember in
two thousand not in 99 but i do remember
in two thousand i had one course where i
did a little bit of a swing work with
visual cafe and that was kind of
interesting yeah we couldn't deal with
swing that was too slow we had to write
all of our local routines ourselves yeah
it may have been a WT I don't I don't
remember but that's about swing was
about two thousand I think yeah about no
yeah okay call her so of course do you
guys get prizes I'm assuming you don't
want your book back trying to get rid of
those wine we will take a look you guys
should both take your night hack a
laptop stickers yeah you know and I can
we remember the the event for the
10-year anniversary that we co-host in
here cuz i'm already looking forward to
the 20th anniversary yeah yeah it'll
it'll be over in no time it will feel
even older and moreover hell we can
