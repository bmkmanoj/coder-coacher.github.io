well we have really from a Content
perspective some really exciting stuff
which we call startups in Belgium and in
Europe in general we really have a
problem finding like venture capital
angels even banks etc here if you're
young developer you have a great idea
wouldn't it be great if you could come
to delphox and actually see and hear
from real experts who actually run VCS
oor angels or even banks we have
actually eng which is a platinum sponsor
they actually have a talk for startups
explaining you know what they need to do
if they you're looking for some capital
and so on and so we have a really nice
story on Thursday it's in room free all
sequential talks all about even founders
like do you get money or do you grow
organically do you talk with feces what
are the things you need to think about
from a contract perspective so there's
some really very valuable information
and that's a new fig so it's a bit of a
gamble I don't know how many developers
will be going there but personally just
the fact that everything is recorded
that will just be great to share with
the young developers and even even all
their developers who starting a start-up
so that's that's the first one another
really cool new concept is the
playground it's actually on my left here
in the exhibition floor and the
playground is really the Internet of
Things playground it's like you know
toys for boys the 3d printing is really
interesting I mean there's an even
Michael who's here to actually give a
talk about javafx and you can actually
develop codes and then print that codes
which are basically 3d models life on
that printer so that's going to be
really interesting to see how people
behave we already got some really great
response on that we have the Lego
Mindstorms we have raspberry PI's and
Arduino zwi even have an Internet of
Things shop where you can buy all these
goodies with you when you're really into
this and the other one we have is of
course the hacker garden the hacker
garden still really worth mentioning
because we have so many open-source
developers here where they actually sit
on the round table they share their
knowledge and then developers can
actually look into certain bugs they
want to fix or even help with the source
broke with the open source project
itself
and really create and create a synergy
between developers and open source
initiators and then something really
brand-new is an ID we got from a Java
one which is called ignite talks ignite
talks already exist before java one but
that's where I experiment I experienced
it for the first time and so what are
ignite Oaks these are five minute talks
and the slide your presentation is a
slide deck and every 15 seconds the
slide changes and so a red gupta was
like all we need to have this a job at
devoxx we need to have these at devoxx
but i was going like well where do we do
this we use every square meter so we had
to like look into the disk edgell and we
found the the lunch breaks so during the
lunch on Wednesday and Thursday we have
about a one hour break you can actually
go to the buff rooms which are next to
the reception and you can actually
experience about 20 ignite talks and not
all of them are technical so there's
really people talking about passionate
things that they're working on and for
example we have actually Peter and
Michael talking about their defects hunt
game so what is it about well first of
all Alex from voxel he came at one of
our steering meetings and he showed this
bluetooth low energy device and it's a
beacon it sends a Bluetooth signal and
it has like certain devices have like a
battery which last 22 years and he came
with that and we gotta all we have to do
something with this so then Mike see
here's a bitter crotona David like yeah
we can totally build mobile apps for
that Android and iOS you harvested yeah
I'll do the Java EE back end so we have
a nice back end Hunt's helped with some
rest api's and so before you know we had
a small task force building a devil's
hands game so how does it work I
actually bought 160 beacons we spread
them in the venue we spread them in pubs
we spread them in museums and so on we
even actually are giving beacons to some
rockstar speakers and they're running
around in the venue so people can hunt
down that signal and so the application
allows you to actually or search for the
beacons in your area you need to
actually have a proximity so you need to
really come
close to that beacon and then you can
unlock it and every achievement we have
about 49 achievements every achievement
has a very nice icon cartoonish style
and it gives you points and what's
really nice is that because of those
points we create a leaderboard and it
basically gave me files your experience
at devoxx and people are loving it I
mean there are already people like
hating me because they're saying like
man I'm not going to sessions anymore
I'm actually just hunting beacons all
day right but this will definitely give
a new dimension to the the whole devoxx
is very experienced so that's a bit I
think the new things at devoxx we were
again sold out as many years before but
I think you know the hunt game the
ignite sessions the playground the
startup talks and the hiker garden there
are definitely things you need to check
out so enjoy def Fox and hopefully we'll
see each other again next year as well
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
