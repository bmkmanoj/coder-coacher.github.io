history and tragic fate of Sun is gun
safe and then Paul is going to discuss
some of the potential replacements for
at least some uses of sunless gun safe
how many people people in this room have
not ever written code to use sunless gun
safe Oh more than I would have expected
okay well I I don't think I need to
explain to this audience what what Sun
misc unsafe is but you might be
interested in in a little bit of its
history so it's really meant to be it's
just a low level VM library interface
designed strictly for use within the JDK
you know this is a fairly common thing
to find in advanced language
implementations that are implemented you
know partly in a low-level language and
partly in themselves and it should be no
surprise that Java has one of these two
it originated we originally introduced
it in the 1.4 release it was used for
there there was a big rewrite as some of
us may recall of the entire row of all
the reflection machinery which
previously had been just massive
quantities of j'ni code and very slow
there's a big great rewrite of
reflection we also used it to speed up
the serialization and it was used for
the the direct buffer code in new i/o in
Java 5 it was extended further being a
principally to support jsr 166 Java util
concurrent the atomic and lakhs some
packages that's when you have things
like parking on Park appeared it was
also used for other things for corporate
performance for the 5 people who care
about corporate performance Nativity
scaled font cache and low-level x11
interface any of it the x11 interface
for AWT you know again was originally
written as a bunch of j'ni calls against
X Lib which is slow for the obvious
reasons so we read it all back with with
unsafe and that was a big improvement in
Java 6 more stuff in Java util
concurrent's it was also used to speed
up some some crypto algorithms Java 7
more lots more stuff
java.util concurrent and some other
stuffs other other performance work Java
math big decimal and big integer were
sped up substantially by using some
unsafe primitives java.lang invoke
method handles of course used unsafe 2d
rendering buffers and you know load
average for JMX you know why is that
unsafe well yeah it was a convenient
place to put it it's not actually it's
not actually unsafe and neither is some
of the other stuff in it safe to be true
to be honest and in Java oh whoa
yet more job use concurrent stuff and
it's also used in the Mac OS Objective C
bridge I may have missed a few uses but
this was you know an hour of reppin
through our archival source code
repository repositories to figure it out
so like all api's in sun dot star
packages some misc unsafe was never
intended for external use we tried to
discourage this we had this this page
was originally created on Java dot Sun
calm this is the Wayback Machine
February 15 1998 I think I think it was
actually created a bit before that but
this is the earliest snapshot on the
wayback machine yet why developers
should not write programs that call some
packages you know they are not part of
the supported public Java interface did
this stop people
no of course it didn't we did other
things we tried to make it at least a
little bit hard to use by putting up a
roadblock but with the language that we
had that we have now still there's only
so much we can do so there's this little
hack which all admit responsibility for
and hardcourt coded names in the VM
right so that make it well just a bit
hard to get at unsafe you have to either
put your coat on the boot class path or
you have to do the following by now
well-known hack you know this is all
over Stack Overflow you know class for
name son miss gunns save get the
declared field make it accessible and
boom you're off to the races you know as
you know the mere cost of this code plus
a compiler warning which of course you
can also turn off if you really want
with - XD ignore symbols file true
however you know so so this is this was
you know it was possible to use this
outside that was a bad thing but it was
also in some ways a good thing right the
work on java.util concurrent done by by
Doug Lee and his collaborators some of
whom were in this room you know this
after its initial release oh java.util
concurrent continued to evolve outside
and this was possible because son miss
gun safe was accessible at you know a
fair at a fairly low price and it was ok
right because well we trust Doug so it's
OK for Doug to use something that's gun
safe in the JDK but in fact some miss
gun safe was also used outside the JDK
it's been used by a number of projects
to do things that would be very
difficult if not just completely
impossible to do outside of the JDK is
this a bad thing well it's kind of risky
to base your business on an unstable
unsupported API but I think on that net
it's actually a good thing it shows you
it shows us how to push the platform
forward and demonstrates what can be
done if you take the platform as it's
officially defined and then add just a
little bit of unsafe stuff so I think
that that's been healthy for the overall
ecosystem so you know and some of you
send this gun safe it's it's an unsafe
abstraction extremely unsafe abstraction
for building better faster safe
abstractions and it's ok
you know it's use is okay in some
informal sense when it's in the hands of
expert developers now despite all this
son miss gun safe has been and continues
to be an ongoing burden it's been a
burden for a number of reasons one is
like any API internal or otherwise it's
been abused it's been misused
there are 379 results as of yesterday
on Stack Overflow people asking you know
well-meaning but maybe naive developers
asking how do I use send miss gun safe
to solve you know this problem I hear
it's really cool and powerful and I can
do need stuff with it so they're you
know they're you know we're scrolling
through this is is fairly entertaining
here's here's an example how can I free
memory using using Sun Miss gun safe you
know here well here's the idiom again
how to get how to get the unsafe object
and I'm gonna a legate something and
omit how do I work with how do I get the
address to free maybe I use the hash
code we all know where this leads
so aside from this which is just kind of
a you know an ongoing cost me in the
overall ecosystem well it's a security
issue you know the fact that that Sun is
gun safe is there that it's fairly
easily accessible that it's trivially
accessible by any code in inside the JDK
itself makes a real a strong defense
in-depth strategy harder and that's one
of our key strategies for making the
platform more secure is to have you know
more than one boundary around powerful
operations and if if it's that easy to
get to well what you know if you could
if you can if you can leverage a few
vulnerabilities to get in inside the jdk
code then well some its gun safe you you
now have all the power you could
possibly want and there's also just the
the ongoing maintenance burden so the
and there's a maintenance burden borne
not just by those of us who work on the
jdk itself but also just the general you
know the developers out in the world
many developers wind up using unsafe and
they don't even know it right you you
build an application you use you use
maven you download half the internet
from maven central and you lo and behold
you know fifteen jar files down from
your actual code there's something that
uses unsafe you don't even know about it
now unsafe is an unstable unsupported
API if it changes your application is
gonna break when that happens are you
gonna are you believe even know that
that jar file fifteen levels down is the
problem no you probably won't and who
are you going to blame you're going to
blame
the implementers of your Java Runtime
you're not going to blame the author of
that library so because of that kind of
factor that has made those of us who
work on the JDK fairly reluctant to
evolve some this gun safe you need to
remove things in it that aren't they
aren't needed inside the JDK anymore or
change the behavior of existing things
and because we've been reluctant to
change it has become almost a de facto
standard thing and then more people
start relying on it and we get where you
get sucked into this whirlpool of
dependence where where it's frozen and
we can never evolve it so how do we
escape this vortex in jdk 9 as part of
project jigsaw we are going to move most
internal api's inside module boundaries
so there will be strongly encapsulated
they will not be accessible most of them
even with the set accessible trick you
you won't even be able to get to them by
a reflection with the one exception that
if you're willing to use a command line
flag you can override that and that's it
in the long run this is what we want to
do with all internal api's and this this
is what we want to do with some is gun
safe we've been saying for a while now
that we would do this with sundnes gun
safe in jdk 9 that has never actually
been the plan the actual plan is this so
the fate of some miss gun safe this is
in in JEP 260 which I published last
week is as follows in JDK 9 it will be
available to code on the class path by
default it will be available to code in
modules by request if you decide to put
your code in a module you can declare
that that module requires requires the
module that contains Sun this gun safe
and you can continue to use it but
you'll be aware that you're using it it
will not be further enhanced and over
time broadly used functionality and Sun
this gun safe will be migrated to safer
supported api's some of which Paul will
discuss
a few moments so here's the here's the
recipe for for what will happen in which
release in a particular JDK release call
it n if a supported replacement for an
unsafe method exists in the previous
release and minus 1 then we will
encapsulate or remove that method in
release n so you've got a review about
one release to figure it out if a
replacement for a method exists in that
release we will deprecated that unsafe
method in in that release and we might
even deprecated it with a new even
stronger deprecated deprecation tag
that's even more annoying
once replacements for all unsafe methods
exist in the previous release some miss
gun safe will be removed gone so you
know whether whether whether the value
of n here is is 10 11 or 12 I will leave
to the future well that will not attempt
to predict that going forward there will
canoe we will continue to have interim
internal api's that are deeply in bed
with a vm that yes sorry Marcus there
will be additional hard-coded names in
the VM we will place them in packages
with the whose name is prefixed with JDK
internal these will be encapsulated you
will not be able to get at their
internals except by a command line flag
and that's that's intentional we want we
want people to be aware of when they're
using this we would like for people to
be responsible when they use it we can't
force responsibility we can we can only
encourage it but we can at least make
everyone whether they're an expert
developer or not aware of when they're
using its on this gun safe so the
command line flag is by design a little
bit ugly but it works just a second
Jeremy ok so as with sunless gun safe
these these internal things will be
unsupported they will be subject to
change without notice but you will be
able to get to them question
German
open to other suggestions so it's it's
it's it's really about being explicit
and making sure that people understand
when they are building a house or a
skyscraper on shifting sands well if
they're if they're running code if for
example you know they're in DevOps or
something well they're probably
responsible for keeping that code
running and it's arguably a good thing
for them to know that well when they
drop in and drop in the next JDK update
release something might break and that
might be why we use it in various places
in JRuby
but we've always but you know I
understand you know users don't know
about that but I think it's it's
irresponsible that so many of these
libraries have not had
but it's all one repo so it's easy to
change isn't isn't open-source so we've
considered various alternatives you
certainly open to other suggestions I
mean when obvious one is well you just
print a warning every time but
historically we've never printed we've
never had the runtime print warnings and
this so that there there's always been a
been a certain resistance to that so
there are more questions cliff
so basically just accept that we're
trapped in the vortex n' and be done
yeah
so what Paul has has stuff to talk about
as well so we're gonna have workshop
time after this we can get get into this
in further depth for now let me let me
just leave you with the notice that yeah
you shouldn't believe a word I said and
I didn't make those images thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
