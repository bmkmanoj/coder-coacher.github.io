talk I'm pull for Oracle I mostly hack
encore libs and I occasionally dip my
toes down the rabbit hole into the M and
stuff like that and scramble back up and
have someone else to help me out and
learn so I'm in danger of seg ving this
talk so I'm going to overflow but I said
a trap in for the workshop later so we
can either continue if I run out of time
or we can deep dive into issues and any
slides I skip over we can go into more
detail in the workshop and continues the
discussions we've had already on there
and also there's a legal safety too
we've got to be careful about that
here's a rubber astute observation if
nothing else works a total pigheaded
unwillingness to look the facts in the
face will see us through that is from
general sir anthony sessle hug me melt
from Blackadder and to some extent this
is true because as Mark said it's an
internal detailed developers haven't
been ignoring this fact and to prepare
to be fair we have to a bit and yet to
some extent this is seen as fruit as
chris has said and as cliff has said
there yes we have a peek and poke thing
people can do this it sees them through
we get stuff done but you know we can do
a lot better than this going forward
into the future we can start to
strengthen the platform make it more
safe introduce safe public API is it do
a better job an unsafe to and then we
can start optimizing under the covers a
lot better than we do today for example
unsafe forces layout representation so
forth like that when you pick and poke
at memory you don't necessarily know
that you're peeking and poking at a
final field and stuff like this it makes
us harder to optimize the platform so I
think we can categorize the use cases of
unsafe into four broad general
categories so we have sort of an
enhanced atomic access here people use
compare-and-swap and all sorts of stuff
like this we have stuff that like
interoperate across the JVM boundary
people use get put Jay and I efficient
memory layout and access
people use allocate free memory put gate
they want to hide from the GC and stuff
like this i think there's lots of other
use cases too but these are the four
sort of broad categories that people do
like serialization mocking proxying i
would include in that where people use
allocate instance and another one here
the two are almost identical but subtly
different and we can map these use cases
to features so we have say enhanced
atomic access i'll be talking about
variable handles here we have
interoperate across the JVM boundary so
this is project panama forum function
interface we've already talked about
this and there's efficient memory layout
and access so that covers project Panama
project Hal Valhalla arrays 20 so damn
talked a bit about this earlier Brian
will talk about this as well it all fits
into this picture of how we can move
away from unsafe with these types of
features and there's a nearer term focus
so we can tackle some of these use cases
now and we can tackle some of these use
cases later so the things I'm going to
focus on on these things and in terms of
the efficient memory layout and access
I'm going to talk about a few small
things around the ray bounced checks and
array access which I would like to use
here and in other places as well so as a
replacement strategy here is that I want
to hunt for the writing hotspot
intrinsic most general one I can reuse
in lots of little other places and
you've seen that applied to what
bladimir talked about with lambda forms
is a very nice divided between the JVM
and the JD Kayla and I'm trying to find
little sweet spots for what I want to do
here so I'm going to skip these changes
except one we talked about these in more
detail some methods have already been
added to unsafe by Red Hat's Andrew
Haley these are get and put unaligned
methods and the leveraging byte buffers
to improve the performance and byte
buffers so if you're interested to have
a look at those essentially their
intrinsic but a lineup if you're on an
unaligned architecture to the normal
guess and puts but if you're on an
aligned architecture like spark it drops
down into little branchy code that's
actually a nice way to use these methods
rather than having to handle this
yourself
so I'm going to a bit about array bounds
checks there's a number of small things
we can do around here to improve arrays
they've been a bit of languishing we
haven't given it enough attention and
care I don't think over overtime there's
one issue that's been hanging around for
a while let Chris mop fixed ages ago in
a patch there it is we're going to try
and get bail in strength bounced checks
on stuff so we can improve bounced
checks in for joining and so forth like
this and then there's a some work that
Roland's doing we can add a raise check
index intrinsic which sort of tells the
hot spot yet what you're looking at this
index is assigned int but what we really
want to do is make it look like an
unsigned thing when we're doing checks
and then we can perhaps do you see the
buffer check index fits in there that's
a hot spot intrinsic and as part of that
we can improve scale calculations for
array access when you're using unsafe so
we can get some nice tight code when
we're doing hot loops some checks are
really tricky to optimize fo there was a
good example on Valhalla around l max
and disrupters ring buffer which
essentially pads the buffer at two ends
and it's really hard to optimize those
kinds of checks out what they really
want is contended arrays how many people
would like contender to raise here
nobody someone would what we really want
to say is perhaps allocate an array on a
cache line boundary in this particular
cases perhaps we need something like
that it's useful in for joining it'd be
useful for Almack's disruptor but Doug
pointed me to if you really want to go
to town on the ray bounced checks this
language x10 as good to look at for
inspiration and maybe we can learn some
stuff around applying that for a OT but
also if we had real final fields perhaps
we could do a better job on these types
of stuff too so a Ramos match what I
like to do is add an intrinsic for an
array mismatch method and we can get
reasonably far developing that using
unsafe and we can get further leveraging
vector extensions in the future but
I will show you in a moment and that is
essentially the building block that we
can use to build up arrays equals and
lexa graphical comparison the Vista
let's graph array lexicographical person
is a bit of a meme going for you see it
in Apache Cassandra in all these other
places and they're all doing it the same
way and they've all made the same
mistake in a sense because it all works
on x86 fine but depending on what
version of hotspot using it might have
crashed on spark I might get really slow
on spot because Sparks and the lined
architecture and it doesn't support it
this is I knew you'd say that I can't
possibly say that but it's but I think
on arm as well if you get into bedded
I'm 64 I thinks okay but there's other
architectures will come along as well
where this goes in so the principle
still applies but yes if we have this
method in there we can GC particular
intrinsic for arrays equals the
character string equals compared to
perhaps we can GC those so we're making
it more general and more usable in other
places and then perhaps we can consider
using it for equals compare of managing
directors so we can improve those cases
too so here's an example of what it
looks like there's a vectorized mismatch
mesh effort here it takes an object
which is actually an array but we don't
have a super type 4 array yet see John's
talk after tomorrow I think we have an
offset into it and in love Arabian
offset and a length and the log 2 of the
array index scale we're talking about
here so essentially we're doing
something but very common pattern that
people have been doing using unsafe
which is looping over this as Long's we
check if the two values are we are not
equal here and we do some bit twiddling
and pop out an index positive index and
if it if we don't find a mismatch here
what we do is we turn 1 plus negation of
how many elements in the array to look
at they're pretty simple stuff and we
can add another unsafe method on top of
there which is Java which uses this
after a certain threshold if not it
bombs out here and then we can actually
implement I compare unsigned in a race
like the
and then you see we we if we get it if
we get a positive value here we we can
peg bites and signs of always return
later than that that works and we could
do that for bite we can do that for char
short and so forth like that and we can
do it belongs as well so the question is
if I implement this long using this and
I compare it to equals using the simple
thing does the code other to performance
but to the same what do you think which
one's faster which on slower well it
turns out unsafe there's not as fast as
people think it is this is the
misconception it's been optimized in
some areas and it's not been optimized
in other areas so the loop you see we're
doing two reads here of Long's and a
compare and a branch and a compared so
this is a little snippet of the unrolled
loop here in the assembly this is about
as fast as you can get this is pretty
neat if you're just using Long's but
there's a bit of sort of slop if you
like coming in here it's tracking is
tracking the sort of index in the
unrolled loop so that it when it when it
breaks out at the same location it can
return the mismatched index based from
its current offset essentially so it's a
bunch of code here and that makes that
makes a difference if you're really
interested in performance so the magic
thing to do here is pick my other
intrinsic that Rowling wrote for me and
stuff it in here bit of Magda pixie dust
and then you get almost the same code
popping out but that check index
intrinsic gives enough to hotspot just
to ensure that things get nice nicely
read if you notice here that the the
branching slightly different because
we've got to recover the index mismatch
index back from there but since this is
equals hot spots not smart enough to
know all you need to know is break out
the loop and you shouldn't have to trap
this and maybe there's other
optimizations rather than if it's
possible going down a rabbit hole to see
but there's tricks we can do with this
with bits of intrinsic bix the building
blocks to improve the situation I got
some performance results here as someone
said earlier there lies so don't have
believe me but I did some measurements
here comparing Long's based on sizes
here you see the greens are long
comparing of a speed up based over a
loop and you see the speed up for when
you're doing long as it's exactly the
same that's what you would expect and
four bites it ramps up as the fixed
costs of the array mismatch mess or
overcome so the question is can we get
bites faster in the future what happens
when we make Vallon intrinsic and use
AVX instructions like 256 or 512 that
method is there so we can actually
intrinsic aight in the future and get
even faster and we should get faster
there too so c2 looks good see 21 so you
want anyone care about see one no should
we so they bother optimizing for it and
the interpreter slow so I got to do some
more work here to see if this is a
viable solution if I don't intrinsic I
the method and as a future here around
vectorization perhaps week the next
iteration here is perhaps we can in GC
that particular thing and then move to
some form of safe and safe vectorization
API in the future and and get better
perform and more usability in all sorts
of other cases too and I think that's
probably could be a key thing for arrays
20 and stuff like that in the future
wait hands how that would work out but I
think that's very interesting direction
to take okay so variable handles if you
go to this issue here you can go it will
give you links to go to a sandbox to get
the source code and play with this and
check it out if you want to play so the
current situation is we got relaxed
mostly atomic volatile atomic get put
fuel byte codes so forth like this and
we got the java.util concurrent star
classes which operate on long an object
and arrays of how many people use these
classes good how many people would
prefer to use unsafe as opposed to those
classes both depending on your
performance requirements essentially is
yes yes and we have good old unsafe to
peak and Poquette memory with multiple
addressing modes and enhanced atomic
access for
long an object so but goals I set myself
a very variable handles was a safe
replacement for unsafe that could
replace the the atomic access use cases
used in Java util concurrent because job
you to current didn't use its own atomic
classes I would like to be able to
replace the unsafe in Java you two
concurrent with implementations of
variable handles and get the same
performance out so comparable to unsafe
bed of an atomic and an API bit of an
unsafe so I've said a really low bar API
wise and a really high bar performance
wise you know and I'd like to corral all
these bullies atomic all these enhanced
atomic operations and fenced operations
into one location so a variable handle
it's a single class that represents a
dynamically type reference so it's a
cross product of variable kinds types
with read/write access modes so what's
the variable kind so a kind is is
defined by a lookup of a Val handle I
get to this in a moment and it could be
an instance or a static field of a class
it could be a relevant sore views of it
could be bytebuffer contents on and off
heap there are many things that are
considered generally variables available
kinds and there's variable types types
again defined by look up so we could
have object references primitive types
in the future value types perhaps as a
vectorization kind of type if you're
viewing / arrays stuff like this and
there's a bunch of access modes so the
access mode is defined by a signature
polymorphic method where the mode kind
and type determine the method signature
and so we can have a fence accesses for
all types it's a question whether they
should be atomic in all cases for
example if you're dealing with unaligned
access on aligned architectures perhaps
you have to relax that assumption and
then enhanced atomic access for certain
types as well alexey ship left would
like to try and do this for all types if
possible
unfenced compare-and-swap okay can you
email that to Doug I or less so you said
ins types of things like lmax disruptor
a little bit not too much yeah this is
not designed for normal java java
developers this is designed for the dog
dogs of the world and so forth like that
we don't really want to trumpet this
existence as a feature that should be
talked about the general zod rather the
developers for sure
puttan I can't hear you sorry oh yeah
that's to be to be worked out based on
based on this it could depend on where
it comes from so we have to work out
details like this so here's an example
arva handle classic has a bunch of
signature polymorphic methods one for
each access mode so there's a bunch of
these so we could have what cliff said
it wanted was one without fence so as a
bunch of like relaxed access there could
be a fence 14 set release 14 volatile
and then the Atomics like compare and
sweat so get an ad and so forth like
that so it's pretty low level class
actually we've already added some stuff
to unsafe mark in the interim we're
going to have to find an extra home for
when we move it out the sandbox but Alex
each if left added put and get acquire
for all the primitive type so we're
trying to get parity with C++ Atomics in
a sense and we can probably GC the put
ordered star now know the names that we
got lazy put put ordered star they're
really confusing names I prefer these
types of me so that's one of the
motivation we didn't implement this with
relaxed SS and fences because the way
it's implemented in unsafe today there's
things related to CP you order barriers
and independent in reads independent
rights handling and stuff like that so
Lexi implemented it as intrinsic video
today as a conservative approach in the
way it currently behaves and there's
signature polymorphic methods here this
is one of the things that gives us the
ability to optimize it avoids the boxing
and packing of arguments which is what
it's used before for method handle
invocation and being in the java.lang
invoke package means final fields are
really final who would like final fields
to be final over whole of the JDK there
are wonderful optimizations to be had
when you really love it
there are several yep yes yes it's um
set accessible and unsafe er kind of it
makes it hard to optimize final fields
that's for sure yes now we know oops and
this is interesting flag you can try it
if you really want to which is trust
final feels and non trust final
non-static fields but it has to it any
works if the containing object
references a constant so you can give it
a try yes making instance final field is
optimizing compilers so we envision two
approaches conservative and optimistic
music million momo screeching runtime
checks yeah yeah we'd like to know more
about when it breaks and why it breaks
what people and we know some cases
obviously with C realisations a classic
case of this ya know so I think we have
a story sorry so I think we have a story
for serialization custom sterilization
frameworks using unsafe allocate
instance and a reflection with you new
new factory so it shouldn't it works
well for plain white coats but for for
expert level api's we have a story how
to get to fix that
so these signature polymorphic members
but like low-level linkage for signature
type checking with minimal dependencies
essentially I'm leveraging the hard
coded bits of invoke dynamic to
implement the machinery underneath I
adapted it to support non polymorphic
return types so compare and set you
don't have to do any sort of casting
you'd have to do in method handling boat
and it requires alas some small updates
to the Java language in Java Virtual
Machine specification it's kind of like
a thin slice through the whole stack
because currently it's specified that
the only signature polymorphic methods
of those in method handles and I'm
adding another one to that set here's an
example of look up so I want to look up
variable handles for these types of
things so I can do it exactly the same
way as you do it using method handles so
I can find a static field via handle I
give it its where its receiver is its
name and the type I can look up an
instance one or I could look up an array
element exactly the same as you do
method handle state these the same
access control checks as well and the
annoying catch exception for any error
although it would be nice to do
something about that and then there's
invocation so I've looked up these
method handle bar handles and now I can
actually invoke on it so we see given
the the static one we don't have any
arguments to it because there's nothing
to pass into it the signature
polymorphic method means I have to cast
it to a string so that's kind of a
negative in terms of the API tell it
what the signature is here but compare
and sets fine because the return type is
not polymorphic so we want to compare
and set on my example for the value
yeah that's it I told I I talked to Doug
about her and he was going well so yeah
he says well then eighty percent of the
cases I don't need that so maybe I need
to get some data to if you can give me
more data to help drive that
conversation right yeah yeah someone
else asked me this as well from the
coherence team in Oracle they were
wanting that type of compare and set as
well
I don't think it's back costly to add I
mean it's another little intrinsic
inside the the hot spot to use use
something slightly different but I don't
think it's that hard yeah yeah so you
can see get and set so forth like this
operating on arrays as well and we don't
have to box the array into another class
like in Atomics and so forth like that
so whatever semantics here it's
essentially invoke exact semantics like
on method handles so if I look up a
field of our handle I want to do a
compare and set on it you notice here I
have to cast it to null here to tell it
what the type is because this is
signature polymorphic I encoded types of
the call site and no normally would map
to void I don't want it to map to avoid
it's a string so I have to cast it but
the if the equivalent semantics are I
look up a fine virtual method handle
using fine virtual to the VAR handle
class to the compare and set with the
types i want and then i bind that method
handle to the VAR handle instance and
then i invoke exact on it so it's the
same semantics in terms of almost
equivalent semantics in terms of
compilation and invocation question is
could I get it down to invoke semantics
so I don't have to do these annoying
cast to null and I don't necessarily
have to cast the T if it isn't a tete
instance of tests and so forth for that
but I might have a cost to it I need to
do some experiments but it improves the
API and then would it be possible with
target typing to remove the cast on the
return type as well if we could do
target typing on method handles and
variable handles we could actually
improve that approach to given this is
an advanced API I may not be necessary
to go this far but it we could do more
to improve it so
pun okay so nano performance Alexei chip
11 for you can't be here I wish you was
he's been doing performance measurements
not ready to he's not ready to publish
him yet but when he is I'm sure he'll
publish them all with some very decent
information so far it's on par with both
c1 and c2 for runtime compilers runtime
prepares for field access and more
results will be pending I did some
result did some performance evaluation
in my talk last year I don't think
that's fundamentally changed and then
more on the macro so far it's looking ok
with an updated for joint pool Doug Doug
thankfully has been playing around with
this and looking very carefully at how
this behaves in for joint benchmarks I
opportunites opportunistically asked him
to do this while he was doing some other
analysis based on g1 and all sorts of
other things so so far it's looking ok
but he's observing an increase in
start-up costs which can put the fork
join application into into a situation
where it gets unlucky or bad runs and we
think is to do with there's early
garbage going on due to increased static
initialization as early GC and then
things get shuffled around and moved
around such that it increases effects of
false sharing increases the probability
about that's what we think is going on
there so if I got time in hand good so
there's more work to be done there but
so far it's okay or not terrible I think
might be four dogs dogs on the list of
terrible nurses at the bottom of a
terrible list so that's a good that's a
good sign of you all the other stuff
that could be terrible so under the hood
I just wanted to have a look what's
going on I picked up I'm going to
analyze I've run a simple folk joint
benchmark I want to analyze the machine
code when using unsafe and when using
variable handles and see what pops out
so I took fork join pool as a first of
August it's already changed it's like a
moving target
and run it against the 166 loops see see
fit bench block I just picked one that
was reasonably appropriate and I want to
look at the enlightening traces and
generated code for a particular method
for John Paul work you poll I want to
comparative unsaved variable handles and
variable handles with those bound checks
optimizations I talked about earlier so
here's the here's a method let's see
what it does so it basically Vezza
there's the fork join pull work array
here with all the tasks in check if it's
not null do some other thing here check
if the array length of this McHugh is
greater misery if so do some shifting
here to get an offset based on some
index get the object out of the task
queue at the offset if it's not null
compare and swap it and also i want it
essentially pop a task off the queue
like this this is this is all integers
that's an integer so we know we know we
trust Doug so we know we're not going to
get an overflow here but if you're
writing code in general that's a
potential source of problems if you if
you if your size of your a grows so you
have to be careful there and then once
we compare and swap it out we do a store
fence there so the variable handle I
just flip between them it's not that
different we get cleaner API here with
the index we have to worry about
shifting and adding we could get relaxed
and we do a compare and set
unfortunately have to cap we have to
cast this tune old to tell it what the
tight car there's not a lot of changing
code it's a pretty easy transformation
and these should be safe so we we have
to do bounce checks here and here and
but if you're in unsafe mode you don't
have to do bounce checks here you know
what you're doing right and also it's
doing a particular type of mode which I
talked about earlier which is
essentially masking the index based on
the aralen 4-1
so this is the inline trace in unsafe so
we can see a call to unsafe get object
and compare and swap and that's the
inline trace for variable handles and
you're thinking oh my god it actually
hotspot sees all through that like just
like in method handles it just sees all
through it and it's actually probably
larger than necessary because see one
does not support stable array contents
at the moment so we could probably
reduce this down but if you looked at if
you call to Vladimir presentation you
see a similar pattern here of of doing
some checks going in and doing some
casts and then going down to once if it
looks very similar to the method handle
setter and getter type code and that's
by design because it's using very
similar techniques underneath if we add
the bounced checks in there if I'm using
unsafe here for compare-and-swap i need
to change explicit bound checks with a
call to raise da check index here you
see it's showing up in the in the in
line trace with bouncer you don't see
any bounced checks here because I'm just
doing equivalent of an a a a a load here
so it's just using normal array access
so let's look at the machine code for
unsafe of it a bit of this method so
what we're coming in here remember that
check for the array length 0 in the code
you go back here so that's that little
test their green in here conditions and
bounced checks and then we the orange is
a bit of index calculations to see to
decrements here and then an and so we're
getting the index into the array and
then the blue here for unsafe is
essentially the load from the array all
that blue they're unsafe is not
particularly efficient in this case and
the reason is is because with we're not
the calculation of the shifts and the
adding is all done in integers and then
converted to long if you convert the
index too long before you do the shift
in the ad you get more efficient code so
this is quirky you know this is a user
tricks you learn by look
at the assembler case unsafe is not as
optimal as you might think yes yeah yeah
yeah and as tweaks we can Roland's done
some tweaks to improve it two sugars
more we can do and then we see a test
null here and then we see the
compare-and-swap so at least it's it's
saving the address here and reusing that
that's a good thing so the r11 here to
access the element at the index is the
same we use for the comparing of a chasm
so in VAR handles API it's slightly
different all we see is we see the same
test for the array length zero we see it
were a bit of register a bit of
shuffling going on here to calculate the
index and then we see a bounced check
come in before we actually access for
your a index because we have to check
the the a a load will do the bounced
check and there's also a bounced check
here but it's getting dominated by this
one so we don't see it twice that's good
in there but we got some we want to get
rid of this so if we take Chris Chris's
patches and Roland's patches we get it
we got it down even smaller so we see
the check here we see the the small
check for the index and then we see a
more efficient way of accessing the
reference to the fort joint task so it's
all compressed down and I'm slightly
cheating I haven't if I optimize the
unsafe one to do the long index it would
get almost exactly the same code as this
pump
have to us role in that one you think
you think you can get an overflow here
okay yeah yeah we have to look in more
detail on that I think I want to point
out here is that the generated code for
VAR handles and unsafe actually when you
do the proper pattern fronts they should
be almost similar here because the the
bounced check gets trim produced up to
there in the dominating check so that's
actually pretty good as a lot you saw
that in line trace but it all goes all
the way down it spits out almost the
same code and we can actually change
that to relax access if we want to we
don't have to do it using a VAR handle
we don't have to do it using unsafe
because we got these bound checks
optimizations in place we can just do
that now simplify the code if we wanted
to so there's a bunch of exotic of our
handles that I can talk about in the
workshop people have questions and stuff
there so I'm not going to go into it
here i think i've got about two minutes
left there's a rave use we can use sudo
aligned unaligned long views over byte
arrays that's pretty common people do
that a lot using unsafe as I did with
the array mismatch but perhaps we can we
can provide a VAR handle to expose that
type of pattern for viewing bytes as
Long's or perhaps
Long's as bytes if you want to go
greater than the Institute max value
your way around we can access manage and
direct byte buffers so we cares on byte
buffers to we don't have to add these
methods to byte buffer we can cast
directly and in fact with a very small
tweak to buffer I can use the same
addressing modes for direct and on heap
and off heap that people use today and
depending on whether the the byte array
is null and will be addresses and so for
we can actually unify it we can also do
a little hack to if a class has fields
of the same type multiple instances
multiple instances of fields at the same
type we can be bad as an array as well
and we can iterate over that as an array
just for fun so if we had a complex
number or a point free d or something
like that week of you valores an array
and this this is interesting can we get
vectored access to arrays and views of
as i talked about earlier and maybe use
some kind of concept of vector that has
a window / v array as we sweep over it
and provide vector operations on there
and it was all nicely intrinsic the
covers and we provide the Java API
provides enough to hotspot of patterns
to do the vectorization so that's it so
we can spill over to the to the workshop
as any any quick questions now yes
yes yes you're quite right we're going
we're going to put a smaller version of
offences we propose it is put a smaller
version of the fences API that Doug
proposed a while back we're going to
we're going to stick that in Java util
concurrent I think and then do the
unsafe dance from there to there so
there'll be there'll be explicit fences
as well as a fenced access methods
through bar handles very good okay so we
can I have some more slides you can go
into in the workshop to talk about
unsafe methods who's using them what
should we do with them and so for that
i'd like to get data from people and we
can deep dive more into this if you wish
i can show examples and stuff</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
