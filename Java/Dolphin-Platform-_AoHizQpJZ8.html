Oh what's the thing
so hope unis I thought my okay so
welcome back to a night hacking live
stream from devoxx 2015 I'm sorry I'm us
and I'm here with Michael Henry and
Henry gave us from canoe and I heard you
have a new platform out there like a
kind of evolution of the open dolphin
system the idea is from open dolphin so
what can tell me about it yes so we have
a canoe we've experimented with the
shared presentation model for a long
time the open dolphin library was was an
implementation of that and we have now
taken that and and push it a bit further
and built a platform based on that so
that you can write applications easily
using this approach so to explain this a
little more I have some slides here so
let me get yeah okay good so question is
what's a shared presentation model so we
have a server and declined and there's
always this big fight if we want to do a
rich client or thin client and the shape
presentation will do something in
between it's not really thin client
technologies but it's awesome the rich
client technology but it's actually
trying to combine the advantages of both
approaches in one architecture and it
works this way so we have a server and a
client and they share the presentation
model or the view model which means
whenever one of these the server updates
the model the other side gets an update
and and gets notified and can react on
that so how we're working with this is
or the advantage of that is we can have
the business logic completely on the
server which is saving your investment
because the client technical technology
is change very often like when you want
to do technology a new client right now
what technology do you would you want to
choose angular you know it's you know
it's almost almost dead do you want to
use polymer maybe react and how long
will it last so flying technologies
change very quickly but your business
logic doesn't and with this approach we
the business logic on the server and we
can exchange the client very quickly all
right so on the client we do what what
we call the projector pattern the
projector takes the presentation model
and creates the view from that to make
it better understandable there's let's
think of a small example when we create
an editor then this presentation would
model could be like this we have a list
of entries and every entry is one input
field so for example we have a label
birthdate it has a type it has a tooltip
it has additional attribute and it's
mandatory things like that and the
client gets this information and then it
renders it according to the current
platform so it could be a date picker
that pops up it could be you know this
control on an iPad if you're in an iPad
where you don't just have the different
roles and to select a date so it really
depends on the clients you can use the
full capabilities of the client with
this approach another advantage is you
can do things that are usually very hard
for example Internet realization or is
very easy here because you can just
change the label the labels for all your
fields the client gets the notification
automatically and it updates a view
automatically that's good so let's see
an example or how what the current state
is how its implemented we have the
client on the server and the model in
between on the server we have dolphin
controllers how we call them these are
integrated into the platform so we can
use them in Java EE or spring they have
dolphin model or you define a dolphin
model which will be from the the model
will be injected and then there are
dolphin actions which are methods that
you can call from the client on the
client side we use web components in
this example for example we have a
polymer implementation working
now that we're using in an application
it uses a dolphin behavior so if you're
familiar with polymer behaviors the
thing that he used for for inheritance
or mix-ins
yeah and that gives you a model as well
which is a JavaScript model in this case
and an invoke method and every time you
call invoke with a name of a method plus
some parameters it will be it will it
will trigger the action on the on the
server and Henrik can show that in code
and and you explain it in more detail so
this works better over the wire like
with a really kind of exactly yeah like
mobile phone clients yeah it's not a
silver bullet it will not solve all the
issues but it works really good if you
work if you have yeah stable connection
network connection which you often have
in in most business scenarios like
people working at their desktops in in
banks in in governments and they just
sit in front of their desktop and they
have a stable connection so you can rely
on that you have the full circle of the
server so you can do very complex logic
here and and it's still maintained I
mean for example if you have this editor
and there's a rule that if you if you
come from a certain country then the
drop-down list for the states is updated
this logic will always be the same it's
and it's on the server you just need to
change the projector on the client but
the the business logic is still there so
instead of taking years to switch from
one to client technology to the other
it's just a matter of weeks you just
have to write these projectors and it
can reuse all of your business okay so
you got a lot of information traveling
back and forth between client and server
yeah yeah okay a lot of communication
going okay got it so I think Henrique
has some more details to show so let's
switch back to okay consider example how
we can code based on as Michael already
said
on the server side we use spring or we
support spring and Java EE and which
means that you can define your view
controllers that are on the server the
same way in spring or in Java EE maybe
we start with a look at our website so I
don't have internet actually so I opened
it here locally on my computer and yeah
here you see mostly the same that was
explained by mica but I think what's
interesting is see the view controller
this is a small example of a controller
was it big enough now we see it okay and
this is a small example of a controller
that gives in the server and its benefit
of the Dawson platform is that once you
define a controller like this and you
instantiate the view on the client in
the server the server will automatically
create a new instance of this controller
but it will be managed by the platform
which means it will be managed by Java
EE or by spring and default annotations
like at inject post construct we destroy
will work automatically so you can use
or you can do the same what you can do
in a eg be for example or in the spring
service like that and so on the other
hand when when you create an sob you
create an application on the server
you only need to define these
controllers there's a kiosk scanner in
the dolphin platform that automatically
you find all your controllers and we
handle the whole lifecycle of the
controller so you don't need to do any
instantiation or stuff like that
Randall server it's quite easy I have a
small example it's a to-do list and all
sorts of applied here it is
and so for this example it's a Moche
module project we had start with our
controller on the server I have a server
module here this one is independent if
it's spring or Java EE and here I define
my controller can use dependency
injection so annotations like post
construct and things like that now here
we have this our own annotation which
defines our model that is synchronized
between the client and the server and
here's an example for an action that
yeah
can be used to trigger an event from the
client so if I want to use this
application which you know has just one
view and one controller in a spring
application that's quite easy here's the
server spring module it only has one
class with the main method that
bootstraps spring boot and we have our
own annotation it's the Dawson platform
application annotation that must be
added to to the main class and once this
is done the server is running and
controlling us will be instantiated
automatically and stuff we exit you
don't need to do anything else so here
in this class we never reference or to
do controller or stuff like that it
works automatically and it's even more
easy on Java EE because in my server
Java EE project so normally I would have
nothing in it I just have a dot empty
fire this must be in the web app folder
that I can run the application with
IntelliJ otherwise so you know the web
app for I won't be in the class path and
then it's not working and here I use
Google's e to stop the application and
if I don't know
so camuto's EE is what spring boot is
for spring is kumo EE for for Java EE
you you can create microservice
faced with Camus goose and you don't
need to deploy your application in an
application container yeah and you can
use it or you can use spring boot to
create your server so maybe the other
thing that is interesting is how can i
define a model so Michael showed us this
projector pattern that you can use but
with the basic dolphin platform API you
can create any models that you want so
you don't need to use this project for
pattern if you want you can coat your
eyes by hand and define your own model
and then on the client side bind your
model to the US and to do so we created
our own property API so people that are
familiar with JavaFX might yeah see some
looks familiar
yeah it looks familiar too to Java fix
people so Micah has done it and he's
done okay explore party API today we did
the binding as well yes in Java fix yeah
and for the platform like finding no not
yet
so first we have for example this
observable is twist which extends a
default Java list or the property which
yeah you can use to define an attribute
and all these classes interfaces are
observable and against the Java X
property API this API can be used on the
client and on the server so you can
define your model by using these
observable data types and then add
listeners on the client and on the
server or so for example what you can do
is you can bind just this new item text
property on the client to an text field
be directioner and on the server you can
add a listener to it so and when you
start typing in the client and the text
field this is now will be automatically
cord on the server okay so so you say
I'm you couldn't use the
FEX properties on the on the server side
why not
so you could use them they have don't
have any internal dependencies to Java
fix but it's in the Java expeced with
Java 9 it will be in the Java if X mod
you and when I want to have a Java
Runtime on my server normally I don't
want to have this GUI just get some
effects space there's more than one job
X module in JDK and swing okay like like
a jigsaw so get the early access and
look into it and it's a I figured that
was like I think six traffic's modules
are there already so like separating
media and webview graphics controls but
I'm not sure since one but that's sexual
state so they're trying separate itself
so maybe you can just okay and they
separated because it used to depend on I
think some formatting thing which then
would depend on local which then
depended on something you know it was
really crazy
so they resolved that feels like that
somehow okay all the packages they are
according but um okay he's like base
should be something that's just like
yeah a sixth of and if they have still
the question if you can run it me sir
okay yeah I'll be nice probably okay so
so yes right we always have to show demo
and it has to crash so that we can prove
that it was a real demo right yeah sure
definitely it's one of the major things
that they must do so for this demo until
now when Micah talked about the client
he always talked about yeah okay but to
be true we don't not only have the few
client we have for example a Java fix
kinda guy Bui - now it's great so this
is how much time people yeah so no
JavaScript rules the world but now but
um I didn't get the message
so uh yeah so can you see right now I
have 2 Joe effects client so we saw the
- job excellent open and this is a
polymer-based web client and yeah all of
them are connected with a server using
information that we just saw there's an
event bus on the server that does the
the synchronization we plan to simplify
that in a later version but yeah you can
go type stuff and it's automatically a
synchronous with all the different
clients using the different technologies
while the the real logic on the server
it's the same for all of East clients so
all the sweet wines use the same
controller class in the server their
individual instances of the class each
of them but it's the same class you know
okay right yeah it's a bad one github or
we created the first release last week
so then maven central array center we
have a website account so um the best
starting point is on github it's canoe
slash dolphin platform Dawson - got from
all on our page it's dolphin - we got
form dot I hope ok good so um thanks for
having me thanks for being here thanks
for having us yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
