as a java technology advocate i'm here
with Martin and Stefan to talk about
adapted jsr so Martin tell us about
adopted a salt so dr. Chester was
something that a bunch of us sort of
dreamt up of about a year and a half ago
now we were basically complaining about
i think the jamis speak at the time and
saying are those designers are what
they're doing you know or who doesn't
know what they're doing some doesn't
know what they're doing you know we
should have some input into this into
this process before it comes out as a
standard and so we decided to do exactly
that and try and connect with the people
who are creating the standards early so
we can as developers we can help them
evolve a standard which is good for
developers so yes no it's sort of kicked
off a year and a half ago and it's been
spreading around the world ever since
excellent so stay fine you took that you
understood that adopted is our model and
as part of Belgium job you took that
model and applied thereto java ee 7
which is coming live exactly that's
about yeah well first way it wasn't me
personally it was Johann Voss who
couldn't make it unfortunately so Johan
Voss said like well this is a really
great idea let's really back this up
with the Belgium Java user group and we
could basically choose which j sorry we
have a bit more affectionate and his
personal choice was a 356 websockets one
and so we started promoting it and the
first thing we'd is like well maybe we
should do a guard type of thing do
hackathon around that so basically we
can read the spec play with the API and
then start thinking of like so what
should we then do with it just play with
it no and then he came with Heidi let's
let's write a sample application so he
joined up with stain van ananda anyone
and they both prepared an application we
had an evening session at oracle belgium
i think around six o'clock tea like
1030-11 ish and we hacked away and what
was really nice they wrote an
tic-tac-toe application with a server
and a job I fixed clients and an html5
one and then there were some other
people really in the room who have like
Android experience there was another guy
who knows about I iOS so when the
evening was done we had like four
different clients talking to the same
server we found a few bugs we changed it
we open source it of course and now we
have a nice reference application on
that chaser which we adopted as user
group excellence i think as martin was
saying the idea was to provide feedback
before the spec actually become standard
find the bugs fly out and then be
successful yeah well I think we were a
bit too late to still give feedback on
the actual specs so we're more bits so
that we have to change our focus of it
and say that well maybe we can just
write an application than at least that
can be used for by other developers as a
you know as a reference point more or
less it's a learning guide yeah exactly
right so that could definitely be a
strategy for other user groups as well
if they want to do something like that
it's more concrete codes you know we
like to write codes instead of just
reading the spec it's a bit more boring
so you need to find the right people and
the right profiles to see what dynamic
you want to take place as a developer
you know I want the court to do the
talking with me instead of spec to do
the talking with me yeah yeah expires
very nature pretty dry documents to read
in the Java language specification it's
painful but you know so for real
language geeks only I think so yeah the
problem of course with that approach is
that if you then we did find a few
issues and it was already too late
because the spec is more or less you
know finalized so that's the only
downside but yeah I mean it still needs
to be fun for us as well to do this
otherwise it doesn't happen right right
so absolutely i mean as part of w7 i
guess lemon jello community also did
some hack days not just joey seven but
the broader java community project means
oh yes I London's being also focusing on
web sockets in JSON and a little bit on
the CD i spec we're quite quite big fans
of dependency injection over here
but we have really been focusing we have
a lot of core financial services people
here in London so there is a lot of
focus on Java the language itself will
the platform itself so doing a lot of
work with the lambdas coming in Java
rates and of course the new date and
time API coming in jail break so those
two have been very very well-received
tech days they sell out within half an
hour and everyone has a really great
time and you know people like Brian
gooks will actually come over and run
the lab with us which is which is nice
from the moral to have them come over
and do that it's really good and yeah
and I get to learn about functional
programming so you know it's that's
great fun too whimsical yeah it wouldn't
been actually and i'm a noob in our
covens double community ways yeah
absolutely and I've seen that particular
model of adopted Jess are being adopted
by about 30 jugs worldwide nice when I
say worldwide literally worldwide
asia-pacific Europe Africa South America
North America we still have to open a
job in Antarctica I guess no I remember
getting everything from Max and Kangol
in life join us in Congo
really good fun yeah that's really
community feedback driven that's very
positive exactly i mean i would like to
conclude with you know I went to
Gothenburg job two months back I walk
into the room then it says speak up be
heard if you don't say a word nothing
will change that truly captures the
essence of adopted jsr as in like you
guys are providing feedback to the
different jsr and making sure this
relevant events I was really nice as
well I have a big shout out to you know
the people involved because they do
listen to spec leads and someone they
really have like you know they
appreciate it that you do this and they
are really returning you know whatever
comments week if they really give
feedback back and so it's a nice dynamic
going on there nice images it's a really
tough and lonely job being a spic
leading in the expert group right and it
must feel like quite often that no one's
caring about the work you're doing is I
really am I also hope that just by
people even is using the API like you
guys took me of the little game it's a
really nice validation of their well I
think so really nice so overall I think
adapter jsr effort has been really
successful for the community because the
truly a grassroot evangelism you learn
the technology you provide feedback make
it better before it actually becomes a
standard has been very successful yeah I
have to say grow even more next year I'm
Lindsay the Antarctica Jack that's a
great idea actually you will move there
yeah be great there a Java one in touch
Thank You Margie and stuff I thank you
and that's it for me thank you thank you
