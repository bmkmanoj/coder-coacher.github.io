no one kisses
I wanted a new suit so small listening /
152 hello my friends good morning good
afternoon good night whether you are
doesn't matter because today is a very
special day we are here in a very
special place with a very special guest
and today we are from santa clara in
oracle where java just started many
years ago and i would like to introduce
you Gary Coney's to nautical he's a
engineer working with job in bed at many
many years and doing testes and working
with different boards and typed versions
of Java so Gary collies I don't like you
said my name is Gary Collins and we're
actually in side what we consider a test
lab and so this land be used to make
sure that Jonathan forms are you know
runs on all these systems or desire to
infant ARM architecture PPC architecture
asleep different types of iterations so
we're sitting now is actually where we
have probably a couple hundred systems
in this lab right here in this little
corner we probably have probably about a
hundred and fifty machines just sitting
here running tests a regular basis and
making sure that Java is rock solid and
we're straight on the systems as they
are so this is your day job testing the
different types of boards and make sure
that Java is running in all the
different ports yeah it's one of one of
my many hats okay so basically what I
kind of the forefront I'm the guy that's
at the beginning of guest systems in
from vendors or whatever say all of the
school board like hang on a sec go grab
on like a Lego Mindstorm and they say
hey how do we get a job on that and so
we work with the Legos Lego skies and
got Java actually working lava system
so worst grade gets down nice and small
small footprint and now runs really well
so what I do is kind of get that one was
beautiful because I didn't have to do
the operating system that was already
set up for me thanks thanks to the guys
that did that but for most systems
everything in here I had to build the
operating systems from the low level all
the way out to getting so it's a normal
Linux operating system and then we run
java on top of that there is ice and and
can we take some shot around here yeah
to show the people so let's move a
little bit so here we have so on the
shelf right here it's a bunch of um
these are armed Lisa PPC machines there
a 500 v2 there from freescale and their
power P 1025 tower boards so they're
great little dual cpu probably about 5
12 to a gig of memory they're really
fast and great low low man systems and
retest found our Java to make sure it's
performs on PPC so yes we do more than
arm you actually test key bc as well so
don't mean why you have many of the same
bored here we have so we we have a lot
of tests that have to be done in out of
those testing you know developers make a
change they want to make sure that they
don't break not just the regular
platforms SC problem is also the
embedded SI platforms and so we take all
these machines to add them into our test
matrix so we have a big complex kind of
like automation testing system and we
add these machines in they just run a
little demon on them and they say hey
give me jobs and start running tests on
it so why do we have so many for one
config we have so many configurations so
many switches that we run Java with that
we make sure that we don't break
anything so we have an array of machines
to just make sure the Java works and all
the environments and all the switches
and all the configurations so that's how
I we have you see that when you click to
download a jdk or a java virtual machine
that's ready for you that is a lot of
job behind the scenes and a lot of tests
is that they they do to provide you a
stable form
so you can run in your embedded device
very nice very nice so up top so we can
go up here but you can't really see way
up here but we have a bunch of raspberry
PI's but we'll talk about those later
again these are more p 1025 these guys
here the ones all up in here are
basically eight core power pc machine so
think about the old power mac days they
all Apple boxes you actually have some
other ethir to these are the power max
these are not Intel chips ease of pc
chips and so we use those armed Apple
boxes as well as these freescale boxes
there p40 80s there eight core four gig
of memory I mean really rock solid
systems and so this is just the tip of
the iceberg of these machines we have
other labs that have tons more of these
but that's for those over here we
actually have a bunch of these are our
md5 headful machines so we make sure
that John works well in an RV 5 headful
system and that's what these are for and
as you notice as a whole boatload this
is just again the tip of the iceberg of
those we know into other systems so we
have trim slice devices these are
basically an nvidia tegra systems and
their great little devices really fast
Oh memory and from the regular company
of comp you a lot of Israel and we work
with them to get those those machines
again not a different configuration this
is an arm d5 again but more of a
headless a server people might see these
as a pogoplug they use it for NASA they
do all sorts of different stuff we
actually make sure that Java works well
in the network from switching stuff and
behind it in your application services
run aliens really well so that's those
words these guys here are freescale arm
device this is a imx6 and they call this
sdb board this is basically a baseboard
right around four hundred dollars Oh
price point sorry the Guru plugs are
about a hundred dollars apiece they're
great little rv5 on headless machines
these ones here the imx6 freescale board
that i was saying that is about four
hundred dollars you know to get into
development kits
to actually get your fingers you know
very into playing with embedded it's so
much easier old days used to be
twenty-five hundred dollars $5,000 or
more for these boards so the price point
come down dramatically to make it so
much easier for you to actually start
doing java programming and coding and
Internet of Things and also it's a fun
stuff because the price points come down
really nice so again we have a you know
probably a couple hundred hobo plugs up
above we have I mx-5 three this is
freescale's old you know one of their
cortex a8 systems them previous before
this one but that's about it for
machines besides all these wonderful
machines up here so Samsung has a this
little device right here is a quad
actually yes this is an octet machine so
this has a cortex a15 quad chip inside
it and it also has four a7 CPU chips
Plus as a graphic some graphics chip
inside it as well so this is a really
fast machine 15 to 10 seconds of this
machine's up and running and you're
running with a full graphic system
really nice machine to Gabe sheen and
the price point is like 130 dollars I
mean you can't beat it and if you
splurge and get the emmc like they're up
on board memory flash memory like it's
four to five times faster but it cost a
few dollars more but it's well worth it
you just plug it in it's super simple
easy so nice that's just those boards
well yeah we we have a I do a lot of
bring outs of all these machines so I'm
kind of guy that has to get them
reporting in the lab and then I pass
them off to somebody else than they
actually go in and go for it in a lab
environment not just here but globally
so we're going 24seven all over the
world so we have systems in st.
Petersburg we have assistants in
Australia we have systems in Stockholm
we have machines at East Coast West
Coast you know pretty much everywhere
wow so very very nice job
and you talking about internet your
things and he is a kind of new buzzword
yeah they and I think that it's very
nice because it's like the Java was very
prepared since the beginning for
international java was in front of the
time all the time and uh what do you
think about intellectual things and why
do you think that Java is the best
platform for doing the internet your
things I know I'm really excited about
having channel on the platform jaan liya
bed apartments for a long time but for
vendors an explosion like getting into
things like just a little gizmos it you
know I like to mess with my garage at my
garage go up and down and have a web
service of getting closer to the house
it's ten cents time getting closer it
opens a mirage for me so I don't have to
actually a boob Mirage Mike you can't
beat that or you know you're sitting in
your bed and you know garage closed ears
are not closed and I have service
writing that tells my system that hey um
close to grunts door and it close to the
garage for me instead of hey honey could
you close the door I don't you close the
door and when we first moved here good
until war's open all the time so estoy a
couple of bucks with the sensors again
at the rest we play at the beginning and
the Java Web Services amount develop
yeah it's amazing and how quick and easy
it is and now we have Java Sea embedded
which makes much more easy for a regular
Java developer to come to embedded world
yeah so very nice and today we are going
to talk about Internet of Things and
well they're just bring many different
types of words so we are not talking
today about raspberry pi we are going to
show that there is life beyond raspberry
pi and java and so if you are if you
just joined a challenge and you are
looking to something different from
raspberry pi today is the right session
so you can learn about different devices
different words because i think that
every week we have a new word all my
assets
the invented market is exploding me
aboard the du jour this the best for
today is tomorrow with colonize the next
we're coming outlets and I met six is
exploding partly it's just amazing how
many words and saying the same see use
if there's so many different variants of
boards and ribbons and people making
link who gizmos to be able to do in a
face yeah and we are talking about 2 to
2 Giga a memory words that's like a
dancer okay ways it is a full desktop so
i can look just give you a quickie shot
I mean this here is just hang on I mean
this board here is basically this and
that little Samsung device up there and
it's running a full Linux two gig of
memory is like that is an absolutely
rich desktop in an embedded platform and
it's a very performant very fast snappy
and running java on it it's just screams
it's awesome great and so let's start
showing to the toys that you dreamed us
to be and which one would like to start
with sure so um well i think i talked
about the lego mindstorm oh and so the
lego mindstorm is a great little
development kit that you can play with
your on job on today they have sensors
that are mean to talk with it so you
just plug in a sensor or plug in a motor
and you can do also to fund robotic
stuff with this right out of the back
you can actually there is a company
called national instruments that
actually makes an adapter that you can
plug into one of these ports and by
plugging in the fort you can actually
introduce flow controls sensors also two
different types of contractions so this
the lego stuff out of the box is great
but you actually put you control systems
rain from one of these Lego Mindstorms
which is which is awesome and Java runs
on it great yeah and you build me death
java 8 yes i actually tested as soon as
it came out and so Java 8 is on this
where as well with any compact profile
to on it all right now and we do
Oracle land page 44 lagu yeah yes let me
show you here I'm going to share my my
screen so here we have the page if you
want to start playing with Lego
Mindstorms and Java you just need to to
Google about it like a Java lagu and
Oracle and you will find this page very
easy and here you have all the support
you have some videos and the guide the
download you are going to use lathos
which is the brutal machine that runs
inside yeah and it's not just that it's
if you in this link here on this page is
what they've serves you how to go to the
language website download their style
their OS tells you how to put it on the
SD card that tells you how to get the
java part on to it so it's not just you
have to go different size you can go
here basically everything you need to
know you can start from this page go
then download start with paradoxes great
very nice so this is the nice way to
start playing because you can find this
lack of my strong teaching that black
astoria but yeah so the ones that you
know if you really want to kind of have
some fun you can go to store by the
lingo kids that are already there you
can go to legos education site get the
corset and then they have expansion kids
with more pieces more modules and you
know more adaptive than so it's like the
GPA like the gyro is inside the young
the expansion kit and that thing is just
phenomenal have a lego to remember the
label do that i'm doing my yo-yo and so
inside that is a the gyro is actually
inside that that's what makes the and
that's a lego mindstorms running inside
that yeah so that's what they use to
keep the thing riding on to us engine
implement many years ago you just go do
that using a real-time operational
season and very complex yes now it's
much easier unless complex but the
coating is a little bit more fun trying
to do the right stuff but it works well
electrons yeah I think that most of the
people red cedar the demo the Dukes demo
which is very nice one and shoulder Java
power even inside a toy like like oh so
very nice okay so only a couple of other
systems and so I talked about I'm access
systems so you know for really getting
up and going and starting off pretty
quickly this is a company called Google
you d 00 or go to that website there's
three different types of for derivatives
that they have but I'm going to bring
this little bit closer so you can
actually see it so this is oops or am I
going here there we go so this is a new
dude board from it's a free scale imx6
chip wide-based it has two gig of memory
I mean this is a really fast system
running java but it has a bunch of the
the GPIO is exposed and you know the I
swear at sea and all those things that a
typical system has like a raspberry pot
but then some this also has an Adreno
rich kind of between them so you can
kind of do what we know sketch as well
as doing pure Java going directly to it
but you can do everything job directly
to GV I already on this point Paul's
eyes and this is very good for someone
that just know about Arduino and want to
improve their real project and say oh I
want to I want more and i'm going to
start playing with java it's actually a
good bridge because if you take the edge
we know if you already familiar with
that we know too confident java is
actually pretty simple and so the
beautiful nice relationship between the
two and you can actually grow very fond
of you know it's good to be no no rates
a java program in java directly on this
board and let's talk about the price ah
yes go on the son of X so the other
sports 139 dollars which is the top end
quad I mean this is really really
smoking great cheat and notice a big
heat sink on top of it it does gets
really hot once you really growing a
real big blow on it but it is an awesome
machine 139 dollars and you can't beat
that you take that raspberry pi is 3500
times for that's this
but is squad-based oh and you just can't
beat it he's a laptop is like a mini
laptop so who do is one you know cool
kit well they expose all those different
things well there's a company called
seats to do or there's this little kit
than a rootkit that basically you can
attach onto the Hoodoo and expose a
bunch of digital pins and analog pins
and so it made it really easy to do
tentative things that I this board is
just awesome and we can do it and it's
basically you take some cabling you take
the little bridge or a shield you plug
it on top of you who do and then you use
these little sensors so this one here I
put my glasses longer see it now this
one's a sound just a sip a simple sound
buzzer but you notice the little pins
and again I told your market cables it
made it real easy to interconnect
different you know effects so I can
connect this up to the digital pins we
got an I squared seat for other
different functions so we have one touch
sensor a light sensor so you know you go
to out of room today or the Raspberry Pi
and get another light sensor these guys
have made it so you've got these little
pluggable little devices with a little
pin connector make it easy to connect a
cable so really no breadboard required
to do Internet of Things and it really
get up around really fast the other we
had a magnetic sensor right here this
one's kind of cool I like this one so
it's basically a little light magnetic
sensor is right on the top up here and
then again the same bridge we connected
so everything blends in was in this
board and they're often running and
doing it of things there's a little kit
that comes with this groove kit or the
seed studio kit so here's a basic little
pamphlet that comes with it but these
are just a tip of the iceberg of the
sensors that are available there's so
many more sensors available for this
board it's it's a fun little kid I I
just got it about a week ago and I've
been so busy getting other boards up and
running I haven't had a chance to
really touching I'm like I'm so excited
they actually get to play with it and
start running java on it and doing
internet of things or whatever you want
to call it I'll wait to have one of
these from home and oh yeah you supposed
to receive every week new effects I
received her things all the time and
it's just getting java running on it
it's always that's the first thing and
just having fun ok I look above this
cute rice so total kit Oh for the sensor
packed and since to do that comes in is
like will cool kit is about $49 and so
go on luan SI SE e ed studio and look
for people with you yeah look for the
crew starter kit roof g r OV e starter
kit it's fun little kit and you know
everything you need to do you get your
so for about two hundred dollars I mean
this is overboard obviously but also
entered always get ton of different
sensors and do all sorts of fun little
things and projects in you know the
Internet of Things or whatever you want
to do to have fun with java and for the
people that they are starting when you
are starting with prospered by you just
Google Java rustburg by and you are
going to find lots of articles otras how
is the grossest poop you start playing
with good outfit example so so the
beauty part of the Raspberry Pi kids
they made the OS image budeau has the
same thing so there's an Aurora less
image they can get you know that on to
them on an SD card just like you would
do when a raspberry wine you see honey
good job on it well you can SCP it over
to the system and copy it then on tart
like you do want a raspberry pi it's not
much different than any other system so
it's just like a full-fledged linux
machine so once you have the linux
machine up and running you're often
going no need to recompile the kara new
and things are none of that it's all
just working out of box oh very nice and
it all depends on what you want to throw
so we'll say you want to throw a seat
think be like device that's a USB plug
thing and plug into the device well that
us be part of it might be you are and
that might not be enabled in the current
so you might have to build that into the
kernel
no simple Google and search on you I you
know within a couple of minutes you find
out the magic config argument and you're
going download this kernel source and
you just run the configure and bill and
these boards many times we don't have
let's play a monitor keyboard and things
like that and do you have some teeth for
the people to start debugging or yes
when you are happy lies you don't have
money toward yes so hang on a semi she
might be fine so we'll talk a little bit
here this is just a rough example so a
lot of the kids you know you can go to
audit for its website and or anywhere on
the internet just look for cereal tip
this is basically a USB plug that plugs
in there's actually some intelligence
and behind the sword is cable it's an
MTB I like adapter that you plug into
your laptop and then you have a bunch of
pins in this case there's a lot of pins
this one's make for a bigger board black
but the pins are the pins so you just
find out which one's the RX which one's
the TX on the ground and so and then you
take those pins you can just wire it
directly in on to thank you to board
there's all these pins there's a display
of which ones are available and then you
just look for the RX and TX one just
reverse them to what this cable is now
you have a cereal tip internship into
the device without actually having to
have a head on machine inside you can go
to a mini calm or you know terror term
or whatever you want to use to connect
to it putty or screen whatever the
contraption is and now you're actually
sitting on the console and looking at
files around them so serial connections
is really old but gold yeah I both good
actually it's an absolutely old
technology but it's you know if you're
gonna do anything about it it's a
must-have I mean I have that's just one
of those adapters where it already has
the FTDI built into it a lot of boys
don't have that so they sometime expose
dvi-d digo db9 pins see why happening
here
I actually don't have any ones that are
exposing PP 9 9 input this guy here
pluggable basically it's a serial cable
to do abuse connect this serial port and
the USB port into your computer then you
get on just a regular pass through palm
connector and connected this into your
db9 and now you're serio tipping
indirectly so like we can do this with
me before you can do this with almost
any kit I use this all the time anytime
I want it the first thing I do on Ford
bring up you sitting there you plug it
in put the party and you turn it on like
it doesn't do anything what's going on
then come to find out that sometimes you
have to mess with the u-boot or the food
environment and so it just gets stuck in
the food environment because you might
have done something wrong you didn't
change the root equals to the death of
the device where the OS is on so you
instead of being on petition one saying
in competition great so we have to
change the you can farm to say hey I
want to petition three so they'll get
all the way up and cereal tip and you'll
say oh I isn't it moving well it's
because of the it's using the wrong
petition so the you who've got to lift
because sometimes have built into the
pool sometimes they're not and so having
cereal tip solves a lot of those kind of
like crazy things so for our xgs thank
you alright so there's a company called
foundry devices which makes them the
saber light sure a lot of people
accredit highly recommend boundary
devices for imx6 dev kits this is a
great kit again its quad-core 1 Giga
memory but begin with more memory
configurations that you wanted through
the through the company they have
different down connectors that can
basically take the LCD connector or
expansion ports and then they have an
adapter board that you can actually do
all the TI out directly with this so
there's an expansion adapter board you
can plug into these little connectors
and get yourself gpio and i square at
sea and on a box just works the other
cool thing about this is it has a SATA
disk also same with the food important
has a same list as well
having running off aceite versus running
off at st part or micro SD card 90 day
because the right life on an SD corridor
a micro SD card is not long and we run
hundreds of thousands of tests on a
machine per night so think about the
rights how many right you're doing and
so what I usually end up doing is taking
a lot of the petitions read-only but
even reads depending on how you boot it
will actually cause a right to occur
which is kind of funny I'm only reading
but if you don't tell it it will then
it's assuming assuming your mom I write
as well to do a read it's great about
how you pop devices so very nice boys
are they both Guzman this one here is
just a saber light to cipro sabr d li TT
RS so it's a 9x six plot well again this
one hundred ninety nine dollars they
have displayed kit you can get javafx
screams on this device does its have a
head right on it it's got hdmi as well
you know multiple SD cards or storage
it's got the USB ports again I mean
bloodless twice awesome breaking pitch
very nice and intelligent launch detail
gonna do we will have something to show
us about Delgado do in Java yeah so
there's the Galileo box from and tell
you can get this car and it's my brains
not really good on the numbers is
absolutely that does the purchase I
things are on 15 out of six and nine
dollars oh it's 256 man it's the perfect
auto box 30 mega hertz but I could move
that's just cycle down on frequency and
you know unto me and not on performance
I haven't tried it I just got it up and
running last Friday at home so I'm
really not to play with it too much but
Java go to java 8 on it and everything
works great yeah this is your hello
gorgeous start playing turn on pooja
yeah so again inside is just a little
you know kick board and then inside that
it's just time or just a power supply
and logic connectors for international
which is great so it makes it nice and
means you just using the same power cord
Oh is change the ad ahead networks and
that's it that's inside this box now one
thing that leaving give you which highly
recommend you know I've been talking
about the cereal tip right on this
problem the connection where you need to
get a different type of serial
connection for this one I'll show you
that right now so here's a board and
this is the serial connection yes it's
Superman yes the serial connection is
actually a 3.5 millimeter ferralti not
barrel jack but like a headphone jack
and so I went on to amazon for i think
five dollars i think this kit db9 to
this just plug this into this board here
and now you have a cereal tip connection
so when assistant once you get the OS
loaded onto the car onto the micro SD
card here it goes out then you can catch
the console very nice so it's nice and
easy again when I told you about having
this this and this plug together so you
plug this into into this court adapter
and then that's and then this goes into
your PC so that's time you get from this
to this to your computer yeah and one
thing is that we are not talking about
running a version love job we are
talking about jungle eight elder time
all the devices yes I mean so one of the
Ravens who are having so it's eight this
is java 8 se8 just came out as the
embedded is the same so this may not
have much power a lot of your systems
might not have as much jus so see you in
a lot of memory to do a lot of Hong
piles and built on the system directly
the beauty of job beautiful asleep in
your x86 box your linux box you build
your your application or even dramatic
whatever it is you build your java
classes and you deploy it to the device
and so the full part is its job a here
on your map or your windows or linux box
and your embedded devices java again so
they were the same it's the same bits
just runs on one or the other yes the
VMS
oh we have the right ones grunts and any
lab is that was never in so good shape
yes and in it that's a compelling story
because you know you have I have a
version of job and I wanna run midnight
I built it I want these new lambdas all
I have to use 80 can I use that on my
embedded device will absolutely because
java SE a java SE embedded are identical
as far as you know their capabilities
with each other very very eyes so more
devices sure so here's on this guy here
remember we talked about above there was
a bunch of samsung those are cortex a15
systems quad base / too big this guy
here is from a company called hard
kernel and those machines are also for
partner called Oh droid bosch nexxt you
ignore the void the northern word joy it
means nothing it's just their derivative
therefore I don't know why I have no
food I won't say but anyways this is
running Linux those other machines are
running lives as well so this one here
is 59 or sixty nine dollars while gave
it memory one cortex eight and I two big
rocks and a great job is an amazing gp1
it that Java runs right on and again
here's your cereal tip this time they
built this little dongle that basically
plugs in onto the board itself and
you're up in building in minutes this
thing here if your lug in the head so
you plug in your hdmi mini hdmi into it
we do a full keyboard and mouse
treatment and headless doesn't really
matter but again we go to the OS
downloaded off of the hard kernels
website or droid website deploy it onto
a cart included up in minutes later the
days that this when i first started
doing this I mean you can't see if I do
have a lot of raisin in here was because
I spent hours and hours trying to learn
how to build a colonel I was in always
learning how to build the booters you
know the trusted leaders non trusted
movers and my height it is written that
didn't work the different to be trusted
not trusted for who
these guys again made a really great
device and from heart colonel so what a
hard colonel org and look up their
voodoo Glow droid x you this one is that
or droid x three great device or d three
entities he remember which one so many
places I have a I can't keep track but
this game in last week as well and I
already blew this one up over the
weekend i have a bunch of them behind
you all nice news moments oh well the
cool part of that kid you know the heart
problems website is they actually have
adapter kits and cool little kids so you
can do so he has a breadboard basically
inside this thing probably can't really
see it well enough but there is little
breadboard we even actually wire up your
you can wire up you know your home
temperature sensor kind of like
experiments and different things on this
board plug it into the board there is a
little plug on the bottom of this
underneath here that actually points
into this port right here and so these
two will merge with each other and now
you actually have secretary that's
connected from gpio you can do I swear a
see spi all from this so that's just
this little bit yeah they have a bunch
of resistors they have a little motor
pack the cool part about you know this
is they have all the little breadboard
and everything in it that you can just
do experiments and really internet of
things like but here is a cool thing I
think I took I was mentioned it earlier
this is an emm emm FC basically this is
$79 it's a lot of money but it's a 64
gig of memory this is four to five times
faster than an SD card and the rights
are not the problem anymore and it is
super fast it's just amazing how fast
this little guy you know get up and
running quickly um but that's just this
little bestie this is the samsung some
cortex a9 or the x3 system no droid x or
droid you 38 km/h long but that's that
well Xu has another derivative it's
called the action II and so it's 0 droid
dash X you
that one actually has power management
built it so you can see how much power
is being utilized by cpu memory all the
different I oakridge stuff on the board
so they actually built into it and you
have to get a special or less image
basically enable that within the
Colonel's then you can actually ask how
much power amusing so then you can take
reason find LCD screen you can find
basically take your little LCD screen
and basically do your plumbing and take
the wiring off with the LCD screen I
guess I can't open it because it's one
of those steel but anyways it is an LCD
screen there is pins that are exposed
here you just put your header pins on to
it just like you would do on a Raspberry
Pi you have these things exposed so what
you're doing is actually soldering this
on to the board and then you can then
wire directly off of their little red
board or off of their little kit and I
connect the two and now you actually
have an LCD screen attached to your
little o droid device or your
temperature sensor or my lock mechanism
and you have to type in the secret
password you can put actually put on
push buttons on the board as well as
well so you can actually make you can
use effects or some other kind of
utility that you can actually do
selectors so from a menu system can do
all that built right into build a lot
LCD screen which is pretty cool very
nice and we have more devices yeah so
this guy here we again you're talking
about imx6 this is on a utile UTI light
from the same compusa compound copula a
solid on Israel this is a cortex I mean
this is a projects a nine point four two
gig of memory the guys made so if you
want to not have to worry about playing
around with os's playing around with any
of the being some built-in this is a
great gateway like device this is a cool
job of desktop device
it runs really fast and it's really easy
so the OS already comes pre-loaded on it
you just plug in ethernet not affecting
your DVI or HDMI and us being rice this
is I think a hundred hundred ninety nine
dollars i'm just taking a while yes or
$225 but the price as the OS is already
built for you you have a support channel
through these guys to actually get
update soon so if you want to get away
from having to deal with the alessa this
company makes an oem like kit that you
can actually buy and use today and I
can't look sensors and things that you
without what you do you're so so think
about you got a good sense you can plug
a bluetooth module in it so we have
basic bluetooth adapter you can plug the
bluetooth adapter into this you can have
you have a bluetooth sensor then it
communicates that we move to the doctor
goes the java staff and then you do your
programming and communicate with your
application through the sensor that's
our so it doesn't expose the things that
easily but it all depends in one type of
sensor you're actually catching yeah but
it's more than that for deep tweets meet
sighs yeah this is a great game great
like device uh-huh we can run like java
you can run oh my god yeah we run a
great web service or you know any kind
of mad men switching with john running
south on top it's right yeah yeah that's
very nice we we have a even a complex
even processing running on another
device for even antennas and things like
that yes you can really build local so
think about in a pharmacist do we get a
server way up in the back end that has
you know all the to say you have all
these sensors are also negate its the
back end and it's flowing the gateway
will say it can't say this is a home
system that is connected to an iranian
network or some kind of a device is
connected to you know fly out somehow
and it costs push your data up straight
so what you can do is to localize
processing to localize in linux on
system process the data and then send
the database
you know what you consider is important
and then you send that out oh you want
to calculate leave you a bunch of Java
object courses on then I just think it's
not just reading sensors and sent to the
problem because we did you have the
intelligence or commit many times like
to have a boat or a car running the
desert yeah absolutely you know it's
punchy so how can I be connected yet
disconnected or how can I get migrated
from here there so that's a great
gateway device 10 years very nice so
that's that one wow there's another one
longboard I came up with another imx6 a
lot of imx6 freescale devices but Joanna
this is just what I happen to get reason
and this one here is another quad days
system 2 Giga memory you know they have
all the GPIO staff expose that you can
actually do something with it as well
the different pronounce you sent to buy
the adapter expansion where it's just
like the rest of assistance so it's it's
not as the same is around 35 because it
shows you that you got over here or
chosen the expansion directly get to do
a little over there but it is doable and
impossible oh there's a DB on 89 I was
talking about to loose you really was
serial connector and the price i think
the high was written on 139 again want
to do then yeah I in and they get a dual
bond so there was a dual decimal so as
you go down the configurations so the
cool part about so one more and all the
other manufacturers make a single a dual
and quad and why would we why's that
important well I wanted to see if I get
it on bigger my application running on a
single floor or grassland fire today how
can I find out if I scale from so as I
throw on a multi cpu system a dual core
so I can we propose des animaux single
then i deploy to a tool that i can't
afford to upon its kind of see the
difference and see if I'm really
utilized in the system efficiently so or
am I really parallel or thing I really
run you know on a quad base system
efficiently so you can use that
environment really cheap and a cool part
is this you can design your application
to fit your needs so this
me then they have the ability but if
you're finding that you're not getting
throughput not getting the you know the
data rate if you want you can come sail
to a duel and do performance analysis
there so you can get all three kids and
then find the one that about that you
need for you again this is just for you
to try to get a proof of concept get up
and running of course you work with a
vendor to make a portfolio at the end
the end product this device can be built
but the cool part is the ability to
actually have us a signal to open apply
and then the price went to keep it up if
you can actually try those and then find
out oh yeah I own you too I don't give
for what I'm mrs. alone isn't that
intensive and so that brings down to
price per unit only developing a product
that's very nice is great and you know
that we are running to another challenge
I ochi developer challenge you know and
if someone just buy one of this board
and have some kind of problem and if
they send some question in our support
forum can you help us absolutely we have
a group of cells look people are saying
and I'm always available I always answer
questions all the time and look at the
raspberry PI's website so alike that if
you have some problem running our
children in a different board with Java
you can give us the feedback and Gary
you will have a very support which is
very very nice and great opportunity
yeah if you find a poor that's running a
glimpse version of Linux like a regular
Ubuntu were like a debian you know kind
of off the shelf so to speak linux and
you find us know i'm working with java
absolutely reach out to check or go and
let us know because i hadn't found one
yet then we don't work on so again we
try to make java is agnostic to the
platform it's running on we try to make
sure the compliances inspect and make
sure that i'm really well make sure they
were complying with the accent in these
cases so on but again we have people see
before we make sure that we run really
well on the architecture and the
agnostic to a problem so we find a
machine very nice and could you shed a
little bit your experience we've less
project suggests the plays jazz machine
that you presented during chapel 1 and g
box sure what kind of questions you ask
how was the project of the challenges
and everything because i remember that
during defaults you did some magic at
last moment yeah you know it's amazing
we have devices that we using over and
over and over again and then I'll sudden
get moved out of an environment that you
used to and you move it to another place
to bring it out everything works and
then the day before we're supposed to go
live something happen they don't know
what happened but the Raspberry Pi
decided to go how to left field rise so
I quickly figured out a few things one
of the things about some of the devices
and these aren't and these little low
assistances they kind of play on the
same bus and so the rest reply the
network kind of interacted with the USB
bus because that's where it's playing on
and so when you did that we ended up
finding we were getting like it would
lose the network and so I ended up
having a static basically put in the mac
address inside the interfaces file
directly and map it so when it ever in
lost the network it would come back up
and still use the same mac address which
would then be was the same IP address
because what it did is that she was
still up but the network without Oh
friendly yeah so you have a robot is
trying to take signals and you're trying
to communicate to something in this case
it's important to have a reliable
communication point to advise yeah and I
do remember that each of the kind of
grecian grosses that you just discover
that i'm gonna need to warm up life like
Somalia and it's you know the physical
state of things we're working in a cold
room and so the board kind of gets
smaller or working in a hot land so we
were actually mostly working in a really
common pot space and so they're
currently was expand and so when we
moved it to the hall where it was really
cool as it went into a truck
not really cold not too there on the
place trunk so our collaboration you
know because we know this is just a fun
project and he will take a bunch of
parts off the shelf and try to build
something interesting and so there's a
lot of experimenting with isolated CSPI
all the different amount gpio stuff and
we found that you know the physical
world versus you know the zeros and ones
versus the physical world the physical
world doesn't play zeros and ones your
end zone you know you have to eat up the
simple little things if walking on a
floor the vibration of it as the arm
comes down and if you skip the floor is
on the robot is on a floor that this
group can move the robot can't handle
for the piece so it won't or shoots and
so we try to put in the ability to be on
hand for that attention but when gravity
plays the physical world plays into it
that someone stepping on the floor it
added a little bit more cushion so when
peace came down the timings on I said we
found as we actually had to go really
fast out to us out to an area and then
we did Mike remembers down to piece
together so we if we use stepper motors
and versus the motors that we lose we
probably would be better more precise
you know Roger do you use it a lot of
circles yeah so budget was budget you
know no clue about servicing radio
controls and all that so so it was all
you know searching on the internet
trying to find out how do we do this and
we'll go up and grab a motor controller
and then we have to port the motor
controller to work in Java and then we
had the court SPI bus you know a llegar
to turn the lights on the chess board we
use i squared C to communicate a new
route do you use of both I square C
Wilson's yeah yes so yeah so we has
basically enabling disables the camera
this is actually 2i square C buses on
the Onalaska high or even to ya so you
actually the cameras on the second bus
it's on a I thinking five head I could
be completely wrong that is alive is it
let's do a lid on my brain still works
like that um but we basically have to
disable the camera to not use that bus
and then enable it to we can use the ice
receipt but the robot actually used only
1i squid see boss it's the good cop
Jennifer did you been at a camera had a
gyro and some funny partner nice race
devices and some of the ones nearby from
my dog food whatever our kind of locked
to me an address and so if one had
multiples like GPS or who we used them I
sell wrong there's gyros haja so we
wanted to know where the piece was and
so he had different gyros on different
spots on yarn to know where it was in
time so we had four or five gyros or
four or five gyros there's only two
addresses yep that we could use and so
we had to then figure out well how can i
get for gyros to work on 2i squared C
bustles well so that's where we would
flip the camera back on and on and so
inside the tooth pad you actually have
used on it disabled the camera port to
use the gyroscope compass app and so you
can see the compass movement but the
interaction of most of the rest of the
stuff is exposed forever i square C for
you to expansion and fun things so we
didn't want to tie up the main gpio I
swear a seat for the common joke so we
missions would be five to be for the
gyro and why that direct and then
disable the camera or in the other than
ever so we can basically institutional
hot switch back forth between state and
you don't have to rethink and you can
use go from camera now then go to the
gyro camera to a gyro and so you just
put the seat back and forth very nice
very nice else that was an interesting
you know well oh no how do we do this I
still want to have the iceberg seat
because you want people to play and so
thanks for sharing his experience and
knowledge we hold us
and so we could see that do you have
many many different types of boards
beyond a raspberry pi i think that
raspberry pi and Intel Galileo is the
most popular because a lot of media
rounded but you can find different
solutions to your project depending on
the size and on the amount of resource
you need like a bigger boards like the
one that you show many times they have
4i spicy buses oh yeah that sort of us
yeah 1030 air sometimes if your project
is very complex you can look forward for
this type of boards and as you can see
we didn't talk about that 300 or 400
dollar boards and the 200 is max to have
a kind of laptop power inside another
project which is a lot it's amazing how
embedded space is increasing and how
Java is being supported in our just
bored thanks for doing that possible for
us because as regular developers we can
just download the things and it just
works works that's that's that's the
goal of making it so i can say you find
something that doesn't work by all means
let us know you know don't you say hey
java doesn't work i get a little bit
more feedback like oh my god debian
wheezy linux OS on this machine and
here's the machine you know we have it
why only as well i'll definitely try
okay let me let me use this hook so i
can show you where you can post
questions about to have the very support
and i can also help if I if you go to
the community but Oracle cone in the
button you will find here we go Java
embedded very simple community article
dot-com go to drive embedded and here we
have yochi developer challenge so you
can hold your questions here
and we will be happy to support you and
if you have some problem with some JDM
in a specific board please let us know
and there we can can help you so you
have the privilege of having the very
support which is nice and Gary do have
some minutes for the some questions from
the audience so if someone wants you
make any type of question here around
the challenge or any technical one we
are ready to answer your question so
let's wait a little bit and see so we'll
wait for questions there's another board
coming out from freescale oh it's all
the riot bored living on right all right
at bar I LTE or in its a sub Raspberry
Pi price point really small low end
system all the GPIO kind of exposed on
this little cool board and that's gonna
be coming out soon very nice you can go
to raspberry sorry why it boring it's
kinda is still a riot and the cool part
about it is it's on using arm the RV 7
verses on v6 very nice uh let's see uh
East Java Sea embedded device going to
support device X's API if yes do you
know when a great question I'm not sure
how I should answer that one um there is
you know I think at javaone last year I
think there was talk about the device
access i GRE and where things are going
and emergence of a me and SE and kind of
I remember how they show the bullets &amp;amp; M
me and SE and kind of like the Knicks
and should all kind of be the same so I
I believe that there will be something
coming out i'm just not sure the exact
dates of one of it be available i'm not
that the person to ask that question but
you know by all means ask the question
on the otn website and I'm sure somebody
will probably be able to answer that
question that's a very good question of
when
be available and what does that mean
yeah we don't have any other way it's
just a matter of time yes okay very nice
more questions my friends thanks mihai
for this question this nice question we
are right for more question okay so i
would like to say thanks to very very
special moment for me i was kind of
there's also been here in these very
nice environment is this is disneyland
for a java a better developer you know I
see you know my parcels like if everyone
survived so un-fun and usually my answer
is always yes I'm having fun christmas
time is every week or every other week
or every other month you know because it
get new devices and your things let's
play you know try to make things
possible so when you guys actually take
job and load it onto a device and start
running with it that it just works so
yeah that's my pool bar I love seeing
people try and experimenting with job
and running on these devices and seeing
what they can do it's amazing what some
people will do with these devices and I
can't wait to see what the challenge is
gonna bring about oh yeah yeah I heard a
lot some wine project soooo it just like
a trinket so noisy whining isn't whining
like we want your children wine or is it
to be a wide device oh so I might have
to test that what how much comes out and
how long it takes us to get funny talk
about but uh we have maker fret next
month me and will you be there I believe
I will be there i was i was asked today
if I would actually be sitting boots
tough time so yeah we probably will have
a bunch of devices and different things
there as well but article will have a
deep space there and we have
rocking on jotham that yes you'll see us
there again right yeah yeah we will be
there having fun with Gavin healthy you
to have fun with java and the challenge
the IOT developer challenges just
running used to have more than one month
to write your project put your idea to
run and show us and try to win a java
one conference pass plus the flight
isn't it awesome yes they can't beat
that yeah make all kind of expenses
Caitlin where do I sign that's right
you're going to do something look you
don't get it for free so you got to work
in make it really interesting then a
raspberry pi is great but you can do
something beyond a raspberry pi I bet
you that with together a bunch of notes
up you know that you do board like a
toad you is really cheap at the low end
boy just a single for one is really
compelling I think the price is like
under ahundred dollars and so and then
the seats to do with all those little
contraptions and adapters climbing
playing basically you can just really
fun things we got another question oh
good do you all right desta the HML
explain HTML s.a.m so that's I believe
isn't that the Cepheid we know i'm not
familiar with the the sam a five de yeah
we've not only at not like i would
assume i don't know what that yeah I
never if I had more details I could
probably explain it but that is any I'm
not sure if that's a microprocessor is
at the the Arduino side of things let's
see so i suggest you to publish this
question in the forum so we can research
a little bit national and give you the
answer so I usually know a lot of the
acronyms but I'm yeah the families yeah
I remember you Jin that that's not a arm
like name at the end the way the at
Mount is but the other isn't and so I
just don't know what that one is Africa
yeah so we are going to to find out more
information and yes
okay more questions so we're being told
to our heads off you know well done so
that's it I would like to thank you
again here we have your land from OG n
we have yada singer from global good and
we are here to to help help you support
you and looking forward to see your
project in IOT developer challenge so
hope to see you at javaone yes
definitely and I can't wait to see your
kind of experiments that you come up
with thanks i might have to reproduce it
myself if they're really cool oh yeah
thanks everybody for watching us and
hope to see you next Monday we will be
talking about robot with Java sweet
sweet so else I'm going to learn more
about lego mindstorm with Gary and we
will be showing Lego written in Java
next monday so hope to see you there
thanks everybody for watching us thanks
Oracle technology Network for making it
possible bye bye hi guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
