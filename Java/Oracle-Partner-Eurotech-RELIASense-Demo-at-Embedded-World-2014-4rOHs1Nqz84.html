Model T I'm product marketing manager
here take your tech is an Italian
company providing technologies for the
iud world today here are the oracle good
we are announcing a new products
reliance is a cloud connected
environmental monitoring system that is
basically used in Europe and areas as
well as sinister plan to monitor the
quality of deer this is the sensor it's
very rugged and compact sensor to be
deployed outdoor and is capable he
basically embeds multiple sensors
monitor the quality of the earth like
particulates air pollutants
electromagnetic fields irradiation the
system is as I said cloud-connected so
it's capable of ripping the data from
the sensor and pushing the data over
over the cloud where the data can be
analyzed and can be displayed as we can
see our international the system he is
intelligent so we can do real-time
analysis of the data and we can send
alerts to the users if there is any
conditioners on the air the system
basically here is showing a couple of
sensors and within the system we go Co
to Co humidity 03 in 10 of course
temperature crashing
the system is deep i can be also display
for mobile application running on iOS as
well as on android and here we have an
example for simple application running
on an iOS device this is data coming in
real time and i can also get
notifications from the system is p data
is outside a specific range so the
system is can scale from a single device
to a network of sensors may they are
fully autonomous and capable of
monitoring the environment of the
motions the sensor is based on java
technologies we do use embedded java
technologies as well as the back insist
there is justice and this is a kind of
example of peyote technologies used from
the sensor to the backend application
where we can do real-time data access
thank you
ha
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
