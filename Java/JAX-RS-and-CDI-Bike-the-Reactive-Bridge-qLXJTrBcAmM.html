coming to this jax-rs and CDI bike
directive bridge session
so before we start and very quickly a
few words about us so my name is David
Alaba C I work at Oracle in the
organization that is responsible for
Java SE Java EE we are also responsible
for open source projects such as
GlassFish Jersey our org is also
responsible for commercial product such
as WebLogic server and other cool stuff
like the event project that was just
open source during the keynote before
that I spent 10 years at Sun and before
Sun I spent four years working on Java
so basically by looking at the evolution
of my Orkut you can clearly see that
I've been involved in the Java space
since quite some times and my name is
Josie I live in Paris area
I provided here's some links what we're
going to talk quite a lot about
completion stage and completable future
and the interaction with the jax-rs API
and if you check my youtube account I
have several talks especially on the
topic of the completion stage stuff I'm
also on and also for our site and the
proud member of the Paris Java user
group
so this was me some months ago
a Jeff acoustic conference in Sweden
where I was giving a talk and someone in
the audience
tweeted that it's not a real conference
unless you read or actor safe harbor
statement at least once so please enjoy
now today we're going to talk about
future but future as in the concurrent
util package not future as in future
stuff that we might do in a product so
we're on the safe side
so we can basically ignore what is being
said there next is our personal
disclaimer the on French it's much much
easier than others understanding French
speaking English now I'm not French but
don't tell Josie so let first set the
stage so today we're going to talk about
reactive now if you look at directive
manifestos it defines things like
elasticity like responsiveness
I think message passing those kind of
things by reactive in the context of
this presentation we really mean
reactive as the ability to respond
efficiently to some kind of event that
are passed so basically we will take
some of the API that are part of the
Java platform like Jack's arrest and CDI
too and we will kind of extract them
from Java and we will use them in a pure
Java C context having said that all the
patterns that we're going to present
today will also perfectly work in a pure
Java environment and the idea is really
to look on how we can leverage those API
and the Java EE compression stage API to
basically have this reactive had this
reactive capacity to your to your
application and once you will get the
parents that we will present once you
will apply those patterns to your
application at the end of the day your
application will exist obviously be
using a synchronous message passing
capabilities but at the end of the day
they will scale more and they will be
more responsive so that's really what we
mean by reactive today
so the first API that I want to discuss
is the jax-rs API we'll spend a fair bit
of time on jax-rs because basically our
session is based on how we can better
use Jack's address using this hi this
reactive ID so we have just released
Jack's rs21
along with Java 8 Jack's rest one comes
with different enhancements like support
for service and even support for Jason B
and so on and so on we're gonna we
basically will skip that today we will
focus on one specific feature that has
been added in Jack's rs21
and that is a new reactive invoker so to
explain what the what that reactive
invoker solve let's first look at the
jax-rs client API that we have inject
the rest - so injector is - we basically
have an API that we can use to easily
consume a remote rest endpoint and the
way it work well first you need to have
a client object so that's basically a
client-side container that you can use
to consume remote endpoint you get it
through this method called so client
will learn the client and you will get
that kind container it's convention over
configuration
I haven't specify anything but obviously
I have the ability to configure that if
I need to once I have my client
container I need to construct a web
target a web target is bar basically
some kind of glorified URL so it's
basically where on the network is more
remote rest endpoint I have my web
target so next I need to construct based
on my target my request so that's
basically the request that I would like
my client-side container to issue and
then we see at some point in time I will
issue that request so basically I will
tell my client container to issue that
rest request so in this case for example
we see that this is a get request it
could be a post request it could be a
delete request it doesn't really matter
and you see that what we are expecting
to get in return is a return is a
forecast object
and given that we have this kind
container that we can use multiple time
obviously we need to make sure that we
close it it implemented to close every
interface so that's one easy way to deal
with that concern
so in jax-rs 2 we have discount API we
have this fluent API you get the plan
builder from the client builder who you
get a client from the client you said
the web target from the web target
consumer request and finally you invoke
the request bail response now if you
look at the bottom of the slides we have
a typical request so we have the ability
to set the headers and so on it doesn't
really matter but what is key here is
the fact that the gate is blocking so
the kind container will issue the
request and basically my method will
block until we get the result from the
remote end point now in jax-rs 2 we also
have a synchronous capabilities so if
you don't specify anything that will be
a blocking request so asynchronous
request but if you look at the bottom of
the slide I have this a sync method so
this is basically to tell to the jacks
rest and container that I want to use
the assignment worker and if you look at
the return type of that request
invocation we don't have a string
anymore in this in this case but we have
a future of string so the basically
means that we have an object that we can
use in the future to basically get the
result from the request invocation
now if we if we do those that kind of
request we will answer we will basically
have a non-blocking code so our method
will return right after the get right
but you know that to access a future
object we need to do a get and the issue
is that that gate is blocking so with
that we haven't sold anything we have
just delayed a problem we still have a
blocking behavior and obviously we don't
really want that the issue is that if it
takes forever for the remote endpoint to
send a result well our code will be
blocked forever so what you need to make
sure is you need to make sure that you
at least have a timeout right so if it
takes more than 5 seconds in this case
we'll have an exception so our code will
be blocked at word for 5 seconds which
is not ideal but it's better than it be
hanged forever now we can also do these
kind of things so instead of directly
accessing the future object we can check
if there is some reason in that object
and if there is we can access it so it
it doesn't really solve the issue
and what you also need to make sure is
that you set some timer but now a judge
access level to make sure that again if
for some reason you don't get a response
from the remote endpoint your code is
not hanged forever now the good news is
is that in Jack's arrest two we have a
facility that allows us to basically
work around those blocking issue and
that's an invocation callback facilities
so it's basically an interface that has
two method that need to be implemented
completed and failed and the name are
pretty obvious
so the completed callback will basically
be invoked when we have the result from
the remote endpoint and failed will be
invoked if something goes wrong so it
works like this so I'm still so this is
a normal jack service request using the
asset invoker
to tell to my client container that this
is indeed a distinct invocation and now
when I do the request I pass it an
invocation callback
invocation callback that needs to have
two callbacks completed to deal with the
response that will be signed at some
point in time by the remote endpoint and
fail if something goes wrong now let's
put that into perspective so this is a
typical micro-services scenario where we
have one travel agency services that
need to consume multiple back-end
services in this case we have four
back-end services and the idea of the
scenario is that we have a user that
comes in the travel and gentle services
will invoke the customer services to get
the history of that users once we have
that we will invoke the destination to
have a potential destination that we can
suggest to that user based on its travel
history and for each destination that
we're about to suggest we would not like
to have some weather information and
some coding information so the user
comes in and travel agency services will
be the client of those four back-end
services and it has to answer with like
five or ten destination with all the
details like forecast and pricing for
the given users now
this is pretty obvious but if we put
some cost on some cost on some weight on
the request invocation that we have to
do we clearly see that if we go through
a pure blocking serial approach it
doesn't make sense it will take like
five seconds to return those results so
we clearly that scale is not something
that we want to do on the other hand we
see that we can optimize our
orchestration workflow between those
different services invocation so for
example the first services that we need
to invoke is the customer little
services once we have that we have to
invoke the recommendation destination
services but once we have the
destination to suggest we can invoke in
parallel the quoting services for that
given destination and the weather
forecast for that same given destination
so if we applied again the cost of those
requests we see that at the end of the
day we should have something that is way
faster now let's look on how it can work
with the jax-rs
to API and with this invocation callback
facility and let's simplify the scenario
a little bit let's just pretend that we
have only two service system consume the
destination services and the weather
services so how we would write that code
using the jax-rs two api we have a first
request that buzz if you get the
destination the recommended destination
it's an a sync request right given it's
in a sync request we have to pass it an
invocation callback an invocation
callback has to call back the completed
that's the callback that will be invoked
when we have the result so when we have
the destination what are we what are we
doing well we'll basically go over all
the distinction that we have and for its
destination we will do another request
another rest request it will be nothing
requests so that mean that we have to
pass it an invocation callback
invocation callback with to call back
including the completed that will deal
with the result so in this case we just
get the forecast information from the
remote endpoint and we had it to a map
for that given destination
and obviously we have to implement the
fail callback for the two type of
requests that we have so I guess that
you want you well you see where I'm
going to this is basically going to be a
callback hell and I had to simplify my
scenario to two services just to try to
make it fit on to slide the original
basic scenario had four services so that
kind that kind of code is difficult to
write debug and maintain so clearly it's
not something that will work over time
and that's the issue when you have
services with dependency so the good
news is that and that's the point of
this talk in Jack's rs21 we have a new
reactive invoker so you see at the
bottom of the slide we have this rx
method that is basically used to tell to
the jax-rs kind container that we want
to use an a synchronous reactive invoker
and if you look at the return type of
that invoker it's not a future object
anymore
it's a completion stage of the response
type the main difference between the
future and the completion stage stuff is
that the completion stage a Java 8 so
it's kind of modern API where's the
future stuff in Java 5 2004 so it's
almost a very it's an older API and so
far completion stage is an interface
implemented by computable future it's a
full API the idea is really to to take a
task and this task is going to be
modeled as a lambda since we are in the
Java 8 welder and this card task is
going to be executed as synchronously in
another thread than the calling thread
by default we can pass an executor
service by the way to tell the API hey
you should be executing this task in
this given executor service or in this a
given given thread the nice thing is
that given a completion stage having the
responsibility to execute a task we can
chain other tasks on it that are going
to be executed on the completion of this
completion stage which is not the case
with the future API you you we cannot do
that in the future API so the idea is
really to create the chain of a
synchronous task here CS wanna which is
my first completion stage that will
trigger two for the tasks 21 and 22 then
22 does not trigger anything 21 triggers
31 and on the other side I also have
another task independent of those as yes
32 and both 31 and 32 are going once
they are both completed are going to
trigger CS 41 so this is basically the
kind of graph of tasks I can create
using this completion stage API this is
the big picture now
this completion stage API is quite
complex there are a lot of methods in it
also a lot of methods in the completable
future stuff it's a bit it's a bit
cluttered to to understands not easy to
understand it at first what are going to
do what we're going to do here is really
to to present the simple pattern to
solve the problem that we have set up
with David that is triggering queries on
red services given the list of
destinations we have so let's go first
the first step is to query the the
forecast backend service once we have
the the list of destinations remember we
are customer we are buying some kind of
travel somewhere and and the website
we're on wants to push us other
destination that we may be interested in
and along with those destination we want
to add to information the forecast for
this destination and a quotation of
price for that destination and
everything is distributed among several
rest services so given given a
destination unknown destination the
first thing I can I can do is query the
forecast service using this kind of
pattern most of the time this since it
is a red service what I will be getting
is in fact a JSON object so once I have
this JSON object sometime in the future
remember this is a completion stage what
I can do is what I must do sorry is ill
modulate using some basic JSON builder
code
just like this so this is a function
that is just taking a JSON object and
marshaling into into a forecast object
that data get that I can use right so
how can i trigger the execution of this
function once this completion stage is
completed well I have an API for that
query forecast this is my completion
state object then apply a Marshall
forecast the this will trigger this then
apply trigger method method call will
trigger the own marshaling of the JSON
object once it is available that is
sometimes in the future all right so I
need to rub that into a method that
takes a destination this destination
will first trigger a request on a
forecast
res server that will return a JSON
object this JSON object will be earned
my child by the the unemotional forecast
object and then once I have this
forecast object the idea is to set a
special property of my destination
object with this forecast object thus
making this forecast available directly
in my destination bin so basically this
takes a destination object and does not
do much with it it does not return a new
destination object it just set a
property inside this destination object
so this is a function that takes the
destination object and since there is a
then apply that is the triggering of the
own marshalling and then except that is
the triggering of the setting of the
property inside the object it returns a
completion stage avoid the building of
this function doesn't do anything it's
just a declaration of some kind of
methods in a pipeline so it's a it
returns immediately but of course the
the task itself will be executed at some
time in the future so once I have that I
can do the same with quotation for
instance following the exact same
pattern so if I have like three or four
property to set in my destination object
querying three or four rest services
corresponding read services I can
multiply this
number of functions this returned a
competition stage of void and this is
what I am going to use in the future so
what does my travel service will begin
to look like I have I can create this
populate destination function that
basically takes a destination and will
set the different properties of this
destination object using the result of
the querying of the rest services for
that I am going to use this static
method from the completable future a
class compatible future all of that
returns a completion stage that can that
again make as they can that again get as
a computable future using the two
computable future method then this
completion state object this olaf object
will be completed wants all the past
completion stage are going to be
completed themselves so if i have three
four or more property to set up all i
need to do is just scale this pattern by
passing more completion stage to this
olaf method which is something i can do
now the nice thing is that if I have
many threads in my executor service that
is going to execute that all those
requests are going to be executed in
parallel
suppose I have 50 properties to set up
if I have 25 threads then every thread
will handle probably two properties to
set up but if I have more than 50
threads every every query and properly
set up will be handled in it's given
thread thus making things much faster as
David showed in the in the in the big
picture image about the the the
organization of the of the of the
overall system so this is something that
takes to destination and will populate
the properties of that destination using
the querying of the rest services in an
a synchronous way and in a parallel way
right so this destination now I need to
get it from somewhere so let us do that
what I get in fact from the from the res
service from the first read service is
list of destination so what I need to do
now is for each of those destination
apply this function one by one now this
is of course the nice job for the stream
API so I can just stream this list of
destination for each destination apply
this populate destination function that
will return a compatible future that
will complete once all the properties of
that precise destination are going to be
set up all right so I have in this
stream here I have one compatible future
/ destination each compatible future
corresponding to as many comparable
future I have four properties I need to
set ok so that may be a lot really if I
have 50 destination and three properties
to set that will be a hundred and fifty
a comparable future in the end and I'm
going to put all this computable feature
in an array why because what I'm
interested in is the time at which all
those completable future will complete
and for that I'm going to to use an Olaf
static call once again and for that I
need an array so I'm going to put all
the results of this of this stream
mapping in an array okay so how can I
set up that now in my rest service
objects RS I have two patterns in fact
that first popular destination that
returns a void and takes an a sink
response and this is a jax-rs 2.0
pattern I first query my destination red
service that is going to return me a
list of destination after some JSON be
and marshaling of my JSON array object
we'll leave that aside then I can get my
completion stage by composing this
destined is this completion stage that
will get the list of destination with
the function I just wrote in a previous
slide right using the Zen compost and
the Olaf remember that this popular
destination returns itself an array okay
so this computable future Olaf will be
completed once all the destinations have
been populated with their properties I
want to set this returns an updated
destination
a completion stage and I need to pass
the payload of this completion stage to
the a sync response because this is the
way this this pattern works in jax-rs
2.0 so I need to switch this completion
stage into a compatible future and since
compatible future is an extension of a
future I can call the get method with
all the precautions that David told
showed you time outs and stuff like that
if the process takes too long now this
is I would say the old-fashioned way of
writing things since I am in and jax-rs
2.1 well I can also directly return this
completion stage and the opening of this
completion stage will be handled by the
jax-rs 2.1 API directly all right so
this is the big picture on I would say a
real world example on a non trivial
example to handle the this completion
stage API now what is happening if I
have an exception at some point I am
querying red services they might not be
here I am and maturing some JSON objects
this could raise exceptions the idea in
the completion stage API is that if at a
given point of my chain of tasks an
exception is raised then all the
downstreams completion stage will be
also raised an exception so it will it
will kind of break all the process if I
have an exception at some point but I
have methods to handle that which is
nice the first one I have is the
exceptional a method that returns a new
completion stage and I can decide if
this completion stage is in error itself
or not using that okay so let us try to
do something smart with exceptions I
know it's not easy but hey we can at
least try I also have a handle method
that takes both the result and the
exception if there is no exception then
this exception object will be new and if
it's not the case there will be
something with it so I can decide to
create a new result for instance that is
a that is near for instance if I do not
have the forecast and I can live with
that with no information on the
Podcast I can just call the set forecast
with the new object I could decide to do
that and I also went complete method
that instead of a bit of a B function
takes a big consumer that will not
return anything and that is another way
of handling exceptions so so in fact
I've got three ways of handling
exceptions with the completion stage API
so here is what it's going to do here is
the the the pattern we just wrote we
apply the the it until the young
Marshall quotation for instance object
suppose we have an exception all right
we could say all right we got an
exception so we take it with this
exceptionally method if there is no
exception this exceptionally call will
not do anything so just be transparent
in the China and decide in fact that if
an exception is raised well it's not too
bad the quotation will be new for this
object so I can still set a new value
for the property quotation of my
destination and this time my completion
stage will not be in error anymore
thanks to the use of this exceptionally
method I could also decide to use the
Andal method the pattern is not not that
nice because I've got this if-then-else
in it and since I am in a world of
lambdas and functional programming the
if then it doesn't really fit very well
in this world I think but hey you can
still use it if you if you like it so if
throwball is nearly it means that i do
not have any exception so i can just set
the quotation like that if it is null
and I decide not to do well I will need
to make a decision on what to do with
this destination object all right
okay so you've saw some examples using
the new rx invoker that is now part of
Jax rs21 you saw that for all our
example we have been using the HTTP GET
method but if it works for all the HTTP
methods which are supported by the
client API objects arise - 1 so that's
delete get head option and so on so
basically all the HTTP methods but patch
because patch is not supported by the
client API now so what we have discussed
today is also how you can basically
leverage access to one with the
compression stooge API which is part of
the java SE 8 now we also acknowledge
that there are other reactive api in the
market so the jax-rs to one
specification has been written in a way
so that in I mean it's it's mandatory to
support the completions the API but it's
also open to third party API so any
jax-rs implementer can decide to support
in addition to the compression stage api
autoreactive api and if you look at
Jersey which is the jax-rs to one well
which is the jax-rs reference
implementation we do support obviously
the compression stage that's something
that we have to but we also support the
guava stable future and we also support
our in Java and our Java 2 so the weight
work so if you want to use let's say for
example the flow bubble you first have
when you construct your client container
you need to pass it a specific invoker
provider for that API in this case it's
our explorable invoker provider so you
pass it that class and then when you do
the request you need to pass that
specific invoker to using the rx method
and there we go you can then use that
specific reactive API so basically we
could use the pattern that we have
discussed today with the compressions
that tej API but you can also use that
way of thinking but using the specific
reactive API that are in the market
again this is optional but that's
something that we do enjoy
now let's quickly quickly talk about CDI
I mean what's the link between jax-rs
and CDI well in Java 8 we have released
the CDI GSR three seven three six five
and well CDI two is addressing quite a
lot of new is having quite a lot of new
stuff but one of the things that CDI two
is adding is a synchronous event so you
know that in CDI we have since the
beginning the this nice seven mechanism
so you have this producer consumer
patterns implementation that basically
allows you to easily produce event in
your application that would be consumed
somewhere I somewhere else in Europe in
your application the thing is that until
CDI - that was purely a synchronous so
basically you were consuming the event
in the same trend as the producing
thread this is not true anymore in CDI -
so we now have the ability to raise and
consume a synchronous event so the way
it works it works exactly the same way
so we are injecting an event of a given
type and then in Syria well if it would
have been a synchronous event we would
have invoked on that event the fair
method if given that it's a NASA event
we are invoking the fire async method so
it's a new method in CDI - so this is
the producing side so basically I'm
producing an event here and obviously at
somewhere else I would like I will want
to consume that event to consume that
event I just have to define an act
nothing observable so for that I have a
method that is using this new at
observed a sync annotation and at
anytime
my an event will be fired but by that
producer my observer will be invoked in
a different thread in an icing fashion
in a focusing fashion so that's
something which is new in CI - and you
see that when we are firing an event
what we get in return is a completion
stage so that as it came in that we can
combine the completion stage that we
have discussed with jax-rs
before with that completion stage object
as well so that was a key dealing
between the two API
now you have the ability to pass an
executor services so that's something
that is done when you fire when you fire
the event basically when you are when
you are saying that you you want to
execute something as synchronously and
do not provide an executor service it
will get invoked in fact in in a common
fog during pool of the Java 8 virtual
machine but you also have the
possibility to pass an executor as a
parameter to make sure that your tasks
are going to be executed in that
executor and this is especially useful
in the in your CDI world where for
instance you have a system that is going
to fire an event and this event is
supposed to update some kind of swing
panel or jfif xpanel or if you're in the
Android space some kind of human
interface panel and you know that in
order to update this this kind of
component of graphical component use a
graphical interfaces component and
properly you need to execute that code
in a special thread in a special
executor so you can pass an executor as
a parameter here and this is really
mandatory when you want to do that for
instance swing utilities comic-con
invoke later is an implementation of the
executor interface might look quite odd
but it is the case and you can pass that
to make sure that this payload is going
to trigger the updating of a swing panel
for instance in the right in the right
thread this is why it has been added in
in CDI too and I think it's time to wrap
up there we go so wrap up time right on
time
unbelievable so today we have discussed
about the Jax rs21 API and the CDI into
API those API are part of a larger
effort that is Java 8 which was just
finalized 12 days ago 21 of September
they are quite not well next to that
there are quite some nice turf Engine
Java yet like a support force hep-2 the
servlet API support for Jason B in some
of our codes we have used the Jason B
API that allows us to easily and
Marshall and Marshall Java object and
JSON document and so on and so on so the
nice thing about most of those api is
that they can obviously are part of the
java platform and they can also be used
outside of the java platform and that's
basically what we have done today the
only thing is that if you are using the
completion stage within the java
platform you need to pass manage
executor services because the the
container has to basically manage all
the thread that will that you that will
be used so with that we have like two
minutes for questions
so yes sir
yeah Jack's arrest you can use it on top
of Java see that's not what we have been
doing here so Jack's arrest Jason B
servlet JSON P cgi-bin validation GSF is
kind of tricky and secure security is
clearly the only API which is Java only
so yeah yeah yeah and forgot to mention
that the compression stage API which is
basically the core of our talk today is
Java C yeah yeah yes
add some repeat the question
yes I'll repeat okay sorry I'll repeat
the question it was about the fact that
when you reach on a completion stage in
this jax-rs method you want to make sure
that it is still executed in an
asynchronous fashion right okay so the
answer is in fact by essence the the
task wrapped in a completion stage is
executed in a thread either of the
executor service you've passed as a
parameter because you can pass an
executor as a parameter when you create
the task or when you call the then apply
then except then compose etcetera right
or in the comment for example of your of
your Java 8 virtual machine okay so this
is guarantee because this is how the
Java AC 8 completion stage completable
future stuff works now well at this
given point you need to have the result
of that right and you you have to wait
for the result to get it so this has to
be made synchronously okay you can all
only provide the result to the to the to
the client once this result is available
so at some point you will fall back on
on some kind of synchronous call but
this synchronous call is triggered a
synchronously by the API itself there is
it's triggered one the result is
available you do not have to wait
yourself this isn't old by the API I
don't know if it answers your question
yeah okay thank you
any other questions
come on don't be shy
well then we will give you one minute
back so we would like to thank you for
our coming here we hope you enjoy it
and please make sure to leave feedback
when you leave the room thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
