different we're going to mix it up a
little bit and to mixed it to you have
to tie it all together we're going to be
for much of it we're going to be showing
the same single application we're going
to use this to show off some of the
great work that's been done in the last
year so we'll also talk about looking
forward we'll see how Java can scale
well down from there you from the cloud
all the way down to some very small
embedded devices and we'll see how
javafx scales right along with it we're
going to start over here on this Windows
machine Jasper's got up and there's an
application that we've been working on
for I guess about a month now or so and
it's a javafx app is completely written
in Java and it's a schedule builder so
it is going to show us everything that's
going on in the conference this week so
let's walk through a little bit of code
so this is the main body on the
application when we would type into the
search field in order to limit the
number of sessions that you have in
front of you or when you go to the
popover both of those things they
construct a search session filter
criteria object and they hand it to this
code the key driver is we need better
parallel libraries so we have added some
language features to make it easier to
build better more expressive libraries
and we've upgraded the collections to
support bulk parallel operations on
collections Java is you know one of the
major benefits is platform independence
the main theme of the java ee 7 platform
is productivity and html5 not all of
these specifications are led by oracle
you know IBM is contributing for example
batch Red Hat is contributing bean
validation and context and dependency
injection so it's truly a community
effort I would like to introduce project
diesel you know project easel is a
advanced tooling capability in netbeans
for html5 it's not just up to Oracle to
make the future Java it's it's also up
to all of you
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
