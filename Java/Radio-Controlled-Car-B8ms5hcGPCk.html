engineer at his aim myself who work at
cos Inge and we have a third person
David who is at an undisclosed location
at the moment and we have him on skype
and he's going to help us because we are
going to show some that interesting so
what we did was we went to Toys R Us and
we bought this radio-control truck and
we removed all the radio control related
pieces from the truck and we put a tiny
Raspberry Pi on the back and the idea
was to extend the range of the radio
signal from a few feeds to the entire
Internet so we wanted to connect the PI
to the web and then based on the data
based on the control signal that we get
through the PI Drive the truck
evey - can you give us if you can hear
us can you touch your nose okay very
good so David is connected to the public
Internet and so is this PI so the first
thing we are going to try is we'll try
to light up the lights on the front of
the truck can you try to do that for us
very cool so the light is on and what
he's using there is Safari on the iPhone
so this is a browser-based hat he just
turned on and off the lights now can you
turn the wheels left and right okay
can you spin the wheels okay now I'm
going to put it down can you try to
drive it forward a little bit
very go and back excellent
so we want you to give a little
information very cool we attach the pie
to the back there were a couple of
problems a couple of challenges we have
to solve first one was the battery so it
carries its own little battery it's a a
cell phone charger battery the truck
itself has a separate battery that helps
it travel back and forth it has a Wi-Fi
part tiny dongle that allows it to
connect to to our server and we are
going to talk about that in a moment
and we have the GPIO control in three
things the first one is the lights in
the front
second one turning the wheels left and
right and the third one is moving the
truck propelling it forward and
backwards and here is the app I little
closer so how is this all working we
looked at pi we could we Z on it we put
the Oracle JVM and we used use the P PI
for J for to access the general purposes
without what data here primarily we are
sending data to the trap that there is
nothing that will prevent us from
getting data back as well so one thing
that we have been thinking about is
getting the camera and what you want to
it so we see on the remote control where
the truck is going the technology that
we are using is html5 web sockets
powered by cos n the company that we
work for cos Inc has an enterprise grade
high performance very secure very
scalable very low latency WebSocket
server for those of you who are not
familiar with html5 web sockets the idea
is that now the browser has the ability
to have any establish a permanent
connection to a server to a WebSocket
gateway and send messages back and forth
very very quickly so the way we
connected the browser running on the
phone to the truck that's sitting here
is through the public Internet is with
the help of the using WebSocket gateway
and a so called message broker in the
world of enterprise messaging JMS
the message broker is a very common
concept the idea is that we have a pop
sub model in our case the phone is
publishing data turn on the light turn
left turn right those messages are sent
through the web with the help of the
WebSocket cabling all the way to a
message broker and then the message
broker browse those messages to anybody
who's interested in that message who has
subscribed to it so in our case is the
PI sitting on the truck that is
receiving these messages so over the
public Internet we are controlling the
truck using a web client and html5 web
clients we are controlling some Java
code running on the PI and eventually we
control the truck that is sitting there
the source code is available on github
faster the parrot controls the motor
board which which can independently
control the motor that can turn the car
right and left also the the back motor
which can which can move the car forward
and backwards so based on those you just
need to send the high signal and low
signal to that pin and that's how it's
about yeah that's right the server that
we are talking to that the PI is
connected to and that his phone was
connected to is sitting on the East
Coast so any message that was set to the
truck across the continent twice once
back in one sir</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
