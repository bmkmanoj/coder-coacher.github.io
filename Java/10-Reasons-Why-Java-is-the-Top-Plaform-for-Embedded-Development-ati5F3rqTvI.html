top 10 reasons why Java is a top
development environment for embedded
developer systems my name is Roger
Brinkley and the reason why we're doing
this particular video at this point in
time is because last Tuesday the JDK 8
early access release for armed with
JavaFX was released and this particular
release is primarily indicated are
primarily dedicated for ARM processors
it is an early release of JDK 8 so you
get all of the new functionality that's
coming in jdk 8 like the lambda prime
lambda constructs but this is is
primarily an opportunity for the arm
developers to go out and kick the tires
at jdk before jdk releases sometime in
the late 2013 now specifically this
release has another key feature in it
and that is the support for hard
floating-point support and this was
primarily tested on the raspberry we
z/os with our b6 hard floating floating
point support another key feature in
here in this release was an optimized
version of Java fx4 for Linux versions
this particular release is not the final
optimized javafx that will go in but it
is at least an optimized version of the
lagoa that will combine very nicely with
the hard floating point and we should
see what developers were seeking is a
little bit faster response time when it
comes to the javafx displays as they
come on a raspberry machine additionally
you'll find demos and samples in this
particular release that are out there
for you to try making it very easy for
you to test to see that things are
actually working on the Raspberry Pi
that you have and that the
implementation is there now by chance if
you don't want to be able to run on a
headless system there's no problem with
that because there is support for
headless arm in these environments as
well it's just simply run without the
javafx implement
station in there and then additionally
this was just tested as we said before
on the raspberries EOS and r6 hard
floating point but it should work on
other arm processors so given that why I
get the question kind of arises as to
why would arm developers or even if
method developers be interested in doing
implementation on on Java and so we're
going to give you Tim reasons today why
Java is the top and better platform so
number one in the couple's software
development from the hardware
development cycle now traditionally when
you were looking at the development
cycle for for Java with hardware and
software what you would find would be
that you would almost have a waterfall
effect of hardware development maybe do
a prototype of hardware development do
some software do some more hardware
development is more software and this
constant cycle that would go around and
so this could lead to two or more
redevelopment phases that would occur
but with embedded Java the hardware and
the software really independent and so
because the hardware is really decoupled
that allows the specific work to be
carried out within the software
environment and so this is this is going
to to break that waterfall cycle that we
talked about it now that you can now you
can just do the hardware development of
software development of parallel there
will be times when you'll want to test
out the software on the hardware and at
various points in time but it should at
least eliminate or reduce the need for
Reese pins that would normally occur
this means that your development focus
can now be on product development and
validation number two the development
and testing using standard development
testing can use standard desktop systems
through emulations now because we
decouple the hardware from the software
we don't have to do our software design
and testing on the hardware platform we
can use an emulation of that hardware
platform on our standard desktop systems
and particularly our desktop systems
that have our programming environments
on them now that's going to speed up our
development cycle because we really
don't need that Hardware in there
more we can actually go through and the
software can be fixed and redefined and
refactored without having to that
Hardware Justin of course that doesn't
mean that in the end we aren't going to
do some some hardware testing we
absolutely do need to run the software
on the hardware in the end because there
will be some differences between the
emulated environment and the actual
final environment although because our
emulated environment is going to be
using pretty much the same software is
what's going to be running on on our
platform our final platform we shouldn't
see very many changes at all number
three Java is highly productive language
with a bis runtime tools and that's
going to equal a quick time to market so
the Java development environment when we
look at what's in that environment we
can look at it into two or two distinct
areas one is the Java development
environment itself and the Java
development tools we look at the Java
development environment that's the java
virtual machine the machine that
executes the bike codes that were
generated by the java c compiler itself
now the Java language is what we're
going to write our code in and so that's
a very important part of of the piece nu
lambda api's that are coming in and
they're all part of this next piece
which is the robust java api s and so we
talk about our AP is when we were first
developing when i was first developing
with c and i first moved over to java is
like wow look at all of these these
libraries that i have access to URL i
don't have to worry about trying to
figure out how to sell all that stuff up
or write my own libraries it's all there
for me and so there's this whole set of
robust java api's we're talking about
trying to display something javafx is
one of those robust a pee is or a whole
series of robust api's here and then
finally of course the java development
tools that exist out there so NetBeans
clips IntelliJ where you can run the
entire environment you can test the the
prototypes of what you're doing you can
provide stop and breakpoints do your
recycling of everything
we have to do based upon what we're
talking about previously and in that
environment the key part is that your
development time is significantly
reduced and products can actually ship a
lot sooner now if we take a quote take a
look at a quote here that comes from
charles nutter and you can see some of
that speed in that development time so
he says in one of his twitter feet a
while back he said every time i see a
piece of c code i need to port my heart
dies a little and then I poured it
quarter of much to a quarter as much
java and i feel better well that's
pretty much the response that a lot of
people have seen when they've moved from
c to job ideas and they can do things in
about a quarter amount of time is what
they've been able to do in the past
number four create a high-performance
portable secure robust cross-platform
applications easily this is primarily
done because of all of the features of
java are really high performing portable
secure robust and cross-platform the JIT
compiler right now as far as high
performance goes is approaching the
speed of C or C++ code and the fact is
in some cases it's exceeding that time
period now we're talking about Java ME
and java SE they have they're really
optimized for a smaller footprint so
they run very robustly in those
environments and we were talking about
the portability the java bytecode itself
makes a language extremely platform
independent which means that we can
develop on one platform or we can
actually develop an RNA in the emulator
fireman and we can put it on one
platform or another platform and we can
execute on a whole variety of platforms
out there and what that means is that we
avoid platform lock in so as we want to
switch from maybe an arm process or two
and x86 or power architecture we can do
that then Java program is combined to
its Java execution environment and what
that really is referring to is the
security environment java works in its
own sandbox the sandbox environment that
you want to want to
doesn't get out of its sandbox or rarely
gets out of its sandbox and so that
means that you're in a secure
environment you know that your operating
system is safe and the execution of the
program is going to be limited to what
it has to do finally cross-platform java
works on a variety of armed b5 b6 b7 x86
and Power Architecture for linux all of
which are very good a set of platforms
cross platforms for the abetted
developer to work in take a look at some
of the speed that's going on Richard
bear had just done some experiments with
the early access release and he was
talking about this in the FX experience
blog and he said JDK is a hotspot base
vm so it's really quite zippy now he was
doing some tests on prime numbers into
this blog and so he says I cranked up
the test to find all the prime numbers
below 50,000 as you can see hot spots
faster than the native code and this is
just one example that we see here of
this I want to read more about what
Richard Berry has to say about the early
access release go to as an fx experience
blog and you can find it more
information there number 5 java isolates
your apps from the language and platform
variations we know that when we look at
various platforms we know that the C or
C++ may not be the same on each platform
the colonel might be a little bit
different or there can be lipsy
differences the nice thing is the Java
Virtual Machine those platforms Vercher
those platform variations are managed by
the virtual machine so you don't have to
worry about that so God are the problems
of memory corruption stack overflows and
other type of bugs which are you know
really kind of difficult and extremely
difficult to isolate number 6 the most
popular embedded processors are
supported allowing design flexibility so
we talk about javafx we in this
particular release for the early access
release javafx supported on ARM
architecture will be 6 and 7 with a hard
float support there but then also if
you're not going to use javafx arm
architecture v6 37 with with a hard flow
obviously if you don't use Java
X is still going to run their arm
architecture b7 vfp little india or
ameritech v5 soft float little in you
linux x86 and partner architecture and
then finally when we're looking at the
yummy environment the arm keel
development board based on the arm
cortex-m three quarters yeah will be
coming out soon number seven support for
key and bevan features such as no
footprint power management low latency
so when we look at all of our devices
that are running in the java environment
all of them are constrained in some way
or another even though even your devices
that are sitting in your in your server
farms are constrained but we're talking
about a bed space or often constrain and
ram or wrong or maybe fluctuating power
or some type of power could straight
there and typically that has to do with
with an environmental constraint or it
might be related to a cost constraint
the good thing is is that when it comes
to memory resources job may be embedded
can be running 130 k bytes of ram to 350
k bytes of ram of rom or up to 700 k
bytes of ram to 150 k bytes of rom so
that's a great environment for the small
tight-knit bennett systems we talk about
java SE embedded itself they can run it
as low as 32 megabytes of RAM or thirty
nine megabytes of wrong which is a
pretty substantial when it comes to low
memory resources easy enough to run on
any Raspberry Pi that you would buy
today but all these systems are ideally
optimized systems so that things like
dedicated embedded functionality like
always on or intermittent supply or
headless and connected devices these
environments have been targeted
specifically for them for that
environment number eight you can
leverage a huge developer developer
ecosystem the expertise existing kui
there are 9 million developers out there
in the world that are in ojama and
that's as a huge resource pool when it
comes to getting developers to work on
your particular project
additionally there's some existing code
and training that exists in a variety of
places one is the java and by the
community of java.net and the others are
variety of conferences we just recently
held the Java embedded conference at
javaone back in October we're looking at
doing at least one of those regionally
around the world additionally you'll be
able to find java at the freescale
technology forums and so you'll find the
environment there and then finally
there's a new embedded development
conference is coming out is called J
focus embedded 2013 it'll be in
Stockholm if you're in Europe it's in
the first week of februari I really
encourage you to take a look at that
conference and become involved with it
number nine you can easily create in to
end solutions integrated with Java
back-end services so the the internet of
things are really not doing a an
autonomous task I say single task here
but really autonomous task take a look
at an event drink dispenser it's taking
you know we may be able to take a credit
card payment so it's got to communicate
it back to the credit card company it
may be the company that's the one sells
a particular beverage that beverage
maybe baby monitored by the beverage
company itself so that it knows when to
restock or how much is being sold a
particular beverage so they can keep
things just in time so they can have
just-in-time inventory and lower their
inventory costs associated with that
talk about an embedded house powering
power monitoring system and and you may
want to if your houses if the house
power is monitoring system you might
want to turn the lights out using
something like your cell phone or from a
web application or the power company
itself may be monitoring how much power
you're actually using it and may reward
you for using power in a different time
but they may also be monitoring the
system to know okay we need to we need
to make sure this this organization has
more power or less power or you know
something on those lines what's good is
it's good for collecting and what's
really important here is
in all of those systems is it collecting
and transferring of data securely to
some java backend server now it doesn't
necessarily have to be a Java back-end
server but it certainly is great what it
is but the key part there is securely
transferring that data and both java SE
and emmy have some very secure
environments to where you can do that
and the technology is there unlike some
other implementations that are out there
that are really not securely based when
it comes to transferring this
information then there's also the
possibility because on the SE embedded
system you can also include a glassfish
server and database as well so some
analysis might actually be able to be
done on the embedded device fact is you
might even turn that embedded device
into a some type of server itself to
where it would respond to requests sort
of information from it but the key part
here is that it's an end-to-end Java
solution so let's turn to our last piece
which is number 10 the solutions there's
a whole bunch of solutions from
constrained devices to server class
systems we can take a look at some of
the examples that are set here so the
Livescribe pen which is really an
autonomous type of pen situation the
Kindle device the blu-ray player Cisco's
advanced voice over IP phone Kronus in
touch smart time clock energy ICT smart
metering ETFs automated meter management
Rico printers the Stanford automated car
when you're talking about really moving
up and done you know higher type of
management systems I mean think about
the car it ran up Pikes Peak by itself
variety of systems that are inside their
they're all java-based did much better
than the helicopter that was that was
filming it so the top 10 reasons why
Java is the top environment for embedded
development number one it decouples
software development from hardware
development cycles number to the
development of testing using standard
desktop systems simulation number three
highly productive language ap is in
runtime
is going to equal a quick time to market
number four create high-performance
portable secure robust cross-platform
applications easily by Java isolate your
apps from the language and platform
variations number six most of the
popular embedded processors of supported
allowing design flexibility number seven
support for key embedded features low
footprint power management low latency
number eight leverage huge java
developer ecosystem expertise existing
code at nine million developers that are
out there number nine easily create in
the end solutions integrated with java
backend services and number ten
solutions that exist already out there
from constrained devices to subvert this
is to server class systems so as we said
earlier the JDK early access release for
our with JavaFX is out there ready to
use kick the tires Duke gives it a big
thumbs up he says give it out there run
your Raspberry Pi on it and don't forget
make the future Java</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
