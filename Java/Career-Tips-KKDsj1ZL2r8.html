four loko ab which is the biggest
hosting company in Brazil so I midler
Eduardo Kihara actually developer for
almost 10 years now currently working
with Android I'm a mobile specialist and
also organize their own google developer
communities and this kind of stuff my
name is Felipe a mouse a software
developer actually I'm more generalist
then I'm not specialist in any language
I love java I love C sharp I love almost
everything that you can program even
vacations right ok love to play also
very nice and high I've been working
with IT for about 10 years also i
started in 2000-2005 something right and
today i'm currently playing around with
IOT stuff android some some things
around dotnet also and as always java i
love to java facts I went to java want
to play with java java facts and the
touch screens and uh that's it cool yeah
I like it um well everybody here on this
table has a evangelist experience
previous experience right so like what
do you guys think there are the most
important thing for someone to be
successful in this like wow let's say
the JIT career yo guys didn't go ahead
oh that's a very good question i think
that when i first started you have to be
i had to be very open-minded so in my
first job as a developer i used to work
with the cobol so this is something that
not a lot of people her a lot right now
and after that i have had a chance to
work with visual basic 6 then i went to
c++ in line and then shall I cabal
yes actually it's it's a very
interesting language it's different from
Java and other language because you have
a lot of rules that you have to follow
and but you have to be very open-minded
to learn stuff so when you are starting
of course there are a lot of things that
you'll love the dish that you can study
and go deeper on that but you can you
should be open-minded to start somewhere
to have the the all the environment of a
company understand how things works how
project works know people and you have
to be very open-minded for that so I
think that's for starters I think that's
a very good tip so what you have to say
about it yeah as I said I always loved
it to develop software right so since
the beginning I was if everyone anyone
asked at me oh you need to develop
developing pytam in C++ C sharp vb6
whatever language they asked at me and I
was open-minded to do that I never chose
my most loved ones right actually I love
java in c-sharp the same thing right
both languages are really cool and
really neat but the thing of being open
minded and be aware that each technology
each programming language has their
their own strong points and the weak
points it's a thing that I think it's
important you need to consider all the
options and choose for the technology
that is more suitable for the solution
that you are looking for sometimes you
are going to go with cobol because and
also if you don't experiment how you
ever know yeah what I like that's nice
oh it's very important what about you
came how do we started hello that's a
tough question because oh I would need
lots of time to explain how it started
but like I'm kind of different from you
guys like I I didn't really started as a
programmer like I decided to to be a
programmer from
in the past because i started my well
the first the first thing that I studied
was performing arts then I n well it's
hard to be an artist in Brazil so like
but I always liked it computers like
I've learned logo you know logo local
language right logo when I was eight
years old which was always the one with
the turtle right that you had to move
yeah yeah the turtle around and yeah I
was eight years old Jana TK 3,000
computer ha ok guys in there won't know
but it was actually an apple true clone
Brazilian about you clone like so I have
always enjoyed technology and everything
so and started to to enjoy more dad and
I am then in after i was already
graduated I went to study a system
system development in a lack in a lab
analysis and then switch it my career to
IT so like it was something that I
really didn't point in the beginning it
was something natural you I usually say
that there are some people who chooses
their profession and there are some
people who are chosen by their preferred
the most were chosen because like things
have started to work well and then I I
realized I wasn't right there so I say
oh I really love this I enjoy doing this
it's it's easier to make money with this
so let's embrace it holidays right wow
you've never tried to to to to be on our
toes in Brazil okay okay very very cool
air you should try let's see I think you
see like lots of things that I've
learned on this profession I really
useful to me right now so like it has
never been hard to meet you to speak in
public to make a presentation it was
really actually it was pretty easy and I
spectacle swearing to do that stuff and
I save up
I oh I was used to do stuff much harder
than that so let's just get in front of
people in present something was a lot
easier than yeah get dressed makeup and
try to but one thing that I you said
that I think it's really important for
anyone that is starting a career I think
being in the place that you feel well
that you feel alive and the makes you
being in your element it's important for
anyone so it doesn't matter if you love
being an artist or love being the
developer if you are in the point of
your life that you say hey i love this
I'm not working then playing now having
fun ok so I think this is something that
also moving moving me a lot now so I
think it's very important that are being
a developer it's not only about the
technical skills of your house to have a
lot of soft skills so you have to know
how to talk to people how to communicate
how to share your thoughts not only on
your team but with the community as well
so you have to be able to go there and
talk to people express yourself about
anything you like and also be an artist
of course helps a lot yeah and
developers has a lot of fishes with that
yeah you know what I think that it's
pretty cool on the technology field is
that there is a space for everybody like
and it's already a science made with
collaboration from many others so like
it's very how do I say you have things
from linguistics physics math and social
skills in love so you have contribution
for lots of science so in studying
working on itu you can already you can
be a developer can go to the product
field and you go to network and then
it's very different one from each other
so there is a space for lots of people
in flower i don't know i don't like to
program but i like to do this or I like
to do that
you have space too many kinds of people
in the i.t fielded so this is one of the
things that make make it cool it's a
very rich environment so there's a lot
of people from different cultures for
example for instance if you have the
chance to work for a multinational
compound company for example you know
people from all over the world so for
instance you can work for oracle for
example or for IBM or any other company
that has offices all around the world
you can talk to a lot of different
people you have to know how to respect
their cultures and how to work together
with all these people because it's it's
hard they think differently they'd speak
differently even if they are speaking
English so and it's it's another very
important part of being not even not
working big companies you can also
participate on open source projects you
can now participate in worldwide company
worldwide communities right well
actually my beginning was on the this
kind of thing died like I was already I
was used to contribute to open source
projects in the beginning first not on
technical stuff like a translation
started with translation then I started
to want I wanted to know how to stuff at
work so I said let's try to program
learn to program and we were going to so
open source was a big issue on my
beginning and like but coming back to
the topic what I think that this is very
important is learning that you are
responsible for for your own learning
you know like university majors and
everything and courses and
certifications are very interesting but
they are going to they're not going to
give you everything that you're gonna
need so you are the main agent of your
own learning so like you have to be the
one there is going to chew and this is
something that I really enjoy
you know so like I want I think this is
important for me now so let's let me go
there and try to learn this basically
they give you the north right they hit
give you a direction that you can go and
you decide how you go there and how to
how far you go actually right you have
to push yourself forward yeah because
otherwise you're going to be stuck on
time or with something old or not
programming very well because you just
don't read some articles or talk to
people and develop your very own this is
very it's it's it's a cornerstone yeah
oh one thing that I would like to think
we are not only responsible by our
knowledge only we are also responsible
by giving it back to the community
giving it back to society and everything
like that so when you have opportunity
to learn something when you have
opportunity to study something maybe
there are people that didn't have the
same conditions as you to do something
so attending events as a speaker
promoting activities with community I
think it's a right blog post yeah right
even writing a simple blog post sharing
your knowledge it's fine it's one thing
that you are responsible for because if
that knowledge dies with you there is no
sense in passing it forward and if a
science is based it like that right
everyone do research and uh you go there
and I'll take a research and extend it
and go far away and give the credits and
I think the important thing one thing
that is really important then in your
career is sharing knowledge and giving
it back to society community or whatever
place you especially because usually we
built something on the shoulders of
others because Giants yes because we all
start looking for an article or for a
documentation or something that somebody
else develop it before you so if you
learn something you and if you feel a
difficulty around something you really
should try to go there and express that
for other people to Butte to build on
top of it
this is of course really important so
yeah so like but you guys talked about
being open minded in build stuff on
whatever they tell you to butte but like
there's the other side when you are the
one of course if we work for a component
they say built this using this
technology we go there and do it but
what about when you have the freedom to
choose the technology want and in USA
you are trying to learn something for
pleasure like my experience is like I
always try to learn something that was
more productive in the sense that i want
my studying time to to be worth in a way
that i could use that technology to do
lots of stuff and not only a small niche
what do you guys do you guys feel that
you or not because i can say as a like
on I want to learn a new language so
which one I'm gonna choose I say oh
let's pick this one that it that I'm
going to spend this time studying but I
will be able to do lots of stuff with
that one thing that I believe as a
generalist is that you need to choose
something that will solve your problem
right the first thing when you start to
develop something or start to do
something actually in life you need to
ask why and what we what we are what why
I am trying to solve what is the problem
that i'm trying to show the second step
is to choose the language technology and
whatever there there are cases that
people are especially is that I think
it's beautiful I actually seeing people
being in specialist but even when you
are especially you need to be
open-minded not every time your
programming language will be the best
one to solve that problem not every time
you have the final answer to anything so
I think you need to always try to to see
the other side's also to see other
technologies other things yeah but like
don't you go
sometimes steady something that is not
with the purpose of solving a problem
like for example me I'm starting to
learn a skill just just for fun because
it I'm not going to use asking for
something else but I've had a contact
with the Haskell some time ago couple
years ago didn't really understood that
and now do you have this functional
language wave coming back and everything
else I say oh let's let's try i'm not
going to use it to anything just it's
just for really fun do you guys have
this actually I've something else yeah I
try to do something like that but it's
more like a way to try to develop new
forms to look the problems new skills or
yeah for example so let's have a look on
functional programming because when i go
back to object-oriented programming I
have will have some awesome ideas on how
to do some stuff and or for example
let's try to have a look at how people
are fixing problems on IOT so when I go
back to enterprise solutions I can I
don't know maybe use some of that ideas
so I'd like to to look at my learning
process with this lens so of course it's
fun to get something just go there okay
let's program a calculator or something
to see how it works and oh it's really
cool but it really helps you to build
more knowledge on when you go back to
you our main problem your main role or
this kind of thing thing so I also like
to do crazy things like that let's go
see what happens it's like a hobby right
but i think that the importance of doing
that is to open your mind to other
perspectives new ways to to find out new
ways to fight it to solve different
problems so yeah functional languages
were something that I didn't have in
mind and today we are a wave IOT in the
past when when I was in the the college
things the the Internet of Things was
something only for industry right it was
expensive it was
accessible to students right and today
you can see basically in an Arduino
everywhere so experimenting things
trying things new things to so old
problems is always always good I think
it's important to us I like to see these
kind of things looking to other
professions like for example carpenters
for example they build stuff so they
have to learn and create different tools
to be able to compute a whole lot of new
things so being a developers like that a
lot of people are creating tools and
different stuff you have to have a look
at that and say oh this is really great
so I can create this whole new think
it's I like to see things like that so
it's it's cool like you do you have time
for something else more really okay why
are the professionals that you guys look
with with like how I wish it could be
like this this guy did you get very
tough questions right like why the was
that you see and say wow well we are on
TDC right we cannot we can say about the
R&amp;amp;D disease that the developers
conference I don't know but it's the
developers oh I think I'll so yeah if
initials are very well know in the java
community also they want a lot of awards
they are very nice person nice people
right they are good developers good
people to talk about the they are
excellent professionals but when you
work a lot of time with community and
when you have presence in different
communities i can say a really long list
here of people that are I admire we have
an record Lucci from the dotnet
community we have a burrata so add is
from the android community we have Bruno
Souza from java community you from open
source right when I we met you thank you
very well yeah I heard a lot of cool
stuff for me oh so it's very difficult
when you have community you don't have
the sense of unity of one person right
usually you see a group of person that
tu se ho I would like to be like Dan or
i would like to be among them so at
Sonya Naga we cannot forget to add some
that's Aneesa he's a very very nice
professional he gave me a lot of
insights about career life and things
like that yeah I couldn't agree more so
there's a lot of people that are
contribute with being role models not
only technical reference so they come
here they share that if you want to talk
to any of them you can stop them at the
corridor and talk to them for hours and
all these peoples are always I don't
know it's crazy there always a good to
be here TDC right instru people uh I
never thought in my life to have a
chance to talk with the Java man right
and yesterday I was saying hi to him and
we started an interview here so
basically I think this is the beauty
being even stuff like that what about
you do you have someone that you wow I
have so many people chew yes but but I
really I can't say I can I kid named few
but I there are lots of people oh I
admire I'd admire linus torvalds for
example for what he has done and what he
has achieved with linux and indeed in
everything i don't know i like lots of
people from the open source community
and for example Stallman really liked by
its it they are from almost opposite
sides and astounded but I admire that
Lina's I know both of the in person
personally I have the the opportunity to
meet in Lena's is very reserved and very
introspective and Stalin is hard to talk
to him and everything but I demeyer what
he has done what he has built and
everything is very smart guy not very
friendly to talk the contribution is
nice the confusion ideas in everything
position the way that they position the
position themselves the community they
have strong opinions that you there
really fight for what they believe this
yes really nice also from the movie but
but the list is very long really yeah
it's true it wasn't a good question
really like in what about projects or
tools if you have to give an advice to
someone who is watching us what would
you tell you know take a look at this
store this project because this is going
to be cool it's crazy that's also very
long list but I have two things that I
would suggest one of them is great oh if
you are on the java community or android
or anything greater is awesome I it's a
really good evolution from maven and all
the oh end and all this other build
stuff and also one thing that not a lot
of people look to its llvm so it's a
tool for creating new compilers and
language so it's very old but it's very
cool stuff a lot of new things are
coming from there so our new cool cool
stuff from C++ is coming from there so
if you had the chance to look for for
the sake of curiosity are in for the fun
have a look at that so one thing that
I'm starting their romance right I'm
siding to date yet is a reactive
programming so RX java the extensions
for the c sharp and stuff like that i
think reactive programming is very very
interesting yes it changed the way that
you need to model your app your solution
so i think it's something that is coming
stronger and is a little bit hard to
understand in the beginning but if you
study you will see that adds a lot of
value in the application then the make
city smaller makes it faster and stuff
like that so cool what about you oh you
guys are also hahaha well let's see oh I
think reactive programming is pretty
cool pretty awesome and i will tell guys
to take a look at something more
webfocus I'm breeding love with me t or
framework I don't know if you guys know
it but it's an oj s framework but really
different from everything else I've seen
before it starts starting from the point
that it's not I MVC framework so brings
lots of different strange concepts it's
pretty new stuff has this advantages and
disadvantages in the way they are doing
stuff but I think it's something worth
looking cause well I've enjoyed what
I've seen so far so I think take a look
at that if you're if you're looking for
some different framework web framework
that is different from anything else
take a look at meteora framework and I
would say to blockchain technology from
the Bitcoin so like I believe that the
future uses that they are going to make
from the Bitcoin from the blockchain
technologies are going to be pretty
awesome in I if I have to guess I would
say that in the future we are going to
see very nice stuff made with that so
take a look at it cool I think that's it
guys yeah entertain final thoughts yeah
I hope you guys have enjoyed our talk
here our host is speechless she doesn't
have a voice right now thank you guys
for the opportunity as well so it would
be awesome to you so if anyone wants
should talk to us or maybe sensor some
questions or comments feel free feel
free to there is our Twitter handles
here I guess right now yeah yells or
another is there you can find me at
twitter i got cone yeah / cameos I don't
in yours is too Kihara yes right
and Philippe our Pedro so almost all the
social networks and things like that
yeah me too i'm kim as I down almost
every social network show okay thank you
guys thank you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
