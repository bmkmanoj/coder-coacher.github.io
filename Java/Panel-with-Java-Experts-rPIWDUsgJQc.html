everyone I'm Heather Van Kyra and we're
here to have our panel of Java experts
talk with you about how to grow your
career as a developer we have a wide
variety of experts here so the panel
should represent all different types of
developers I'm sure you can relate to at
least one of the folks on our panel if
we have time we'll even take questions
from the audience so we'll start out
with a few questions I have teed up and
then we'll move on to take questions
from the audience so I'm gonna start by
asking all the panelists to introduce
themselves when we start with Mary and
then just move down okay so my name is
Merrick McCluskey I'm currently a senior
software engineer technical art
architect at US Cellular so I been doing
actually beyond just Java because these
days all the apps are like all you know
platforms it's all like a huge hiko
system so I've also touched into like
JavaScript like beyond the Java and then
also mobile apps and all those things
and then my community involvement I've
been helping the Chicago Java users grip
quite heavily organizing meetings and
speaking to like you know high-caliber
speakers like Venkat in here and and
everybody else do so yeah so that's my
pretty much my community involvement
yeah okay cool thanks Mary for being on
the panel Edie
hi my name's Edie burns and I'm hoping
to bring to the panel a mid-career
developer experience I've been doing
software development for 25 years or so
and have been studying the topic and
domain of career management and career
growth I have a book about the topic
here secrets of the Rockstar developers
it's a collection of interviews with
lots of great developers that I could
find about their secrets and how they
got to where they are and how they avoid
getting burnt out how they avoid having
you know we'll have I deal with tight
deadlines all the things we have to deal
with the software developers and I'm
just hoping that we can bring some stuff
out here that sharing some stories and
some perspectives because we have some
new developers and some old developers
and some very senior
developers as well so as Heather said
it's a wide range and well
representation of our industry all right
cool thanks ed and you know a lot to
offer let's see a venkat you Venkat
Subramanyam I'm a programmer author and
speaking conferences do consulting
mentoring and just I think I spent more
time in airplanes then on earth okay
Ivor okay my name is Ivor I'm a Java
developer I run a local jog in malmö and
Sweden I'm also in the Java community
Executive Committee and as well as the
PMC for e4j and at conferences I often
do talks about micro profile all right
cool Jonathan has its own mic i'm john i
have my own mic unblessed
I'm Jonathan Ross I am a senior software
engineer I work in C++ and Java in the
high-frequency trading business I work
at a company called IMC trading
otherwise I'm also actively involved in
the Chicago Java user group where I try
and bring in awesome speakers and I'm
also dabbling a little bit in the
sponsorship side of that and the rest of
the time I'm also an avid musician so no
pointers little plug for the null
pointers but for the no point does this
evening ed and I will be entertaining
you all with the no pointers yes
hopefully with the help of lots of
libation that you a drink before
listening that's always fun Mercedes my
name is Mercedes I am from Guatemala
actually I am a CTO in and a start-up
based in Guatemala that is called
productivity I have six years of career
development and recently I was promoted
as an Oracle developers champion and I
on an out zero ambassador - I've ruined
two communities in Guatemala I J duties
chapter that is the female chapters of
Java and I have a Google community that
is called EPS +50 - and in the past I
room during three years Java users group
organizing meetings and the Java date in
Guatemala so and I am a currently an
active international speaker
one year and a half is speaking
international and five years speaking
locally Guatemala awesome well thanks
again for all the panelists I think one
of the most common questions that I get
from developers is talking about how to
advance their careers so one of the
things I wanted to ask you about was
what are some of the activities outside
of your regular employment you've done
to advance your career so some of you
have already mentioned some of them but
maybe just add a little bit more context
and color around those in terms of you
know how you kind of took the step out
from day to day putting your head down
getting the job done to really you know
starting to look at some of the ways
that you could maybe stand out a little
bit as a developer and move outside of
that just just your regular employment
nine-to-five or whatever hours you take
just maybe share a couple stories or
examples about I've done that it looks
like he's ready to go I'm always ready
to go on we have I wanna hear everyone's
answer because I got a lot of questions
myself too but for this one I think you
have to remember the notion of find
things that are people look at as
somebody else's problem I don't have to
deal with that and then fix that thing
because there's so much out there that
people don't want to deal with but needs
to be done so and with the advent and
complete domination of github you can
find open source projects and you don't
have to be like a master at writing code
people want their issues to be triaged
people want their readme to be spell
checked and maybe even localized there's
just so much entry-level stuff that you
can do to get involved in a community so
you have to find out what sort of domain
you're excited about and then find a
corresponding open source project that
isn't that domain and then just see
where the low-hanging fruit is and just
get started it's never been easier to do
it that's one of the great things about
software the barriers to entry are lower
than any other human endeavor that's
happened where you can actually achieve
professional success the tools you need
especially with the cloud now most of
the time the tools you need are actually
cost free or very low cost so it's a
great
way to get in and get started can so in
terms of advanced in the career I would
say two different things one is I think
it takes a little while but you need to
really figure out what you are really
really passionate about what are you
curious about what would get you up in
the morning and say I want to tinker
with this and and then become really an
expert in it and the second thing I
would say is it's really not about whom
you know but who knows you that makes a
really big difference so what that
really means is become prolific be
active in your community so people in
your community local community should
know who you are because you're active
you're speaking you're organizing you're
helping out the user group so that's one
way to for people to know whom you are
so when there is an opportunity they
will know to call you and so like I said
it's all about who knows you so the more
prolific you are the more you are
dedicated to what you do people begin to
take note of it and that's extremely
important to advance the career just to
follow up so like VanCamp for instance
like how did you get you decide you're
into your first speaking opportunity
outside of the courses that you teach of
course I don't mean that but like you
know what what pushed you over the edge
to be like you do your first talk
because like I tell first time speakers
you know once you do the first talk it
really just snowballs from there you get
invited to one more conference another
conference and it spreads globally as
well so even do you remember any
incidents to share oh absolutely I'm I'm
really glad you asked that question
because I remember very clearly back
when I used to live in Houston I made it
a point to speak in both the Java user
group and the darknet user group at
least once a year and in fact I've
continued that even today I speak in
about 15 user groups every year just
because you know that's really what made
a big difference for me and it in fact
turned out that I was speaking in one of
those user groups back in 2001 when a
conference organizer you know came to
promote the conference saw me speak and
said hey it looks like you're somebody
who could be in the conference and
that's how my conference speaking
actually started so absolutely speaking
in local user groups is a great way
because the user group is a very
friendly environment
you can get feedback people can help you
to get better at what you do it's also a
way for you to tease out some ideas you
may have and say hey I'm working on this
what do you think is this a good
approach so that's really a you know in
a multiple different ways
speaking at user groups is really a good
way to get started that's awesome so now
I mean you're very humble venkat but
obviously one of the most sought after
java speakers doing keynotes all over
the world and it started with your local
java user group and spread from there so
all right Jonathan I thought you were a
dancer the question I still wonder to
this minute why I'm up on this stage but
I guess whatever I've been doing over
the last wild sort of paid off I started
a couple of years ago just hounding
speakers after their talks and asking
questions to them after the sessions at
conferences like this and yeah pursuing
the speakers they were speaking on
topics that I was passionate about and
asking questions there and then starting
inviting them to come and do talks at
the Chicago Java user group and do
in-house sessions at ONC and stuff like
that I don't know it seems to hand out
I've met an awful lot of people this way
I got to get closer by okay so what else
wanting to add there I just think
speaking to people at conferences don't
be shy go up to the speakers we love
talking to people and they have good
questions after the sessions right so
just following your interest you write
things that interest you and it sounds
like it kind of naturally happened I was
hounding all the Java performance
speakers and talking to the JVM
engineers I'm really into the
nitty-gritty details of what goes on
under the hood and Java so I was
hounding Brian gets and the likes and
thanked at I handed you I think there's
a couple different amount enough we can
look at it this way but it seems like
there's two tracks to look at it one
would be becoming the individual expert
and and you know promoting yourself but
the other is being a community leader
and I think Mercedes that's something
that you're doing more like with all the
different communities you're doing yes I
am really different communities in that
what this is why
of the case for hep successful sometimes
in your developer career because when we
are working sometimes we are focused
only in one thing is that thing that we
need to do at work so how I will
discover this old world of colors that
we have in technology so attending a
community because in that community
people speak about many things and one
thing that happened when we as leader of
that communities that people came to the
community and say I want to know about
this topic and I say oh I don't
know anyone that know about that topic
so I need to become the expert of that
topic for learned that to the people in
the community because it's interesting
on that so this is a challenge to leader
a community so you are in front of that
and you need to see what are the
interesting of your people because that
community is important is not you is
your community so this is something
something for example I am an Android
developer I started my career as an
Android developer but I grow up in a
Java community so I am like a weird case
and I will say being a speaker if
someone don't want to speak do I dare
you to make that because I am now CTO in
a start-up because someone found me is
speaking in an Evan and say I need to
make this product and I think that you
can help me and we create that startup
so it's a really grow up into a career
just for a speak just for share why I'm
learning or what I am doing every day
did everyone I know you've been active
in the community for a while but it
wasn't until maybe like the last three
or four years that I think you've become
a little bit more visible so in from my
perspective looking at you and your
career it's like something over the last
three to four years something kind of
shifted where you know you became more
visible in the community got more
involved what can and how has that
impacted your career yeah I think it
really changed when I started speaking
at the bigger conferences like being
accepted to job one that was kind of a a
thing that that made me more visible
around there and I've always done
speaking at a local java user groups and
we're always looking for speakers so
we're always happy for people common
there and
well III think contributing to open
source like joining the the JCP the
expert groups there the executive
committee has done a great deal for me
and I I want to add a little bit water
ad said as well but I think last year at
that Nexus bank at that your keynote you
said being a programmer is like being a
kid in a candy store every day and for
us get up is that candy store so we just
have to find the things that we like to
do and and make it better just
contribute to to whatever we're doing
and take take it wherever you go I think
yeah contributing to open source
projects and that at least you kind of
related to that and your answer is one
of the best ways to kind of start to
grow your reputation and career is pick
a project that you're passionate about
like you said Jonathan and follow an
issue tracker that's like a really you
know introductory way to do it finds I'm
fine said become an expert
yeah right Mary you have anything to add
to that so for me I'd like to testify to
what all of you Pamela's two are talking
about especially van cat that says you
know users group are really a good way
to kind of get yourself into the door
and believe it or not I used to be a
very shy person I did not want to talk
in front of people I got nervous and
that's like oh what am I gonna do but
because I started going to see Chuck and
then Bob and Freddie and all of them
were inviting me to help out and I
started doing a lightning talk and
that's how often do I found myself I
actually could speak in front of people
and then kind of like get comfortable
and it just like slowly it builds on my
confidence and now I spoke at JavaOne
and now it definitely says well so yeah
so I want to testify it is a very good
way to get in is through users group and
all the activities in the community that
you are kind of reaching out to so yeah
well that's kind of the positive aspects
right hey I kind of want to focus more
on challenges now my next question right
so maybe name some of your challenges
when I'm finished talking and then you
know give an example of how you overcame
that challenge right so and it can be to
like so what are some of the challenges
that you see developers facing what are
some of the challenges you've faced in
your career and maybe give an example of
you've overcome that okay I don't want
to go first I wanted to put an addendum
on the previous topic but I'll come back
to it now I don't wanna speak say
alright interrupting is a pet peeve now
you know okay
Mercedes you start okay yeah oh yeah
this is something interesting that we
were speaking about that because
sometimes we don't only have challenges
in our developer career enough in our
life in in essence and I will take my
story yes okay you know before that I
 was completely in made development
I was having trying to have to a career
in art you know I studied seven years in
a conservatory about piano and then I
was trying to study a bachelor degree in
fine arts and working and ruining my
communities and the problem is that I
needed like six hours just for a study
my piano program I was taking my
university classes I need to study for
my university classes you know I
included drawing include dance so film
right and work six hours and ruins a
community so I was in one moment when I
was sleeping anything during three days
it's like I was dying and I was not
having successful in anything just I was
doing good things so I was in a class
and one day that I say why is that it's
more people or people that had many
talents never had successful is because
they are trying to make everything at
the same time you need to choose
something and I say oh this is my
story I need to choose something and I
choose technology and I will say that
that was the first jump that I made in
my career and was impressing I say oh my
god I am making many good things ruining
communities you know with one at Duke
Choice Award this year in educational
outreach with the Java users group
because we was running a tour so I say
is impressive but she he has risen and
maybe that can be you too in that
happened but we are in a bad work or for
example I have a bad experience in a
community and I need to leave that
community take me six months decided
that but sometimes if you are in a place
when your work is not being value or you
feel that is bad
well you need to take that decision you
know being strong and I say this is the
best thing for me and you know after
that I started to be internationally
speaker and that makes me become a
developer champion so don't be afraid to
take this decision so will not be
something bad for you maybe we'll stop
to doing something like a main track but
we'll have a really positive impact in
our careers focus focus tonight we got
applause for that I think head I think
had something to say well I'll say two
things when it comes to facing
challenges and and succeeding from it
the first I kind of noticed a lot in in
observing other people as well is a lot
of times we are a little shy to ask for
help and I think it's important to be so
to say a bit shameless ask for help and
get as much help as you can and one of
the best things I've ever had is people
helping me to get better and giving me
feedback giving me you know criticism
and telling me how I could do better and
a little bit being shameless to ask for
that help is very important especially
earlier in the career and to me that was
extremely important when I was trying to
learn programming it was not easy for me
at all and trying to really ask as much
help from people to know how I can do
better and people who are better at
doing things where my role models you
know asking them to review what I did
the other thing I cannot you know ignore
is the incredible support of the family
that you have your career success
heavily depends on how good your family
is in supporting that for you and I
would say that's being incredibly
effective for me is I couldn't be doing
a lot of stuff I do if I didn't have a
family that fully supported and
sacrifice for my sake so I definitely
want to say having that also is very
critical those are really interesting
points and thanks for sharing that yeah
the supportive network is really
important your family being and
supporting you
and admitting when you don't know
anything that you don't that you have
questions that you don't know everything
I see that really as a common thread
through the developers that I talked to
often is admitting that you don't know
the answer can be a really big challenge
it even came up this morning and the
breakfast that Mary you want to share
sure so for me I find one of the biggest
challenges these days when I work in
that business context is that I have to
somehow well among ourselves and
developers we know what we're talking
about but when you have to actually talk
to your business because they are they
are the ones that pay that cat who gives
up funding so I often it's finding it
more and more the more senior I'm
getting more experience I'm finding
there's a you know very big need to be
able to communicate and articulate what
it is and not you know in our lingo and
I find it is the skills that I'm mostly
trying to develop at this time to to
kind of talk so then the business will
understand without misunderstanding
because a lot of times we talk about
low-level stuff and then they don't
quite understand it they get even more
confused so I think that's something too
I feel as developers we need to not just
do the coding but we need to learn how
to communicate and speak to the business
users effectively so yeah and I think
that's increasing more and more so even
pure developer technical roles are
spending up to 50 percent of their time
needing to communicate right so the way
that we develop software and work with
in open source projects and the way they
it's developed internally with it using
agile methodologies all about
communication so it's key skill they
have as a developer I don't want to just
tongue into Van Kant's point there about
getting feedback and everything like
that also working in in the industry I
find that it's really important to have
a very good code review process in place
so if you've got a good process in there
to get feedback from your peers than
that that's a unmissable way of getting
developing yourself further as developer
and that's closer to I can't quite hear
you can't you hear me I'm soft-spoken I
beg your pardon so good code review
process is great way of getting peer
feedback and the other one is maybe seek
out a personal mentor maybe you want not
necessarily your boss or but but
somebody you look up to within the
organisation
and seek that feedback actively did you
have a mentor that have made a big
impact on your career III did you share
anything how did you find that person I
mean that's another common question I
get it could be awkward right I mean I
usually say something like you know can
start informally it doesn't have to be
like oh hi would you be my mentor
but anything actually for me one of the
my greatest mentors was actually my
Master's supervisor he taught me an
awful lot outside I studied physics he
taught me a lot outside of physics and I
still get back to him to bounce ideas
off him a sort of personal coach I want
to put on the Mercedes point about
knowing when it's time to take a tough
decision and move to a new thing that
also applies to your technology stack so
a lot of times if you get really
comfortable where the particular tool
chain and that tool chain itself doesn't
evolve it's hard to let go sometimes and
move to the new thing that has been
embraced by a wider body of people so
you have to be constantly re-evaluating
what's in your toolbox and be willing to
change that you know and I struggle with
this myself because I'm still I'm still
using Emacs for things that probably
people aren't using Emacs for so like
mail reading for example but the point
is you just have to be open to turn act
try new things because at the end of the
day our industry is all about facility
at acquiring new skills and abandoning
or de-emphasizing old ones constantly
and that's hard to do yeah I I want to
go back to the mentoring thing and I was
approached by the guy who runs the the
local Java user group together with me
he just came up to me and said hey I've
already do you want to be my mentor I
want to become you in five years I
wouldn't be a Java champion I wouldn't
be an international speaker I want to be
contributing in a community can you
mentor me and I said of course I will so
so that's the other side of it reach out
to people that you see hey I want to
become that
guy and and you can find them so yeah
one of the time things I did for Java
one for a number of years I don't know
maybe five or six years in a row is find
someone in the community and partner
with them and say hey let's do a talk
together and this would be the
experience that got them into it and my
good friend Hassan Saleh who now works
at Nickelodeon in New York he was a
great Java developer in Egypt in Cairo
and I got to know him and we gave a talk
at JavaOne together he came into the JSF
community and he eventually asked me to
sponsor help you know sponsor him for
his visa and that's how he came to the
United States so these kind of
connections can really change people and
change their careers and it's our I
think our duty as senior developers to
spend a significant portion helping
others do that so this the last couple
comments have really gone into one of my
next questions but to us about personal
growth in training so what are some of
the things that you've done as a
developer in your career and some of the
things that you would recommend that
have been the most beneficial for you so
one of my examples was mentoring if you
brought it up on your own but there of
course lots of other things and why
don't you share some of those I only
will add something to the last point is
that I saw many developers are afraid to
ask for help so please if you need help
ask for help someone next to you have
the answer and want to share that with
anyone that asked for that so about what
other help ask for help just come on
okay what are things with me you know I
like to take mocks yeah in that ones I
don't have time so sometimes I don't
follow the mock like that session of the
week made the exercise if not I wait for
the end of the mock and I make that up
marathon of the mock course this works
perfect so instead to make that on
Netflix made that on a mock Sun exists
many mocks there are for free and are
really good even just backup and share
what a mock is I'm the massive on yes
okay on massive courses
that provider denote by Coursera Udacity
udemy in that Oracle have a ones that
are good now I am taking a few courses
there or you can find that on YouTube
exists people you know experts that
record videos sessions and they share
that on YouTube or watch the conference
recorded conference sessions that are
really good too
I try to write book read books but that
I'd usually score two to rate so I don't
have much time for that but then with
blocks you know I don't know what but I
think that he'll have many Twitter
accounts so come on don't follow these
ladies all I put new lips I am in the
page now come on don't follow those
people that done gives you anything
really positive to your career
follow the gurus come on follow these
guys well um this guy these guys other
guys in the conference because that
people is writing articles you know and
they share that to you I write this
article so if you follow the gurus that
Twitter pages know of the fish'll pages
of technologies they provide you tips -
and things good information so this is
what I do
oh one of the things that I think is a
good career strategy is to find your
invisible college does anyone heard the
term invisible college before so this is
a term that I talked about in the
Rockstar book and all of the rockstars
had this thing they were a member of an
invisible college which is basically
your posse it's your group of friends
that you stick with throughout your
career and that kind of have the
industry bases covered as a whole
because the problem with MOOCs and all
of these kinds of things is there's so
many of them so it's very easy to just
be completely overwhelmed and shut down
so you have to recognize it's impossible
to keep tabla and everything just accept
that fact and if you're involved you
know a community it's basically a
community so if you're involved the
community everyone can kind of share the
knowledge and you have your own thing
that you could share and if you need to
get an answer to a question you can
reach out to someone you know rather
than just going to some random forum
that you don't know it
much better to use it as an opportunity
to form a relationship with someone -
okay thank you you want to share I
couldn't agree more with what ed said
you know the good old saying tell me who
your friends are I'll tell about you is
is extremely important I would say
clearly that made a huge difference for
me because of the friends I could hang
out with you know after you speak in a
conference what do I do on a Friday
night or a Saturday night it's the geeks
that I geek out with where we sit and
talk about exception handling and
garbage collection until late in the
night that is a huge difference when in
terms of the knowledge you gain and
being critiqued and and and how you
really you know geek out the other thing
I want to say is you know as you become
more experienced in the career giving
back to the community is incredibly
important and and there's a lot of
things we kind of shrug and say there's
no not much I can do but there's so much
you can actually give in ways you may
not even realize it the number one step
go back to the college you graduated
from and there are so many students who
are going through career right now if
you can spend a hour two hours sharing
your experience as a software developer
imagine what impact you can make on them
because there's you know right there in
the school going through and reading and
trying to graduate but looking at you
being successful gives them really great
hope that hey there is actually some
really cool stuff I can also do when I
graduate so just spending some time in
colleges back where he graduated from
can make a huge difference if you're not
living where you graduated find a local
university or a college and go spend
some time the user groups one of the
things that I enjoy thoroughly is you
know knowledge is a wealth that grows as
you give so if you can organize a code
retreat just a Saturday where developers
get together and we do pair programming
for five six hours it's unbelievable how
much you can walk away not just helping
others learn but when others question
while you're doing certain things a
certain way it makes you think very
differently so we
really learning a lot collectively
together so organizing code retreats is
something that I thoroughly enjoy and
and you know working with with
developers in the local community
that's another way to really give so
there's absolutely so many ways if we
can just stop and ask the question how
can I be I've helped somebody I'm sure
you'll find so many ways to really help
others to grow and in the process you
grow yourselves as well you can also do
this on a smaller scale you can also do
this inside your company one thing we do
a lot is reorganize brown bag lunches or
show Intel's
where we or a book clubs where we study
a particular topic for instance when
when Java 8 came out we we worked out
together during a brown bag a couple of
brown bag lunch sessions worked out how
streams work and this is a good way as
well to help your colleagues you don't
have to necessarily take the plunge into
the communities and start working with
their Java user groups you can also just
do this within your own company work
very well with us anything else you want
to add in terms of things you recommend
for training and growing well just
generally speaking back to venkat one
event cuts a first point go deep become
an expert I mean you I mean one thing
that I go to swear by is read the RTFM
there's not just the blogs and the books
you can actually we're blessed in the
Java community that the source code is
readable that really helps you can
actually read the source code and work
out for yourself exactly what it's doing
and you can become an expert you can
become an expert on that in your company
you can become the go-to guy on I don't
know Java concurrency or on streams or
on lambdas and yeah and you reach out to
the community and ask find find support
the supporting network find people who
you can ask to further deepen your
knowledge but reading the manual pages
is not - nothing to be ashamed of that's
that's how you become an expert in these
matters well I think mary or ever you
want to share maybe just one small thing
I've been to a couple of like hackathons
I do find that is actually amazing
because you go into like you
group of random group of people and
actually you're talking about the idea
to then you try to implement within a
very short time I think those are very
good opportunities to grow your skills
you'll be amazed like what you learn in
just like a weekend for example like
yeah that's what I've done to so yeah
that's a really good example and I think
there in that way you can grow your
communication skills as well as some of
those softer skills in those type of
environments
yeah that's right you know I've are yeah
I think the the most important thing is
to just go out there and and and do it
more or less any everybody can be a
speaker you don't have to be this super
expert the first time you do it because
when you when you prepare that talk and
you learn that topic you become an
expert so you kind of forced into
learning something a little bit better
than the guys in the audience and then
you're the factor the experts in the
room so just get out there I kind of
want to challenge a bit the necessity of
like expertise you need expertise
obviously needs to exist but with the
breadth of things out there I think you
do pretty well in an in a jet as being a
generalist as well so don't get
discouraged because a lot of times I
don't know for my neuro makeup if I say
if someone tells me you must become an
expert to be successful
that's pretty daunting I mean and in
fact let's face the fact that knowledge
is so widely diffused that expertise is
easily acquirable as well I don't
suppose maybe my book wording was off
there when I was talking about expertise
I think it's a really important that
developers know what it is the tool that
they're choosing is doing and why it's
doing it that yeah that you're not just
using it because it's the latest
buzzword or the latest compliant
technology but that you really
understand what problem it's solving you
don't have to understand it to the
absolute min you take of details but
just understanding the the why is very
important there well one of the things
we've seen and of for those of us that
I'm around long enough is the advent of
Stack Overflow and now it's really
possible and there
plenty of people that actually do this
where they just get their jobs done by
looking at the thing copying pasting and
and you can make stuff that kind of
works and lets you get paid but that's
not the right way to do it and you you
should scratch below that there's one
thing we haven't touched I think and
that is attend conferences go to
conferences like you're all here at that
nexus this is where you learn things and
and so attending conferences a lot of
conferences and listen to the speakers
and sooner or later you're real I said
hey I could be up there and approach the
speakers and ask them questions
afterwards that is that is the the thing
that did the best for me yeah it comes
right back to Jonathan and that actually
leads me to what I was just gonna say
which is now it's your turn to ask the
questions so we have a mic up here by
the stage so just come up to the mic in
front of our stage here and you know ask
questions of the panelists so for the
questions and you're not going to be
recorded on camera if you ask a question
so there's the mic right there you have
any questions to ask of our panelists
all right I had one of no one's come on
come on I'm Barry we need some questions
I'm gonna ask a silly one if you don't
get up on the mic mic which my question
is what do you think of the notion that
we've all been training an AI through
Stack Overflow and they're gonna have a
machine learning algorithm that scrapes
Stack Overflow and learns how to do our
jobs
who's taking Ed's question we warned you
or any random questions here I have no
problem as long as they keep sending the
check to me
[Laughter]
everyone else I don't have much of an
opinion on that one in particular you
look perplexed well yeah I have been
thinking an awful lot about the notion
of AI taking over an awful lot of jobs
in a lot of career paths but I think
I've always thought that being a
developer would be one of the last ones
to go well I can't help but notice that
my employer Oracle is now one of our
major selling points is reduce labor
costs with our automated intelligent
database on the back of the Economist
magazine month after month after month
are saying buy this product because you
have to pay less developers and I'm like
but that AI is gonna come eventually for
more and more of us I think and that's I
would like to get people's perspectives
on that all right any any question any
other questions I have one more question
if anyone in the audience wants to ask a
question we'll take that one first
though all right question from the
audience hello my name is Ryan I work
for a software development problem Depot
so as far as getting in so right now I
kind of generally work on the higher
level of jamun right now so I'm working
a lot of api's you know I work I work at
the guy at the higher abstraction level
so my interest a lot of times is in the
lower abstraction level I tend my tend
to find myself you know digging around
source code and trying to learn how
things work and I see these other
companies some of some of them are
around us you know they that actually
build the tools like pivotal what are
you guys recommendations for and right
now pretty much been my off-time trying
to prepare myself so I can actually I'm
in public so I would say that's been my
I spend my time trying to prepare myself
so that I can go work for these these
companies that actually build the tools
and what are you guys recommendations
for for getting more prepared so that
you can move yourself into a role doing
that because that's my goal is to get
into a role where I'm actually building
and understanding these tools and then
moving up that chain instead well thanks
for your question Ryan a lot of
companies now have started really taking
advantage of LinkedIn and medium to get
their own message out so if you're
trying to learn what they're doing
follow their blog
and see what they're interested in and
that will give you an insight of what
what the study and want to look for
putting on my employer hat I would say
an important thing is to actually know
your tools well it's very hard when
we're getting in developers straight out
of university they tend to know their
data structure as well and everything
like that but actually putting together
a full system using I don't know maven
or or IntelliJ what not they don't know
how to operate the tools to write code
so if you if you're good with that
that's a great start and also triage
basic triage troubleshooting finding
bugs debugging all those workflows if
you're skilled at bats then you you do a
lot better than a lot of the university
graduates that we're interviewing I
would say three things the first is
networking a lot of these organizations
have their you know developers employees
speaking any conferences getting to know
them a little bit better networking so
that's first thing second is there are
the hair products and all of those
products are open-source if you can
start contributing to some of those
whether it is fixing bugs making
enhancements that's another way for you
to really get familiar with it and the
third really is when I talk to people
what I'm looking for is not how many
technology names they know but how
really well they know things the
fundamentals make a big difference so if
you can show that you really understand
how things work not just how to use
things that becomes really valuable
because that means you can actually
build stuff for them then use what is
being built I think that is another very
important thing is to really come up
with the you know understanding of how
things work and being able to articulate
it and then also to be able to build
stuff by you know open-source products
to show that you actually are capable of
doing it in in US in a way I would say
generally speaking it's very effective
when
you start contributing and they
recognize and they call you then you
trying to do a cold call and say I want
to come work for you guys so anything
you can do to lay that out in front is
actually much better for you to really
get there any other advice for Ryan I
don't know if it was kind of facetious
when you were saying like about machine
learning scraping a Stack Overflow and
then taking over our jobs but do you see
do you think it's possible do you see a
future where it's actually reality
because a surgeon can't really or they
have limited limitations on how much
they can operate on themselves if a
program is getting a virus or has bugs
do you foresee a future where machine
learning really gets to the point where
AI is actually fixing their own but its
own bugs because I can see it cloning
itself but fixing its own bugs and
evolving in that sense I mean is that a
reality though I I think it's possible
that it might be certainly a field of
study that's worth investigating
I wish we had Frank here because Frank
record say I think it's inevitable so
the question is how long okay I mean
think about your own job I mean you
mentioned bugs right a lot of the
process for fixing a bug is you look at
the log message you see what the thing
is you try to analyze the state of the
Machine and then you have to try to
apply some sort of iterative logic
sometimes using a binary search to hone
in on the things sometimes other kinds
of approaches and all of the inputs to
that can be automated in some way so it
seems like it would be possible to do I
just wonder if anyone studying it all
right well there's that any other
questions from the audience we have time
for one more question
hello my name is Natasha I'm here on
scholarship through women who code I'm
actually not a developer yet aspiring so
I just wanted to know what would be some
advice that you have for as someone who
is just getting in so all of this is
incredibly amazing and a bit
overwhelming because I'm like just even
learning how to define certain
terminology so I can write a line of
code that's like at the the level that
I'm at right now so especially for the
women who are on stage what are some
things and for everyone what are some
things that you would suggest that I do
to make sure that I'm getting the most
out of this experience being here and
then also really being intentional about
how I move forward in my process
all right so Mercedes are Mary you want
to take that one first
we've been heard from Mary you want to
take that okay yeah I guess it's a woman
so I can certainly understand what
you're talking about trying to get into
the field where is I so dominated by
male I myself too when I first got into
the industry I felt like I every where
I've worked it's always been I'm the
only woman or maybe one of the few two
or three so it always it didn't really
help so it's um I think now though I
mean okay so I started my career back in
the late 80s early 90s so things were
different then but now I do see it with
all the internet all the social media
and everything is actually you're in a
good time to get into the business and
there are a lot more support groups
they're users group there are women
coding groups that actually for me I
just don't have time to do everything
but when I whenever I can to I would go
and participate in like women's or
hackathon or women's event and you talk
with other women and I actually was also
in some career panel and then speaking
with ladies who are very experienced
they might be school principal and they
wanted to convert like basically my bar
what you call it like transfer or
convert to a becoming a programming
person so I find that those are very
good opportunities and you can look for
those opportunities and then talk to
people already in the field and then get
experience and hear their stories and
then you
by talking to a lot of people about the
experiences you kind of start to
construct the experience that you want
to take on the journey you want to take
on to achieve what you want to achieve I
think yeah definitely reaching out to
the community and yeah those are good so
yep I think we can hear from all the
panelists let's Mercedes you wanna go
next you know when I share the tips for
getting started as a developer I don't
know for me this is up this is car so
how I start but the question is do you
have a background in technology or not
because if you don't have a background
first you need to choose something and
then find a way to learn that if not
well for example go to conference this
is a way good way to make networking and
sometimes in the conference you can look
people looking for for people for
writing their companies so may network
but yeah I don't know for me this is a
hard I wanted to Latasha address your
question of intentionality and getting
the most of this experience here that's
a very great question because we're here
right now one process that I usually do
before going to a conference and it
depends on having enough time and having
your act together well enough is before
the show sit down with the conference
agenda and basically plick your sessions
that you want to go to right and then if
you are into blogging put out a blog
post saying these the piss the the the
ones I want to go and then as you're
doing it I've actually had people come
to me actually rate sang said hey you
know you're lovable live blog that you
did for my session here last year I've
referred to it because I needed to
remember what I said and go back to my
own talk but the point is take good
notes and if you are a blogger might as
well just turned it into a blog post so
the intentionality aspect is study the
program pick the sessions go to them and
take notes all right thank you you want
to add to that so one of the things that
that I've used very effectively is being
inspired by people who do things that I
eventually want to do you know the
beauty of this is seeing somebody who
has done it
shows you that you can actually do it as
well
and and they got there somehow they just
didn't appear there it was a journey
they went through as well and and that's
a journey that requires a lot of effort
a lot of commitment but that's an
inspiration we can take away from and
that's what I would recommend and also
to network to find out other people
you're making new friends that's one of
the things that I love the most going to
conferences is I go into conferences
with a group of friends but I leave with
a lot more friends than I came into and
and you know for example knowing people
like Mary I couldn't have known living
in a completely different city in the
world but knowing that hey I know
somebody I can call in when I go to
Chicago he's just amazing and and that
networking is incredibly valuable
because you've seen somebody maybe you
had breakfast with them and and you
exchange names you take their contact
information that's something that's
gonna you want to take with you so what
I take back from a conference is the
friendship the relationship the contacts
and that's extremely valuable and then
being inspired following it through I
think it's very valuable and then to go
off and start creating something you
know whether it is being part of your
own community you know you don't have to
be very technical honestly some of the
people that I know personally who are
leaders of the Java community are not
because they are coding Java but they
are there because they are like hey I
could contribute in several ways to do
this they are helping people create
content they're helping their treasurers
and user groups they are meeting
organizers there's so many ways we can
actually help one of the biggest
challenges I think a lot of us faces we
want to define some kind of perfection
and we tell ourselves we can't do that
but I think that's completely the
opposite we don't have to be perfect you
know using the words of Les Brown you
don't have to be great to get started
but you got to get started to be great I
think that's extremely important we have
to not be afraid to embrace your
mediocrity because at some point that's
what we all are yeah good point you want
to add something right I would just say
also seek out your local java user group
and attend the meetings other other
meetups as well
maybe also ladies and tech I'd say that
would be a great place to start building
up this this network for yourself
another way to also learn to use your
tools well maybe find a github projects
something that you're interested in
check it out work out how to build it
how to how to interact with the code and
maybe pick a bug on the bug list and try
fixing that and then interact with the
owners of the project and get their
feedback all right cool however anything
to add about getting started if you're
just getting started what would be your
tip you ago I said go go on get up and
clone the repo and and do something
you're crate just something your own it
doesn't have to be code as a mentioned
but my first open source contribution
was actually to translate a getting
started guide for Stalin from from
English to Norwegian and that that's
that's something that's valuable it
makes it more accessible it doesn't
involve coding I don't know any scholar
at all but I was able to translate that
book so just find our thing yeah follow
your passion I think is always good
advice all right well thanks for the
questions
thanks very much to our panelists for
answering the questions and providing
your guidance I think we have some
really cool content and questions
discussion going this is definitely
recorded so if you missed the beginning
because you know we're eating lunch or
something like that it'll be posted on I
believe it's on that is it on the
YouTube Java Java channel in YouTube
from DEF Nexus developer career panel so
thanks everybody and thanks to what our
panelists really appreciate your
exothermic contribution thank you
all right thanks everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
