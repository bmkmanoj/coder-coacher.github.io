technology Network we're here at javaone
India talking to members of the java
community I've got Harshad oak with me
hi Harshad hi Tony how are you doing
here really good good so you're a very
active member of the java community tell
me all the things that you do I have
been involved with Java for quite some
time for over a decade now are we
writing books about hour we along with a
few other people driver user group in
Pune and I've been writing articles
books and kind of reaching out and of
sharing all the all of the new good
stuff the latest and greatest to Java
right right now yeah you're a little shy
because I know you're a Java champion
too right yes yeah that's nice to have
so tell me about what your sessions are
going to be here I am speaking on the
Oracle Java cloud here which is the new
off Java cloud offering from Oracle and
I I find really exciting and it's
something that more people need to be
aware of so hopefully my session will
help good so why bother with the crowd
club people say it's a buzz word people
say it's not what what right what things
can the cloud do for a developer
actually I think the cloud is now past
that stage of being a buzz word it's
more of maturing so even if you look at
SRI strings you will find that people
are now accepting the cloud and there
are real solutions available in the
cloud so actually now we are in stage
where people have accepted the benefits
of cloud and kind of moved to actually
at opting it so the primary benefit of
the cloud as kind of any would be aware
is that you don't have to do all the
stuff that you don't want to do you can
just focus on building your product
which is the benefit of using the cloud
service from Oracle as well that is a
standards-based service that where you
can deploy a normal java application
fairly easily in quick time using any of
the tools like NetBeans and jdeveloper
so it looks really promising ok and
you've worked with it a bit yeah you're
writing a book right
I think working with it for some time
and now I'm writing a book of Oracle
press about Java cloud so yeah yeah so
what have you seen that's been
interesting about it for java developers
I don't understand yeah I think the best
part is the Java continues to be to stay
strong and robust so it Java has gone
through some rough times over the past
few years but it continues to say strong
it continues to move forward not just
Java Java EE as well so although I don't
don't see anything radical or anything
very different but just the thing that
is moving forward and there's definite
progress and definite robustness in the
platform and the strength of the
platform continues to be there I think
that's that's something that delivers
definitely worn from Java and that is
there so tell me if there's aI don't
know if there's such thing as an Indian
java developer community but what do you
see where you are is there you know a
lot of activity or people busy working
or tell me tell me what it's like give
me a flavor in terms of numbers the
indian java community is very very large
it's a huge rather there will be
thousands and thousands of java
developers and every city but in terms
of activity probably we need there's
some did some work to be done so that
there are a few groups across some
cities in india and we have vocational
meets and stuff but the participation
isn't as much as that we would like but
it's it's improving it eventually get
there okay well good so I know you can
go out to java.net if you're interested
right and joining a jug and there's a
big map and you can take a look and see
if there's one in your city so tell me
some of the activities you've done your
jug lately mostly the pony jack has we
have been confirming it's probably one
of the oldest in India there will be the
first people who started it started at
long time back in 96 or something around
that time so it's been handed over to
next people there's somebody else who's
kind of driving it for a few years
somebody else takes it up it's mostly
around user meets
needs interactions or email and that's
kind of being the primary focus of the
user group in Phoenix excellent so it
sounds active and I want to thank you
for your enthusiasm for java over the
years can we go yeah it sounds very
exciting about learning about Oracle's
Java cloud offering which I know you can
learn more and you can get a free 30-day
trial if I want to check it out so thank
you very much and this is Tori wheel
from the Oracle technology Network thank
you Thanks firing me all right
appreciate it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
