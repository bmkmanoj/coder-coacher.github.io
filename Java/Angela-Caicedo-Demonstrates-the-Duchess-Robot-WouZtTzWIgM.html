Network and I'm here today at devoxx
with Angie like I said Oh Angela hi hi
so your java evangelist and you are
always working on interesting projects
and so tell us about what you have here
ok so what I'm trying to do is we're
moving into the Internet of Things so
I'm trying to look for cool devices that
we can connect and use Java so what I
have here is Lego Mindstorm the ev3 and
the good thing about it we built a Duke
because we all look Duke and then so we
have the main board here we have some
input some outputs so for implica
actually have some sensors so we can
have touch sensor color sensors we have
a gyroscope internally so the gyroscope
is actually able to detect if you're
rotating or if the joke is falling so we
can adjust that these guy won't fall
well we'll try and then we have some
outputs that are controlling the motors
so we have two big motors for the main
for the legs and we also have another
model internally that is controlling the
arms so and it's running java and it
works pretty good so you want to give it
a try so when you say java what what
exactly it's all a house that we are
using right now ok ok yes please show oh
yes and we also have I forgot to mention
we have an infrared sensor in the back
so this will allow us in this case we're
talking to him so we're using a remote
control to control the robot you can
also use that sensor for proximity
sensor so you can actually detect
collisions so you don't crash into a
wall things like that but right now
we're going to use it with the remote
control so we can actually direct the
Duke ok so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to start the program we can
actually lay him down ok
and then to start the program we have
the touch sensor
beep
why you not beeping sorry
so it will beep so I'm going to have to
stand him up and then he's able to
balance so he's going back and forward
because he's trying to keep the balance
so you know if he start falling he will
adjust and move he's falling back what
he will move up to just he can turn so
we can actually make him turn oops but I
was a great day it would so that's the
whole idea um we can actually rotate the
forward backward and and again so is
there is a small program that is
controlling like not fouling off no
falling down so it's really the first
rule I mean the robot and sensors that
you would you it's just the beginning of
the project it's the beginning of the
project yeah the idea is to incorporate
em color sensors so we have these ones
so we can actually detect up to seven
colors with this sensor and I think this
is a lot of fun stuff that we can do
yeah great thank you so much for coming
and describing to us all of this thank
you very much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
