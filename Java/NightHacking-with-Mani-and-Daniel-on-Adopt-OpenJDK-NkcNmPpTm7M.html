hacking interview we are going to be
talking about adopt openjdk and we have
some members of the london java
community here who flew all the way out
just to do this interview that's really
nice of you guys to come to Germany just
for an interview with me thanks Team all
pleasure within a few other things as
well but but it's always a pleasure to
chat to yourself different absolutely
absolutely absolutely so all right so
let's do the insurance money sure tell
us a little about yourself and and I'm a
Java developer very passionate about
Java and yeah everyone here's a Java
developer Keuka yeah so I'm very
passionate about the OpenJDK project
itself I spend a lot of time doing that
apart from doing the java stuff that
everybody else does as well and i'm an
active member of the london java
community doing other sub projects that
have come out of the OpenJDK call Daniel
yeah pretty much same story is money to
ask my day stage of a CTO for a small
startup company but I like to maintain
as much hands-on as I can and adopter
openjdk allows me to do that property on
Tina and although hacking in the
internals of the JVM thats lagging it or
the Java core libraries or that's it
really good fun on my day-to-day job
it's more people management so really
keen to do as much yeah hacking as I can
all right so i'm gonna i'm going to show
a little bit of what's on your desktop
here so tell us a little bit about adopt
OpenJDK and what it is how folks can get
involved etc etc oh yes oh and the adopt
group is all about promoting their and
evangelizing the OpenJDK really keen to
get as many people as we can on board
building the OpenJDK it's really quite
simple people often think it's hard
money then the resort than they think
it's you know gonna be insanely hard but
it's not and we've got some great things
for coming up for you we was awesome in
fashion and some bit ly links we can
share with you but the main thing is we
want to get people building the OpenJDK
experimenting contributing to the future
of java because it's you know in order
to contribute well to help steer java in
the future you have to understand where
you are now and the only way you can do
they're released by diving into the
actual guts of the code and having a
play around
and it's very easy to get get involved
we have a nice getting started kit that
takes you all the way from downloading
the virtual machines or building the
word solutions on your own all the way
to building your own virtual machine
they even have examples on making
changes to the jdk library running your
client programs against it and even
doing more advanced stuff like hotspot
hacking and things things like that cool
so I remember I was at one of the first
openjdk hack sessions in London with
Martine yeah a bunch the job of
community members i was asking one of
the guys um you know why why he cared
why he wanted to hack on you know he's
just normal java developer why he was
coming to the session and for him it was
really cool that you know he worked day
to day on coding job media applications
but he could actually make changes you
the the java core libraries which he was
using day in and day out so that that
was his reason for hacking on open Jade
on the OpenJDK but what do you guys why
are you so bad what do you think people
should care I said you know yeah so
actually that's interesting because
OpenJDK is got a history and we have
actually plotted it out it's not exactly
the same as we've shown in the slide but
it's more or less the same same thing a
lot of and it's made up of a lot of
different components which really
interests us because when we are using
job or normally we don't try to find out
what it is made of what's billed what's
the wiring what languages is built in is
java built in java and you only know
that and we only thought you'd find out
more about it and that's actually god is
more interested wow you build java using
java that means you boots in your job
with a previous version of java but can
you boot strapped to the same version of
java let all the electrics and there are
all those experimental questions or what
happens if you pull out that repo is
that repo dependent on the other
actually try it out and see and we did
and all of those questions that were
unanswered actually starting to get
answered and we could only find that out
by getting involved in the project and
doing the deep dive stuff and it's
actually got us to looking deep down
into the source source levels and we've
got snippets of code in the hot spot
that we look at and see oh this is how
garbage collection policies
done oh this is what happens if you
switch on this flag or call this we
watching machine flag and stuff for that
I think yeah so you guys you guys are
probably particularly interested in
korba that sounds like a man just
thinking one because we still don't know
what the goal by is doing there happy
deleted morva would it still build can
you go just as it doesn't but do we
really need to have korbin there to
build you know you can have a lean
version of the jdk so for modularity I
think kick so that will allow you to
turn things like that off which most
java devs no longer use yeah sure enough
I think to answer your questions to
yourself for me it's all about Java is
my native language so to speak I you
know grew up learning java and i really
want to steward it having to help as
much as i can keep it alive and you know
develop foot for example a lot of people
in the london jump in its you Richard
Warburton Jim Goff in particular helped
a lot with the the new datetime live rig
running half day sessions getting
developers excited and involved and
because we have the openjdk project
going on as well I can actually dive
into the internals not only write tests
but understand you know exactly what's
going on under the hood so for me it's
all about the excitement of actually
seeing the development of your language
you know a lot of people really love
java so it's like great you ain't way to
get a girl so you guys how long you been
doing it open adapter for Jericho so the
adopt openjdk actually if you see from
the from the slide it started a little
bit before between 2011-2012 but I have
been involved in it late 2011 Daniel
came in early last year yeah roughly two
and half years for me a year and a half
for him ok and I know that there were
some kind of hack days another stuff
organized around you know fixing
warnings or other stuff in at monte yeah
aight that happened around berkeley
around november two thousand eleven so
Java aids coming out well came out last
week we have the party tonight are any
of you guys contributors to the Java aid
release and we've all you need
enough four hundred of warnings well
actually this every piece of the same
mornings and and my my patches are in
seven and eight I've been told dice yeah
it's pretty cool mind if you do a build
and set you might find me on some of the
some of the passes so the folks in the
audience should should thank you for
your hard work on the Java 8 release you
did accept donations as omani day yeah I
didn't see that it was him oh yeah yeah
and and daniel has also been
contributing since early last year I've
been involved in the test so he's
contesta somewhere is involved in the
better of project which is there to
improve the patch management Emmys he's
basically doing everything around the
OpenGL excited but what I really
conceived and so as to teach people to
teach we find only do they learn the
most by doing that but I mind spending a
great worker sofia bulgaria going out to
train people to like train her than
people which she does is really good
team on in and people that's like edit
don't know they get why they want to be
involved you know yeah i mean i mean
we've collected a bunch of resources
here like likes so two and a half years
ago when i started when the warnings
project started I mean the open today
game wouldn't bill it would take like
three or four times clear tweak it and
experts need to sit in there I mean
Frederick ostrom did an amazing job of
rewrite Asian illustrated here and today
what we have on the wiki on the openjdk
Vicki is actually a result of that build
system fixed and all the other great
work by everybody else and we've got
some nice tools out there to go out nice
documents out there nice time so folks
want to get started with hacking of the
JDK where would you recommend they get
started their job land come and see us
yes these guys every table yeah right
over there we've set them up with the
ends and everything that's all I saw you
have quite a bunch of people hacking at
the table so yeah wait some good with
your presentation le course making
comments to me as well and a half of
those people ended up at the table
they've got copies of the virtual
machine which they can get from us or
download from the getting started kit
okay and then for the the 10,000 people
who are watching the stream after the
fact yeah yeah then these resources are
best exactly you got no long less we've
got some great men unless you've got a
new adoption discuss venomous going on
and welcome you group formed air there
and you're
Who am j d.k.o.c you replace the old one
yeah yeah yeah I'm money's on Twitter
we're on twitter got a better way
waiting interesting links we're always
tweeting new getting started guides so
the best thing money really is the two
getting start exactly i was going to say
the same thing the the the two links of
the bottom the getting started kit and
the intermediate and advanced experience
are the ultimate documents you want to
look at do not waste any time on the
wiki and just get to get started because
it gives you everything you need in an
hour of them in a matter of hours you're
up and running and we're happy to like
we're on the RC channel quite a bit on
Twitter a lot some ways yeah we're
really keen even if we can't be there in
your town but have you liked it invite
us but if we haven't be we can answer on
twitter and absolute and IRC as well my
list and got a lot of people involved in
our cm away and say four thirds it's
very very easy for anybody to get in
mold and and progress further cool
alright well thanks both of you for
taking the time away from your um
openjdk hack session here to to come up
to the stage and i look forward to your
future success in making java better
language for all of us thank you thank
you thank you thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
