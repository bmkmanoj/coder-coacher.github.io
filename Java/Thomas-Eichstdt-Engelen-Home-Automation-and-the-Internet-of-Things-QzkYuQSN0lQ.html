Network and I'm here today with Tomas
angling Tomas I hi so it tell us a
little bit what you do for for living
what I do for living I'm a senior
consultant a normal life I'm a senior
consultant in a small medium based and
software consulting company and yes I'm
that's that's my normal day job and
there's a second heart in my boy and the
second part is home automation and as
with in the home automation area I am
very addicted to a project called open
up open home automation bus and yeah
that's right on what I'm doing my spare
time developing things automating things
at home if not everything is automated
then yeah I'm not convinced so it's
quite a hard job to do all that and you
receive a Duke Choice Award for the this
year for the project yes open hop
receives the award at least and it is
very much deserved to the to the whole
community of oak map so we have yes sir
who else was on the project with you
there's Kaikoura who found the project
in early 2010 and currently we have
around 20 active contributors to the
project we recently switched our project
from google code to get up so we know
very well who is active and who
contributes to the project and that's
around 20 contributors and around 70 fox
we have the project so it's quite active
quite vibrant and we are very happy
about that and that's the reason why we
received the award I think or why the
project is receive the water
so the the project so explain a little
bit what does it do or I mean is it a
platform what did you create yeah the
whole problem in home automation area is
there are many many different systems
out there and all of the systems speak
different protocols and since there is
no global protocol that all of the
devices speak we have to create or we
had to create a platform which leverages
all the protocols and open map is an
integration platform which connects to
all the different devices and yeah
builds services on top of that devices
so that home automation is possible
again before that you have no chance
because all of that devices have their
own silo and with this integration
platform we build services on top of
that and we make possible to switch
things that are not connected before
we're not connected before okay so so
when you talk about devices what kind of
devices are we talking about how is that
the fridge I mean so probably guess
there are fridges with ethernet
connection we have professional home
automation buses for example KNX it's
very lickable is very popular in
belgium then we have devices like the
philips you for example and a device
like a Tesla Model S which is a car av
car and all of these devices yet doesn't
happen probably just normally have no
connection to each other and so we can
make them speak to each other and we can
then operate on top of them and automate
that so how did you build it I mean
which language do you use we use Java
and on top of Java we use osgi as to ya
in order to modular rice or software
better because there is no java language
feature which supports fertilization but
area
yes we use sauce guy and that's the
technology stack and Java as a
foundation on osteon top and many of the
Eclipse projects that are out there so
where can people find more information
about this project we have a website
open heart org which is we we started
with a new landing page a bit more fancy
landing page than before after that and
the most of the information is based on
the big Vicki and most of our
contributors right there picking the
Vicki itself is quite well written but
it's not that complete as it could be so
yeah it's an open source project and we
do our best to have that description as
good as possible thank you so much for
talking to us to delay thanks for having
you thank you thank you for joining us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
