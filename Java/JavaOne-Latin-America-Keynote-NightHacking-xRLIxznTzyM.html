the audience and we're just we're having
a little chat and informal conversation
Simon okay pay no attention to the man
behind the camp welcome to the light
hacking show thank you and we love to
hear about what interesting people well
you're interesting at the hope what
folks are doing with Java technology on
on different platforms and devices and
you look like you have lots of cool toys
here okay so let me ask question who
here has heard of the Raspberry Pi okay
most people have great so we've got here
is so we got to help these guys okay so
if you notice the cameras are pointing
at us not you so raising your hands no
now clapping making noise yes that shows
up on camera okay try that again okay so
who here by show of clapping has heard
of the Raspberry Pi great so as you know
the raspberry pi is a very cheap linux
computer it uses an ARM processor and
it's literally $35 for the whole machine
now the great thing about this is that
you can do some interesting things in
terms of obviously programming it and
turning it into various devices and so
on so what I thought was you know let's
see what we can do with Java running on
the Raspberry Pi so as like that's like
that like Java ME stuff right this is
actually running java SE we're on the
jabra me because it's that powerful that
it can do exactly desktop we can do on
yes so it's the same actual java SE JVM
just poured it to the ARM processor and
as George announced you know we are
going to have a hard float
implementation which is going to be
available by the end of the year in
early access to make sure I say early
access okay so what I've done is I
thought to myself okay so let's let's
kind of use some of the power of the
Raspberry Pi and specifically the fact
that it has some gpio general purpose io
connectors available on it and what I've
got here is a lego motor so it looks
like
your kids build them um well I used some
of my son's Lego he hasn't actually
noticed that I've borrowed his lego he
has so much of it that he doesn't notice
that a few bricks have gone missing
those are some your hobbies have rubbed
off on your kids absolutely yes and what
I've done is I've connected the Lego
motor to the Raspberry Pi using the GPIO
lines and there's a little bit of
circuitry in here which basically
converts the TTL logic levels that you
get on the the lines here into the
9-volt control of the motor so that's
all well and good but then I thought
okay so how can we actually do something
useful ok maybe not useful but at least
interesting with the Lego motor and what
I've got here in is in the USB port
connected to the raspberry pi is a
dongle for this thing that now i can
tell you Simon that's not it doesn't
look like that would actually give you
good protection they vent in a crash no
it's it's not just again you can't ride
with me on the night hacking tormund no
no no no I I don't think I would want to
do that no so what this actually is I
just hold that up see that is an EEG
monitor so actually monitors your
brainwaves and I've got this thing about
putting things on my head enduring
keynote presentations so I'm going to
put this on and what I need to do is I
need to connect this to my ear hopefully
we'll get a good enough signal this is
always the tricky bit is actually making
sure I get good enough connection but
let's see if we get this to work okay so
what I'm doing now is I've actually got
this connected and if I remember to turn
it on which is always the important
thing as well it's now i'm going to
start reading my brain waves and it's
going to send the information from the
sensors to the dongle and that's going
to be read by the Raspberry Pi so I've
written a Java API that just takes the
information through a serial port into
the Raspberry Pi processes it and then
sends it to the the motor and the idea
there is to the the sensor the mind wave
actually recall
various values of different brain wave
functions but it also gives you two
values one of which is the attention
that you currently have and one is your
meditation so one of them is I've
connected you feel comfortable
meditating in front of a room of
hundreds of Java no no no so I thought
actually the attention would be good so
the idea now is that I'm actually going
to control the lego motor with my mind
in theory we'll see whether that works
okay good we're still connected right so
if I just run the application now I just
need to make sure that we get a good
signal here and hopefully we'll get a
connection I'm not seeing anything
although that okay yep good okay that
right now so so it's now actually
reading my brain waves and turning my
attention into a value which is
controlling the position of the motor so
what I'm going to do now is I'm going to
use my Jedi mind trick to control the
motor it's pretty difficult events to do
this in front of a very large audience
I've got to say but essentially that
that is now using my attention which is
but clearly varying it's waning it's
drifting in and out you know obviously
I'm not quite got in the jedis mindless
writer but that is actually working so
if I turn this off and in fact let me
just take this off it and see with it so
hopefully that I should I have to turn
it off as well okay so it's not sending
random data that's interested all right
now hang on no I know what it is no it's
no I'm not quite sure what's going on
there anyway
so i think i think the epic failure is
around the flaws this isn't remember
yourself never try something new in
front of an audience I didn't I've never
tried that this is this is part of the
fun we don't have an audience or just
have exactly shot on our interview and
Tessa thank you very much for being on
the night hacking okay Thank You
