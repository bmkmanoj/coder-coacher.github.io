technology Network we're here at javelin
Shanghai talking to members of the java
community I've got Simon Ritter with me
here today hey Simon hey how are you
doing pretty good that's cool so tell me
about your sessions here at javaone
Shanghai oh well it's see I think I've
got four sessions yesterday I did a
session on 55 new features in java SE
eight or i was highlighting all the
different things that were including in
the next version of java wait a minute I
gotta stop you there did you say 55 55
new features yes in an act Wow all of
the new features I was pretty much all
of the features yet ok cool and then
yesterday I had a session on the
Raspberry Pi with Java where I had some
pretty cool demos that I did put that
have a mind-controlled lego motor
excellent wait a minute you control a
lego motor with your mind that's right
you guys wow that's really cool so I've
heard a lot people talking about the
raspberry pi a lot tell me why there's
so much interest in it I think it's
really because of the price point star
way because it's literally $25 for a
computer okay so you can use it in all
sorts of different applications it's
really quite powerful for twenty-five
dollars and so people can you know use
it for something and then you know try
something else and if they think that
they can make like a video streaming
device you know it's $25 so people are
really happy with the kind of price of
these things and it's just so flexible
in terms of what you can do with it and
it's a really easy way to get into this
whole Internet of Things platform that
everybody's interested in right that's
right that's amore one of the big
advantages of the fact that you can
connect things like you know sensors and
motors and stuff like that to it in a
really simple way and one of the things
we've done with Java is we've provided
an API specifically for that as part of
Java ME and in fact Java e 3.3 Java me
and they did 3.3 has just been released
right it's GA yesterday right right yes
yeah man includes the device access API
which is very very useful in that right
so I know you can go to 0 10 right now
and go get those bits so I'm going to
recommend that people do that definitely
yeah so I've just now that you've been
in China for a little while do you do
you have an impression of like the java
developer community in China is there a
difference or what do you see I wouldn't
say there's a difference but there's a
lot of developers and they're very very
passionate about Java I mean it's it's
really always interesting for me to see
what kind of questions I get after my
sessions and I've had a lot of people
coming up to me and asking me really
in-depth questions so they're obviously
getting the technology and they want to
use it for a lot of different things so
that's really good wow that's pretty
exciting I mean if people are really
asking you some in-depth questions
they're passionate they're really
enthused about Java that's right yeah
yeah you know well cool Simon I'm glad
you dropped by our booth it's delightful
that I got a few moments to talk to you
so thanks a lot thank you hi this is
story way up from the Oracle technology
