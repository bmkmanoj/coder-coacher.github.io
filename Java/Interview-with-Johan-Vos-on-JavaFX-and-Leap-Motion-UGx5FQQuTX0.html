in move in with dr. Voss at the lodge on
headquarters welcome dr. Voss hi Steve
nice having you here so we're we're here
right before the DevOps conference
actually hacking on some digital signage
and stuff for that but we figured we
would do a live video stream and show
some of the other projects which Johan
that's going on related to javafx and
leap motion so without further ado what
are we to hacking on today dr. Voss are
you gonna get annoyed if I keep telling
you that sorry this is my turn yeah what
we will show today is am we have we have
a back-end application weave a web
interface for those of you I think
that's already exciting we're going to
make it even more exciting but maybe I
don't have to spoil the pleasure so
maybe we first have to show the boring
application the application that i
consider pretty boring okay okay so
there's a difficulty in our setup here
so the mouse is connected to my laptop
but the output is connected to steve's
laptop so if you see strange mark
behavior that's because of the setup so
what we have here is the demean quest
that's a service SAS surface actually
that we created on top of that occur on
top of glassfish at the lodge on what
the mean min quest is actually a
combination of quests and a quest is a
combination of means it sounds a bit
difficult but quest is a typical
question for example there are a number
of quests in the main quest already like
what did you like about Java one what
can be improved here what did you like
about leap motion and so on and a quest
can have different means which are
actually IDs from people so people can
response the quests and and give some
opinions and then they can also vote on
orders meet other memes and the best min
will bubble up in the quest I will
create a quest now
I have to sign in but workwear Fatheads
blocking the sign in there where we're
physically blocking the signing madam if
you know how it works in that that's
your mouth and design yo come on skype
okay so good enough I don't have to
create a new account because as it
should be you can login with your
twitter or facebook or credentials have
to authorize the application and now I'm
login so visually blocked system know
the dialogue in this Johan Falls I can
go to my quests see I created a number
of quests already I can create a new one
enter a name description this is a this
is the blah blah question what should we
do for java 1 2014 instead of public
West we should call it off at 12
thousand i can't see what i type so it's
close enough close enough texture on
java and we're going to do this in
english and we create the quest that's
good give the two most popular line
which is the world of their data type in
a PHP close okay so this is this is our
quest we can add a few mins know like
IDs for example 2 1 2014 move it back to
moscone probably do it in moscone oh
yeah now i can also tell my friends that
I your V resume no but that's it's hard
to tell for the system's I don't have
friends so come what I've Facebook
friends and well that counts as well for
the cert they're almost like friends
yeah but I don't have much Facebook
friends actually
so I can share it on Facebook and I at
this is my personal idea and we share it
on Facebook it should be on facebook now
um if I can go to Facebook that's that's
challenging let's check out I have this
logo up there and I have the title and
I'm not a right I'll go back my
connecting to facebook with something
else oh pip oh that's probably
yeah kind of bringing to the to the
right thing so ok what we see here is
your voice this is my timeline and as
you can see many friends doing many
things on a hook so it's on facebook and
also it exists in the world it's
wonderful so and actually when some of
my friends watch my timeline they can
they can see this ok they click on it
and then they will come to the quest
that I did and they can voltar it I
can't fault for my own meme of course
but it's am that you know doing social
stuff that isn't doesn't part of the
standard Java expected do you have a fan
not yet but I think you bring up an
interesting a topic there that well the
good thing is java ee 7 is a finished
now and it's time for thinking about
what can we do in a java project no v8
called Delacour well actually we're
using data core in this applique really
yeah it's a coincidence yeah it makes it
all so much easier to have this
integration with social networking we
didn't have to write much code for
having this facebook share and login via
Twitter and so that's a let the Dalek on
top of a glossary that's that's doing
this so that it's not it's not standard
java enterprise but well we don't have a
standard yet in the enterprise for
social media
so that's the the web part oh yeah one
other thing that I forgot to mention so
you can watch memes on the Facebook and
Twitter and but you can also go to a
quest oh yeah javafx Java vex yeah but
literally was the top or a platform this
is probably an old quest from yes they
are so yeah yeah what you can also do is
you can click on this and then you will
get a code snippet and if you put this
in your website you will show the top
means on your website to it's it's it's
sort of like a Twitter batch or so so
you can incorporate your quest and the
memes in your own website you can have
them on a facebook on Twitter or you can
go to the to the main quest funny
website yeah you never be like or if it
was a real application an application
would make sense indeed apart from
website well good enough I was working
on on a Java vex application or you mean
the top using the top reapplied for me
one of them most frequently used
platforms for developing client
applications um if you want I can show
it you happiness let's see I have to
move the cursor to the to my screen for
foster care center and did it what
spoiling the next thing
not sure where this is going to be sure
somewhere okay it show her my screen so
as you can't see yeah but this is what
you can see so this is actually a chav
effects application it runs on a linux
ER now those ones on the windows on the
mac on any other system probably soon in
the future so what we have here is a
same we connect to the same back end as
we saw on the website actually that was
an angular website alert the JavaScript
you know JavaScript yeah yeah I've heard
about that's a scripting language it's
scatting owner actually operates at JVM
language yeah yeah it's on top of came
here yeah Nashville one is probably what
yeah that's the at the runtime but it
runs in the Java version that's the
foundation of JavaScript yes no so here
we can choose between the number of
memes I hard followed a few of them
what's going to happen now is we connect
to the backend system and we well the
question that that we choose now is a
particular one up on the leap motion you
know the leap motion it's some dis dis
device Michelle mace let me let me make
a bigger ok yeah they're yeah so that's
a it's a cool device from a company
called leap motion and its response to
gestures that hand gestures that you
have on top of it now we're not going to
go into detail now maybe in five minutes
but that's just the device and it has
number of features like for example yeah
this is a bogus thing in touch I'm not
going to translate it because you're
going to probably cut recording them are
you curb super ungu look Alamy over with
dirt has my touch well if you said this
out loud and place was nearby you
wouldn't
able to do the country anymore but you
like it or not like like at this is
something that I probably shouldn't stay
on live stream in front of ya our world
especially not if this is paid by a US
company they're gonna beep it out so do
you like that statement or not yeah I
love yeah you like it okay then we move
the slider and it seems that your
lightest add some very professional
graphics theory yeah that's as you can
expect that from me this is this is
design you know design yes it's a dev ox
will be glad to know that Johan is not
doing a design rotational signage at
that box well agile already did that it
depends I might have some time to make
some minor adjustments now we're very
very busy 1 2 3 t.o Steffensen is
listening don't worry I have the design
on the control it's it's gonna be cool
so we vote for for a specific one and
this one I don't like or the browser
integration it's actually pretty cool
but I always already showed the positive
feature so this is less cool for example
anyway who needs a profit of today if
you have applications mind the program
has bar that's moving using our binding
for this so this is a okay blah blah
blah blah and we can so all the memes
that people enter then there are also
wants a book we can photon them here now
it's getting a bit hard because yeah my
hand on the mouse that's uh it's it's
not very good to be more of a keyword
person a keyboard oh yeah that still
exists how old is the keyword actually
isn't it amazing that we're now 2013 and
we're still using you know you know why
those keys are offset on your keyboard
right no it is that all these little
mechanical um grippers underneath that
they actually hit the physical keys
which type okay so the the thing knows
when I'm hitting a key no it doesn't it
doesn't notice there's little mechanical
arms on your
okay so if they were lined up in perfect
grids they would hit each other that's
why they stagger the keys on your
keyboard because of all the you know so
thanks for this very useful information
but actually I'm not sure if I need this
mechanical thing especially not for
doing this yeah that's a my wireless
neck so why don't we try something
better for if you do you have any ideas
on something better it should be much
easier if you want to if you want to
vote on a number of ideas and if you
don't have to use the mouse every time
then you can't or assume that you're
eating an orange for example and this is
this is a real life situation when
you're eating fruit you have to type at
the keyboard it's a mess and so deeply
don't do that explains Laurel on your
keyboard no that's because my colleagues
use my keyboard as well but I'm imagine
that you could keep working world eating
an orange that would probably save lots
of time yeah that could change the world
I think and well one of the things that
I was thinking about when when we do
reviews of our conference papers it's
often yet you have to put together I
like it no I don't like it and rather
than doing it the old-fashioned way on a
website or a bit less old-fashioned way
in a job of X application you can use
this leap motion device let me quickly
hack something which actually means move
the mouse to my part of the screen again
and impressed FX
oh and now I have to move it back to go
forth on the screen I'm going to stop
this application this here we are ok so
here we r again so actually we have the
same application but not completely do
you see the difference yeah and it's
missing it's missing the that cool
little slider control slider slider is a
cool control actually has nothing there
how do you even picker well if if you um
like something if or if you don't like
something you actually just wave your
hand I'm gonna do that don't don't put a
leaking out for it oh it's actually have
a black screen hanging out right here
alright so um I hope this is a
synchronous a camera synchronous with
the mostly otherwise the whole concept
is gone it's close enough so you have
your hand here and if if I like this
idea that was a Bobby's idea so I went
to the next one which is also bogus
actually but ok that's bogus if I like
it I move my hand to the right you're
like for the viewers it might be to the
left because the camera well you up
there one stage and and if i don't like
it i move it 22 to the left and watch
watch the smiley moving so if i like it
i agree and if i said ok that's it I tap
just just tap your finger you go to the
next one so this one I don't like it
well next one I like it and so you can
contain continue and go on I if we have
a pause I preferred to be on the smiley
because actually there's no graphics
involved in here because I can't create
a graphic so this is just maath so the
it's a cubic curve and you're better at
math
you're pushing pixels matt is much much
easier than doing the picture so this is
just there it shows from your UI design
but actually the what what we do is we
create binding between the the
coordinates of the leap motion with the
the interpolation part of the curve of
the mouth of the smiley so it's just
that was pretty cool general yang Tao
binding Alec surfaces yeah I get a bit
depressed because of this actually um i
was showing this to my son four years
old and he liked it and then he had some
music on and he started playing with so
first saw some kids music and he was
very fast enough you could make it like
a talk yeah probably yeah you do look
low voice overs with smiling exactly so
it can be a beavis and butthead kind of
a kind of thing okay this is a good
point for folks on the stream to ask
questions of dr. Voss and his his
amazing javafx app which makes a smiley
and animates a smiley with your hand if
yeah well if you have more design
questions I'm happy to take that before
if you want assistance in helping you in
a design well wrong broadcast well to
get let's get you asked for pots on for
that one um yeah okay so you can see we
have we have no questions because
they're so amazed ya hala gb shaw
murdered dumbfounded i see jose's on the
stream and he's probably taking notes
because i think he wants to have a leap
motion as well one nowadays i just
several workers I think Stefan sake as
well mmm okay so anything else you want
to show dr. Rose I think that's it for
now what I think what's important is
that what we have to take away is that
with with Java vex you cannot only
connect a client application to an
existing back-end and show this
functionality but you can also integrate
with cool devices like for example the
leap motion so I think this proves it
java vexes soon to be the number one
preferred platform for oh yeah okay we
got a delay question from jose let's
answer those my clothes the stream okay
okay Jose asks can I already use the
meme on my blog yes you can it's a so if
you go to me acuesto dork it's actually
it's in it's in beta but feel free to
use it it's a you can use it on your
blog and you can will make this redirect
the drivers are so dumb definitely yes
it's already we already packaged it as a
as an application for making windows but
we want to share the source code of
these applications as well and you can
of course if you want to stick with the
web version you can use it with Facebook
or use the JavaScript integration to
incorporate it on your blog feel free to
do it and please let us know if that you
have any questions requests whatever
cool all right so thanks very much for
joining me for the night hacking in
between Jay fall DevOps lodge on
headquarters and well we'll see you at
the dev box conference next week I have
streaming next wednesday from two to
five p.m. central european time and you
could find the signup page on the night
hacking com website so thanks very much
thanks for having me
