back at the ORD of stage and now I have
with me Holly coming hi Holly
hello how are you yeah very good nice to
be here I see you again um maybe you
just introduce yourself for those who
don't know who you are tell us a little
bit about who you are and what you do
sure so I'm a longtime IBM er I've been
doing software development for IBM for
15 years I've worked in all sorts of
different places I've worked writing the
JVM doing performance for the JVM I've
done performance tools for the JVM I've
worked on WebSphere for a long time and
what I'm doing now is I'm a consultant
in the bluemix garage so we do customer
projects using the sort of the latest
and greatest technology and also design
thinking to try and come up with
something quite innovative and quite
efficiently as well very cool yes I've
seen you around for many years a
friendly face Shh well we both been
around for many years but you know
that's a good and a bad thing I think
it's good thing we have lots of
experience with the Java community but
I've never interviewed you before so I
like to hear you know in your words uh
so you have a really interesting talk
here at our dev in just a little bit uh
you tell us a little bit about it I know
you said it's to talk that you know you
kind of modify and evolve as times
change and tools change but it sounds
really intriguing so maybe tell us a
little bit about what you're there the
talk title is confessions of an
automation addict it's very it's very
provocative title yeah and I think that
what's interesting is that the tools we
use for automation change as you know as
we have new problems but the fundamental
challenge of automation is still there
and it's how do we balance the time we
spend to automate a task against the
time that the task was originally taking
us and we can get that balance wrong in
two directions we can just keep sort of
goldfish like doing this task that's
really mindless and repetitive and we
could be spending our time on something
else instead but instead you know we
don't step outside and look back and say
I could be using my time more
efficiently right and that's bad but
sometimes we get the opposite problem as
well which is as software engineers you
know we have this really lucky position
where we have the tools and the skill
to be able to make a lot of these
problems go away and so we go with this
task is a little bit tedious I'm gonna
automate it right and then six months
later we're still working on maintaining
the automation framework that we built
and it's getting this towering stack of
features and function and bugs and we've
completely lost sight of the original
task that we were trying to do because
we're still working on the Irate
automation right and that's a really
easy trap to fall into and it's one that
I've fallen into many times myself so
it's sort of a I do as I say not as I do
when it comes to automation right I've
found myself in some of those situations
as well it's hard to keep you know the
big-picture view sometimes when you're
working on a problem even in a team
environment yeah I think it's exactly
that big picture that sometimes you know
it's what you're doing seems to make a
lot of sense to you because you just you
know you solve one problem you go on to
the next problem you have an ordered
list of problems and it's only when you
step back and talk to someone else and
they say what are you working on and
then you explain and you realize as soon
as you explain it that it sounds
ridiculous because what you're doing
isn't actually adding value right you're
investing all this time the opportunity
costs and become invested in it so so
your talk you're giving some tips on how
to kind of be able to pull back away
from the situation and know when maybe
you'd be a little bit more yeah
self-aware those things exactly the sort
of some you know some guidelines for
well how do I measure how much it's
going to cost how do I that sense of
perspective what are some red flags to
look for when I'm doing an automation
that let me know that actually I've got
to invested and what I'm doing isn't a
good idea anymore and also the other way
around as well you know so there's rules
of thumb for well when should I start to
automate a problem mm-hmm well sounds
like a really valuable session to attend
and it's now starting right now after
this interview out of XP at 6:00 p.m.
okay and then afterwards of course we
have our bright lights starting shining
on us right now we have some music later
so I'm looking forward to that what are
some of your highlights of or dev though
it's been really interesting for me to
see kind of some of the opportunities
that they gave to us as speakers and
then the venue and the people and the
diversity in terms of the topics I mean
what are some where all of the above so
I mean it's such a nice
and I think you know they were lucky to
have such a lovely venue the Turks are
so interesting because because it's got
this broad focus they're talking about a
range of Technology which is interesting
including some that I don't normally
think about like the more academic side
of Technology but then also talking
about the more human side of Technology
as well and how we what we do as
technologists affects those around us I
think that's really interesting to think
about it definitely it is I've
definitely appreciate that I mean you
can not have seated in the keynote
topics that they select as well really
focusing on that human aspect and of
course me working with the community I'm
very interested in behavior and kind of
the soft skills that you can acquire
other than the technical skills so kind
of blending that all together to keep
yourself relevant and marketable in in
the developer world it's really becoming
more and more essential so I'm
definitely enjoying the topics I haven't
had a chance to attend too many talks
yet but yeah I'm definitely having a
great time here so I'm joy hearing more
about what you're doing here this week I
look forward to catching up with you
after your talk and checking out some of
the music I don't have a second talk as
well okay second Todd yeah I'm speaking
on Friday on micro services okay and
then I've got I've got a demo ok and I
think the interesting thing about micro
services is we take something that was a
monolith and we turn into a distributed
system and that has some advantages but
it also has some really big risks that
we need to be aware of and I think
sometimes when we approach micro
services we we think about the
advantages and we forget about the
disadvantages and what I've done in my
talk because I've used raspberry PI's oh
how the system is distributed as soon as
you do that then you get network card
failures you get one of them stops
working you get one of them you forget
to plug in and then you can really
immediately see how the system needs to
be able to cope with a failure so I
think that's very useful the downside
for me as a presenter is that I never
actually know which things going to go
wrong
so it's a slightly stressful talk so you
have a little hardware case that you
bring with you and so how many raspberry
PI's are you gonna have any library PI
raspberry PI's I was just discussing
with Chris who was up here before you
know doing a Raspberry Pi class for kids
and all the different part
that can fail we do I think maybe 20
kits at a time so that that could be a
challenge to manage five of them so it's
live in person it is a check out the
failures you're going to be you know
yeah yeah yeah check out the failures
the failures are deliberate even though
I look surprised
the the goal is to have some failures
you just don't know which ones you're
gonna observe exactly observe and learn
yeah but to make it more realistic okay
and you take help from the audience yeah
an interactive session with aliens right
yeah okay well I'm gonna miss that one
but that sounds really exciting you
don't have to catch it at the next
conference I see you and you have that
talk because I'm leaving on Friday
morning I'm gonna miss that one but
sounds very exciting yeah yeah it's
exciting exciting all right well thanks
for talking with me my pleasure
talk to you soon too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
