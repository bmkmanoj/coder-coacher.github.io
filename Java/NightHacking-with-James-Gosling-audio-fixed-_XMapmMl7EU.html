stream you can find out more information
about the online video broadcast I'm
doing at night hacking calm today I'm
out here with james gosling father of
Java and what's your title at liquid
robotics um chief software architect ok
very impressive yeah whatever you know
type that off the street you know and
we're out here in Hawaii that you liquid
robotics Launch Center where you guys
actually launched the aquatic robots
yeah well and where we do all of our
engineering testing and we've got a
fairly extensive shop here for banging
on large pieces of metal and yeah and i
noticed back there there's quite a lot
of have the equipment yeah
although I'd equal amount of the press
of equipment in sunny of the location
yeah out there yeah sunnyvale is more
you know people doing CAD and
electronics and stuff than anything that
requires like a large a large hammer
easily happens out here cool so what the
plan for today is is James and I were
hanging out the past couple days and we
got some good video footage I'm of the
aquatic robots everything from the
hardware to loading on boats to launch
you get at sea yup and then we wanted to
also show some of the software they're
actually running a java ee server yup a
java web server on the devices and then
finally do some Q&amp;amp;A from folks in in
chat so without further ado about we
show them some of the nice hardware
yeah so this is a walk around that i did
with stephen you can see the the wings
these are these are the the new models
with fairly nicely hydrodynamic wings
and you can see the there's the wing
rack and the float above it normally
those are you know quite a lot large
there's distance apart when it's in the
water and that black sort of snakey
thing is the umbilical that that
connects the two and the umbilicals a
fairly gnarly piece of technology
because it has to take a lot of shock
load because I'm standing there in that
video waving my hands and I have no clue
what it was talking about at the time
but you can see the the solar panels and
the rudder are done at the back once
again the fins you can see sort of at
the at the stern of the the wing rack
there's the rudder and this model has
actually got a thruster which has been a
source of much entertainment ok let's
let's skip and actually take a closer
look at the thruster that's that's
pretty interesting yeah so that this is
a large block of titanium and there's
actually a thruster bar we don't use the
thruster very often but when we do use
the thruster it gets us out of type
tight situations like if we're about to
be run run
down and there's a there's a processor
in there that's a fairly small
microcontroller and it communicates
through a can bus for any of you who've
ever played with the can bus to the the
float end of it and all the really
important bits are up in the float and
we have some video of the brain of the
the brains yeah so this is the command
and control box it's a watertight box
that's you know designed to be you know
submerged under salt water for very long
time most of the bulk of it is actually
batteries and those black lumps on the
top top are wet made a bowl saltwater
compatible connectors those connectors
cost more than your average cell phone
which is a little scare they certainly
cost more than the processor that's this
isn't exactly all off-the-shelf parts
you can just hablo together yeah those
connectors are actually yeah those
connectors are actually custom-made and
doing what may dabble in saltwater
connectors is little even fine to have
them open like that one of those
connectors is enough it will not be open
when it gets put in the water that
badness ensues if it's if it's open when
it's in the water that bump that I've
got my hand on there that's where all
the antennas are the for the
the GPS and the Wi-Fi and a couple of
other parts the piece that matters the
most of people who are listening is
inside that box and it's it's basically
the guts of the cell phone that we're
running linux on it's a it's an arm
seven it's a TI OMAP something or other
on the on the arm scale it's relatively
wimpy but compared to what we used to
have in there it's it's a huge
improvement yeah yeah definitely Java
runs on much smaller devices and this
this actually was where you started the
Java yeah yeah you're a long time ago
you know 20 odd years ago it was all
about small devices and you know now are
now our small devices are as big a big
as what we thought it was a skater as
you started yeah yeah so it's it's it's
it's been entertaining to see them
actually fit in these things now
and so all of the really sophisticated
software is up on the top where the the
Java VM is and
you know it's it's wildly multi-threaded
there's a lot of some strange AI that
goes on up there so I like like one of
the features that the kind of weirds out
people the most is the bestest thing is
pretty good at doing obstacle avoidance
in the early days of this thing they the
local boat crew was kind of weirded out
by it because they go and they try to
pick one of these things up and it would
get out of the way and and they'd then
they'd spend a lot of time like anything
hunting it down trying to pick it up and
it would just run away and then hang and
they had completely forgotten that the
new model has obstacle avoidance so then
they just have to remember oh yeah
really reaching over the network and
turn out obstacle avoidance yeah we
noticed that way around the ship that
the moment got in the water it scurried
away yeah it runs away they could
possibly yeah from us yeah and one of
them when we when we dropped them off
you know it had been if it had been
given a place to go to to sort of march
or undo its tests and and we were sort
of in between it and it and where it was
supposed to be so this is a little
annoyed so for those of folks you don't
know too much about see navigation once
you explain how the
because work yeah so the the there's
this international standard and set of
regulations about radio beacons that all
all ships at sea are supposed to have I
mean there's they're sort of regulations
on when they're supposed to have them
you know and it's a combination of you
know beyond a certain distance from the
shore and above a certain number of tons
but pretty much anything that you
encounter more than a few miles off
shore is guaranteed to either be
breaking the law or have any is vegan
yeah so smugglers might turn it off at
their own Earl yeah although although
that that actually turns out to be a bad
idea because then you know they're you
know look at this mug leurs are coming
into the shore with the AIS beacon turns
up somebody will notice and if the ass
beacon is off that like putting a flag
on saying that mug leurs yeah yeah and
yeah they're they're much more likely to
the the AIS beacon has an identifier in
it and
and so they're much more likely to do
something like say my I'm my own and I'm
oof the identifier of lung something
like random pitching vessel got it got
it why don't we actually show the drive
on these guys as well these these have a
very interesting way of moving through
the water yeah so the the little wing
rack at the bottom you see those those
fingers sticking out on the side those
are actually wings and they flex up and
down so as the as the float is moving up
and down in the water as the waves lift
it up and down the wing rack is down
here and it's got these wings but the
wings sort of flipped that way that way
that way there and so it does this sort
of rowing motion which turns into
forward motion so we we end up
generating forward thrust from the wing
rack and we end up with quite a bit of
thrust we get about half a ton of thrust
and really dependent on the size of the
waves yeah oh it's a it's an interesting
sort of function because when there's
with the sea States really high with his
big waves we get a lot more forward
thrust but at the same time we also get
a lot more resistance because we're
plowing through their waves so we reach
sort of an equilibrium I'm not sure we
don't really know what the equilibrium
speed is on the on the new vessels on
the old ones it was some words around a
knot and a half
the new ones we should be or we have
actually clock limit I'd like two and a
half knots which is just pretty good you
know what we can expect in sort of
standard C States is somewhat unclear
cool but you know it's a lot of
experiments to come all right so that's
something else I thought was cool while
I was out here is home you spent quite a
lot of time calibrating these guys
before putting them out to sea this is
um because as Quicksilver you're working
on yeah yeah so this is me calibrating
the compass on quicksilver's like I'm
rotating it you can see there's this
thing that I'm staring at right there
which is just an ordinary hikers compass
and I'm you know attempting to use my
laptop in the bright Hawaiian Sun which
is a little bit tricky but in the rudder
module there's a there's a compass in
there and the problem with that compass
is that it's surrounded by a lot of
things that disturb the local magnetic
field and so understanding how the
magnetic field of the the surrounding in
the in the throat ER affects the compass
is is pretty important to being able to
go in the direction you want to go so
I've been spending a lot of the last
last while
sort of understanding how the magnetic
fields get get get torqued around and
then you know build these apps as much
of an issue any holes models or is it
well it was an issue on the old models
but then they then so what they ended up
doing was putting a secondary compass
I'm kind of far away and we can't lean
out in LA well it is just being distant
from the the magnetic fields in the
rudder and sort of in our in our plan is
putting a remote compass in but problem
with the remote compasses it's another
thing to fail is out on a wire in a
place where you know sharks like to put
their jaws you know in salt water you
know just you know just just you know an
extra piece of wire is just a just an
opportunity for issues so the nice thing
about having the compass right in the
the rudder module is it's a big block of
titanium and it charted sealed it's it's
it's there's this not much that can
damage that
and it's got a you know really
ruggedized communication system up to
the up to the float yeah so it's the
safest place to be but it's also the
place with the the most sort of magnetic
distortion and and so you know the Met
undoing the magnetic distortion in
software has worked out pretty well so
i'm i'm pretty happy i've been been
tweaking it over the last several weeks
and
the the numbers right now we're looking
pretty darn good so I'm pretty happy
with that well this is Quicksilver but
one of the other boats we're looking at
he has an extra piece of equipment here
yeah so that's that's Captain America
he's got a camera on one of the masks
forget exactly which which camera that
is it's a it's not an off-the-shelf
camera it's one that's got a really nice
sort of web interface there's anyone who
has those cameras or something no these
guys aren't selling this camera yet we
sort of got an under-the-table
pre-production version of this camera
but it's got a got a nice rest interface
you know you can you can get you you
take pictures using using curl it's it's
kind of a scream but it does all the
sort of real-time streaming standards so
you can do rtsp off of it so
if you were either at my editing my
demos at javaone a couple of weeks ago
that's the camera that was being used
yep and it was just RTS being straight
from that camera through cell modem cool
okay so after we hung out for a bit on
shore we finally start loading these
guys up John went with me to see one of
these guys getting pushed onto the onto
the boat here yeah yeah it's nice to
have an engineering shop with a grade
all its there's a lot of big heavy
equipment around here and as those
especially the new wave gliders are not
light yeah they're yeah the new ones are
not light especially if they are they're
loaded with batteries you can put in an
astonishing amount of battery on them
yeah I think they can go for weeks
without seeing the sun life yeah I
noticed that there was like a whole
section which was kind of a payload area
yeah yeah yeah if you take the the solar
cells off the hull oddly enough looks
like a data center rack sort of laid on
its side and
the rack units that go in going to have
to be in you know watertight box of
boxes
well then we went out on the boat and
then actually launched I believe this is
Captain America getting kicked up off
the bed yeah so the this work about the
whole Kayla and it's got a small crane
on it and we just lift the lift them up
and give them over the side and you see
that piece of string on the top that
that sort of separates the the float
from the from the glider you can see
there's that little rack piece a little
little fall out so they just sort of
drop it in the water yeah I know sir
they're quite efficient at this I'm
assuming they get lots of practice they
get lots of practice and the road crew
gets lots of practice we do lots of
engineering test so there is just pulled
the cord the wing rack is deployed and
the way it goes guys so this is I guess
we're recycling that one yeah
okay and here here he is out at sea yeah
yeah that's me in the back there staring
at the rudder since i've been i've been
mr. you know guts of the OS and
navigation so I've spent a lot of time
staring at the rudder making sure that
the rudder is doing the right thing
that's I was going to
you've still got still got bugs to fix
and
yep here's Quicksilver yeah hopping
around and see nice and happy
reliance Lee yeah we launched both of
those that day you guys you guys hopped
back on boat after a long but you were
my impression was like he went out and
you were like very focused and serious
sense by the time you got to coming back
on shore you're really happy oh yeah
what would Nathan it when it when it did
the untwist right you know untwist was
one of our really major goals was to be
able to do that
and that without worked incredibly well
I had all kinds of different ways that
could could approach the problem and
fortunately the the most straightforward
technique actually worked beautifully so
I was really happy
cool yeah that was a yeah cessful
mission yeah that was that was that was
really successful was it's it's really
weird to have a job where you know a job
requirement for debugging is to put on
snorkel gear and gotta dive into the
Pacific
but that's pretty cool one of the things
you didn't see in the video was that the
water was just loaded with jellyfish
lots of little small grape jellies and
and it was it was it was it was really
really pretty because they kind of glued
to glow in the sunlight I'm not sure
it's a very good like scientific ins you
know Geographic reason why this watch
basis of Hawaii well it why turns out to
be a really great place being partly its
other than the nice weather and the
beautiful well it's only it's only three
time zones away it sits in the u.s. it
has predictable weather so we can do
operations every day we're in an area
where the the sea is very uncrowded with
other ships so if something goes wrong
the robots can Griffin they're not going
to get you know chopped up in the
propeller of something so if just about
anywhere on the coast of California it's
it's it's you know marine protected
areas or multi-billion dollar homes I
mean this we've got so we've got this
engineering site here we've got you know
a couple hundred feet of frontage on the
ocean and it's this building is way
cheaper than a big building we could
rent in Silicon Valley that you know if
you're not going for like an oceanfront
house here
it's actually cheaper to live on the Big
Island than it is in Silicon Valley by
like a factor of two
and I need maybe some without here there
are advantages and disadvantages I mean
the there's there's no San Francisco
there you know you can't go on water at
the the Dioner cruise self of market or
any of the usual things that makes make
San Francisco so attractive but if you
like farmers markets and really great
beef and
you know kind of a quiet lifestyle this
is a really good place oh yeah that
primer last night was really making
people on stream jealous all right so
let's take care of the last bit of
business here so you had a user
interface yeah so we have multiple user
interfaces for this this particular one
is the one that's actually running on
board the wave lighter than its really
designed we can for the audience members
where do you go back to the beginning on
that
yeah so that's that's kind of the login
screen so this is this is so we only run
one JVM on board the vessel and it's it
runs the control software we call
Regulus and it's running threads to
handle all kinds of stuff everything
from you know monitoring the weather
station to navigation to the you know
neighborhoods shipping situation and all
the rest of it you know there's a lot of
stuff going on in the on this thing and
that's one of the reasons that the JVM
is so great because you know we really
pushed the multi-threading but in a
really different way yeah I'm freezing
new java SE invented the whole time yeah
yeah so we're using java SE embedded on
a knot on the on an arm
it has been completely rock-solid I've
never seen the JVM crash I'm really very
happy yeah yeah the the crew that's been
working on that has just done a stellar
job I'm so thrilled and so one of the
things that we run in there is a copy of
jetty and so all the sort of onboard
diagnostics and all of that you in the
mechanical configuration you you get at
through the onboard web page we do
piloting in a different different
mechanism because the these web pages
you can only get at when the vessel is
actually on the internet you know so
it's it's that it's only useful when
you're within about 10 miles of shore
which given what people do with these
things is actually a fairly rare thing
it's common for us in our test range
yeah so we can so we can sort of dive in
you know we can sort of ssh in the ID on
device yeah it's really nice to be able
to like like do a break point on a robot
in the middle of the ocean and you
actually deploy new software on the
river i deployed new software almost
hourly some days nice yeah it's it's
it's it's really nice and most of the
time it works fine every now and then we
have a little little hiccup have not yet
had to send a boat out to rescue a a
forlorn wave glider that's been
victimized by a bogus piece of code
but you know can you know the few times
that bloated stuff with with bugs the
music really paranoid about testing
stuff on the short side before I
actually upload it to a vessel American
but you know if it if it goes goes kind
of wonky one of the nice things is you
can always upload an upload a fresh copy
in that's all just you know the the be
uploading and installing new software
it's all it's all just SSH and SCP and
all of its all of its brethren so it's
yes you're not remitting on the wheel
and using all reliable stuff it just now
it's just all the senate or linux stuff
i mean it's it's really great to be able
to do embedded software with this giant
suite of standard tools
and you know in the in the Java world is
just this crazy set of libraries you
know everything from like a standard
library to do declination to really
great libraries for doing
mapping all right so so if you want to
have a polygon that represents the the
boundary of an island it is really good
libraries for that you want to find a
convex hull of the out of an island to
be able to find an optimal path around
it it's easy to do ya know I guess javis
been used for a number of years and
universities and research settings so
I'd imagine that a lot of interesting
stuff that you need yeah Lana and a lot
of it's been used in in like like the
mapping world so look like a number of
the the GIS libraries that are out there
they actually drop in pretty naturally
it's like why would I use the GIS
library well it's it's it's for obstacle
avoidance right because you don't want
to bump into islands yeah right so you
or anything else off well so you do
download maps
and that tells you where to would it not
go so if you getting up being pushed off
course you know to you know not not
whacking to that island well yeah and
there's all kinds of you know data
stores out there on the on the on the
web like the like the Coast Guard has a
a list of hazards to navigation that you
can download and it changes remarkably
regularly and we been a date of mine
that and
upload that to vessels and make sure we
don't run into drilling rigs or recent
shipwreck surface times like that um so
this is the power page I think they're
like yeah so so the so like like I said
this was a lot of this is engineering
data we have the power supply from hell
we're absolutely the finest details can
be controlled let's let's move on here
here I'm just running PS just so you get
some idea of it yes it is actually a
linux box and there's just anything to
come well one of the things they let us
pause right here one of the things I did
was I put in a copy of Jai thon
in retrospect I'm feeling like I should
have used some issues use one of the
other ones I I'm half well we're all
will far down the road but i would i
would love to rip it out in and put in
well i would probably put in right now
right now just because nash horns right
around the corner and it seems to be
looking pretty lovely yeah that probably
a pretty good chance yeah I put in I put
enjoy on because most of the the sort of
science guys know python yeah
you know it's it's funny in that
community people David they know python
and matlab
and that's kind of the extent of their
programming experience but yeah that we
have a variety of issues with with using
with using Python but one of the things
you can do
as you can you can command the vessel
even even when it's far offshore we've
got to rest interface where you can send
it arbitrary strings that are
interpreted as by aegis down type into
this little text area yeah so you just
type into that text area and the the
thing below the text area is sort of a
cheat sheet of the some some more common
Python expressions except I if I hacked
into one of these boats I could I could
drive it around the Pacific oh
absolutely absolutely you could do all
kinds of stuff the security is
reasonably tight
but yeah yeah we couldn't figure out how
to have you have steve's laptop actually
run it live so just because of the
security well actually we could probably
probably kit we probably could now
because we shift our Chevy again because
we get your own I'll try to yeah I know
let's list not feeling adventurous
Jeremy let me type here
this is something it will only work if
you're on our VPN and we have to lose of
it that when go too far gone
up
that's crazy off-screen
yeah here i'm just i realized that we
had two shifts to use laptop into the
firewall
when you're when you're just sort of
goofing around they're all kinds of
things you can have fun with so but it
turns out my ships get near buys for
spotting her yeah yeah so when they win
a bit there's various parameters but but
you can you can set it so that if a ship
comes within a kilometer it turns on its
light
and that works really well
of course now this page is taking a
while to load because it's got an image
that I should have done that I should
have done that
put my sex
yeah so he's out there happily swimming
where is he I am
yeah that's where he is so he's
please right now just
offshore so we're right we're standing
right here this is our offices right
here this is this is quite high Harbor
right here and Captain America right now
is just just out there and we usually
have them sort of roaming around in this
this area here sometimes we bring them
in close to shore normally when we're
out here it's the snorkeling out here is
kind of boring because it's deep ocean
and sometimes there are entertaining
energy creatures come to say hello but
not any wells I've never been around a
whale what's the guys here have seen you
know the whales come around but there
it's not not quite that season yeah but
you see you know full up my
big fish when you getting closer to
shore like in around here we often doing
operations in around like sea turtles
and the rest of it
we are essentially equivalent to it to a
fish the way that we do we the way we
operate and yeah you're saying that fish
actually like to follow the wave runner
yeah we give them shade and for small
fish that it feels like a protective
place and actually our big problem with
sharks is that they go visit the small
fish to feel like it's a protected place
so they hide in the shadow underneath
the wave glider and then the Sharks go
Oh lunch and normally there's there's
there's no issue they they just have
their lunch the larger fish have amazing
spatial awareness they weave we were
originally you know concerned about
things like whale encounters and turtle
encounters and all that it
they are they are completely at home in
the sea it is the damnedest thing busy
call they you know they get you know the
turtles will be a little curious and but
after a while they just get bored and
and actually in the area on here where
we where we work they'll often come up
and like swim next to you it's it's it's
like the coolest things I haven't that's
a tough job you know yeah I know it's
like here I'm hanging a debugging and a
sea turtle comes to join me had that
happened a couple of times here and
that's really pretty neat cool so why
not we meant we've been chatting for
quite a while why don't we see if
anybody on chat wants to say hi and ask
any questions
so everything up to this point in chat
is considered talking amongst yourselves
but if you type something else now we'll
consider it a question for James to
answer so
of questions or comments
ok and I'm actually going to pop up the
chat
home screen hair
we have a nice hole
background
here
you're just getting two friends who the
software her Steve yeah and I try
yeah so in the chat let's see the chat
we just kind of hidden there one of the
questions look like you know what's the
longest distance one of these has ever
gone swimming where we certainly crossed
the Pacific you know we've gone from San
Francisco to to Brisbane
they did stop off in in in Hawaii to for
a little bit of R&amp;amp;R and get the barnacle
scrubbed off but but otherwise they did
the trip to to Australia pretty well you
know these things will routinely be out
at sea for months at a time
hurricane season in the Atlantic you
know they'll just be you know trolling
up and down the length of the Atlantic
chasing hurricanes and one of the one of
the more interesting things about the
design of these things is making them so
that they are incredibly robust so one
of our design criteria is to be in a
category two hurricane continuously for
like a year and I because if you try to
operate in some place like the Bering
Sea or anywhere you know sort of near
Antarctica you know it's pretty much you
know constantly constantly constant
pounding like a category two hurricane
that we've the worst we've been through
is a category four hurricane
that was that was last summer
that was exciting everybody was like
like glued to the screens you know
looking it like that all these all these
readings that were completely impossible
it would be callin Owens with a camera I
think storm like that yeah although we
probably wouldn't be getting very much
off of it because you know when China
well no it's more that when you've got
60 foot waves but all you're going to
see is the site of the wave one of the
things on the to-do list is to change
the camera software so that it's
integrated with the inertial navigation
unit so that we we can do things like
take mixture pictures at the top of the
wave phone where
not not not quite doing that yet but i
think if john here has his way it'll
happen pretty quickly
and other questions pique your interest
because we're going to other year you're
using on the glider and in the cloud
it's kind of a mixture so we're using
the latest stable of jetty alert
certainly not all of jetty teddy is the
jetty community is somewhat
schizophrenic there is there some folks
in the jetty community that want it to
be like a follow-up appt server and then
there are the people who want it to stay
in it too it's embedded roots and so I'm
just using i'm using not much more than
jetty as a servlet container yeah i did
some tests last year with jetty
glassfish jboss at the other observers
running on Raspberry Pi embedded yeah
and I think the one which i got running
Annalise memory footprint was jetty and
definitely class size was a smallest as
well because you can pick and choose
yeah yeah the fact that you can pick and
choose the libraries and you sort of
assemble it from the pieces that you
actually need yeah and i'm not using JSP
or anything like that I've got a you
know I ended up writing my own really
simple template system that I'm actually
going to love that it's working pretty
damn it went pretty well on our on the
cloud side we're running a mixture of
glassfish where is it three
to in glassfish for I'm really quite
happy with us fish for the machines that
we've transitioned over has been it's
been pretty much just drop in and go so
that's been that's been really nice
did you write every class in standard
jdk yeah yeah what else is there right
this dominos still use a JSP I have no
idea it's got a little bit where's what
is my troll handle you know I used to do
that you know sort of show up on
websites in that under under a variety
of assumed names in and these days you
know the problem with social media is
that it takes time any of this stuff
just takes time and you know I've been
working 12 hours a day for so long now
that it's like no you know when I got
home and hop on Facebook no the last
thing I want to do is hop on Facebook
you know and doing things like blogging
has been almost impossible because it's
like well I could do some coding or I
could do some blogging I'm a whole lot
better at coding than blogging so I mean
I I you know doing doing English is not
one of my strengths yeah
how did using the JVM compared to more
basic solutions I hard we know it
concerning energy by budgets yeah the
arm itself is certain is nowhere near
our major energy drain the sensors are a
pretty big deal but we have we've also
had this issue that they really needed
to get a lot more intelligence on board
the kind of stuff that you can do one or
the small embedded processors really
doesn't work very well so a really good
example is collision avoidance so in the
old ones where the intelligence for
collision avoidance was on shore that
involves sending messages across the the
satellite network and sort of between
the time that a ship was detected and a
evasion was started could be half an
hour if if things went really well it
could be 15 minutes but on the new one
since all the intelligence for evasion
is on board and the response time is
really governed by the AIS standards
reporting reporting rates and the almost
all ships report I had a 10-second
interval right so so every ship at sea
is reporting its location every 10
seconds and you know we were receiving
that on board and then I react to it
immediately and if you're reacting
immediately you can actually react
remarkably stupidly and you're still
better off than an intelligent reaction
half an hour later but we've got to a
point where the onboard AI is
sophisticated enough that it's doing a
pretty intelligent version of obstacle
avoidance it's got the number of
different avoidance strategies depending
on sort of the
what I call the threat levels or it does
sort of a measurement of how much
trouble it's in and then it does
different kinds of things so if it's far
away from the ship but a ship is in the
way it'll start it'll sort of go into uh
sort of a little parking position to
wait for the ship to pass and if it's
sort of closer into the ship it'll
decide that it's time to run away but
that's relief you know doing all those
kinds of things is really hard to do in
the tiny little embedded processors
what was the you guys are talking too
fast I can't read them what was the
biggest challenge in creating software
for boats like that I guess the biggest
challenge it's their challenges all over
the place one of the things that's made
it a lot of fun is that they're just
really really different but one of the
hardest things is is dealing with
reliability you really want to have
graceful failover things fail it with
all the time you know in the in the data
center world you're used to you know if
machine fails you just rebooted really
don't want to be that doesn't work at
the same yeah well I mean it works I
mean it reboots but but but but then
during the time of your rebooting you're
not you're not you're not driving right
you know you're just drifting yeah so we
you know so it's like keep it up all the
time and then you know for for connected
devices like the GPS and the compasses
for a bunch of things we've got got
redundant devices all right so like like
for the for the gps is
you know it's just what anything you buy
is got an onboard GPS we actually use
all of them and we effectively fuse them
together and they there's this sort of
mechanism to do fail over from devices
if you know if we if we lose the GPS
that's on top of the weather mass then
we fail over to one of the other ones
and back and forth and you know a lot of
these gps's are somewhat more flaky than
they ought to be but you know it's all
about dealing with the unexpected and
one of the core of Regulus is this thing
that sort of manages the coordination of
the services on board and through the
booting of the system and the sequencing
of the booting and one other thing it's
kind of different that I didn't realize
until later on is it the right way to
think about it is that the machine is
always booting but it's never actually
booted all the way up it's just all
you're always in the boat in the boot
process because they're always devices
are coming in going you know if you'd
lose a GPS then you've lost the GPS but
because we've got this complex power
supply system you can sit there
rebooting just the GPS by just turning
off that GPS and if that GPS comes back
then then it comes
right so we've got fine-grained control
of all the sub devices on it so we're
essentially rebooting different parts of
the machine all the time rather than
doing just sort of like that the big
switch reboot really a very fine-grained
reboot which is which was pretty
entertaining but it works pretty well
against there are a couple of good
questions from look and Jonathan so they
were wondering let's say look look was
wondering what you meant by highly
multi-threaded and Jonathan of course
wants to mapping component I think we
all know a jonathan well
oh yeah yeah the mapping component yeah
I've got to get up my ass and get it out
there the weather that they're there two
obstacles to get to getting it out there
one is it still needs some code cleanup
and maybe what I should do is just get
it up there up there and if somebody
wants to volunteer to do some code
cleanup because it's the way it was
poured over to javafx wasn't quite as
good as it should have been it was it
started out as a swing component and
then it was sort of sort of integrated
into FX in a swing ish way but the
performance ended up being really nice
because FX does really good things with
with image maps and with OpenGL but you
know it's pretty straightforward and
there's a big working 12 hours a day
problem some days a week
god that's got to stop but getting close
okay and we hit we have some some
volunteers yeah yeah well so um if
you're if you're interested in helping
out with the project just um reach out
to me on Twitter or my blog and all I'll
get people who are really motivated yeah
involved yeah well I i can probably
throw throw the raw code out there maybe
with a little test program yeah it deals
with a lot of different tile servers and
the one that is the least encumbered the
one or the one that's the most
straightforward if you don't want to get
a lawyer in the room this is open
straightening out yeah i love the
OpenStreetMap guys thank you
all right and what's a question about
getting started with robotics
questioning that scholar
let's call you up yeah you can raid
skull on I mean any language the runs on
the JVM works works just fine most of
the people around here come to this from
a from a background in c and c++ and
going all the way to scala from you know
writing firmware and microcontrollers
kind of a jump but you know scholar
would run just fine sebastian is um the
organizer for great come over in europe
so he has a thing for groovy yeah yeah
well we can actually put all kinds of
different languages scripting languages
on there okay you know I I'm sort of
torn between groovy and JavaScript big
advantage of javascript is why now
and rhinos looking awfully nice that's
already me sorry mash or the yep yep no
no that should be coming out with it
there should be a really high
performance the guys in a soft Stockholm
working on a really smart so yeah they
do have good work yeah
yeah I had the chance to have a long
chat with one of them not very long ago
and i got really jazzed it looks like a
pretty nice piece of work
okay so last call in questions we have a
couple here and then we'll try to wrap
this up within the next 50 I writing
high level java bytecode hacking ow its
high-level chocolate all the time if the
bytecode see I do do a lot of stuff with
with introspection and annotations
though which is kind of as close as I
get to to bytecode hacking I do
something that's very much like you know
in the ee world in dependency injection
and servlets the the sort of dependency
injection thing that I do is actually
used as part of the boot sequence so
when I say at dependency suction sakshi
that that pointer gets filled in just
the way that ejb dependency injection
happens but it also notes a dependency
in the boot sequence graph so that is
effectively a topological sort of of all
the all the services on the system and
they get they get sort of booted based
on sort of dependency order
and when you say add dependency you can
also annotate that with and so what
state the surface has to be in so does
it have to be just started or does it
have to be started and functioning
properly and various other things the
services have lots of different states
but you know that's worked out really
really well but that's as close as it
gets to like will level bite hacking
yeah so use any libraries like ASMR now
I'm not actually using ASM for that
there's a there's a different library so
all I'm doing is scanning for
annotations all right so there's this
great library of there called annotation
detector it does one thing really well
and that is it scans for innovations and
it's and it does it blazingly fast and
it looks for either annotations or
classes you sort of give it a
description of what you want to find and
it scans the classpath for them and it
doesn't be the full you know build the
the j build of the bytecode structure
the way that the ASM does it's just
looking at those headers so they have
their own little little parser for the
for the class file format and it just
goes like the wind it's lovely
alright so what I was thinking as well
close out the stream here thanks
everyone for asking questions thanks
James for for joining us well thanks and
thanks for it must be must have been
tough for you to like get an airplane
and come up to Hawaii yeah yeah and be
able to call it work I have my own
issues of work as well yeah yeah yeah I
works with all fun and games so if the
folks on the stream I'm going to be
headed to Europe next I'm going to dive
x4 Netherlands kids and i'll be at the
Jay Paul and DevOps conferences so the
next stream will most likely be from Jay
fall or right before I'm chatting with a
couple folks about doing something in
Germany Yeah right before I head out
there so if you haven't already register
for the the website at night hacking com
it or follow me on twitter at night
hacking TV to find that one subsequent
broadcasts are going to be happening and
i was thinking since the camera is
somewhat mobile we could do a little
bonus footage of the wave glider right
behind us when we're sitting here yeah
you want to pick it up and I'll just
I'll just you can just talk talk through
it talk through it let me just swap the
the video feed here
royal anymore
all right let's see what we go you know
we can do without stretching the wires
too much yeah okay first trick is will
the battery catch yes battery works yeah
audio
so I presume you need to keep the audio
cable connected yeah but the only thing
we have to worry about is the connection
to the computer which is why we can't go
to that far yeah well I can always turn
this guy around but
yeah this is just got this guy's solar
panels are disconnected and this here is
that you can see this witness here
section is this kind of our data center
at sea part we're normally you sort of
drop boxes in here since we don't have
any boxes we just put styrofoam in to
keep it up keep it afloat but the
interior the waverider here is is open
to the sea so the individual bought
keeping individual boxes water types is
a whole lot easier than keeping the
whole whole watertight and here's the
the main dry box and with all these
these funky connectors I don't know if I
can
ah
they they make really soundly I was
hoping to show you what a what a wet
native old connector looks like they're
they're pretty funky we have these these
carbon fiber masts this is the AIS
antenna for the the radio beacon this is
a little radome are like you oh here's
one that's out I don't know if you
confess I don't know this is these are
the very funky what made of also there
they're designed so that even if salt
water leaks in these pins don't don't
leak and they form a strong connection
but they're still there's you know with
all the all the way around these guys
will stay at sea for months and months
and months and yep they work really
really well but they're much more heavy
duty pins and since they're custom made
there we were expensive than the guts of
a cell phone
yeah so here's the wings there's this
guy's umbilical is off right now if it
joins in right here this is where the
cell phone antenna is and there's a
weather station up here the weather
station that we use is a standard sort
of celba weather station it's really
hard to find weather stations because
they have to be able to go underwater
because we roll over and most people to
make weather stations now they don't
worry about that because if you roll
over you got bigger problems and we
haven't found one that will deal with
really serious hurricane strength winds
because if you've got a ship in your at
sea and it's hurricane strength winds if
I knew what the weather is like your
name well you you're pretty much toast
already you know so there's there's the
there's no point in having a sensor good
enough to record like lethal conditions
we have enacted in that one category
four hurricane from sort of satellite
data you can you can kind of guess the
this the surface winds but it it looked
like we were for a while in 190 knot
winds which is pretty scary so they
survived that this is the rudder unit
that we were just we were talking about
the fins are kind of funky because they
they fold out and fold in
yeah that's really cool the fins at the
top this gig at the back these ones look
more like a like a canoe than via the
other ones looked more sort of surfboard
like yeah but yeah you could take all
the stuff out and paddle it around and
it would be it would be fine when you're
out there with the boats the first thing
I hear what's his name did is he jumped
up on it like it was a little canoe yeah
yeah you can Nikki yeah he's so wrapped
up on the back here yeah we've got this
this is a this is a funky a little but
this thing here actually detaches it
actually it jects off the back oh and
it's connected with a little rope and
what that's for is if you've got really
really bouncy seas it's hard to get a
hook around this one of these guys I say
so so you just sort of zero up to tell
you pop this out and it trails a rope 20
or 30 feet and then you can just get a
grappling hook on the rope and let out
of the sea well yeah yeah trying to make
these things so that they're
operationally sound in kind of scary
weather
although we've had a number of sort of
comical incidents where you know we've
done things like like like test runs
with customers where you know the
customers as well we'll take it out on
one of our ships and will deploy it then
we'll pick it up and you know it's like
but you don't have to pick it up because
then you don't have to deploy because we
just throw it out there and they'll swim
out to the test area and then they'll
still likes quit banks went back and we
had had one with with one customer where
it goes out to the test area the weather
just goes to hell gets really really
bouncy and the customer says well you
know it's too dangerous you know it's
it's way beyond the Coast Guard limits
for you know when we're allowed to set
sail and you know so we can't go and
recover your robot and they were all
like and then and so we just said okay
we'll just drive it into barber which is
what we did and it just brought itself
up at Arbor and the customers chins had
just sort of drops in this lake ice no
that was that was a really good teaching
moment for them yeah yeah I'm sure that
customer is quite happy as well yeah
yeah having having something that can
drive itself around and you know just
sort of changes the way a lot of these
these folks think about doing science at
sea I mean these things are just
platforms for sensors actually we
removed it there was one here that had a
really interesting sensor package on the
on the underside but yeah we often you
know will tow sensor back packages there
will mount sensors in here that will
either have mass stop with the measured
weather or have ports on the bottom that
that you Matt me mount any of you know a
hundred different kinds of sensors but
it works out pretty nicely all right
cool well thanks very much for taking
the time past couple days and also doing
the interview well and thanks for coming
up you have been fun oh and I have a
sticker for you as well so last time
when I came out to sunnyvale it was
right before my um my night hacking
stickers got printed up oh you got
stickers yeah you must be like like
surrounded by five year olds in the
Netherlands that's exactly what it's
going to be like yeah well that's always
a good thing so
it's not much on compensation for taking
a little time out but yeah well this uh
this is got a new bumper home coming
soon that's pretty good alright cool
like our age thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
