night hacking at devoxx episode are our
final guest of the day is Josh long from
SpringSource hi Josh
hey dude thanks for having me that's
pivotal these days by the way okay yeah
yeah from pivotal new company's same
spring teams for the same spring
goodness just a new company along with
Cloud Foundry and all that stuff you
know I'm one of those old-timers who
still thinks you can still get me at
Josh stout long at SpringSource calm you
know okay cool and we're gonna try to
show some live hacking today so I'm
gonna switch over to desktop right after
I actually put the Josh's is speaking
here in the in the subtext header josh
is hacking all right so now now you're
actually hacking in the subtext and
let's get your desktop up is it not up
so we can't we can watch your mad finder
skills here too so what are you gonna
show us today well I wanted to talk to
you guys about spring boot we've been
showing to people at the booth and it's
been well-received so I figured that'd
be a useful enough thing to talk about
it seized and actually I gave a
presentation about it at the University
session with a good doctor David sire on
Monday
receptions been pretty good so if you'll
indulge me yeah yeah let's do spring
boot in five minutes Ready Set okay so
we're gonna cheat when use groovy first
you know like goobies it's super finesse
you know Luke was here earlier he was
doing groovy stuff so yeah
great way to go I have a backup coffee
remember I'm actually for the viewers
I'm using my friends keyboard my laptop
is in another place so I'm using an
English keyboard so forgive the awkward
pecking you know hunting pecking so up
to whatever the idea is we're going to
focus attention on what matters when we
develop as often it's not that is that's
something you can do by doing focusing
on convention over configuration so I've
got a director here called app - it's
just sort of empty can you guys see that
in the shell there yeah yeah now this is
plenty big good so I'm touch I'm gonna
actually go ahead and open up a file
here mate
was it night hacking that goofy oh good
sever right yep yep perfect okay so
we'll start here I will fumble around
with the keyboard here I'm gonna create
a restful service is just gonna you know
do a basic thing it's gonna show people
it's gonna show a restful endpoint but
we'll you know you'll see there's more
to it than that
yeah greeting controller with any luck
the idea is here I'm just gonna use the
spring MVC 4 which is due at the end of
this year by the way component model to
stand up a restful endpoint and that
will take all of maybe a few minutes if
I had my a game on and I
typing as fast as I could on a British
keyboard with really tiny shift keys and
weird funk going on it's all weird
string and plus I suppose you need to be
a good typist to be a programmer huh I
remember I was at one of these um these
agile conferences and they were doing
you know one of those like hacking with
the Stars or things but one of the
groups had a funky economic keyboards I
have an Ergo keyboard at home that's I
think which one D is actually I'm one of
those guys that so I've been using a
Microsoft natural keep the only thing I
like from Microsoft ever you know is the
mics and the Xbox was pretty good but
that the the that keyboard my god it was
amazing I got a first one back in 2001
at least I have the white ones divided
you know and then I think they or
somebody else sued logitech away from
being able to do good logo keyboard so
it was really the only game in town and
then like four five six years they have
the black ones instead of the white ones
they used to have so I actually remember
loading up on on white ones from eBay
and those lasted me up until I
absolutely had to make the jump into the
black ones you know so I I used to keep
a spare keyboard my luggage for
traveling so now even today when I doing
conference talks you know it's awkward
enough on a regular Mac that I
understand what do you think of those
Kinesis like clamshell like the upset on
clamshell ones where you have to kind of
like curve your fingers around there's
there's something to it right I mean as
long as you're not doing your wrist
that's where they're you know and
there's something about the blood flow I
don't claim to know it too much I just
know that the Microsoft keyboard
literally within a week I had no more
pain you know okay so this is just a
restful controller the idea is it's
gonna listen on port 8080 for requests
coming in to that endpoint and I'm gonna
take the you know variable in the URI
and pass it into the restful endpoint
and it's just gonna be it's gonna be
turn object this is just a goofy cheat
for returning an object yeah so I've got
this little command-line tool you can
get it on a homebrew or DVM or it's just
downloaded if you want to call it spring
I'm gonna go a spring run night hacking
goofy and this is gonna go ahead and
start up with a new like assuming my
he's valid syntax this is a fairly
underwhelming Mac so that's not good
okay I assume that's it so that's you
know nothing fancy right very basic end
point there right okay but the idea of a
spring boot is to really optimize for
production so and optimize for
developers as well we want a little bit
of both so I'm gonna go ahead and use
the grape dependency resolution engine
and usually grab annotation so I'm gonna
go say I'm gonna say spring boot starter
this is actually pulled down and maven
dependency for me actuator yeah that's
like so reboot if I was confident enough
I can actually use the minus W command
you know sort of avoid all this
rebooting whatever let's see so this
same old things before but now I get
metrics about my application I can see
the application itself the stack frames
that's you know in the environment I can
look at that I can look at metrics
themselves about the actual requests
that are coming in back and forth on the
application so here's how many sorry
here's how many 200 calls were made you
know success at status code 200 calls
were made to the dump endpoint etc how
many process I've got memory memory etc
I can add a lot more I can even you know
optimize for further I can say okay I
want to you know I really want to get I
want to secure the stuff a lot of stuff
should be secured first so I'm gonna go
ahead and add this security dependency
and then I'm gonna go ahead and add and
I'll speak to this in a minute that
dependency there command C for some
reason takes forever
here we are by the way that op that
that's a some of the best foot finest to
ask yard I've ever seen but it is
optional
there you can actually disable it any
good open-source project needs ASCII art
logos exactly okay so um this is by the
way this convention so anyway though
anybody's you ever used to me game you
see will notice that it's looked at the
spring game you see code it's realized
it to spring app and it'll start up a
web server for us you can it does this
based on the presence of certain
libraries in the classpath so for
example Tomcats present in my class path
if I had jetty it would do that just
fine if I wanted to deploy I could
actually use the Java version for
example and deploy to you know I can
also get a standalone jar or I can get a
war you know just like you would for
legacy environments you know one thing I
did is I turned on security and by
default that security is going to look
for certain properties and give me
certain information so the user that I
need for my application now cuz it's
locked down its user the password is
here on the shell I'm gonna grab that go
to the metrics in point so its user
right oh whoops it's user I think it's a
password for the HTTP endpoint no
anybody
um I forget what the default one is so
I'm going to go ahead and specify it
myself okay
made application DEP properties yeah so
if if any demo and this program works
works great the first try then we know
for sure that it was canned so much for
that chain huh I'm gonna cheat I'm gonna
just copy a file I know I know but
that's what it's doing right so that's
the it's a security got username equal
spring and password you can name it
whatever you want
and I'm telling spring boot to go ahead
and use the spring the authentication
manager for both the shell and for the
HTTP endpoints now that that's there
I've got a total of two files one of
which is a property file and then we're
just gonna run the same thing again we
did I did the university talk on Monday
and of course we had released m6 the
night before so I got from the stage and
part of my you know part of my demos had
been updated the others hadn't demo
train fail and it was so sad awkward
okay so now so the same stuff is
available there do you guys remember
Firefox no no I have no idea what that
is it's a thing man it's gonna be big
one day you just watch people using it
no no God no I just kidding a day
gee-whiz so spring spring okay so all
the end points that are secured same as
before right egg I have a dump
you know the env endpoint etc one thing
I really quite like I can actually now
do SSH port 2000 spring at localhost
English keyboard much localhost
password spring as well and I'm logged
into this freak spring boot like shell
they're the console can you guys see
that in your yeah
I'm gonna use the help command this
takes for some reason a long long time
to get help I don't understand why
everything else is very quick so we're
just gonna wait awkwardly maybe we could
fast-forward in the video just for that
one part there we are I think the idea
is that whenever you're getting someone
help you need awkward pause to let them
figure it out for themselves you have it
out you have a choice you can wait for
this or RTFM but we don't know we don't
want them to actually feel that
sensation so that should be quicker I
think anyway it's a shell right and by
the way the second the second time you
weren't helped as you know you've got
it's very quick right so system I can
say okay what's what is my environment
look like you know what properties I
have in the environment I can say JVM
system itself I can you know I can look
at the heap etc there's a lot of
actually you know really cool stuff in
there me for me that like the wow factor
dashboard right that's pretty cool let's
see so they really believe in STR this
project that's like that's like part of
the ball here absolutely
yeah yeah gives you kind of dashboard is
that word is exactly right it's the
dashboard a very comprehensive view of
what tapping application how much memory
is being used you have top for Java
basically I mean this is built on this
is built on top of the crash D project
which is an amazing awesome library
you know libraries I don't know really
really convenient so optimizing for
people who want to get up and running
they want to have a way to monitor and
manage their application obviously if
you go to your web service and you want
to see the health there's even a health
endpoint there
so that's groovy obviously that's kind
of cheating because it's so concise for
a lot of people we want people to get
started quickly so we spring by the way
has a new home on the web its spring
that I oh we have a bunch of guides here
that are you know 10 to 15 minutes each
people want to learn about how to build
a web service I want to learn how to use
data access or do Android or to work
with Facebook's API or Redis for
messaging and all these things mess
RabbitMQ they can they're ten ten to
fifteen minutes and each one of them
comes with complete
working code set they can just skip
ahead and see how it works and an
initial one that's kind of a build file
in the folder structure that's it and
they're all built with spring boot
that's the reason I mention it there's
also a great little thing here if you're
using at-sts which is our cliffs
distribution it's a superset of the
lacing rates of Clips then you don't
need this particular feature but if you
aren't and that's your absolutely fine
of course start that spring that IO you
go here you kind of you know go shopping
I went web I want I want actuator and
security and all this stuff and it'll
give you a zip with a maven project
ready to use we're gonna go ahead and
use the one in here because I we're on
TV we got to hurry up but before I do
that let me pull you out of here
common sources demo these common sources
of demo files port 8080 is already being
taken yeah that's a good one I've done
that one before am I on my demos yes
just like ah there's no reason it had
suck but it did you know okay so spring
uh close this guy here go away
so I file new Springs spring starter
project this is the same as that you
know that wizard the dialog you saw on
the website there Knight heck yeah
or good night yeah demo just do it
whoa sure uh-oh they want then I give
you a new Firefox Roja Shane is the way
I like that
evergreen web services I'm gonna go
ahead and just choose way of an actuator
just to move along so all this is doing
is going to the same web service by the
way it's just giving me you can actually
just copy the URL and that'll give you a
it'll serve you up a zip file with
everything you need pre pre configured
in my case the information the actual
application itself lives here yeah so if
you go here and you look you'll see it's
just a directory you know it's like so
so most of that is the target directory
but then you've got an application class
an application test and a maven palm
that's it now I go in here I can see the
code the actual unit test written for me
and everything nothing special the
application class this is the Java
version so okay clips wake up already
refresh they are so this is the entry
point into the application it's a very
very simple to public static void main
in goofy we can afford to cheat and get
away with it you know but here you need
to have something so telling what to do
again I'll go ahead and cheat here I'm
gonna optimize for time so a greeting
controller again
actually do mind if I just copying code
yeah that's fine it's fine
somebody's got to do it
so there you are
of course it's only fun if you copy good
code what about simple code that's that
dessert you write greeting controller
it's all I'm doing is recreating that
same basic thing we saw earlier you know
the restful service you know it's been a
long day
it's not you it's me so seats in the
theater too you know
oh yeah the seats in the devil walks
session rooms are so comfortable but
I've been on these hard chairs all day
so now I'm tired you've been resting all
day crowded man if we've been dancing
around talking to people with this all
day oh yeah okay yeah okay so this is
just a non tinge will be simple POJO
nothing special just returning a
greeting and the idea is you go to this
end point same as before than that it's
just this entry point it's an
application class with a table
auto-configuration that tells bring boot
hey based on the presence of certain
things in the class bath do for me what
you can so for example if Tomcat is
there it'll start up with the Tomcat web
server servlet smack into one so I'm
gonna go ahead and run this hit run as a
java application and this will go ahead
and start up you know just as before
localhost so I've got the same as before
right hi Stephan Stephan I don't know
which one do you like Steve Stephan
Stephan your choice so it's same as
before all the metrics are there as well
you know up and up and running very
quickly I I could I'd ran that with
public static void main right it's very
easy to work with we have a we have a
plugin that were using in maven you
don't have to use it of course but if
you want to it certainly helps to make
this as concise and sort of portable and
palatable as you as possible so I'm
going to copy that path CD there before
that
and I'm gonna go ahead and may even
can't install this bad boy this will
download the Internet so bear with me
here ran the unit test it might fail
because they were already out online yep
again
port 8080 I just it's the bane of our
existence is that important it should
just randomly increment and tell us
where it's going this doesn't have an
SSD so it's unfortunately a very slow
you know who go to the target directory
here's what I think of a lot of people
gonna be interested in is a we have of
course the original jar which is for all
four kilobytes right for code in
whatever classes but we actually have a
second second drawer here that's a you
know that one and that is ou not has its
HS so nineteen Meg's and that includes
oh I'm in the wrong directory that's
even worse guys your um your pair
program is asleep at the wheel here
literally well what do you see
got questions thoughts feedback yeah
where my where my fries in beer yeah
actually I'm gonna go grab a burger the
quick learners rate than the street you
know okay so I built it again
this time I'm at the target directory
you know do H us demo so that's nine mix
so I didn't have the SSD SSH shell on
this one but the idea is you have a jar
it's actually very easy to use you can
deploy it into any cloud environment
what can works in public static void
main works in any environment you
normally work with and again as usually
just start it and you can take that one
jar and you have a working application
it's so simple that even I could do it
you know I'm saying like you and I
worked before on a Java fix and spring
sort of restful service I just think
this would have been a lot more fun yeah
no definitely this would've been a cool
technology integration project so that's
that's awesome and it was almost five
minutes for the groovy version
yeah yeah well you know we went through
a few hoops and did various stuff that
was very cool we have yeah we have a
bunch of people on the stream so if
you'd like to ask us questions just pop
in chat and type a question in the in
the chat session all the open source
spring stuff we're happy to talk about
and of course now as part of pivotal
people have questions were like where
are we what are we doing you know so I'm
happy to indulge any of those oh and one
of the things which I'm announcing is
we're going to be doing a new night
hacking hacking regular bimonthly hack
sessions so every first and third week
of the month in California I'll be doing
it like 10:00 a.m. on Thursdays but
we'll also be having user groups and
folks involved in Europe here who will
do Co hacking and would you like to join
us for a future hack session absolutely
I'd love it please alright so we'll to
plan a spring hack session and then get
a bunch of user groups and folks
involved or you know you guys who are
watching the stream or the recording
here who who want to join us for live
hacking yeah that'd be great look look
forward to seeing you guys there as well
you know all right cool
let me let me pop back to our video
thanks yeah so I already gave you a
night hacking sticker right before okay
cuz I'm I'm out it's okay yeah
that's not your laptop but I think I
think you're a laptop
this is my buddy Andy Pieper yeah Cloud
Foundry ninja you know he let me borrow
it and I quickly brew installed the
spring command line tool there and I've
got this all ready for the talk yes that
proves how easy this is to do on your
own machine if you're watching this at
home
oh yeah well we yeah ruins the homebrew
baby unnoticed and of course you don't
need it but it's one way to go yeah okay
all right cool so thanks for a hot day
in doing some hack online ke discussion
online this has been a great thing but
it's kind of one way you know so at
Starbucks man and I'm sure if you get
questions you'll for them to me yeah
thank you all right thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
