all right hello everyone like to welcome
you here for tonight hacking at their
Vox I hope you guys are enjoying the
aldehyde regarding activities no
something is wrong what's going on is
what all right that's that's all her
that was a title I that was a white one
but didn't go there for some reason okay
that was the right one so will this be
uploaded as well just click right here
yeah okay all right Clark knit oh no
it's got it all right thank you okay as
I was saying welcome to hello good
afternoon everyone welcome here to the
night hacking at devoxx I hope you're
enjoying this time at hacker garden so
all those tables you see around you our
tables where people are hacking or
discussing technology you can come and
join us you can talk with Ian that's in
the corn right there venus is arranging
all kinds of activities are on the
hacker garden we can come here and hack
on openjdk on adopted Jess are all cool
activity if you're interested and for
you too are watching us we are here
directly from the box on the night
hacking interviews we are talking with
lots of very cool people interesting
developers for discussing all kinds of
technologies and you have been here
talking about career and how you can
improve your career and how you can do
coach stuff in your life so I had the
pleasure to have here with me johan van
and johan is a java champion he is one
of the organizers of dev box he is a
great speaker and open source advocates
but most important of all your Han is a
Java developer hai jaan thanks for
coming here hi everyone oh thanks for
having me that's that's so so first of
all
thanks for for this amazing work that
you guys are doing here there vox you
and all the organization team the event
has been great thanks a lot that's it
that's a very big and dedicated team
that's uh that's doing this so they
really deserve a round of applause yes
thank you thanks a lot well I'm not sure
we're gonna gonna get a round of
applause here but people at home can
okay that's perfect so you're on you you
are above all a job developer and you
work with mobile you work with javafx
you work of all kinds of cool
technologies a lot of technologists
people know normal developers don't use
you know a lot of the enterprise
developers kind of thing they're kind of
not using those things because you know
they're they're stuck on java ee or
spring kind of stuff how is to work on
this new and exciting technologies well
as you say it's exciting i have to
clarify that i'm i'm still doing work on
java ee as well i know and was right
yeah exactly yes that that's where most
of java developers are working right and
i think the ee world is under control
and it's going very well with java ee
and looking very much forward to java ee
7 it's going to be even even more better
improvement than than java ee 6 was
right but what we see now in the
industry is a move towards mobile so in
the past most business and transaction
started from a former website and from
people at home clicking buttons on their
browser but that's changing so today we
are seeing more people using the mobile
phones and their tablets to to interact
with sources and therefore i think
that's going to be the area of tomorrow
so we need to make sure that the java it
has a prominent role in that area so I
see that as the next battleground for
java so we'd better be prepared so
that's why i spent most of my time today
on a job on the client on the mobile
client that's very cool and now and how
do you see job on the mobile right now
you know is it ready it's doing going
well it's growing it is a yeah i think
it's a
it's ready and it's going a yesterday I
gave a session that you can see the Deaf
accessions on our YouTube and Vimeo if
the 20 gigabytes limit is a lifted and
the reason it is already is actually
because of a combination of Oracle
contributing codes to OpenJDK Oracle
engineer's contributing JavaFX and then
the community combining it all together
and the company or companies like loon
and orders to provide sources around it
so what you showed yesterday was that
you can write a Java program once run it
on desktop iOS Android and embedded
without changing a single line of code
so that is that is that is production
ready and it's a it's all available and
all open source that's that's very cool
and it's funny I mean so now it's very
nice that you are talking about all
kinds of different companies right so
there is a whole ecosystem around I
think that's one of the most important
things of Java right that we have a
necklace is not just one company doing
things right yeah exactly it's I think
one of the reasons the Java is still
strong after 20 years in order to
succeed and I think that's important for
for Java developers to realize am I made
a few mistakes in the past by doing open
source projects without a commerce
without that were not viable in order to
do to be viable an open source project
should be part of an ecosystem which
means that different companies should
contribute should have the freedom to
contribute and also should have the
freedom to to benefit from it without
well by still playing by the rules huh
and I think in the java mobile world
this is exactly what is happening so
there's not there's not a single company
controlling it but there are many
companies working together oracle is
doing its part gluten is doing its part
and others are doing their part as well
but it's so we contribute on open source
and we work very well together and we
make sure that we can put services on
top of it and in general what I always
try to combine is you should give
developers the freedom to do what they
want they should be able to grab the
oat hack it enhance it and and use it as
they wanted to do and then the same at
the same moment you should also give
companies what they want and they don't
want to download stuff build it put it
in their own build server and so so you
provide them with with releases and you
provide a subscription model for this
right so so now the right way of doing
open source is with all kinds of
companies are interested in the project
so so they are interested in involving
so this whole idea of open source
something that I just work on my spare
time it just work at night it's not
really dude what's going on right
because you actually have companies
investing so the project is successful
yeah I think that I think they're at
least two major requirements for open
source so first of all you need to love
what you're doing if you spend spare
time in it you you you need to have a
passion for it so you don't do that for
technology that you don't like now with
Java there's more than enough of that
that's really cool and that you that you
like so the second thing is you should
you should think about is this is this
some technology that me or someone else
a company that I might join or somewhat
a comp list would be interested in is
this something that adds value to to
others or is it just something that
that's pretty cool and there's nothing
wrong with doing something open source
that's that's very cool but I think it's
even better if you do something in the
open source space that is of interest to
more companies and more people because
it will improve the open source product
if many people are working with it it's
it's also it's it's it's really a
pleasure to to see people downloading
what you're using right that's giving a
boost and it's inviting other people to
contribute as well because they see yes
people are interested this is working
nice and because I think this is the
main reason why we are developers write
that we we want to improve someone's
life and and you know we're not just
writing code just because of course it's
we're doing because it's fun because we
like it that's what that's part of it
but but our main objective is that
someone's life it's better because of
the quarry road right and once once you
deliver that code that makes all the
difference exactly so it's a
so while I love theoretical physics a
lot in Java you can really we have
changed people slice safety besides I'm
very impressed them I've special
attention for health care I'm very
impressed when I when I see health care
demo so I went to a session of Poland
Gayle Anderson earlier today and they
showed the heartbeat monitor in javafx
now that really matters so if they work
on this day they know that they can save
lives and it's not only about saving
lives and not all technology should be
created for saving lives but helping
people helping um yeah make just because
you know helping people can be no just
just because you know you can be better
entertainment or it's easier for you to
travel it's easy for you to rental
hotels easier to get a taxi i mean all
these is technology changing and
improving people's life right exactly
that's what you want to achieve you want
to leave the world as a better place
than before here we enter the world
right that's wonderful and you think
that open source is you know because
because one of the things that we all
have in common right is that we need to
be improving our careers I think you
know if we don't work in our careers no
one else will right exactly so you know
and you think that open source is a good
way for developers to actually prove
their careers or chore to learn
something new or to you know help them
change people's life yeah I I really
think it is it is a way to improve your
career I'm not that extreme that I know
that some for some job inquiries you you
need well or they check your github
commits I'm not dead extreme so it's for
me when I want to hire people it helps
but it's not a it's not a requirement
because not everybody wants to do open
source and that's their decision right
but I personally think that if you
contribute to an open source project
first of all you make the open source
project better but second you interact
with people and by living on an island
you won't improve your skills right but
by interacting with people and even if
it's only reading code reviews to be
honest I've learned a lot by watching
cool requests and the comments that are
given on those pull requests okay for
example on the openjdk and open GFX
projects there are many batches being a
cent and then discussions are about
those patches and that is really I
learned a lot when i read the
discussions from the air from from the
big guru so you improve your skills and
it's also so much rewarding and and that
brings us actually back to devoxx it's
um it makes it more than just a job more
than just coding because you're working
remote with many different people and
then you come to a conference like Java
one order books and you meet those
people and and you're discussing in in
real world what what you're doing and
it's a it makes java development more
than a job it's it's it's it's a passion
right that's wonderful and so just since
you mentioned dev voxyn coming to
conferences coming to conference is also
a way for each improve your career not
just because you learned things but
especially because you meet people right
both new people but also you mentioned
this this cool thing that you meet
people that you already know online and
actually put a face to an email or
facebook github account and that helps a
lot you exactly yeah that's one of the
one of the reasons why many attendees
regular attendees of java one and evokes
say the best spike of a conference is
the whole way like where you really meet
the people and if you look at the
situation at this moment the whole way
to akiza is overflowing at that box yes
right now as you can see there's a lot
of you in the highways a lot of
conversations going on that's why we do
hacker garden right the hacker gardening
is exactly place where we all can come
here and hack together in something and
have you done this kind of things in a
conference that you actually sit down
with someone you exchange some ideas you
do some coding you you kind of clarify
something that's missing have you
actually done that oh yeah really am for
example this year at javaone we were
working on a job online on iOS and we
had a few people are dropping by and
saying I want to try this on my system
as well so we set up the system so we we
we build it we improve things so it's
really this is not the the best way to
would to teach 50 people about the
technology this is really for making
small improves mall but meaningful
improvements to two systems simple or
complex systems so one of the things
that's a lot of times we see is that you
know developers come to conferences and
you know we're all nerds a little shy we
don't know how to talk to people you
know like you know looking our own feeds
right so what what is the one thing that
you think people could do when they come
to your conference you kind of break a
little bit out of this just kind of get
a little bit out of their comfort zone
and do something what is the thing that
you've done in the past to actually get
yourself engage in photo people in the
conference although i'm sure you're also
a little afraid a little not wanting to
talking people one thing you've done
that helped you it's a good question
actually to remind me ja 199 in line or
2020 on gage was still doing the the
keynote and i said a java one everyone
is a brazilian yes i'm rather and what
he actually meant with that was don't be
shy talk to people but you have to be
honest yeah i was shy in the beginning
because it's a bit overwhelming all
those rockstars your you meet your idols
there but those are just normal people
and there's no reason why you should
should be shy now what does help is if
if you if you do in advance before
conference you you contribute to some
project even by maybe just putting
something on a discussion list or put
creating some pull requests or i'm
reviewing code just because of that
people will remember your name and then
you have an easy way to to introduce
yourself that's that's that's very very
cool i actually you're talking about
meeting your idols I've just watching
here Dave walks today this morning the
presentation of and route animal that's
a guy I've learned at compilers and I
learned OS from from his books and I
finally met him in person i went to say
hello and thank you for all he done and
one of the things that he said in his
talk is that you know it they're doing
minix right that's that's the last the
teaching OS and he works with and he did
say that java doesn't run a min
and and you know there is looking for
people that you actually contribute
porting Java to mimic so that's that is
for example is a good way for you to
help and participate with your idols on
cool projects that they are doing
absolutely well to be honest it's how I
got involved with Java as well when I
start with Java 96 there was no java on
linux so with a bunch of people we
created the blackdown team who have
reported java to linux oh that's
actually the best way to to to get
involved it doesn't have to be a high
level contribution so start with what
you like start with I'd you what you
want to do and and and get involved okay
that's so cool so I think we're running
running out of time here so you'll hunt
thanks very much farewell for
participating in our night hacking two
views but thanks for all your
contributions to their java word right
in general and thanks for doing that box
and in all of you here thanks a lot for
for watching us for following us paying
attention net hacking calm that's where
all the videos for all the United
hacking interviews are going on thanks a
lot see ya thank you too thanks man just
totally excellent thanks a lot thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
