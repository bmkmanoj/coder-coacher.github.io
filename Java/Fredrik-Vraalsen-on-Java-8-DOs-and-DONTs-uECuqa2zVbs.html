us a little bit about do's and don'ts of
Java 8 yeah so we we don't we don't
actually care about the dudes does
anyone here care about the do's no no no
we care about the the don'ts yeah so
what should we what should we where's
the danger with the Java 8 api's right
so i gave a talk over today about some
you know best practices and experiences
we have with the using debate in
production for about a year and a half
now and well one of the things that that
sort of i we had issues with is its
parallelism in the stream api because uh
it sounds very very nice now you can get
parallelism basically for free right you
just use parallel you're just click got
a parallel stream tub yeah and it gets
faster exactly it's it's awesome until
you see that some parts of your
application ours is slower than it used
to be so we run into this issue we have
some rest services that had multiple
endpoints and and one of them where we
use Paulo stream was much faster but
some of the others started lagging
higher latency and of course it turned
out that the issues that when you're
using parallel stream yeah you're using
a common for join thread pool so I pull
if something blocks the thread pool or
does something bad that the rest of it
gets resource starved exactly so by
default that thread pool is configured
to have the number of threads is equal
to your number of processors course
minus one or something like that yeah
which is not usually a very high number
why did it if you if you're dividing up
the work that's cpu-bound it's fine yeah
but if you do things which are disk
bound or network bounds that it's
exactly and one of the services we had
was basically you know reaching out to
other services to fetch data and that is
locked everything base at work for ya so
a resource-limited exactly so what we
ended up with doing well basically we're
looking for work ram so one of the
things you can do of course to configure
a higher number of threads for your
thread pool but that's sort of just
yelling
comfortable know what you really want to
do is sort of bulkhead your different
services or endpoints so I'm kind of
like avoiding the Titanic situation and
all I actually had bulkheads but they
didn't go all the way up so so two
things we found one was that there's a
trick since is using the fork join
framework that you can actually force it
to use specific for join through yeah
I've seen that half it's not very pretty
but it works but we ended up going with
the complete able future which is a new
API in da white which is really nice a
much more mature I think API than the
previous future which is basically just
give me the value when it's there yeah
unbelievable features are pretty good
and it allows you to chain asynchronous
operations and wait for a number of
futures to finish and stuff like that
and what we were looking for of course
was the we could control the executor
service that it was running on so that
was very nice and basically that's what
we ended up doing you know yes yeah so
that's why was a dosa that was a dolt
and then yeah well basically a ground I
think that there is a case where
parallel stream works for well and
that's if you're in sort of a batch mode
where you have one one thing going on at
a time but you want to paralyze a bunch
of operations within that yeah thing but
but if you have an application where
there's some sort of interactivity going
on or you have concurrent requests
coming in then probably you want to look
at comparable future okay what leather
what are their doubts what all your
doubts well where's the danger streams
right dreams video you talked about that
on the previous interview and streams
are kind of funny in Java 8 especially
if you are used to streams from Scala
for instance yeah because in Scala and
most other functional programming
language the streams are lazy data
structures that are sort of populated on
demand but you can consume them multiple
times if you try to consume three
multiple times in Java get an exception
yeah which is Elise threaten boy yeah
one basically and so I think I stated in
my talk that streams are basically
if I'd iterators they have a bunch of
functionality which is very nice like
ability to transform and filter your
data but until it's if you try to use it
multiple times then you get into trouble
and one of the things we saw in our
project that was that we try to optimize
it by not converting between the stream
API and a question I babe I all the time
by sending streams around and that
turned out to be a pretty bad idea yeah
now that you want to do that yeah so
don't do it kids yeah don't reuse your
stone is it does that right yeah rule
number one do not fire streams run yeah
yeah nice all right so but what I've
been looking at is there seems to be a
bunch of third-party libraries popping
up that allow you to do more functional
stuff it sort of well some of the things
that are missing in the JDK is for
instance support for immutable data
structures because that's basically
non-existent there and also things like
immutable data value objects yeah and
things like that which is very nice if
you're used to that from from scholar
for instance which is my sort of
favorite language and what I'm working
at the moment cool so I thought we could
look at some options yeah so they're any
good libraries for that yeah I think so
one of the ones I've been always
somebody doing some cool project which
solves the problem which will eventually
catch up to you with the JDK yeah so one
of the ones I've been looking at is
called Java slang and it's basically
well like they say could functional
component library for java 8 and it has
a bunch of cool stuff it has basically
it has let me just scroll down here it
has like the core functional stuff of
course like functions as an interface it
from that that are more elite then the
function interfaces in Java 8 and tuples
which is sort of an anonymous object of
our class of a kind but you have typed
yeah I mean two holes members tuples are
very common in functional programming
like sizer and they're nice but you also
have a
collection API which consists of
immutable collection so you in the
current release which came out in may
sometime it was a fairly limited it had
like lists and trees basically but I
looked at at the github project and and
there's been there busy the only one
should i touch of other cool stuff yeah
there's a bunch of activity going on
there so now they've that's Pabst all
sorts of things yeah filled in their
collection API and it seems like they're
gearing up to a 2 dot over release nice
so hopefully soon but yeah these these
are lists these are sort of sorry
immutable data structures so you get all
the nice things you get from like
structural sharing and you don't have to
worry about locking and yes I'd better
for parallel programming as well because
you don't have to worry about no
defensive copying no locking and all
that nice stuff that you get for free so
I can go into intelligent real quick oh
yeah so for folks who are watching us
live yeah um since we don't have a
monitor here for you to see what he's up
to you are welcome to peek over his
shoulder if you stay all the to his
right shoulder you'll actually be off
camera as well yeah or you can watch the
recording later I guess no it'll be
there awesome so I just start out with I
have a list of two people to put an
objects yeah for so it's quite easy to
construct it you have a its own list
class and you can just call list of and
it's just of our arcs basically so you
get a list of person objects or people
if you print it out you get what you
what do you expect now if you want to
modify you can't modify this list
because it's a miracle you can build new
lists based on it as you normally do so
you can have more people so just take
your existing list and prepend something
nice
ah if I can type alright so in that case
if I print out the original list it
hasn't changed it still has only the two
people that were in it but more people
comes this now of of 33 people right yep
nice and this so one of the drawbacks of
course is that this is a separate
collection API it's not a part of the
Java collection API but it's all of
their stuff is based on a table so you
can use it in the enhanced for loops and
you can also easily convert it to a Java
stream and stuff like that so you can
use the stream API waited so i can do
like more people to dallas stream and
then just go on there and you could pass
these around I suppose to scream no
actually these Java streams you like
yeah pass around yes you can list from
yes java slang yeah that's right and and
they also have a stream implementation
which is actually a lacy this data
structure that you can reuse yeah so so
all those stuff and you can do think
things like say stream generate and give
it a supplier so if you want to get
generate like on some random numbers you
can just give it math.random and you can
take like 10 10 random numbers let's
print out that and see what happens and
what happens is that you get a stream of
a double and a question mark because
this is lazy right so you just yeah this
out later yeah wisely so you need to do
to consume it somehow by basically for
instance converting it to a list and
then you get all the values nice awesome
and there's a bunch of other cool stuff
you have like pattern matching similar
to other languages that it allows you to
make like a switch statement on more
than just instant strings you can use it
on types and yes stuff like that and
they have
like failure handling i tries as a
similar to the option api that you have
in java but on handling exceptions
rather than absence of values yeah that
looks like it looks like a cool library
yeah ok so if javis like java slang the
other one that was actually just told
about in the break before here but hey
that's why you are the conferences right
you Pierre up cool new stuff was called
immutable Beautiful's that are you know
github data i/o and they basically have
let's see if we can increase the size
here a bit basically support for
immutable value objects and bye-bye
annotating your objects you get vertical
new features for it cool so because one
of the things you can easily make
immutable data objects in Java by making
everything final and having everything
in your sliced in the constructor or
using builders and stuff like that but
it's it's hard when you want to do
things like change a property create a
new version basically of a value object
with some property changed and in Java
you would have to sort of reinitialize
the whole thing or create a whole new
object based on a builder again whereas
in scala for instance you just use the
copy constructor and that allows you to
change just the properties that you want
yeah so this seems to be doing a lot of
the same things and it seems really nice
so I'll check it out so we have a stream
immutable thing that you have a slang
and we have a value object mutable thing
with immutable Stu oh yeah so yeah I'm
sure you know now that Java it has been
out for a while there's going to be a
bunch of libraries like this help you
bridge the gap do more functional yes L
programming exactly which i think is
useful I mean they enjoy white they did
a lot of good stuff it's definitely more
fun to work with Java now but they're
coming from more functional but there's
still stuff you know you're missing then
and this nice there is some help
superior you're fine with coding a
little Java 8 on the weekends yeah yeah
now that my day job is Scala you know I
need to get my java fix
somewhere else nice okay so this is a
good introduction to some of the the
don'ts some alternatives to the don'ts
anything else you want to highlight yeah
so let's see I guess that um in my talk
I try to basically just show some
examples for how to use like option
because a lot of people don't really
know how what to use it for and I think
that the sign of that API was a bit
constricted because they basically only
intended it to be used as a sort of
marker API for like public kpi's a
marker class for a public API has to say
that this might or might not return a
value and you need to handle that as a
caller but we found it very useful in
our in our code actually and we used it
a lot of places but one of the things
that we ran into she still was when we
wanted to use streams and optional
together basically sometimes you get
like a stream of optional values and you
just want the values that are actually
present it was a fairly common common
use case is weak we ended up doing that
a lot of a lot of places and and that's
not really supported very well in in
Java 8 but what we it's very easy to
think of an optional as a stream of 0 or
1 elements right mm-hmm so if you do
that and you can use the existing flat
map operation to just flatten the
structure and get there just get the
values which we cannot just get the
values so what we ended up doing was to
create a to stream method that just
converted an optional to a stream but it
seems that enough people have actually
requested this feature that it will be
part of Java nine so on Java enjoy name
optional will have a stream method on it
that you can call and convert it to the
stream so that's very nice yeah take a
flat map with them yes nice presents now
I really one needs to go out and learn
flat map because it's awesome
yeah i think that's that's one of the
bigger kind of you know if you haven't
done a lot of functional programming
flatten out those flat maps well flat
map in particular gets a little bit of a
brain twist flat map and fold i think
which is not present i think in the
stream api yes not it has reduced but
it's a slightly different but yeah flat
maps is basically a big hurdle you need
to get over I have a the lambdas example
where I I have chickens mm-hmm and so
when you hatch the eggs you end up with
a stream of streams because the eggs all
hatch into chickens yeah and they get
the flat map it to get a stream of
chickens yes that's pretty cool yep and
you can look at the optional a sort of a
it's a rapper right so it's like an egg
yeah yeah exactly cool alright cool yeah
I think that's about sums up the main
parts of my tongue yeah no no okay so
it's good I think it's helpful for folks
who are kind of picking up job aid and
want to do more functional stuff to know
some of the different library options
some of the pitfalls to avoid as well
and yeah this is a lot of fun so thanks
for the quick interview here at the Java
zone conference um if you guys want to
watch the recordings they're all
available at night hacking com interact
with us on twitter at hashtag night
hacking and we have one more interview
with your coworker alexandra another
hour also thank you very much thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
