engineer in Oracle's Java platform team
and I'll be speaking today about small
language changes in jt9 first however we
should mention that there was a very
large language change made in JDK 9 as
part of modularity that his project
jigsaw there's a new kind of source file
a module info dot Java file that's used
to declare dependencies between modules
as well as to declare what packages a
module exports and other information
like that there's much more to be said
about modules and to learn more about
modules I recommend you listen to the
modules and JDK 9 talk by my colleague
Alex Buckley for the smaller language
changes made in JDK 9 they come in two
categories one is a set of planned
refinements for project lambda from JDK
8 and project coin from JDK 7 and the
second set of changes involves making
the deprecation facility more
informative project coin and JDK 7 was a
collection of half a dozen small
language changes and we made further
refinements to 3 of those in JDK 9
diamond try earth's resources and Varg
warnings the small language changes in
included those updates the coin as well
as two updates related to project lambda
from dedicate and will speak through
these in terms first safe are args on
private instance methods you could write
code like this for some time
even back in jdk 5 or 6 using the
utility method arrays dot as lists in a
platform to we easily create in this
case a list of list of strings however
when you compile this code if you were
diligent about your warning message
messages you'd note a warning like this
warning unchecked generic array creation
for VAR x parameter so what's going on
here this warning is actually mandated
by the java language specification
because it's possible something bad
could be happening that something bad is
called heat pollution and it's discussed
in detail in the specification however
when you call the platform array
thoughtless method nothing bad actually
happens in this case the platform method
is not misbehaving so this error is
uninformative even though it's mandated
by the platform we didn't think that was
a very good situation
so in project Coyne we created a
facility to get rid of these
uninformative warning messages and that
facility was the save our args
annotation if a programmer applies the
safe varargs annotation to of our org
method it lets the compiler know that
the programmer is asserting that the VAR
arguments that does not misbehave that
heat pollution does not occur and
because of that the compiler is
justified by the updated specification
to not emit warning messages at the
declaration site of the method and more
importantly any of the call sites of the
method so now as of JDK 7 you don't get
warning messages calling arrays dot as
list because the design of the
annotation facility annotations are only
inherited on classes not interfaces or
methods therefore the safe args
annotation can only be used on methods
that cannot be overridden what are the
kinds of methods that can't be
overridden we can't override final
methods or static methods constructors
also can't be overridden from the VM
point of view constructors are just very
special cons of static methods there's
another category of methods that can't
be overridden and those are private
methods and we omitted those back in JDK
7 but now in jdk 9 we've gotten around
to adding them so we had a very small
update to the java language
specification to now also allow say far
arcs on private methods next effectively
final variables and tribes resources as
a reminder with the tribe earth
resources statement you have a try block
that manages your resource R in this
case and the compiler internally
translates this into a class file
roughly equivalent to this where there's
a finally block wrapping a try and in
the finally block close gets called on
the resource as long as it's not null
now it's actually a little more
complicated
this to give better exception handling
so in terms of full disclosure this is
what the full destroyed ring looks like
we don't have to worry about this as
programmers because the compiler takes
care of this for us
so back in JDK 7 the requirement was the
resource to be managed by the try with
resources statement had to be a fresh
variable declared as part of the
statement that wasn't the original
proposal originally you could use any
expression that had the right type if it
was the article is full interface type
that had the closed methods that was
fine however we noticed there was a
problem with that proposal we see that
here let's say you have your resource
are initialized to a new resource you
manage the variable R with you try our
three sources statement and within the
block you make it point to something
else now when you come to the end of the
charters resources block which objects
should have its closed method call
resource 1 or resource two we decide we
didn't want to have to solve this
problem and the solution was to require
a fresh final variable to be used with
the try over three sources statement
however that was a little overly
restrictive because if the expression
was already a final or effectively final
variable this problem wouldn't occur so
in JDK 9 we've relaxed the rules so if
you already have a final or effectively
final resource you don't have to clear
new variable for it so instead of
declaring the resource R 2 in this case
you can just reuse your existing
resource variable our little
simplification that gets rid of some
unnecessary boilerplate in the code next
we'll talk about diamonds with anonymous
classes diamond uses type inference
inside the compiler to allow programmers
to avoid having the type explicit type
parameters when calling constructors
so back before diamond if you wanted to
do something like initialize your list
of maps of strings to integers you'd say
call new ArrayList and you'd repeat
those type arguments map strings and
integers but you don't have to do that
anymore now you can just say new
ArrayList
less the greater-than and the compiler
will infer the rest for you now this
language feature is very effective at
removing the need for explicit type
arguments however there are some cases
you can't use it because of a bad
worst-case interaction between diamond
and anonymous classes you cannot use
those with each other the problem is
there are cases where type inference can
infer something called a non des notable
type that nan de notable type is outside
the type system we can use as
programmers and it cannot be represented
in the class file that needs to be
generated for the anonymous class
however that's a worst case outcome in
many cases a de notable type is inferred
and that could be represented in a class
file so we thought this restriction was
a bit unfortunate and we did note when
we were finishing up project coin in JDK
7 that in the future we might relax this
restriction and allow diamond and
anonymous classes to be used together as
long as that worst-case outcome didn't
occur and that is indeed what we've done
now in JDK 9 we've loosened the
restriction and now you can use diamond
with anonymous classes in many cases in
JDK 7 we found that diamond was very
effective at eliminating explicit type
arguments over 90% of a constructor call
sites and with this new enhancement we
feel that allowing diamond with
anonymous classes allow removal of a
large fraction of the remaining 10%
we've had good experiences using this
feature in the JDK codebase and
eliminated hundreds of additional call
sites the next two small language
changes are updates to the project
lambda features that were added in eight
first underscore is no longer an
identifier name starting in 8 the
compiler issued warnings if you used
underscore as an identifier warning that
it might be not be allowed in future
versions of the platform and indeed now
in JT 9 it is not allowed and what was a
warning message is now an error so why
are we doing this we want to reclaim the
underscore as syntactic real-estate and
repurpose it for more useful things
those more useful things are described
in JEP 302 lambda leftovers JEP being a
JDK enhancement proposal as part of land
in JDK 8 you could add methods to
interfaces that had code these are
called default methods so these methods
are non abstract and thus they have a
method body at the VM level and JDK 8
interfaces could have private methods
and these were used to help implement
the lambdas and so forth however at the
source level programmers could not
declare a private interface methods in
JDK 8 and now we can in JDK 9 you can
declare both private static methods as
well as private instance methods how
would you use such a private method on
an interface you can use them as helper
message to implement the other public
default methods and we've found this
feature to be very useful in writing the
JDK the next two small changes are both
related to the deprecation facility
first we'll talk about deprecation
warnings and imports one of the ways
we've paid down the technical debt in
the JDK is to reduce the number of
warnings in our code base we've actually
cleared of all categories of warnings in
large fractions to code and that has
included eliminating the deprecation
warnings now when do you get deprecation
warnings these are discussed in the java
language specification and you get them
when you use a deprecated type method
constructor and so forth and there's
three ways you can resolve those
warnings you can stop using the
deprecated elements that's preferred
when you can do it what you can't always
do it you can propagate the deprecated
annotation to the use sites now that's
worse than the disease because you're
expanding rather than contracting the
number of deprecated elements and
finally you can use the suppress
warnings annotation to let the compiler
know that you don't want to get this
warning message anymore so let's say you
have your client library and you're
using a deprecated library and you you
want to suppress the warnings from the
annotations because you get the warning
message here and you want to get rid of
that
you might think alright right at the top
of the class I'll suppress the
deprecation warnings and I won't have to
do anything else however when you
compile this code you find you still get
the deprecation warning so what's going
on here well if you look at the warning
message in more detail the warning isn't
from the body of the code in the class
it's actually from the import statement
instead right at the top of the file now
this import is mandated by the Java
language specification and worse you
can't use the suppress warnings
annotations on the import statement is
not syntactically allowed so this
warning is pretty unhelpful if all the
other uses of the deprecated type can be
suppressed
why can't you eliminate the warning from
the import statement that doesn't seem
very helpful and indeed we change this
behavior in JDK 9 by not requiring a
warning message in that location anymore
and because of this it's now tractable
to clear a large code base at
deprecation warnings and we have an
existence proof of that from the JDK
both the Java based module and Java
desktop modules have been cleared of
deprecation warnings
what does deprecation means it's a
facility that's been in the platform for
a long time but there's been some
uncertainty about the semantics of it if
something deprecated because it's
harmful or is it deprecated because it's
going away and if it's deprecated
because it's going away
why haven't more items been removed from
the JDK over the years we've made some
progress removing removing deprecated
items in JDK 9 but we also thought more
information you needed to be conveyed in
the deprecation annotation to
distinguish between these different
cases and we did that by adding a new
method to the deprecation annotation for
removal method that was either true or
false it defaults to false however if
it's marked as true that's an indication
to you as a developer that you should
migrate away from using that because it
will be removed in some future release
of the platform the tooling around
deprecation was operated to handle this
about both the language specification
as well as Java C and Java to talk all
had updates to handle this and there's a
new static analysis analysis tool in the
JDK J deeper scan that analyzes class
files and jar files for uses of api's
that are deprecated in the jdk to give
you additional warning that your
application might be using them so you
can take some action to stop using them
so in conclusion modularity is the large
language change coming in jdk 9 but
there are many other useful updates we
went through doing plan language
improvements to the language changes
previously made in JDK seven and eight
these are great very straightforward to
use and you can use them in your own
code today and to start using them in
your new code you can download a version
of the JDK for your platform if you're
interested in getting involved in the
development to open JDK you can look at
the mailing lists on the open JDK
website and you can also get updates on
open JDK by following open JDK on
