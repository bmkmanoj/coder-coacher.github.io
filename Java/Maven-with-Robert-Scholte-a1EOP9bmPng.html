welcome back actually we are at devoxx
Belgium today and I'm your employee from
Oracle technology Network and my guest
is Robert shorter yes very well
perfectly so Robert well tell us what
you do first okay first of all I'm the
chairman of the Apache math project and
I'm responsible for the most part of the
implementations done for Java 9 and so
you work on the maven project you've
been actually investigating also Java 9
is going to work with maven yes right
now so there are the early readers of
Java 9 end of jigsaw and everybody's
waiting for the built tools and the idea
is to work together with Java 9 and I'm
the one who's responsible for doing that
for Apache maven so already like try of
course yeah yes so we are already
working on it for I think about a year
but but those are all snapshots so I
think about 10 days ago we did the first
official release of the Maeve compiler
plug-in and that's version 3.6 dot our
and that's one already available in
major central and people should use that
right now just to test Java 9 and so
they can also test Java 9 JDK that
java.net slash well I'm not sure just
look for the early Java really so what
did you find out when you were actually
testing Java 9 and Raven so what is
working what is working oh there are so
there are two features in Java 9 which
are very interesting one is the release
option which has been the replacement of
the source and the target which makes it
possible to compile exactly to the
correct JDK version and the only one is
of course about the multi paths and
there's one interesting feature in this
plugin because it is
capable to detect if it should either
use the module path or the class path so
the the anteater doesn't have to do
something in this bomb to configure if
it should use the multipath it that will
decide to plug in for you anything other
things well we're still in discussions
about the module names especially for
the automotive names because we know
there will be a lot of collisions for
the specifications they are using right
now I've done this talk from Monday I've
done that also at JavaOne and at J fall
and I will do it next week on Apache con
and one of the returning questions is
can you generate the parts of the
requirements because all the information
is ready in pom file why do I have to
duplicate it well right now that's the
only option sadly unless we are going to
do something with with templates but I'm
not really a fan of that because you are
only generating a part of the module
info file and the other one you have to
adjust your yourself still so for now
you have to do it all by hand so so
everybody so the compiling part is ready
and then we have of course the archiving
part so the maybe our plugin is already
available and with the latest release of
jigsaw we had a small issue with the
maven war plugin so that has to be fixed
and there are some other archiver
plugins which also are available as
snapshot but they also need to be
released and that will happen soon so I
think we're in a good place and people
should really try to test this thank you
so much for sharing the good news okay
thank you talking to us today
okay thank you okay bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
