you
oh all right now
you just have to touch it right yeah
okay some kind of using your fingerprint
exactly to activate the stream okay but
you have to hand it over you want the
camera yeah for the interview okay here
we go all right so what we're doing
we're doing a special special recording
it's going to be reverse interview with
with Tony and Adam yes and to start out
with we're going to go we're going to go
outside and check out the bike and maybe
get a lot more light alright so let's go
actually it's also a wireless okay so
i'm gonna i'm going to burden you with
this one really i will of fire here you
need a just um make sure to make sure
the stream is working just carry it with
you for a little bit this way you'll
know if we drop out of Wi-Fi range in
bad stuff happen this one and for this
you pepper will see videos every new
studios and community where your taste
on a cut the keys or this open I'll to
open and Tonio African perform some
fancy right yeah I do sometimes netbeans
platform maybe javafx soon sure less
than 50 people
yeah okay so here's the bike this this
is called a broken headlight I would
have it
broken
this happen I I can't adjust the beam
height so I noticed when I was driving
around people kept flashing me and
finally I was riding behind Tom and he's
like your headlights pointed up in the
sky its broken so this was our carefully
engineered solution to put tape over the
headlights so I don't blind people and
that's why we're going to go to the shop
today and fix it the Hermetic solution i
would say right yeah so why you render
in London here at found about about town
by car hey cool and how many kilometres
are you already well not not all that's
fine but I only on the keys here I guess
we can't turn on
I drove from London to my cook and then
from niekerk to Tom's place at the
border of the netherlands and germany
and then from here at their down to
munich so which ride was the longest one
I don't know I said from the Netherlands
to hear it was about eight hours on the
road from London so the Netherlands was
about the same maybe 8-10 hours because
the tunnel takes longer going through
the weather called the ER tunnel it's a
train you were through the Yuriko yes I
was on the tunnel so how lonely the
tunnel the train was delayed so it was
like an hour I'm by the drain I thought
you go to work my bike no they don't let
you that'd be fun
you get off on the other side but yeah I
mean this is relatively comfortable
normally on my sport but I can get
around her bed I couldn't sit for eight
hours on a sportbike I would kill myself
ok so my grandfather's bike right now
right yeah pretty much treat my pretty
much this is a monster what is
you
200 km/h yesterday on the Autobahn but
one that is ok right yeah that's German
speed right yeah city
I can do I can't
Viet home at a time like it's it's
steady this bike has a wobble that
starts around 160 180 and when I got up
to 200 it was ready to throw me off so I
figured I wouldn't push it anymore how
fast can you go with your bicycle I
think it's only a 650 CC so I get it to
end you know 120 miles or 200 km/h and
unless unless I have the winds going my
direction I can't physically crank it
anymore that's about as fast as it goes
look for grandfather's bike is not the
best one who commits his power yeah yeah
that's okay without me oh this is GPS
GPS navigation yeah so what you doing
next we're going through good ever yeah
so from here
Lake Constance Lake Constance potency
and I gonna be its vendor okay and then
I'm going to Switzerland reinmuth spend
reimers netbeans named team yeah I'm now
going to drop by Terence's place on the
border go to Switzerland Italy France
and I think my last stop is Paris and
then I go back to dev ops but all of
that I've never fit here so you'll meet
the other side great week Antonio in
pantaleon pass and Tony are going to
hang out too much I'm driving like three
hours a day three hours a day yeah
rounded to it is a day all right times
like you know 14 days or something so
what's your family's opinion on that day
they think I'm crazy and hopefully when
I get home they open loving the door
maybe I sleep on the couch for a couple
weeks as well as you ride a movie before
what easy right house motivation movie
yeah yeah that never so easy right now
no you have to do this like movie
welcome without camera without taking
just writing you know yeah yeah so we
still are wow this is actually working
quite well this is working perfectly
yeah
yeah i can if i had keys yeah now this
this is not like my leave my suzuki is a
nice good and sound to this is this is
an old man sounds don't don't have to
saw that at least at least it's not like
the Honda's like the meat heard the
Honda 1300s they they sound like a
vacuum cleaner were horrible this was
okay it's not bad you could pimp up with
some javac sound or something
doesn't emit the sound through the
yeah so instead of car do you have Mike
a sports car actually it's called
volkswagen kombi hot spot so I guess I'm
is it nearby here you park you far away
to my folks wagon this is like the white
one a little bit smaller slice like this
yeah so I noticed my ramen all about all
these little Audi's and Volkswagen and
eating MIDI bands they're passing me the
you of course it's crazy we just see no
limits between the limits you know yeah
yes of it you go like
now we are working for oracle before the
new orleans all right yeah well i have a
job but all the speaking and javafx was
in my spare time so I'm i just noticed
GMU and reason and other guys actually
very critical guys are working for
oracle right now so was it a good
decision you like it or or would you
like
because I got to do basically the stuff
I want okay and before when I had a
full-time day job so you can imagine i
do my employer one yeah and I had to do
what I wanted so what I wanted was this
night taking and what the employer got
was this ok so now i reversed it like
this is what I want ok like this tour ok
and this is what Oracle says I have to
do so that's a better ratio ok and you
enjoyed it yeah yeah so really God
because people from the community are
rejoining Oracle because you know before
that no one knew what happens I mean
yeah so it's the opposite like when our
prefers to go every call you heard as
people leaving yeah exactly and now you
know what so when you gonna join I think
I will ever remain yeah yeah and I think
I think you have a given ISIL business
guy sir yeah thank you but um yeah I'm
really glad that you are we joining it's
important it's important to have folks
the community like you two guys who are
supporting java netbeans java java bella
x of course ya can't have everybody
working for oracle or the other way off
and then if this all dead exactly um
what is your favorite part of joe mix um
my favorite part yes why like that why
do I like Java effects do you oh well
I'm kind of a visual person at heart
yeah so why not one of the html5 because
I have time for that yeah so I Dunson
html5 apps but every time I do one I I
do
boundaries it's like two weeks and I'm
knee-deep in JavaScript and CSS and all
this monkey yucky stuff and then it
works on one browser and I'm like I
don't want poured it to get it fixed it
to work into the browser's I don't want
to redo all this javascript stuff I
don't want to figure out the 10th MVC
framework of the year so javafx is good
for busy people do you have any secret
feature is coming jealous you can review
lost and I tech night hackers so you're
good you should be the one interviewing
for an i hack night hacker yeah I mean
no wonder that is things alone don't
feel awesome yeah so I it's no secret I
mean the web map and stuff which we're
working on is pretty much public and you
can check it out open JFX but i think
fruit for javafx 8 over the big features
order the favorites features alyssum
through some pretty clear freeze
important which they're working on I
don't know whether we'll make the
release or not what else today it was
very cool there's some good stuff based
off the top of my head I'm forgetting I
nother thing embedding inside javafx
swing that one like the really swing
note okay there's a couple features i
was really excited about i can't
remember them now what do you ask
reverse sure if i don't break down
without all this okay good outing
you can I think we can leave this year
this is safe this is within broadcast
range also you see my embroidered night
hacking yeah they're fantastic I saw it
right this is this is called being a
billboard for the night hack store life
hacking tour and you can buy that in the
Oracle store Oh hopefully soon you have
night hacking in the orifice tour maybe
maybe give this out to drive one
attendees next year no be cool yeah I
tonight this would be a jacket the Java
one try any other cycle so mine is more
from the ring ding a ding ding ding
sound range but yeah but about five
years ago there was an actual like come
with bike javaone but it was a bicycle
with a real bike Nathan come this year
also they had the geek bike ride oh yeah
yeah I wasn't there you went you were
there officer as I law school it because
I would keep motorcycle ride but so one
can wait guys fun so when can we expect
to have the components required to
create an IDE with javafx like rich text
oh yeah that is it this x-axis the one I
was looking forward to in Java 8 yeah so
it's going to be in there yeah for the
text field i I don't I don't make the
road maps and I don't see the
development yeah yeah I think it's
planned it's supposed to show the slide
the first slide the famous porkness now
you know yeah say member that they don't
trust what the evangelist says slide
yeah we can do it now yeah Generation X
that that's really important yeah like
you need some other stuff like you know
docking frameworks and some other things
but those are things you can build
exactly and there's lies Campbell I
think like the first project which does
a big ide like maybe not they will be
nothing's in javafx will actually build
out all those components and other
people can take advantage of it yeah
because I saw so like people like Tom
Shean we're doing eclipse in Eclipse
some some some kind of code editor java
editor but they were using basically an
embedded web view
with JavaScript calls and and stuff like
that that would definitely not be
maintainable yeah yeah so it's cool that
you can make it but it's it's nothing
that you would be proud to show exactly
so let's let's see if anybody actually
is honor is on our chat so Peters are
really be used outdoors are they okay
social stream chat
rich tech support thanks thanks Jim oh
yeah so Garrett was only ich bike ride
he enjoyed it all right swing the tree
table 3d 3d so yeah so Peter Peter says
hi Peter pilgrim so what do you think is
is the next thing that we shoot that
should be added in Java fix that is not
yet there the next big thing like other
than stuff which yeah we thought we'd
already what would be nice to have so I
can think of lots of things which would
be good if people created them for java
effects for other folks to use but i
think at this point the platforms like
mature enough where you can you can
build real applications you don't really
you're not waiting for anything mm-hmm
so it's a matter of people building out
like more control libraries more common
components you can use you know even
like the graphing and charting is very
good in javafx but you can do more
business focused like
Tom Tom you Gellin who I with works on a
GF extras project did an agenda control
for like calendars and scheduling so you
could even build like a outlet I thought
ovation in there and I think more of
that needs to happen people building
controls and layering stuff on top of
javafx so do you think that this stuff
that is coming from jf extras is somehow
also going to make its way into the
distribution some sort of it some some
of it well but either one way of looking
at it is even tom was likes to keep his
stuff in Jeff extras because he can yeah
revision it more quickly and make
changes and update it once it becomes
part of the platform it's kind of you
know you're locked in order to change
the API I can't change the api's you
have to keep it backwards incompatible
there's stuff which goes along with that
so it's actually better to have things
which are bleeding edge or more
innovative in
for some step 1
controls oh yeah I know Garrett's
controls gauges yeah I was something
they were talking about pushing back
into the core I don't know if it's
actually going to happen but they were
having that to pulse team to see if it
made sense yeah dude well but but in the
next version in k FX 8 or probably the
controls and how they are created will
change a little bit right they're going
to make the api's public some of the
private api is public but i don't think
anything public will change their being
very careful that keeping all the public
API is identical yeah it's going to be
backward compatible but yeah but the
basic idea of creating behavior skin and
I'm touching these aren't public API Jie
Oh none of those classes are public so
if you're depending upon internal api's
then that's province they've been really
good since the JavaFX to a release of
keeping public API is backwards
compatible just like it's part of the
job se so the same way you you expect
like you know date and I oh and all that
stuff to Dockers compatible job FX is
the same mm-hmm all right so we've been
chatting about work this whole time and
that's that's no fun so tell us tell us
a little about your neighborhood here
let's just get a picture of some of the
stuff around here so this is your the
outside your studio here right yeah so
we here in West End yeah Munich West End
is where the Oktoberfest is in your
native format in DC right and icky laid
it aside from having arrows yeah and
this is also where the best blu-ray in
Munich is Augustina yeah agustina is
just like 500 meters from here and then
you have the Bavarian Statue of Liberty
here the bar area it's also like 500
meters in that direction so it's the
best place in this is like a very
cultural center of central Central it's
the center of Munich so
rather than the west end of munich
refurbishment okay specifically Tony's
training studio so so Stephen already
made this way out of the picture that
means the engine is basically so he
wants to take over again I guess so
thank you
too and really enjoy it it's it's great
where again the show I saw a lot of
these videos and it's a lot of fun yeah
thanks for doing that yeah now thanks
again to the affair cutting out
hopefully you letting me come out I
would arrive on live a healthy yeah
without any cold Devils safetrade yeah
that should be hopefully not too much
snow that I can actually get through
safely first get you can rent a bunch of
these you know the folks i can just put
your motorcycle back and just dry
describe others it was the grandfather
option this alright cool okay thanks
thanks folks for joining our informal
tour let's cut to outro</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
