basically from work because we work on a
very high level these days and I feel
that a lot of developers don't really
understand either the hardware or even
the Java to a machine that they base all
their software
upon and I see that it's a lot of
misunderstanding of what works on a Java
to machine how you should code for the
Java Virtual Machine and this talk is
basically a collection of basic
guidelines of how the java virtual
machine processes a Java program and how
it makes it fast such that people get a
general overview and the JVM is a little
demystified by that point I mean how do
you go about looking at performance for
the JVM so I mean that's of course
profiling tools that can help you with
that but it's it's more like you can do
little things that can have big impacts
on a JVM that's the java virtual machine
is based a lot on heuristics so it it
looks into your program how its run at
runtime and then it tries to build a
profile to make your program fast and if
you do strange things on a JVM then this
can sometimes have big effects and
unfortunately the driver to machine is
now 21 years old not a hot spot but but
Java itself and there's a lot of it why
still out there from old versions of the
JVM that people still apply and in
today's environments this doesn't
necessarily help often even the contrary
and in order to basically give people a
guideline of what actually works and why
this works
I made this talk so how do you know that
yours your your software or you losing
performance you're not like optimized
for a perfect for good performance on
the JVM well worst case you see the new
production systems because they're slow
for some reason and then it can just be
that there's some code segment that is
particularly slow for some optimization
maybe even you have applied or some
framework you have in between and to be
honest most of the times it's not the
Java Virtual Machine JVM works quite
fine it's most of times it's a database
but those few times where it's not the
database people typically do not know
where to look and how to look and
that's why this is an important skill
still and also in the future if you look
into what's happening on a JVM you have
now crawl which is a Java implemented
JIT compiler they're still happening a
lot and these things will change so it's
good to know what's happening in JVM
because maybe someday you'll update
there's some internal change which will
affect your software then it's good to
know how to debug these things right so
is it more critical when you have large
applications I mean when when should you
worry really about it it's often the the
large and application it is it's often
like these this web server model it's
and and ironically it's not it's so
important there it's often more
important if you have these sites like
streaming frameworks when you have a
large quantity of data that you want to
process you get like a stream of data
and you have to send it further as
quickly as possible which might be
something like spark or some some other
framework and in these frameworks the
the process is very busy most of the
times and then it's very beneficial to
to look into where the JVM spends the
most amount of time and I had these
cases where you have like you parse a
lot of big files and you need to extract
data from them and then suddenly you
find s1 reg X that consumes 90% of the
time this program is running and you
remove this one and you break your
runtime down to ten percent of what you
have before and then sometimes these
small changes can have big impacts so
and do you use like a particular tool to
moderate the the applications I mean
something that you used a lot that you
really like yeah so for development I
tend to use flight recorder a lot and
Mission Control for production you have
a bunch of commercial APM solutions but
you can of course also fly use flight
recorder now that it's open-source and
without a license this might actually be
an option
people must mostly like to go for free
alternatives right but yeah there's a
lot of great tools out there I'm trying
to avoid mentioning names because
they're all pretty good ok flight
recorder in particular it's nice because
it's bundled with Oracle JDK and now
open to the case in Java 9 as well
anything else you want to share that
about your talk I mean it's going to so
when is your taxes on Friday last it's
if you're already interested in this
topic you probably won't learn too much
this is really a talk that I made based
on the experience of explaining this
over and over again to colleagues so now
I have videos out so I can tell them
watch that video that's basically what I
want to tell you so I save some time
there but it's really an introduction
it's it's I don't show machine code I
don't even show Java bytecode I want to
show people this is your Java program
and in some way this is how the JVM will
transform this program at runtime it
will look at these particular things and
base its performance met optimizations
on these metrics that it collects from
your program cool well and it's so it
will be recorded so everybody can
actually see it live on Friday or or
afterwards right on youtube I hope so
yes Thank You Rafael thank you for
having me thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
