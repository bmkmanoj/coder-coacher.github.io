here at devoxx belgium a mule employee
from Oracle technology Network and my
guess is odd one on 20 booty hoe or 27
rakia who is working for reddit and I'm
the CGI to specification leader ok so so
you've been working really hard on the
CDI too yeah so we've been walking the
expert group is I've been walking for
nearly two years now and CDI too and we
have a lot of nice feature to to
announce and to add to see I so there
are features like a soccer news event
the official ID java SE support until
now there wasn't a Java Sea support at
the specification level we also added a
lot of helpers to design portable
extension so to have a better tooling to
integrate third-party framework and over
specification we also add a few advanced
life nice feature to have interceptor on
producing beam and a lot of our little
stuff so so for people who are maybe not
too familiar with the java ee platform I
mean how is a CDI interact with other
standards so the first version of CDI
was released with the java 6 in december
two thousand nine and it becomes very it
became very popular and today it's quite
sandwich in java ee platform so a lot of
over specification using Cydia to
integrate so for instance it's the case
for Jack Sarah's being validation its
will be also the case for the next
security specification so it's an an
integration specification that helps
having a consistent programming model
across all the java ee platform
so and so right now you said it's so
it's going to be released actually yeah
we should everything's going ok I'm
going light we should release in January
the city I to dot all will be releasing
January and so we are walking on the
last future the future freeze will be at
the end of the month enough November you
can still make your feedback they are
all the information to get the early
draft reference implementation on the CD
i spec ugh website and you can play with
it give your feedback if you find any
issue in the spec it's still time but
the window is closing and yeah and yeah
we should release the the CDI to respect
for a for january the idea was to
provide it before java 8 because over
spec may want to see what's new to adapt
to this new feature in cydia and and we
openly plan to provide a CDI two dot one
GSR to add a feature that could be
missing in the city I to dot 0 for java
8 so that was the idea of the beginning
and we stick to the plan quite that'll
you are on schedule yeah we aren't good
so and do you work a little bit or do
you get feedback from adopted yourself
and people who go to that program or so
what's your experience so that
unfortunately we don't have a lot of
feedback okay we have a very active
expect rube so people indexed our group
are walking on real life project so they
have their own feedback but we perhaps
would like a bit a feedback from the
community but perhaps it means that
everything is okay and the new feature
that we introduced so there was already
22 like to early draft for CDI one was
released
last year during the summer and second
one was releasing a guest there and so
far we didn't have any negative feedback
only people asking for clarification and
things like that that we added to the to
the spec as well okay so um so anybody
can try it right i mean i would be
awesome too and you should read the
specification that you worked nicely
yeah so it's well documented and we have
we have a nice we have a nice link
system between the specification
document and the tck okay so you can
check all the tests related to a section
in the Indus back to see where r what is
the code in the tck behind to to
understand by the code what is in the
specification so you can understand on
both ways by reading it and by reading
the test and going back and forth nice
very nice so good work thank you so
thank you for them for leading the
project right i mean it's I'm yeah I'm
sure it's a lot of work it's a bit of
work yeah a lot of politics as usual
yeah so thank you so much for talking to
us to them thank you bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
