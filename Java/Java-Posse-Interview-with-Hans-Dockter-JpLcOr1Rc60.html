see your hands yeah absolutely sir pants
you're here and the exhibition floor
what does it feel like to be an
exhibitionist it gives me the usual kick
excellent what do you think of um FJ
Caille case so far right ASEAN countries
good good good I mean well highly
qualified attendees and very good
speakers very good speakers dinner
wonderful location with a lot of Dale I
so it's not just it's awesome excellent
excellent so any any favorite bits so
far we haven't had a lot of a conference
yet but right exactly how would you
write in this morning don't mention now
the Texas system is a little bit weird
in Stockholm but you have kind of have
to negotiate your rates kind of so I
have to figure that one out but no
yesterday from the heck of garden there
were a cradle esky doc like in come out
of jail focus thanks to undress and
right and yeah there is so I'm a greater
perspective already a very successful
yes yes so great all right at one point
three is is it out yet 14 is on there is
Albert goodness so really we're very
fast and fast for a java posse to pick
up for some of the job of some of the
cool yeah you know better Kyle what to
talk about 14 and 13 and what's new and
that kind of thing yeah well tell us
tell us about what are the bigger maybe
the last couple 13 it was also very
recent yum will tell us maybe a little
bit about what's bigger 13 and 14 and
sort of the plan so on
I think the big new feature in 14 is I
think that there are so many open issues
when it comes to dependency management
in the Java world I always tell you know
in lots of other platforms so there's so
many so many standard use cases in the
enterprise that that can't be solved
properly just starting with you have
asprin all in the Supreme Court job in
your in your classpath right and none of
the dependence of management systems out
there so far is able to realize hey they
contain the same stuff so if they if
they're if there's a version conflict we
have to do something about it or
inordinate yeah just like all their
other typical scenarios I was talking
with the gyros rules guy they they need
they when they when they refer to the to
the whole software stack they need to
kind of model this is a releasable
rumored and only those components of
that release can work with other
components of that release so they must
so they're not other external libraries
they belong to release the lumen and and
they can only share one version number
and so so make the plenty of use cases
out there that you can't model at the
moment which is a Sherman in 14 we kind
of we finally introduced our first
approach its incubating to two tomorrow
this kind of stuff and then to enforce
your rules that you have as an
organization so I think that's a that's
a big step forward in our domain and I'm
very excited about that so that's for me
in terms of scope the biggest feature we
started to tackle right so I know I know
about 13 primarily they did my in one
for him so can you
and what else went into 13 as well
because that's that's only happened
fairly recently as a sex so I mean so we
have we have many scholars developers
that we're using Corellia we're saying
hey I mean without information compile
who is Justin flying in the Scala world
so thanks to typesafe who who provided
no Z SME as an incremental compiler a
tool that you can integrate with other
build systems we now could we could
integrate that and we now have a fast
incremental Scala compiler similar to
what s BTW has to offer so that that was
of that was there basically the
requirement to to to make it to make it
a feasible tool to use and in the Scala
world and now we be trying to you know
improve things train introduced the
rapper to make it easier to to work on a
scholar project and say hey I need to I
need to produce output for different
scallop versions need to compile against
different scholar versions and we talked
about that yesterday another thing I
think that is missing in the dependency
management domain is the concept that
ever loved I have a library but it is it
is made and need to be built differently
for multiple platforms so in C++ it's
obvious but also in Scala because of the
non-existing binary backwards
compatibility the same library need to
be billed for 294 to 10 for groovy it's
the same and now evening finally in Java
we have that problem right thanks God
because there's some innovation and I
know want to have the same library but i
use some of the java 7 features but i
still want to support java 6 so i have i
have great i have different sects and
it's not just it's not just a classifier
those those different variants as we
call and they might even have different
java dorks because they use certainly
certain different features they might
have different sources yes so it's a
when Jeff Wright comes out that's
especially gonna betray with right
absolutely and they might have different
dependencies so there's no at the moment
it's difficult to model a kind of song
concept I think he would give you a lot
of flexibility when you do a lot of
drafting right to model and we want to
make that concept also first-class
citizen and the Android folks have have
the problems as well so yeah big because
of this or because of the cooperation
with with the Android folks a lot of
staff has been prioritizing that in
there and in that area so the lot is to
to happen because we're kind of
targeting the two full Grail Android
release and kind of June May June this
year so that's another another nice list
of priorities we have to get up that'll
be a major milestone yes very large
complex project built with Gradle yes so
how i would say maybe how is the IDE
integration tool integration going in
with Gradle um let's say or it it's
going along good I mean we're not happy
with with a certain state at the moment
but there's a lot of progress happening
especially for idea uni so that's now
for them a top priority and we're
watching their commit locks and finally
the Gradle supporting idea is getting
its getting really well and that means
it's very promising and they're thinking
now making in a first class citizen and
which has become an important idea again
I wouldn't have thought that six years
ago what's really they did a great job
and there's kind of a critical mass
problem right the guys who are working
on ids don't want to spend time on
something they're not sure about and
under percent the people don't want to
use it until the ideas have it so now
we've reached maybe this critical mass
where the momentum is gonna help
accelerate but we wouldn't have the
resources to tackle that and the
knowledge that would have been the other
alternative we just write all that ids
support but that that that is beyond our
our you know available bandwidth Eenie
so yeah absolutely it's a nice
indication of the critical message there
and of course or the android adoption is
an important aspect of that so that
that make things easier with the tool
vendors right yeah so I'm gonna break
one of the cardinal rules of interview
which is I'm going to ask a question
about which I actually have no idea what
the answer is so it may or may not make
sense but are you guys aware of what Jay
frog is doing with ben tre oh yeah
Angela and so you have that's that's on
the radar or is it actually in the in
the product now yes I mean so the first
thing we're waiting on a pull request
from the vin brave folks that Jay Center
becomes a language element when you
define your repository similar like
making sample so in that is and I yeah I
mean I think the java community really
deserves a very rich portal and
repository for for the great open source
ecosystem we have you know not just some
Feist or right but something when you
were when you can interact where we're
human beings can kind of interact and
say I'm interested in progress here I
want to make comments he I want to have
a discussion here yeah and talk about
the all jar versus the core jar right
and issues around yes the dependency
graph right and work through those at
the community level as well as the
technical level yes absolutely so I
think it's exciting I kind of was
waiting for that for a long time in
terms of knowing who will provide that
but yeah cool anything else you can are
you looking forward to the java posse
ramba absolutely yeah yes and I'm so I'm
looking forward to the java posse round
them at the end of of the month right
and I'm looking forward to the first
greater conference in June in the Bay
Area greater summit from jun 13 2 to 14
hola car was present the Google Android
team will present oh you might present
too
all on the scarlet well I'll come along
and visit definitely so so that sounds
good it's a good time of year that's not
actually not too much going on there so
that's good in its international hood
yes oh yes very much so one thing I mean
with your dependency injection framework
course Carla one thing I always wanted
to ask you are writing a dependency
injection from before scholar does it
just allow you to make things more
convenient or Lester do the do the
features of scholar allow you also to do
something really innovative something to
kind of qualitatively enhance the
concept of dependency injection I think
I think both of those things are true so
interesting you've turned the interview
rambler voila yeah so a answer number
one is that incrementally there's an
improvement because the dsl capabilities
that are so great on scala so it's a
much neater dsl to configure the
bindings very clean with you know fluent
fluent api kind of it reads like english
for the binding but i think the other
one is the the kind of revolutionary
part of it is it heavily uses implicit
parameters which is something that a lot
of other languages have right now and
that's the way the configuration gets
passed around so the compiler does the
heavy lifting for you it means that sub
cut can only work in scala it won't work
with any any other languages but if you
can use scholar it's a very clean simple
implementation so yeah it looks like
it's clearing out okay so um either
they've got fed up with us or it's time
for the next session I think those guys
keep talking yeah interrupting our
coffee break on the upside I can hear
you now okay right without without do it
just because anyway well anything else
you want to covers over we maybe give us
a little sneak preview of what's coming
rattling on one side so what's your
roadmap what's good I mean we are I mean
I'm so excited about we stick to our six
weekly really sorry about six to eight
week and
every release has a significant
functional as I'm get on the train yes
so in one thing in 15 i'm looking
forward to might be 15 or early 16 not
sure yet is one of the really nice
features of Gradle is the incremental
held and and we we push that to the next
level right now greater decides for you
something has changed execute something
doesn't have a change don't execute but
now we're providing an API so even if
something has changed and we trigger the
task the task and ask what exactly has
changed and can do stem staff
incremental stuff and only the necessary
stuff and and it gets information about
the output that has changed the input
that has changed so that is sir yeah
that's an alternate way of transforming
the input to the output right optimize
based on yes subtle changes so you can
do some smart stuff some task come make
you if something has changed you need to
rebuild everything like java talk yeah
but obviously some other tasks can we
really stop smart about Oh something has
changed but only a little bit only I
only need to do a little bit like an
incremental compile right whatever so
exposing this to to the public that
that's exciting we continue with our
scholar support ending a ripple and
other stuff we want to do continue with
the dependency management stuff I've
talked about there's already a lot of
stuff in 15 there's a dashboard plugin
already in 15 so finally people asking
about made inside and stuff like that so
that would be our our offering in that
in that respect what else there's more
is it more on the list so another thing
is but it might be that Miley too far is
is you know improving the whole way you
can publish libraries if you have
different destinations like I have one
publication at one component but its
destination is weblogic and better jetty
and websphere the way you want to
assemble that is different depending on
the destination platform it's also it's
something like in maven that is covered
with the provided scope but I think you
can push that idea much much farther and
and much and much more
that's a powerful good in a powerful way
for the use cases you find in becat
began to price scenarios right now
awesome sounds good alright so I think
it's time for the next session ah that's
probably good handsome yeah ever so much
thank you so much for having me here
yeah there's no luck I understand
business going really well i hope that
continues yeah and you're moving to the
bay area as well yes i'm very excited
about that honey yes so girls man cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
