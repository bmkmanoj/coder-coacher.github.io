Developers Conference here in Sao Paulo
Brazil and I have here my colleague
Fernando Papadopoulos I'm Fabian our dog
and he just did the presentation about
data science using Java and we are going
to talk a little bit about it so
Fernando just started a company about
almost two years ago doing data sizing
in Java so you think that Java is a good
technology for doing data science yeah
we are using lots of tools from java and
some open source software's and java
helping us to improve or our core
business and all of other pieces of code
we need to do it's really easy to use
Java to write or or piece of codes so in
Java you have the whole Hadoop ecosystem
to do java application so what tools are
you using in your company and why you're
using them like you are using Hadoop
Andorians we use Hadoop you also use
HDFS and mahout crunch and some other
softwares you can get the open source
code in Java and there's a Java
developer you can actually look at the
code and fix if something doesn't work
for you and this is scaling well for you
yeah that's the point if you use
software's made in Java
it makes easy to us to look in the code
so if you need to fix something or or
see what's going wrong it gets easy
because everything is writing in Java so
this is this whole data size hype is
getting bigger and bigger everybody's
talking about it so do you think that
job is a good fit for it cuz many people
use tools like our or Python so what do
you think we have treats is Java the
first choice for for doing data science
or we should
be using something else as most of our
ecosystem are actually written in Java I
think we prefer to choose this kind of
software as we have and better better
integration with all of them so we
should use the oven
how big is user data like for example
how many new records you have each month
we collect about 4 billion records each
month and we are planning to double next
month are you excited about everyone
going to San Francisco September yeah we
have presentation approval so we are
going to see all of you in Java on San
Francisco great thanks everyone and see
you Java one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
