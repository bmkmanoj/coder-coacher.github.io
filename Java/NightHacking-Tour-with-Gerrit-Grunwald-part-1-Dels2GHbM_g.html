headquarters with Garrett groom Walter
or as property and her parrot that was
what tom says right yeah carrot and it
had I don't know you can I blow job you
can't do that but the name should is
Dutch I think yeah I heard of it okay
and you are a master hacker at javafx
look for work for canoe now just just
recently joined also the best known for
steelseries control just for swing and
now javafx for the JFX project or and on
all around cool hacker also Garrett is
the designer who built that initial
splash screen for the young light
hacking tour yeah it was powerful
session right yeah we coach LOL 00 Botha
javaone so thank thank you for them Oh
welcome what's fun but when you wait
what do you think of our stickers does
this meet your design standards are not
hacking stickers so if not then I
wouldn't have it as my Twitter hash
right sorry time enjoy yeah it's your
proof yeah it's approved here we go wow
thanks this would be on my camera I
would block pictures about it so furnace
good all right so what sort of what sort
of stuff do you wanna do today what's
her hockey yeah so I would like to show
you some things I did the last three
weeks four weeks since Java one in
principle where i saw the embedded stuff
javafx on embedded and I really was
amazed by the possibilities and directly
order to bought and LCD display directly
a travel one nice and it arrived you're
sitting in the session you heard the
announcement anybody directly afterwards
I biologists online and it arrived the
week after journal one so and then the
house of the new beagleboard for ESL
effects forearm release on exactly so
I'm because I talked to jess plant he
told me don't use the Panda mode
nanchang remember and use the bigger
boat ex-im because
that is the reference yeah let they use
and so I all of the one and he also told
me I should order just one specific LCD
display otherwise I won't get any touch
so that was the reason i ordered exactly
the same configuration they showed it
the Oracle booth I travel one but yeah
that's only having a hardware and the
hard part was getting it running that
was really not so easy for me because
I'm not a linux hecka so it takes a lot
of terminal work there and Linux
commands and other things so and knowing
where the files are on linux and if they
are not there you have to just create
them and it will work so yeah all of
that stuff building my own corner which
was also a really good experience yes so
I started with that sand first you have
to order all that things it takes really
some time because that stuff is only
available in small amounts so when I
ordered the LCD display they only have
two on stock wow so you're all right and
the day after it was gone and then they
saw five weeks you can order one so it's
really you have two o'clock but but
somehow you've got parts and you provide
yeah I know the spot sense on the
weekend last weekend I put it together
in the box so that I can transport it
and just say in front putting java code
on this box it's not a problem that's
really an easy thing to do you just coat
it in I use netbeans for that and I coat
the little application I can just show
it first because it's running right now
oh and I hope it keeps running and let
me show you it's it looks like this this
is the stuff that will be on the bigger
board just like this when you say this
is like something early and this is the
ante as you can see I try to make it
look like a metro style because that's
fancy but I never saw really or never
use the Metro epsoide it before before
against the demo yeah let me let me
mention to folks had interacts on the
stream and then okay update you once
light schedule change
yeah okay so if you're watching us live
on ustream you can interact with us by
either typing a social chat in on the
ustream page night hacking calm or the
same page for on the east stream site or
you can just tweet out with pound night
hacking as a hashtag and it'll go into
the social stream and we're watching the
stream will answer questions online and
we also have a a local audience here we
have we have folks sitting in the studio
hmm and our night hacking to our what I
can okay there you so Andre so Andre
what are you doing here show so my
sister cool and you're gonna you're
going to help us out later and do an
interview too ok actually we moved
andre's to interview up we're going to
do it right after Garrett finishes with
no delay and then we're gonna go have
have fun outside alright and Steve
cursor there and so just like Steve you
hopped out where do you normally live
and humble view cool and I've always
been in just and created some Jonathan
excess and fully intend to create rich
yes so just like Steve contacted me and
want to drop in since you know I was in
the area we we welcome drop-ins even if
it's not a jug event it is just doing an
interview it's cool to have more people
hanging out at hacking we already been
having some really good discussions
about um javafx and you know the
switchover from swing and you know the
future of java mobile devices and all
that cool stuff so you get to have all
those fun conversations if you hang on
person alright so ok back to back to the
main star here oh oh mighty a lot of
pressure if you're looking look at this
this is you have to see this right I
promise to Matthias that I will show it
however here's your shot
let me get the clothes if you have said
yes I'm in February that's the
conference you have to go to j focus
stock on great conference and Pepe go
there so you're getting a big kick back
for that one right oh yeah okay so now
we have to just switch back to the to
the demo screen which is just yeah it's
the code running on my desktop machine
no because no that's why you don't see
anything here so this is an in principle
we have on the left side we have this
chart which is just a giant jf extras
control and all they engage right and on
the right side then we have a chart this
is a.j Fagin javafx chart standard line
chart and then I created some other
stuff just to fill the room right we
have a clock and then a little calendar
and then I have a button to switch the
unit between Celsius and Fahrenheit and
then I have two different modes because
I measure continuously every 10 seconds
or I can also measure every 15 minutes
so and exit of course message nice so
this is exactly the code that runs on
the big reward I just compile it as a
jar put it on the BeagleBoard started
and that's it so that's that's java on
on the baker-bots it's really all java
so you don't need to make any changes to
the help you this is exactly that's the
code I coat it here on the on my desktop
and then just put the jar on the on the
video button start in the letter yeah so
that's awesome it's it's a really good
experience to to code for this kind of
stuff so i used the sun spots in the
past which are running on a java-based
yeah just like yeah walk walk viendo
yeah right which was a really great
because you can coach in a Java ME style
java code on these devices and you have
lots of possibilities with sensors and
all that but you don't have it really
yeah okay so it's not idealize so it's
really just a sensing device and that's
it not as powerful yeah and this is now
completely different because for the
bigger watch you haven't principle
completely
8pc if you want just as a size 14 this
it's really small it's in this box here
I can show to you later go so this is
the app and with a gauge it's a little
bit of a problem right now I don't know
if it's really a buck I filed it as a
back end it's the box so you can't use
custom controls on the bigger watch jbn
right now it doesn't work so I don't
know why then I check the sample code
that comes with the JDK and I saw that
they put everything in one class so
usually we have asked in control
behavior and a CSS file and separate
class files and then this is one control
but if you do that you just get a black
screen that's all so there is nothing
and then I saw the original demo code
and I thought okay maybe if it works if
I put everything in one class and it
works so i don't know why but there's a
I fight the back of all that that should
be fixed so yeah like I said it's a
little bit metro-style that was just I
would like to try it and I think it
makes sense on devices like this the
colors it's it's really not to not cook
you I know it's just was to play around
with and I have also never played around
with the metro-style unit so i have no
idea if it's really the right behavior
so it's just what I saw from images and
try to copy so when I was when I was a
degree in town he he told me he loves he
loves the Metro UI because you know
Microsoft turns rectangles with colors
yea unto a valuable design pattern for
you eyes yeah you tall so told me that
she's not able to do nice-looking urs
show us the rest of us can create you
eyes and people like wow that's it was
just like it's natural it's completely
new great design yeah yeah let's let's
go yes the rest of us can do what you do
now damn it okay so on so what I did so
just to give you an idea why why is did
I spent three weeks
and screwing around with all that stuff
to show you now something that's because
a Java one we went to the appreciation
event and on the bus I talked to touch
Costello costella and we were discussing
how can you use an embedded device with
javafx in a real use case and then you
told me yeah you know we have a use case
where we need to measure the temperature
of a room and really a couple of times a
day and we have to make sure that it's
stable so that would be great if we have
something like like a bigger brought in
this in this room measure the
temperature and send it over the network
to my desktop PC so under that's the use
case law yeah so I tried because I did
this with the sun spots already I try to
figure out how to do that and in
principle this is easy you just create
the app on the bigger board which sent
the demented data out and buy I you say
xmpp because I'm not a sober guy I think
if I would be a server guy would set up
some glass finish and do all that hanky
panky stuff but I have no idea about
that so I use just a different approach
I used to xmpp which is the jetta driver
teasing chat protocol and so this is the
event base which just makes it perfect
for stuff like this and you can just
create a I created some accounts on open
java service and yeah and the bigger war
just sends data to my account and the
advantage is that it does not only send
the data to my account but I can also
use it on my iPad for example so because
i have just a chat lounge and is in the
moment the bigger board sends me some
message I would see it on my iPad and so
it's not John while running on the iPad
or Java ethics but I'm sure it will come
right so we just rather like to see that
yeah yeah exactly but in the meantime
before we got javafx on the eye patch i
can use now the check on which is also
nice so and we can show it better and I
don't know if we can see it on there
yeah so I'll bring I'll bring the the
camera maybe the camera
and are there so I'm yeah okay then on
the desktop I ran another application
which is then representing the oh that's
the desktop app it's just and to make
the to make this show the difference
right this is a desktop machine I used a
really rich gauge which with all the
effects and all that stuff which it
doesn't really work on the other bigger
wat and the reason is that you have on
my macbook pro the GPU I think it has
384 course and on the video board I have
free course so that's one difference and
also the clock speed is it's completely
different level here that's why I bring
a camera yeah you can yeah that's great
do we have our three row light man like
name by right hands yeah just some more
words to the setup because the bigger
board has four USB ports and also a
serial connector and the easiest way to
do this was because I don't want to feel
around with the bare metal so I use the
sensor which is really a nice thing it
is just one cable with the serial plug
and if you set the DTS enabled to true
then it would send every 10 seconds it
will send the metadata in centigrade
degrees centigrade so that was easy then
to read it out by rxtx and if we use
angstrom on the on the BeagleBoard you
can just install the rxtx java Jane and
the J'naii lip and also the java java so
it's just in the opie kg package
management it's already there you just
have to install it and then you can use
it from Java that means I connected this
stuff to the USB port and that's
important because the serial port
doesn't work with Java on a bigger board
so you used your USB and every 10
seconds it will sense the temperature
and then it % the data / XMPP through
the connected clients this one is not
the desktop line and also my iPad
I'm not sure if I see it I just make
some measurements before you see here
all the measurements and if you pull it
out and now it's I knew that so now it's
it doesn't work anymore yeah like I
expected it's a demo God's right yeah
but you see it worked for one hour and I
bank a graph here on the on the desktop
version and also on the bigger boat
itself maybe I can step aside so you can
grab it this way this is still working
but because i started the desktop demo
it the connection is lost now to the
desktop version and so here we have the
same thing running you see some glitches
here this is still be prophets it's a
very early preview version oh can you
call it early a desktop over there can
you click on the left the blank shot of
your blank shot okay so if people right
here we go so this is the yeah that's
not the bigger bought stuff and here you
see the glitches that you see on the big
reward and and it's not very stable but
like I said you see here the
measurements it's one hour it measured
the data and we just grabbed the sensor
a couple of times so to make sure that
it really sends the data over to the to
the desktop version and let me see maybe
it starts again you're fine let me check
alright so here we go let's do some
measurements no don't think so yeah I
have to work wait every time 10 seconds
before it no it doesn't work
unfortunately it doesn't work I don't
know why we saw it working yeah it
worked and collected quite a bit of data
too yeah the bigger one is working but
some other exit
means when I started on the desktop then
the connection gets lost I don't know
why it's a unfortunate but no it's it's
gone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
