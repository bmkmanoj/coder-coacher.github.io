latest Java card 3 technology Java card
3-connected edition after a quick
overview of the technology I will be
demonstrating some of the new
applications that can be implemented
using Java card 3-connected Edition
smart card hardware has become more
powerful and ever faster CPUs larger
memories enhance networking are now
common on high-end smart cards
the javacard 3-connected platform
supports three application models for
compatibility with the classic edition
and for backwards compatibility with
Java card 2.2 an abd you based classic
applet model is available classic
applets can therefore be deployed
unchanged on both Java card three
classic platforms and connected
platforms the connected platform also
allows a classic applet developer to
leverage the new multi-threading and
network capabilities this new type of
applet is called an extended applet and
is the second of the three application
models these extended applets of course
are not compatible with classic addition
or with Java card 2.2 the third
application model is the web-based
application model the connected platform
includes an HTTP server on a servlet
container this enables the development
of smart card applications with a rich
web-based user interface and also
enables integration with existing web
services
the connected platform supports both
contacted and contactless interfaces
multiple i/o channels can be active at
the same time the contactless interface
allows for NFC support support for IP
over the high speed interfaces allows
the card to truly act as a node in an IP
network the following demonstration
shows how this IP stack can be further
enhanced to support the zeroconf
protocol
this demonstration shows how a connected
card with a zero stack can dynamically
discover IP services on a local network
or on its hosting device it also shows
how a card can advertise its own
services for dynamic discovery by other
hosts on the local network and one of
these advertised services is card portal
card portal is a web application that
lists all the installed card
applications and services being a web
application it provides an enhanced user
experience in the case of a SIM card
this application could be a central
point for card service access that could
be customized and branded by a mobile
network operator one of the applications
listed on the card portal is the card
owner application this application
provides information about the owner of
the card it's a web application and can
either render an HTML format to a web
browser or it can act as a web service
and provide the identical information in
vCard format to the requesting client
application when the user connects her
phone to a local network she could use a
zeroconf
enabled browser and here we're using
firefox to discover the services
advertised by the card from her browser
the user could then access the card
portal that runs in the SIM card of her
phone the card owner application also
advertises itself as a zeroconf
service a user could therefore directly
access it from the list of discovered
zeroconf services
this second demonstration shows a mobile
ticketing application suite it combines
NFC based payment web user interactions
and asynchronous notifications mobile
ticketing is a large application suite
that combines for different applications
point-of-sale is a web application that
lets the transit user buy tickets check
his ticket book balance and perform
other administration operations the user
can access point of sale from the card
portal when buying tickets point-of-sale
will interact with wallet wallet is a
legacy applet application that
implements an electronic wallet
turnstile is an APD you driven
contactless classic applet that allows
the transit user to swipe his card in
front of the NFC terminal at the
turnstile and to be granted permission
to enter or exit the transit system the
operation of the turnstile is simulated
by this application it simulates the
contactless interaction which occurs
when entering or exiting the transit
system it also simulates the contactless
interaction that occurs when the transit
user has been blocked at the exit gate
and the ticket booth clerk overrides the
system to let the user exit through the
gate finally admin is a web application
that can be used remotely by a clerk at
a ticket booth to assist the transit
user if his transit card is blocked
before being able to enter the transit
system the transit user must credit his
ticket book using the point-of-sale
application this financial transaction
is executed securely through an
interaction with the wallet application
the ticket book balance initially zero
is now three tickets
the transit user can now attempt to
enter the transit system by bringing his
phone in range of the NFC terminal at
the turnstile once the contactless
exchange is over the gate opens and a
notification is displayed on the users
phone acknowledging successful entrance
to zone one of the transit system when
exiting through a turnstile in zone four
the user again brings his phone and
range of the NFC terminal at the
turnstile
the gate will open and a notification is
displayed on the users phone
acknowledging the successful exit from
zone for the charge for the trip and the
New Balance if the transit user did not
have enough ticket book credit to pay
for his trip he will be blocked at the
exit this may be the case when he had
enough credit to enter in zone 1 and
exit in zone 2 but not enough to pay for
a longer trip such as one from zone 1 to
zone 4 in this situation the user is
blocked at the exit gate and a
notification is displayed on his phone
asking him to contact the ticket booth
clerk the administrative clerk to assist
the transit user when his transit card
is blocked in order for the clerk to use
the administer the card owner that is
the transit user must authorize the
remote access
when the clerk attempts to access the
administered for a password to authorize
the remote access once authorized the
clerk can log in into the administration
history the clerk can then
a special case but the transit user go
through the turnstile gate a
notification is displayed on the users
phone acknowledging he is authorized to
go through provided he credits his
ticket book
prior to re-entering the transit system
and prior to re-entering the transit
system the transit user credits his
ticket book
this third and last demonstration shows
how a zeroconf
enabled connected card can discover
other pure cards on its local network
and perform secure transactions with
these cards here we assume that to
transit users for example two family
members have connected their phones to
the same local network
perhaps just their home network the two
phones have different owners and here
they are represented by Java card Duke
and by Java ME Duke the first card owner
let's say the father has a balance of
five tickets and he wishes to transfer
two tickets to his daughter's phone
his daughter of course the second card
owner
you
from the point-of-sale application the
father can select his daughters card as
the recipient for the transfer the list
of recipients has been discovered
dynamically by the point-of-sale
application using zeroconf
facility when the father attempts to
transfer two tickets to his daughter the
daughter is prompted for a password to
authorize both the remote access and the
transfer once these permissions are
granted the daughter's phone displays a
notification acknowledging the transfer
of two tickets and confirming the New
Balance the father's ticket book is
debited accordingly and each phone
logged the transaction
so this concludes our presentation today
and thank you very much for your
attention
