of my favorite things java and cloud
computing i spent my day right now
figuring out how to make java work well
on the cloud and what i want to talk to
you about today is some of the
challenges for running java applications
on the cloud the first is around
multi-tenancy and how we actually drive
up density in the cloud so when you want
to do this in a truly multi cummer kind
of way you need more controls you need
more ability to control the resource
consumption of the JVM to kind of put
fences around applications as they run
and share those instances and enable
kind of a secure and managed way to
share those OS instances the second
thing which we've been working on which
i think is really interesting is some
revolutionary new garbage collection
technology called balanced GC and what
balance GC does has really set the
foundation for some of these problems
that I talked about it's a garbage
collection technology that allows us to
then optimize how we process that
garbage collection data based on memory
characteristics am i running on fast ram
am i running on SSD or some other
technology and optimize how we treat
that data based on the memory
characteristics of where it's stored i'm
pleased to announce that this technology
around balance GC is something we've
already delivered with a latest release
of our jbm version 7 which we released
back in September we've made available
now this advanced garbage collection
technology the second challenge is
around your apps so you have a
foundation of java running well on the
cloud and we can deal with the
infrastructure how do you actually make
your application scale and I want to
focus in on one kind of core approach
that people are using for scaling and
that is around elastic data grids the
challenge of scaling is how do you scale
stateful applications and that's where
some new techniques have emerged over
the last few years that really are
designed to help you deal with state in
a scale-out multi-instance architecture
iBM has delivered technology like this
we have a set of products two in
particular that are interested
one is Webster extreme scale which is
our Java based in-memory data grid
product that supports all of these
scenarios that I talked about we have a
subset of extreme scale as well called
the data power XD 10 appliance which you
can think of as a hardware appliance
packaging model for extreme scale the
third area was around deploying and
running those applications on the cloud
the picture on the right is kind of the
model that you have to deal with today
what we want to do is switch the
interaction to the picture on the left
that says let's just describe the app
our commitment will continue forward you
know maybe one of the big signs of that
recently was our joining of OpenJDK last
year but we continue to invest heavily
in Java with that thank you very much
and enjoy the rest of the presentation
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
