alright we're showing here is expected
helpful demo where we have rotation we
have some kind of product disease in our
particular scenario that chronic disease
is heart failure can be any type of
Aziza the patient may have that's our
specific scenario this patient has some
remotely monitored devices they take
readings from at home according to their
doctor's instruction they have a which
reads data from these devices that
transmits them wirelessly to start
completely reality much smaller
we have job-embedded with an embedded
event processor running a complex event
processor which is analyzing the data
coming from these devices in real time
and doing some local analytics determine
the state of a patient's health without
concern from whether a doctor is
actually watching at that time or not so
even detect looking at the correlation
of the data readings from these devices
aggregated them together going over
certain analytics won't believe that are
personalized for that patient Niki
detect whether that patient in our case
is actually about to have heart failure
before maybe the doctor even gets a
chance to see it this helps in scenarios
where the doctor is inundated with data
from all sorts of devices in the
situation that could close with 12 our
team to this will have to generate a
very specific alert by taking this data
analyzing it movement
determining that there is something
going on without worry about all this
data being sent and analyzed like the
pension will be presented with an opal
tablet with a user interface and this
case is a java-based user interface it's
communicating with our gateway and the
Java embedded application running on
there and this screen here is something
that the healthcare provider would have
access to the backend and actually gives
a few multiple engines but let's show
what happens as we take readings are
local so how to connect this to show a
live data reading and then we'll go to a
scenario where the patient is actually
having part of this simulator live in
and actually take a live breathing but
we use a pulse oximeter it's a laser
device for pulse oximeter is a compliant
exact running Java so the patient us
doesn't worry about things being plugged
in so it's taking my reading right now
and as soon as it's done I will take a
look at the user interface to see that
it updated with my reading so it should
be a 98 over 85 and there you go you see
the 998 for oxygen and 85 for heart rate
now I'm going to do is show a scenario
where our patient is having or Billy or
about the network failure so to do that
we have to actually simulate the data
for these meetings we're going to
simulate data being read by the patient
four times a day they're taking readings
four times a day
well what pressure weight and pulse
oximeter
now if the hosts over the course of a
few days or the patient goes up a little
bit it's not a big deal if the weight
increases a little bit everyone's great
clutch weights not a big deal if their
blood pressure increases over the course
of a couple days again not a big deal
alone but for those three factors
increase by a certain percentage
together over to keep it running average
over in two to three days that could
indicate heart failure can actually be
Bruce in the serious scenario for this
patient so we're going to do is actually
simulate that with our event processor
Manning all three feeds in real time
throughout each day averaging out the
readings and keeping a running average
throughout the week
scenario of Kurtzman's patient these
rules are perfect they able to be
personalized for each patient who are
parties whatever their particular
situation so I'm gonna take user
interface here take it out of live mode
and put it into simulated mode I'm gonna
bring up the same interface we saw
before but now we actually see just for
our demonstration purposes a little box
here and that's kind of show our
simulated device readings I'm not
actually going to take the vise readings
because I'm not actually gonna have
heart failure I think here today so I'm
gonna start out with a baseline and our
patient has a baseline of 148 over 70
for intake or a blood pressure 90 for
oxygenation 77 for heartbreak and a
weight of 200 pounds just tell you an
example a scenario for baseline stay
first day of readings I'll put the
button here and it just simulated for
readings for the first day and really
all that happened was the weight
increased just a little bit for this
patient not a big deal
again this is something that the doctor
can get access to in the back end but
perhaps he won't have access to it in
real time and that's the value of our
analytics running here after day two we
see that the blood pressure has
increased just slightly but everything
else is pretty much stayed the same
compared to the big four again not a
problem
by day every way does increase another
pound or two the heart rate has
increased as well simulate day four
greetings four readings per day again
and we see the weight has yet gone up
again pulse rate has gone up and blood
pressure has slightly elevated by day
five in our sample data what has
happened is each of these values over
the course of two to three days has
increased of certain percentage again
the doctor has programmed that to
trigger our health care event and what
is happening here is of
the system running here locally to the
patient has detected that there's a
potential for heart failure and patient
may be suffering with new heart failures
so in their local tablet they'll
actually be presented with an interface
and they'll be asked how they feel and
it'll be very simple all they have to do
is choose a smiley face and they're
feeling fine a sad face that they're not
feeling well at all
or so so based meaning I'm okay but not
great and they can also provide some
some optional feedback so I'll just do
that almost like this so so please and
I'll type in that I'm feeling sluggish
which is consistent with a patient
having heart failure and that patient
can send that data off which actually
goes to the backend healthcare provider
to see whether or not the user actually
does that still the alert will be sent
to the backend and what we're showing
basically is that we've got two days are
coming from our our local devices from
the patient but it's being analyzed
locally so we're not too worried about
all this data innovating upon the
healthcare provider to make an analysis
and this is a life and death situation
but I want to show you now what the
doctor will see obviously the doctor
will people have access to this patients
can actually pinpoint different readings
from the devices as they come in in real
time so you have a pressure pulse
oximeter Nathan if I were to scroll down
this an event as well it actually starts
it over time so the same analytics we've
had running here locally are being
charted here in the subpage of dashboard
the most important part here is that the
healthcare provider when there's notes
he has some alerts we've run this a few
times today so you can see that most
important thing in hearings that we have
that last set of data that we have read
here thumbs up then we have heart
failure detected for this patient our
patients are identified by ID here for
privacy but that's that's the important
part so we have end-to-end scenarios as
devices that are routed data location
analytics running
and the all transmitted back to a back
end that health care provider has
options</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
