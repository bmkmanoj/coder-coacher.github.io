technology Network we're here on the
floor of J focused live talking to
members of the Java community I have the
distinct honor to speak to mr. Michael
who Derman hey Michael
hi Tori oh you I'm well are you doing
fine thanks good so I've been told that
you are an expert on DevOps is that is
that a accurate characterization yeah
it's it's it's a good fit okay you've
written a book so maybe you know maybe
there's some experience okay oh man so I
hear the terms very overloaded so what
is DevOps DevOps is really a term that
it's very much over an order right so in
my opinion DevOps is just a tool box of
Alliant goals between development and
operations as well as aligned tools and
processes so actually my message what
DevOps is is summarized in my DevOps
book which was published two years ago
okay have things is it a very changing
moving target that you're heading I mean
would would you update your book or do
you feel like it's spin it time this
yeah that's nice but your publisher
would like to see addition to I'm sure
yeah maybe
actually it's still up to date okay even
some some things I've written more up to
date ever
so one example is what I have written
two years ago is that DevOps
is not a tool there's nothing like a
DevOps tool right oh no
agile or not right yeah yes it's it's a
good tool such as a factory or bench
wake and underpin your DevOps approach
for sure but it's it's not it cannot
implement it directly the DevOps so
therefore it's just a matter of
collaboration between development
operations and towards are just tools to
to help the people the people are more
important but what I've written in the
is for example that DevOps is not yes
there's nothing like a DevOps tool yes
there's not a DevOps engineer right and
funny enough meanwhile if you study some
some openings many many DevOps engineers
many companies are looking for DevOps
engineers and many - vendors provide any
sort of obstacles interesting so do you
feel like development is changing like
developers are learning to pay more
attention to the production environment
or is there something forcing a function
or it's just I'm a nice guy and I'm
gonna care about that more tell me tell
me your opinion
sorry that's a very good question I
think that's a process it's can only be
reached a step by step so I think that
both parties can profit so development
can learn extremely good from operations
how software can or must run in
production so it's it's really a
difference between software and
production and software on a on a local
laptop right so it's really a common
problem that developers say oh that's
that's my software my module works
locally but as soon as they hand over
the software to production it breaks and
but also the other way around so also
operations can learn from development
and I think the future is that both
parties will merge more or less so what
what I call is developer is reflects the
one team approach that compromises
programmers so coders test us but also
people who develop infrastructure as
code and all that stuff so all those
people have to develop the software
interesting yeah and as I can only speak
for my in user perspective and I really
don't care whether it's DevOps or
production people IT people are the
developers absolutely it's not working
for me or it's it's very response time
right that's all I care about except the
point right so that's the most important
it was awesome
and business goats are important so an
improved cycle time for example or any
other business goats right are most
important
I'm delighted to see that wall breakdown
so thank you very much for dropping by I
really appreciate it thank you for the
time yeah good luck and we'll see you
again my sty thank you
there's a story way out with the Oracle
