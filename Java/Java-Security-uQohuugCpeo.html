Network and I'm here today at devoxx UK
talking to Melton Smith milking time
some Milton tell us what you do at
Oracle so I am a senior principal
security p.m. for java platform group
and i managed security for all the
products java products pretty much
except for EE so a lot has been going on
with Java regarding security so what are
some of the remediation yes yep so we've
done a lot of things and been quite busy
a lot of information is available
publicly so the public can see you know
what our progress has been in the number
of bugs and severity bugs that we fixed
number of CPUs that we've delivered and
security alerts and turnaround time on
on getting these things fixed i think i
think everybody well i hope everybody
would agree that it's an it's definite
progress so what are some of the
important recent updates so i guess most
recently would be java 7 update 10 in
december so in 7 update 10 we introduced
a security slider which allows browser
depth people that have operating in
their browser to to change their
security settings to their preference
and we also introduced a check box that
allows folks to either enable or disable
Java very easily so you introduce also
the applets code signing so tell us
about it yeah so that is coming up for
April I'm very important but we have
gotten some word out but we still
continue to try to get some out but code
signing is very important because it you
know helps to establish a web of trust
for java desktops and
and hopefully keep users safer and we in
order to effect the best user experience
people really need to have their applets
signed it's not a strict requirement
that applets be signed but we are that
the dialog messages that people receive
are definitely more friendlier 44 signed
apps so that so it's not a requirement
but it's certainly encouraged in you
also announced that that Java one you
will maybe you have a track there yeah
so that's that's very new as well you
know I think one of the challenges with
security here is you know there's
definitely things that we can do at
Oracle to make Java stronger but really
security is a industry challenge and it
takes collaboration and so we you know
i'm looking through things last year i
discovered that there were a number of
security sessions and so i brought it up
to the conference folks and said hey
let's just you know we're doing the same
thing anyway let's just let's just call
it what it is let's call it a security
track and so so the folks said yeah okay
let's do that and so it was great and
you're giving you a session today
actually yes so I'm providing a session
here later just kind of talking about
some of the progress that we've
discussed here on Java security and
going into it a little bit more detail
as well as some of our progress and and
a little bit more detail about Java one
and things like that so and the session
will be recorded I assume and beyond
Polly's as well every way yeah right so
anything you would like to add or link
maybe where they can find more
information yeah yeah there's there's
definitely um
they'll definitely be some useful links
provided on the slides that are part of
that session that include information
about the code signing and also about
different policies and things were
collat why we communicate when we don't
communicate things like that that our
people are always interested in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
