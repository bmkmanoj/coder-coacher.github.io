show some folks we're sitting in a
fishbowl people can see us for that and
for the expression in order to line up
against the wall and try and distract us
at some point we'll get them back so
welcome to the screen and so the stuff
we're going to try to do today is we'll
talk a little about some of the Monday
java initiatives which you've been
Martine are pushing for talk a little
bit about some of the presentations
you've done recently and also go over
some of the stuff that engines doing
maybe do a little hacking with MongoDB
my vein amazing how that goes so the
whiteboard behind as we can etch on it
seems work pretty good Steven cohort and
then we have an office full of people
who we can get revenge honestly if
they're trying to attract us which are
disruptive Foley we're hanging out here
so welcome so I guess to get started so
I was at javaone and saw some of your
talks but for folks provokes you you
don't know much about about you and your
interests kind of can you explain some
of the things which you're passionate
about and also some things you learned
from folks who came to your sessions and
so I javaone I did I think it was like
four sessions and one was a short
version on the value of outsourcing your
your bits of your code not your whole
code there was sessions around the
london java community and adopts jsr
adopt openjdk and some of the stuff
we've been doing as part of the being on
the JCP executive committee and I did my
introduction to the disruptor
presentation I've been doing all year
when i was at Almack's and since i just
moved on from from my wife's a couple of
weeks ago then that was probably the
last time that presentation will get an
outing and then finally i did a
presentation on
the problem of the lack of women nit
which was a pretty good session
a from having these sessions of you know
room full of 20 women talking about how
hard it is to a woman in RT yeah I
thought I was tied in the back for this
party yeah and I thought there was good
representation from both both genders
those folks were had
I think we important I having guys long
to those sessions is easy when you've
got a room for the woman to say you know
I've had trouble because I've been
discriminated against in this area or I
find this ere we are difficult or I
can't do this and I think it's a bit
better when you have guys there saying
well I've suffered from that too or I
didn't get the same I didn't feel it was
sexism but I've had discrimination in
other forms and i think it's it's a much
as far as I session was like
brainstorming on different different
areas so Israeli you learned our which
you didn't expect anything and
surprising I came up i think the thing
that surprised me actually was the fact
that afternoon sessions like that you
end up with lots of people coming up
with stereotypes like the reason why
women don't want to work in various
professions is because they want to have
babies or because they want to work
part-time and the most surprising thing
to me was a lot of those stereotypes
didn't come up and i think by phrasing
it as
we like about our jobs what do we not
like about our jobs what can we do to
help the industry by phrasing it that
way you don't get stuck on these
stereotypes of you know we need to we
need to be more supportive of mothers
and we need to be more supportive
part-time work all that stuff is true
yeah I think a good point that I her a
couple of books yourself included
mention a session was the book men and
women are her parents death right and I
really want to sell gender equality in
the workplace does not mean that you
treat parents better exactly and I
thought was really interesting actually
is that Oh for other women in the room
maybe half had half were mothers and
half weren't and as the men in the room
half of fathers and a half one so he you
know by actually addressing each problem
individually then I think even be much
more useful than than saying well
parenting is just a woman's problem I
think that's just it's not helpful well
so I thought it was really great because
I thought everyone was really on board
with that and the thing I really liked
is that everyone in the room really
likes being in RT realized their job and
he's really passionate about it and and
that's the kind of message I want to get
out if we want to attract more people
into the industry we just go out there
and tell everyone how brilliant is yeah
yeah although conference sessions like
they're unusual isn't it a
self-selecting audience but you know if
you're attending a conference then it's
just one small step up to talking and
then being a role model and then writing
blogs and those are the people you want
to get out there talking about how
absolutely
be sure to get more more kids especially
young woman and I tea is very oh yeah
exactly and I think that lots of people
in the room of the job one session were
very keen to go into schools and talk to
to talk to schools so that was the right
sort of audience for that whereas when
you get businesses asking how do we get
more women programmers they're not
prepared to go into schools and teach 14
year olds they really want women who are
you know who 25 and got five years
experience already know is that cool
sorry guy are you going to give that
summer session to that yeah it went
really well so I'm going to give it
again on Thursday here at the 10gen
offices and so there's room for about a
hundred people in that session and its
really supposed to be an interactive
session so we're going to a whiteboard
we're going to do something but do the
same sort of thing and what I hope will
be interesting is if we get different
answers on what's good and what's bad
and ideas on what to do so I think it'll
be really cool to run a few more times
so definitely definitely doing it here
on Thursday and and I'm doing it at
devoxx as well several folks who are
interested in what was the website that
you go if they either go to meetup com
and then type in London java community
that's fine or London java community
credit UK I think we'll take them as
well oh no what if I got something dodgy
amaya on my browser
how they can participate in any cattle
juicy burger London John community dr.
at UK yes exactly they can talk about
there's plenty of time it's on Thursday
right and then there's this problem form
in technical approach but I think this
is what might be better actually if you
go to meetup com there we go and that's
the actual direct link 873 67 117 yeah
this is you've got a limited number of
so yeah so that's my that's my rent for
this week and then yeah running again at
da box as well and doing a few things at
devoxx actually including i'm doing the
opens wide open source your secret
session i did at javaone i'm doing that
at devoxx as well and i'm doing a branch
tiny new talk about agile development oh
so was your what's your angle and it's
going to be really interesting things I
thought so I took a slight holiday and
watch it thought works for three months
last year and one of the interesting
things about that was having worked at
Almack's which started off with a sort
of fairly standard agile type process
and then evolved it over a few years the
difference between what you start with
and what you end up with is quite
interesting so working at thoughtworks I
could really see that because they go
into places and they put in place this
of embryonic this is the prescriptive
way of doing it for now and what they
don't get a chance to see is if you
years down the line wow it volts and get
to see it working and um l max was quite
good at evolving their process in a way
that works well for them and so we
really wanted to tell a story of the
fact that sometimes it's fine to follow
a process especially if you're trying to
move from one very prescriptive process
to another but really you don't have to
get caught up on all the ins and outs of
following specific process and so the
aim is to kind of show the journey of
the agile process there and what why
certain decisions were taken what sorts
of tools you can use so for example
switching from a scrum star way of doing
things to a camp and star way of doing
things and using pair programming or not
and so each of the decisions taken and
then also maybe get a chance to have a
look at as problems that might not have
been solved yet and other things going
forward yeah actually that was my joke
was agile I like know is it's really
cool Erin no I think what when you see
your average agile conference speaker
comment usually they're a high-paid high
power sales consultant yes exactly I'm
Emily does a great presentation and
usually their hearts in the right place
when you're trying to give you blanket
advice which will help you improve in a
general sense yeah but they really can't
see or can't give you advice that's
specific to you TMR video and the people
who work for you if you think about a
lot of practices and things which they
teach they're actually practices which
came out from kind of things which
developers do to be more productive yeah
like you have to ensure favorite of
developments working together which is
just
yeah but then when
loser
you know
that's actually when I was at and go to
Amsterdam because I saw saw a range of
agile presentations some were the ones
you see sort of year in year out of what
is agile why do you do agile how do you
move from waterfall to agile and that I
thought was a coming from an agile
organization that stuff was a bit like
company was still talking about this you
know it seems crazy but then some more
people who had spent a couple years on
the agile journey and then they were
saying and now we've got this problem
and now we don't have to do this so I
thought it'd be quite interesting to do
a use case of one particular agile
journey and say why various decisions
are taken which is not the same as you
know the l max as always this is the
spirit of there's there's no one else
for 22 how do you agile so this is
officer say as advice evaluate your
advice can go up as well as down can you
think of maybe one thing which you found
worked at elements which was radically
different from kind of the standard yeah
agile agile cookbook um oh that's a good
question I'm not sure if I can I could
think of a few different things to talk
about in terms of wealth some stuff
works sometimes it doesn't work
sometimes I don't know that there's
anything particularly radically
different the thing I think I found most
difficult and most rewarding was pairing
every day it's very it's very difficult
it's extremely intense and you know not
having your own computer to work on with
your own environment not having your own
desk not having your own space mavin
your music in is very very challenging
but on the other hand it was it had a
lot of benefits in terms of learning all
the different areas of the code getting
up to speed very quickly at being forced
to actually focus on this and not
check facebook every 15 seconds you know
so I would say that it's not let it be
different but they they were quite
strict on on doing pairing pretty much
every day it has its pros and cons and I
think there's still there are some
organizations that will work for a
summit wine and also you have to hire
knowing that you're going to pair every
day you have to the people that you hire
have to be bought into that they have to
be collaborative they can't be
protectionist and I think that's the
most challenging thing it's not the most
radically different but I used to a lot
of phone interviews and say you know we
pair and people would be like oh you
pair every now and again no repair every
day really do and it's really hard some
people do say it's not for me and that's
fine you know and this is another thing
so one of the other things i really want
to i'm very interested in is is hiring
good quality technical people because
it's extremely difficult and no one
really talks about how hard it is and i
think that one of the key things when
you're hiring is to be honest and to say
we do pair we did try and pair every day
and you know and if it's not for you
that's okay but you know don't don't
we're not gonna try and force you to do
it and that's the things if you that's
one of the controversial things is
perfect which lots of people who told
you know scrumptious ya know exactly a
lot of development practices that is
completely ignore and say oh yeah do
whatever tell what team works for you
and when you're trying to create a
process you can roll out of any company
where are those of size as history that
makes sense but i found that like we had
a big firebird new coach when we first
started with extreme burger i'm taking
it again and we actually we got a
mention in with
bruschetta look fat yeah the textbook
use case for extreme hurry and a lot of
the folks on team didn't go in expecting
and we switched over the company's
methodology for they really got it as
yeah even to this guy that's that's how
they're most productive how they work
but it was much more difficult to get
you know large to change their
development culture that radically I was
are you I'm not sure you should really
because the whole point again this is
one and one of the whole point really is
that you need to build the process to
support your people that you can't
really have your your process whether
it's prescriptive because it works your
team or whatever you can't then bring in
tins from outside and say you've got to
do it this way because if those guys
don't work that way or if they're
straight arm
it's not gonna work so i thought i
thought we'd fly by from potatoes who is
watching stream that apparently healthy
acting on his tweets now you're the
against you guys tweeting foot-pound
night packing i'll show up on our screen
down here but that's all I think those
are sounds not all right I'll see if I
can work on that a couple minutes jump
so before when I thought samples in mind
I was right so he was he was poking
strong yeah um they're not necessarily
mutually exclusive us what I already
you're raised prices doesn't have to be
tied to your relations I think that's
the key thing fortunately we can fix
this I think it's important enough that
people get good audio right now set plus
something interesting physical to show
us on the camera well I saw flowers 30 d
lux
alright so we should be back up on your
agenda theorem still there can you sell
me the audio went back
yeah occasion so there let me know that
fix the audio issue and now we've got a
pretty picture in the background this is
our architectural design discussion yes
what we need is more trees trees and
sunshine sunshine that's good you forgot
the deer eating everything I'm gonna do
what I normally do instead I'm gonna
have a deer I'm gonna have something
else which eats everything which is I'm
having you with us here grocery bus and
then this is a shock oh nice so there's
a new and new species of shark is
yourself live at wedding shoppe hahahaha
what's that was a lot of Ed was it up ok
so we're thinking we're fitting in with
the MongoDB week that's cheap hey so
either a MongoDB we should complete the
picture perfect
alright so we've been chatting about
advil stuff which probably over by huh
but why don't we show some code or
something yes and we could well one of
the things I was fighting with last week
is so I've been working on a
working on a big code base and yesterday
yesterday last week was the first time
in a visa had to create a new project
from scratch which was entertaining and
I learned all sorts of new stuff like
how not to use maven and things so I
don't really know what would show but we
could just show some general Mongo stuff
I guess so the idea of this project was
I've got a few things kicking on my head
and one that was the project I was
working on last week but I don't know if
I'm ready to show that yet but will
steal some of the ideas from that this
this this one was actually inspired by
something you said at the end of the
session with Steven because you were
saying all yantra she goes all these
conferences are like yes yes I did get a
lot of perfect and I thought I've been
thinking for a little while it'd be
quite cool to have an a good conference
app that that manages a lot of your
stuff obviously maybe this isn't going
to go down very well with parlays guys
because obviously they already do
compass stuff but what I was thinking is
I don't know whether you could use it
for if you're trying to organize a
conference or if you'll say an
organization like 10 down which goes to
a lot of conferences but this lends
itself quite nicely to having
mongodb back end because you've got
these are some entities like the
conference itself the talks at the
conference the speakers at the
conference and what I one of the things
I really like to do in real life
actually is have an application where
when you sign up to a conference you
actually get some notified of who else
is going to the conference and
especially said people like friends of
friends on Twitter or stuff like that so
over time you're tying in social
networks with physical conference yeah
and I know that you get some of this
stuff from a bunch of different apps
like yeah lanyard and the ASEAN
conference has got quite good way of
painting people beforehand so delighted
to meet you and that's kind of cool but
social do their own proprietary yeah and
it would be quite nice to have something
which was the reason being that I think
that you see start to see the same sort
of faces at conferences way and it'd be
quite nice to make it so easy access and
I think people like to look and see not
just who's speaking but who's going and
what sort of conferences it and the
people who are attending do they have
gloves they write interesting stuff on
Twitter I'd like to meet that person and
so yeah so that was my idea and I so
I've done absolutely nothing on it so
far just basically write some unit test
this morning with the word conference in
and home yeah passes because he gets to
Gruber I've got I had one here and which
I don't think you showing up now but and
I had one in passes because it's called
should and it does
I hope as as far as I got but what I was
thinking from a mongodb point of view is
doing some sessions last week so I'm
very new to tengen I'm very new to
mongodb I'm very new to no sequel
databases in fact just a plug my own
blog last week I wrote a blog post about
the really basic intro to the different
types different flavors of my sequel
databases the next step one at the
moment is I'm trying to understand about
about schema design in no sequel
databases which sounds kind of weird
because I thought they were scheme
Willis but they're not especially if
it's a document database because you're
kind of you want to be able to to you
want to be able to figure out what your
document looks like and and there are
advantages to design things and
particularly so I thought maybe before
we even write any code or maybe we might
even get as far as writing any code we
could do some white boarding around the
sorts of documents you might have in
this sort of pap the only thing is that
because I've kind of done a very brief
hand-wavy version of what this app is we
don't really have a clear idea of what
our customers are what our requirements
are only thing like that or actually
just kind of brainstorming and
interesting to happen and boiler
customer because we could both go to
conferences that's chain and since we're
the customer we can decide the
requirements that's tracing this word
also developers we can decide the
architecture specification uses
Riverkeeper exactly that any silks
people okay so oh goodness I'm
destroying this already I'm gonna I'm
gonna wipe off my my picture I hope you
captured that the posterity
and actually I do want to take a picture
of this thing for myself so throw them
on the floor that's for them I am as
conference attendees what are we
interested in so would we start with
thinking that we're at night any
speakers right so we're going to start
from the speaker point of view I'm just
writing stuff down as if I know I'm
talking about we probably want to we
definitely got this idea of a conference
object of some form right which is why I
started with conference in my code and I
guess from a so I didn't use the green
one because the green one was rubbish
yeah ok so let me do that in this that's
much better let me check it's not
permanent I just watched elf of course
not home done that yeah I think I pretty
much all whiteboard markers become
permanent after served under years
that's true they kind of evolved into a
permanent thing so now conference is
going to have a name I guess help and
location and it's gonna have so I'm not
as I said I'm kind of need to
longer but it might have a series of
speakers which is like a nested sub
document maybe that's one way of doing
it and then your speaker so this is
effectively a kind of away I don't know
how we know we represent that and so
your speaker could have like he's sort
of name he I'll look at me in all sexist
but yeah so so before you is building
their knowledge you do the drop is going
up good okay like you might want to have
a different so this is yet are you
trying to do it on like a document
structure I was gonna do a document
structure and then break it out
according to which bits we're going to
want to index into go thank you sir all
right so then because I was thinking
that there's probably commonalities
girls in attendance that's true but we
can just multiply speaker okay yeah
that's triggers are those who speak so
speakers have names and a speaker and I
don't know a name a title or whatever
the whole point about the the document
database is is that you could have a
bunch of stuff in here not necessarily
fill them all in so actually that's a
good point so if it is a superset you
might have a name and job title i was
thinking then and you might have twitter
handle company yes and right so there's
a number of things that they could have
and the good thing about something like
Mongo is that rather than having a
column in a relational database for
every one of these you just fill one of
these in if you've got it and if you
don't have it you know fill it in and
that's fine which I like that's quite
nice and then you've got a bunch of
those guys and they also presumably can
have a series of talks which can be
whatever and you can if you want to you
could just have because everything's
based around this one conference you
could just have one document which has
got all of this as a nested thing but
that's not particularly
for really because presumably you will
if you're a speaker you might just want
to see just your talk so you want to get
straight into this for here which again
yeah yeah and also something else is you
might have multiple speakers on top yeah
that's true too and so then what do you
do do you break out the talks into its
own thing and then have this because you
can link to things so you could link to
individual talks okay so me like the
other severe relationship or speakers
have multiple songs sometimes yeah and
toss have multiple right here sometimes
but the typical case is one speaker 1
talk yeah probably usually and it
depends this very much depends on on
your access into the data so for example
if you're if you're printing our
timetable then you you might structure
this completely differently so you might
have you know the day at the time and
it's got a series at times like one
o'clock two o'clock whatever and then
the talks under each of those times
because that's that's the way that you
want to access that data oh I'm good
talking about something i don't know if
i'm not very well right now yeah so i
think i think that you know whatever you
you hit a dead end of your architecture
discussion need to take a breather and
walk around the office okay let's do
that
the good thing is I didn't even really
woman sorry this is the tangent office
there's actually people here in the
office
we're being filmed run away so yes this
is the London office the New York office
is a lot bigger as the last office I'm
going to warn the guys that they're
being filmed watch out guys look busy
you're being filmed for the Internet
you're being filmed for the internet so
leave all the confidential stuff up Emma
screams I get a good picture hey cap
 with austerity and and yet these
are all guys actually doing work which
is cool see ya I mean they asked me if I
wish to mark I said yes I believe that's
the default as anybody there's a one of
the driveway I think you're you're the
winner for stickers yeah it's a very
impressive story function yeah I have
managed to always remember to get
stickers every country I got you look
usually because by the time I get to the
airport my sticker taillight 28 so you
could you could probably compete with
that happens you know better that one
smells really little bit 10 money Isis
laptop is equally as almost all stories
into this house is locked up zombie a
year old so i swapped it out last
December of the other one
cover as well but that's basically our
strategy is you keep filling up with
cigarettes much both snicker I problem
no I just got three months of traveling
with a 13-inch laptop I realized I
needed something smaller and demand
tory well cool and yes this is my desk
which is why there's nothing else and
yeah there is a there is one of our guys
there if it doesn't use a Mac but I was
anyone else most of our people as in
your summer people yeah any news on that
stick to emulating most people running
in my case I work should i worry about
it has unix prompt in africa and that's
getting up don't worry and i raving
about to your generation yeah it's not
necessarily great for running
presentations whatever wiles here's
working power and authority think you
know you guys travel yeah so we've even
got what was the stickies on with the
what's going on and a good agile way
it's not my board varnish yeah i guess i
guess it's kind of but it's more like a
Trello but hardcore I mean in the in the
flesh
so yes what else ok show the water
cooler yeah this is the water cooler
with our connection with our other
offices in New York and California and
where no one is there if I sit here will
anyone come no everyone's just avoiding
the water cooler and New York so if we
want to do remote night hacking session
we could just come here yeah I could
point the camera at the monitor and away
again there's never anyone there ya know
New York you can't reach the the office
currently oh of course there's ever
hurricane going on in New York at the
moment so yeah usually New York's the
busiest busiest office to look at right
right it's usually because it's right in
the kitchen and people are just going
past there all the time yeah there's a
lot of people that but yeah I think
everyone staying at home quite sensibly
and we've got the kitchen with a shiny
coffee machine which is an absolutely
essential for a tech company and um and
our cupboard full of manga
you
this question
you
but
there's also a bottle opener that's the
best thing I've ever seen a bottle
opener for deer and then there's a big
open space in here sitting on the
counter bar yeah exactly and this is our
community space so this is where we're
going to be tonight and where my session
is going to be yeah so for folks who
want to hang out afterwards this is
where I love the job London job and I
live session yeah and these doors are
made of metal because apparently this
used to be some sort of print money
making my storage facility isn't a
visitor yeah that's just kind of
interesting that's the fishbowl I short
tall
all that inspiration I've completely
forgot what we were talking about so I
guess this I guess there's another way
of thinking about things like the more
traditional way is trying to figure out
what your entities them right so you're
going to have conference conferences
we're gonna have talks you're going to
have speakers you're going to have
attendees at ten now you have an N in
attendees at ten days all right so I got
a good idea for our program okay how
about we create a MongoDB which can
store conferences okay easy very easy
let's stop that I'm trying to kill
myself on these wires
oh not for me i'm incredibly fancy
all right here right now okay so what
I'm going to start with because then we
can actually demonstrate some of munger
stuff I've actually got am I'm already
the instance running on here in here so
i can write an integration test which is
going to create as a a MongoDB database
for our conferences
I don't gonna call yet I'm not doing
very good test driven because I don't
really not doing it tues great database
or conferences so we'll start with
creating a new conference repository
Satori right and so that's going to go
into the main code and then we're going
to so what I want to do actually that's
not the name I want I want to make sure
what I want to do is I want to be able
to create the or get access to the
conference repository and then I don't
want to I don't like to fall over when I
try and query it for start maybe doing
test-driven is bit misleading in this
case anyway was he out guys and actually
might cheat because I might look at the
project i was doing last week to see
what i did look at that and say man copy
right so actually that's right I was
doing an integration
and so I'm actually again I'm not going
to call it anything like that because I
don't we know what that's doing you
should do something it out there were
rowing yet so let's say that we have our
I you know what I need to do i need to
add Mongo into my Gradle build file so
Gradle I was looking last week I was
going to use maven last week because I
he's moving before and I thought it was
going to easy and the IDE supports it
and I'll Blanc it in there all I want is
the dependency management and then when
I figured out I couldn't use Java 1.7
with the version of mainland that I had
and I couldn't work out how to get the
version of moment I wanted just to get
the right dependencies I pulled it all
out and started again with was greater
so that was and that was one day's worth
of learning experience yeah actually I
think if there's this one thing and
Russell miles into someone about sunday
but if there's one day if people can try
this new technology Radel is a great
alternative to using hands and they've
been regardless of whether you're
building a movie
right so this is all I want this to be
just a job a project right but with them
with Gradle this is my build problem
it's got almost nothing in it I'm doing
java an idea I want it to be climbing at
one point seven because really not
enough people using one put seven yet
and it's kind of cool and and then I
just wanted to manage my dependencies so
i'm using j unit I've just it I've just
decided to use Mongo and that's all I
need and hopefully and with IntelliJ if
you've got jet jet cradle which I think
will just import all that stuff for me
and it's doing something yes and then it
brings it down with me and then that's
it that's all I need to do and it didn't
download you to our internet exactly and
the thing I really found it's really
tiny things which pleased me about it
which was when I just did so Friday
Gradle build that should just work o or
not because I it's not compiling and
which is fine hopefully they shouldn't
know oh come on
don't want to import it for me tell you
never do live coding worst thing in the
world for presentations when you're
sweating in front of a hot way and
thousand people maybe 20 or 30 wish to
hurry i see the doors yeah yeah try
there's a lot of stream you can't see
all people i SAT industry yeah that's
cool that's fine they can go to
disappear and I've just been saying how
amazing mumbo is and now it's not why I
today and my mother and great on but if
I do that yo girl not found in rig no
that's got some other right place
foolish person it's definitely not going
to work
because that does everything that wants
to do what I found really cool about
this which is just the tiniest thing but
without having to put anything in my
grade or script about where my test
territories were or anything I ran them
phrasal test in my other project and and
it just worked and it just ran all my
tests and then I thought well that can't
be right it's probably not running
anything so i made my test failure and
it just worked and so all the other
targets that you expect to be there we
just don't know if this might go away
now as you've been successful that's
what I was hoping for just just try well
you know the importance know exactly so
I'm just kind of going I'm going to
steal them from over here which is all
this so i'm also i'm just using the
really basic java driver for Mongo
instead of using any of you is it
supposed to be an actor yeah that would
look here see external libraries doesn't
increase or estimated I know which is
why thought I would rerun developes so
we mustn't be working so trying to
command line I try compiling a McMillan
and see if Gradle
but at the building it worked well
you've added Mamadou
okay and to wonder bar one of our
buddies on the string see Corey belief
put her hands are really hard to read
said to restart intelligent let's try
that okay bc the build worked so it's
just an intelligence of intelligence
picking out the great intellij is being
stupid J I think I think so do we this
is the whole point of streams to pick on
IDEs we are a chance to to pick on that
BS and gear Chad responded to in
brussels on that parently all my fault
oh right but this time we're taking on
the IntelliJ sweets give equal unfair
treat to oly IDs yeah i mean i'm a big
fan of IntelliJ but sometimes I'm with
any idea some types of your moment
saying yes go away well it's not gray
anyone it's red oh that's much better I
knew I should've done something else for
this and how old there we go how about
for dinner that's what I needed to do
wow I just
that there is greater support and
IntelliJ but it's not quite as intuitive
as I've had to hack some of the the
initialization fast let's go where I
want to go so it's entirely possible
that it's me with that of you it's less
unhappy okay so here we go that's great
one of those and this is not gonna be
this is scummy we're going to call a
database called conference and it's cool
it well we want to call the whole
database because the collection will
probably be conference will call is the
social conference special conference
something
I'm not going to do that just yet oh no
that's not what I want to see
exception great news I don't know that
it does look sad we don't want one of
those yet because we haven't done that
yet so let's see what happens when we
run that
well it didn't error very first hey you
are excellent red green roof ad said
with a lot by the red bit but green me i
justit's a shocker record that's true so
if I have one of these repository
thingies now the reason I put this in my
integration test is because I wanted to
poke stuff into the database rather than
say I can t remember was doing last week
I wanted to poke stuff manually into the
database in the integration tests so
that I could query it using the
repository so I guess what we want to do
is we want to say this is where everyone
gets to see that I don't know how to do
stuff insert and then any DB object
basic DB object and then I can put in
something here like I'm going to put in
the name I'm going to call it dogs and
then that should just insert that into
my conference once when I run that so
Jenna's having fun laughs best so so Jim
even though you may be picking on my
dance now at least i'm not using like
three letter yeah i hate you touching it
co for you see like every variables kept
like to hundreds of three letters and
your china ty sir ty cipher is that
first letter yes exactly I I was just
looking through some of the Sun code
some old Java code the other day and
yeah it does that it doesn't miss a few
keystrokes anymore because know exactly
you could type so i could type that and
that's it let's just take this just as
short as if you were right and if you've
got loads of three lesser ones and your
autocommit also
the pressure can't help you so if I want
to do that so I'm inserted something in
there call that so if I want to if I do
find can I do let's find out how many
can i do sighs on that count how we go
do that so let's find out how many how
many conferences called devoxx I've
created because I think there should be
I've run it several times now so I think
was going more than 13 30 boxes ten
boxes so this this looks like a very
data-dependent test yes so if because
we're actually testing against a real
Mongo instance we're not doing this
isn't a real so so let's let's do this
first was assert that the count is 1
okay we fulfill yes we'll get a report
so let's do that instead let's do you
want to set the count
well we're gonna be anal and just doing
one second one is for that's fun and
let's stick a pretty testing which will
but we always talk with objects let's do
that so am i set up first I'm gonna need
my connection is set up now
and so I think if I I could drop the
whole collection for the time being I
think which would actually create it and
then drop it no don't think it'll make
it pass come here alright so we have OCD
I city is good i like my city so here is
you'll be creating a new we have a
single collection which is all of our
conferences and then we insert which we
empty at the beginning and then we
insert our brand new deluxe collection
deluxe conference into it there today ok
so what you can I guess hey candy let's
do a conference today that were together
so we did that we've got a sinister
photographers name so this is now our
this is our deluxe and that's why we
insert it so now we want to see we want
to do that that's cool to find out right
now that's at the moment that's finding
all of them so that's fine we're going
to make sure there's only one in there
maybe do the same test but find all the
cards
I mean a new test thingy let's do that
let's get rid of all this stuff because
we're not doing it so we're going to
call this
I know it's not really a particularly
great example so should I give them so
this is our this is our expected one
we're going to insert it first this is
our kind of given and we don't want that
anymore we want to do let's get rid of
that conference collection fine but this
time we want to find and we actually
want the way the mongo driver works at
this level is you pass it the database
objects you want to look for so this is
this looks like an old test because
basically I'm inserting it and I'm
trying to find it but we can make it
more complex later so this is the fans
like a criterion query right so I could
just put whichever pairs i want to put
in there the name and the date and or
whatever yeah yeah exactly which at the
moment because we've only got a name
it's actually the same thing as the
actual thing so we're going to find all
conferences which match this name I
should call this well whatever and
that's going to turn me at cursor so I
think there we go so I can it's right
over those now just reserve the names
though
object get I said that name is now what
well oh yeah this is one of the slightly
irritating things about working with the
raw data objects is that you have to
cast them and so I think what you'd
probably want to do is you want to all
of this kind of the mapping between the
the raw database objects and me Malcolm
entering the order to our subjects in
your domain object would be all
obstructed away somewhere else which is
something i was looking at stumbled
across it last week a couple of guys on
Twitter pointed me at a hexagonal
architecture we heard of this I was
quite impressed with it it's it kind of
its as good way of thinking about stuff
so that you've got your core domain in
the middle and then you've got a series
of ports and translators at the edges so
it can turn it into JSON or XML or it
can turn it into your data is shaped
object or it can turn it into whatever
it can map it to a different type of
domain object to talk to a different
part of your of your application and I
thought that was quite a nice way of
keeping your domain or nice and clean
and all well i think i think my idea was
and you know I'm could be talking
rubbish here because i spent about 10
minutes looking into it but the idea is
that this is kind of like your your
database translator and this is like
you're one of my thinking of like if
you've got i'm going to call that rest
let's go turn it into your restful layer
and this might be your admin UI and this
might be your UI so it's not about yeah
that's kind of the idea
and then then nice and neat inside here
is your core domain and that I thought
that was quite good actually because I
was really struggling over how to
translate my core domain objects so in
the case of this thing we were talking
about conference object I was thinking I
was wondering how best I want to turn
that into JSON because I want to use
that's one of the format's I wanted to
use and but i also want to turn it into
one of these TV objects and I thought
this is quite a nice way of having
adapters between the two different types
of formats instead of having on my
conference object to JSON object or to
DV objects and having actual translators
might make that a bit cleaner but then
the other problem I found with that is
then you need to be able to inspect your
domain object for everything that's in
it so that you can translate it from one
to another so i guess there are trailers
around that but yeah so i'm usually we
have from austria brush yes do you know
I thank you he's from the shinai user
her oh yes use the new the most active
he's very good he likes keyless easy
beef which should say I'm from how I
behavior personally yes and those are
those are quite nice for avoiding long
test names like this because it actually
gives you a whatever certain behaviors
I'm kind of torn on behavior driven
development frameworks I haven't used I
haven't been haven't worked with someone
who knows how to use one really really
well so a lot of the stuff that I've
done has been before they were decent
frameworks so you end up doing loads of
stuff enjoy unit and then you end up
with stuff like this and I would love to
be educated in how to use those things
properly but I sometimes wonder if if
some of them a bit magic and do too much
under the covers I don't know I don't
might just music myself cuz
a range of things which are considered
behavior driven development frameworks
but I mean the fundamental nature
they're kind of just like Jane but a
little more yeah yeah I think against
the funky like robot pipeline ages which
convert human most effective your test
yeah that's where it gets a little bit
funky because what you're trying to do
is you're trying to write tests which
our na a language which is more familiar
to non-programmers where I think for
most successful develop projects I've
seen in the program perspective rather
than you taking people who don't first
in purnia pushing it yeah bergen rosendo
taking a more of the scope of
understanding the requirements and it's
being else to such as testing and doing
the whole yeah so i totally buy that i
think i think that i think that as
programmers our job is not to understand
the technology yes we are going to be
the people who do understand the
technology but our job is it's
translating from the business
requirements to the technology which
means that you need to understand the
requirements which means you need to be
able to write acceptance tests up front
before you write the code and then you
need to be able to do testing afterwards
as well so yeah I kind of I by the core
developers not just sitting in rooms
writing code but really expanding to
touch all those areas to a point where
you can talk to a business owner knows
nothing about technology I think that's
our skill as developers we shouldn't
expect business people to be skilled in
after tour technology I think we should
expect technology people to be skilled
enough to talk business so yeah I mean
you are getting good so do so no muscles
talking about spot which is it oh yeah
the MS guys are using Spock they're
quite they're quite happy with Spock
actually and I haven't used it but I
heard good things about it yeah so
there's lots of good
so we're going to try them all out right
now you're not going to be for the next
session my mind future night packing
those can think about trying to hurt us
forever so if someone wants to come in
and teach me how to use something else
that's fine i'm so i'm so lazy because I
I do so much stuff on you know dude so
much stuff in the day job and then stuff
doing toggle into conferences and bits
and pieces like that i'm not going to go
and find fifteen thousand different
etiologies try them all out see which
one other point is you you don't pay
attention and you people you trust are
you this is really exactly just like we
talked to use cradle yeah exactly people
who just tell you that there's a better
technology source and and then you try
it exactly so I'm much happy for someone
to come and say try this okay I'll try
that when I when I've got a business
reason to try it alright so i would
consider that first round it has
successful form of our article but we
want to get conferences Thank You Davis
and other conferences and they've even
have names and that was even well part
of this is Sharon that so I i would
consider those successful having such we
keep going on but it's fine I are kind
of one of the things that one of the
things I just struggled with last week
was really getting up and running with
stuff like Bridal and starting to work
with with a mongo driver so this is this
is basically encapsulating my learning
from last week which is good cool so you
might will you mind bringing up
John here sideshow box when I snuggle
better sure let's stay that Holly which
earlier that's right that's uh Neil
thing that you broke all right so I'm
actually physically setting out a
journey across your arm this is oh no no
no now we've got this kind of weird
thing where where yeah we go yes it is
part of sofas good all right so actually
physically got my jacket here and I'm
going to be talking about her cycle I go
to jail all tomorrow conferences on
wednesday and i got a little for those
of you go to the night hacking dude guy
i was actually one of the original james
gosling 3d models o meanie so he's in a
lot of the 3d artwork or do all the all
the sun java news from pretty much
console it's cold so i borrowed that I
kind of burger on the jacket and i'll be
writing my BMW 1200 RT which i rented so
all set some pictures of those
interested you had a few tweets sent you
saying what are you writing i want to
sit now here's the the schedule of
upcoming of us out of here the next one
is the ljc which is at 7pm which is
adjustable otters does that also be here
and we'll be happy with some of the
members and then nothing tomorrow but
then on Wednesday I have a whole series
of dayquil talk cyril spot in the
pavilion there and i'm just going to
stream and interview each other boats
pretty much the whole day come so check
that out and you know join us for
additional land concessions and thank
you very much tricia gburg thank you
have fun being our fifth night hacker oh
I have to present you to move here oh
cool I got pesto you get a limited
edition like that game 5 i'm sticker
listen I can't hold it up for that and
thank you very much for tuning in
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
