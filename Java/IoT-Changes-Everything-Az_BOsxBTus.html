here at the TDC conference in san paulo
brazil i'm a middleware pre-sales
consultant I work for Oracle in San
Paolo and we are here with event if
Vanguard deal even please introduce
yourself hello morning everyone my name
is Ivan guardino i'm working on Oracle
technology team in Brazil in Sao Paulo
to and we are here today to show you
some IOT stuffs and co-stars true so our
topic today is IOT Internet of Things
could you please explain to us we have
heard a lot about IOT lately what is IOT
exactly I hope to have many many
perspectives for our whole perspective
IOT is everything there is connected
connected with what internet at all so
if I have some some hardware some some
kind of sensor that we can connect these
two internet and send some data this is
ihe for oracle perspective so looking
this kind of technology oracle is
delivering a complete solution based on
IOT platform to collect this data and to
analyze this data in real time so here
we have some kind of prototype beauty on
has berry pie using groove by and with
some sensors so here we are showing you
on livestream how this works and how
oracle can collect and turn translate
this data to other device such as much
phone mobile phone okay so that
prototype seems very very interesting
how hard it is to implement such a thing
like only a electrical engineer can do
it no GD is a quite simple at all this
is a odd has berry pie to device we are
using your groove pine
hardware and we are connecting using
four kinds of sensors this is the
distance sensor light and is no this is
a human attend temperature sensor we
have also sound sensor and light sensor
the sensor are are connected using
digital and analog departs on our
hospira group i and also we are using a
portable battery for for joining jeez so
this is part of a smart freezer
prototype we put this inside as a fridge
a refrigerator to collect this data to
know if the door is open to know if the
refrigerator is 40 mg to know if the
sound of the the cooler it's ok or not
so all this data is signing using Wi-Fi
connection I build some wireless network
use my 4g cell phone here ends data is
sent to oracle plataforma as you can see
on my desktop this data we can analyze
these messages these messages are
signing every time about eight or ten
seconds so as you can see we have it all
here the temperature we have distance
sound humidity luminosity to this is a
json format so i wrote some java code
inside here and this ecology collect all
this data using python script so Java
calls a Python script for collecting
this data and send the oldest data to
our product farm once on our platform we
can manage these data using just all the
platform we don't need to write some
code for doing this weekend man we can
analyze this data we can integrate this
data in the the easiest way here in your
prototype
this data we are saying it to our mobile
cloud service platform so it's a native
integration on iot cloud service
platform to MCS platform as you can see
we just need a rest endpoint some
credentials for security and we send
this dream in my cell phone I have a a
mobile app that I can consult all this
data that are sending from our ass
verify device so whatever is the harder
on the edge or cocaine handles the data
Oracle can use this data for correlate
the environments correlate the
information to know what's happened on
real time so after all even send
information to a mobile application to
enterprise application we can also
create some explorations here and these
inspirations we can take this data
analyzed in real time and create some
alerts using sequel language continuous
query language so it is native on our
platform shoe as you can see i will edit
an exploration and you see all the data
coming from our device and we can filter
this here so that's very interesting
that's a prototype with real-world
application in fact it was it was made
for a customer for a food company here
in Brazil right so you as a middleware
consultant you are in contact with a lot
of companies I think that every company
likes the idea of connecting devices on
the internet measuring real data and but
what the companies are usually afraid of
when they think of yeah why not start
IOT project right now I think the more
the more thing they the companies are
afraid this for security yes because we
have a lot of connected devices saying
this some data and how can can we guard
where entities data are coming from the
right device on the right time it's not
suffering attacks so this is the concern
of agriculture in the in our platform we
work with metallurgy called secure
device using off of Education token and
jks just a wallet key store for the
first communication so we use the search
k diarrhea installed on the hardware
device on the edge this device this the
search page for this device used to
generate wealth of education so using
this we can guarantee that the data is
saying if for this device to this device
and this is the bi-directional way for
sending receiving data so on major
companies we are trying to change it is
mind such about the secure our platform
can collect this data security no
problem and we can as we cannot have how
can i say i specifically harder device
on the edge all all of kind of companies
can use whatever is harder is an orca
can provide a platform for collecting
this data and analyzing this data in
real time all of these in our cloud
platform so we don't need to have to
have a hardware installed on on your
base you can use these as a service so
you can share and you can take this
information as you need you don't need
you to bring it into at home and try to
filter it you can do it on cloud using
our platform
okay I think when many companies think
of article they think of a of a company
who usually serves enterprise customers
big big companies they think of oracle
database and then when they hear IOT and
nautical I think maybe they can wonder
whether orrico is really committed to
this IOT movement can can you talk a
little bit about oracle strategy for
this area yes sir arco is more than
database as you know so our who is
moving to cloud all the platforms
including io TI cheese and your platform
is on the market since in January so
Oracle is doing a huge investment on
this bus for not just IOT platform IOT
is one of most platforms there are who
can provide for our customers and our co
is the only company in the market that
has a solution in change we don't need
another third-party solution for
delivering innovation to our company we
have integration platform on clothes we
have a process platform we have a
database we have infrastructure as
platform and serves so we have it since
day operational system the database and
chill the softer as right now and some
and among others software running on a
cloud or go can offer the complete
solution even on primacy and now we we
are moving oho to cloud so the darker is
investing a lot of money to to make is
real rhe is one of them great if i want
to start using right now oracle iot
cloud service how will all be charged
like on a monthly basis depending on
what i use how does it work there's no
charge this is a prepaid service so you
can you can buy some creds and use as
you need if you don't don't use don't
need to use the iot cloud service
Bufferin Martin don't have to pay a
penny for this so there is no contract
is just a serve see you pay per use just
simple as that right and one final
question can you comment a little bit
about how oracle is position among the
main competitors in this area we have a
lot of competitors in marriage some
competitors are special it's on some
kind of solution but none of them they
had they they deliver whole solution the
complete solution and we have
competitors for LG they're using
specifically IOT but they don't have the
integrated platform so they collect the
data and they send it to all to you do
the hard work in your house or in your
in your company and your condo or co-op
side of it can deliver the complete
solution so we have competitor in all
verticals all the solutions but none of
them has the complete solution eyes or
who have ok so I think this was a great
overview of Internet of Things and how
you can start using it and implementing
it and generating value and innovation
in your company thank you very much even
ok thank you for for the audience and in
please follow us on the Twitter and
keeping contact she asked for questions
and for demos we are here to to support
all of you thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
