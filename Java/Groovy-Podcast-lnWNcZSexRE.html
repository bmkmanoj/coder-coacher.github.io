evening and welcome once again to the
groovy podcast sort of we're actually
being hosted here at dev Nexus in
Atlanta and and thank you for not
hugging interviews don't by the way keep
in mind the the camera adds ten pounds
and there's at least three cameras on me
right now so so yeah and you multiply by
each and every comment yeah exactly
all right yep should we get back to the
business because they need the stage
fairly soon they will kick us some leads
that let them try it we are extremely
fortunate we'll get back to the coffee
maker over here a little bit we are
extremely fortunate to have lucked into
having on that I saw meter a our good
friend being a person at the conference
making presentations everything was
foolishly walking down the hallway right
when we needed somebody yeah exactly
yeah is gonna walk through the whole
podcast is exactly how it works yes
right it's all a port to me steep it's
it's if something got recorded it's just
a matter of luck yes Andre saw me write
for those who don't know is a an
incredible Java champion the head of the
Griffin project that's correct
what else should we add in on that
groovy champion what's groovy chick I'm
official title yeah co-founder of the
haka gotten right co-founder of hacker
garden many people have attended that
it's wonderful to go currently now also
member of the JCP Executive Committee
remember that election that's right you
got elected signature on my hand and I
will never the game you have so
many more meetings to go to now right I
mean you go over just to go to meetings
yes now now had to go to meetings Wow
also of course you're the biggest claim
to fame is that you are very friendly
with a shell Ruiz who is also a Java
champion yes she was nominated mo
champion last November as well right I
understand so you think that the only
reason we know undress is because of her
I think he's just a little off when
she's not around that's all I mean I
think he's a good guy but you know it
gets dicey what I'm saying it's no we'll
we'll deal with what we have because
that's what we do on the groovy podcast
they
so what is the definition of groovy
podcast we do is that's right so what
are you speaking on at the conference
well my talk has happen in tomorrow
Friday it's actually title the open
source revolution and the D is to
showcase why open source is important a
little bit of history how open source
came to be and how we can make the most
of open source just a regular developer
or also as an organization excellent
any you speak about I guess about
Griffin is an example of an open source
project I would love to but the thing is
that we are in a Java conference and
sometimes when you talk about dynamic
languages people just run away to the
hills I mean you ask them what you are
allowed to speak about no but I don't
want people to believe in the room and
it is up because groobees great it's
just just come on well are you gonna
talk about Java in the context of open
source and how could that and also oh
all right you know what let's talk about
the conference that is not shy to speak
about groovy are you going to write back
on yes yes yeah yeah that's great come
to Copenhagen that's the European
version and it's opposed to the US one
in Minneapolis in July you know so what
happened last year a guru bees emo
became the official mascot of Great Khan
absolutely yes no I didn't see the
announcement there was an official
nomination only when you who grew me see
more easy serious guy I guess we'll
never know exactly and in order to know
you have to go to great confidence you
have to go to Copenhagen take a set of
steel available it's a good plug we
didn't see it coming
okay we should explain this silliness
shouldn't we it's not a silliness it's
yeah yeah so I'm switching gears I'm an
official chief cappuccino officer now
and an espresso advocated a frog and you
know what coffee is great because it has
a broad audience like everybody loves it
it's very easy to explain
everybody needs it it boosts developer's
productivity it's basically like
everything else we do enjoy frog so I
mean why not it's a natural extension of
our product line well that certainly
explains the the smock here but it
doesn't really explain the Hat nothing
ever explains that hat Oh trust me I
have a very good reason the amount of
people that come to me and say yeah I
know you increase dramatically since I
have never had but I try to go with my
good looks and my niceness for many
years and I had to but there's a
difficult which making the famous and
infamous you know I mean you sure you
want to be from what I know from what I
know there is no such thing as bad PR as
long as people talk about me I'm good
you know the only people ever say that
are the ones with bad PR yes no it'll be
me yep yep I'm actually doing a talk
today on Gradle so we do have at least
something will be related sort of going
on oh hi Bob Kirkland I well there was a
Kotlin talk earlier I'm not doing
anything Colin I'm not gonna be talking
about the Colin DSL yeah that's coming
but that is coming by the way it's not
100 yet but they have a path to one oh
but Gradle did announce 4.6 release
candidate to a few days ago yesterday
was it yeah yeah and so the actual 4.6
will be out say within a week something
like I I have a question for you guys
not not trying to mock or or you know
being mean to anyone but did you hear so
that they're very close to one always
with Scotland yourself yes there and did
you and a lot of people tried right and
did you hear any good like success
stories we tried the Kotlin DSL and it's
good or as good or provides on the pro
means or or anything like that no not
yet but it's also because I have I've
been not looking for those those things
I personally have tried it for very
simple trivial projects it is the DSL
that you use is quite similar to groovy
there's almost no difference whatsoever
except that you get the type safety and
code completion and to support the
moment that you need to do more than
that is where it breaks down
and you have to write so much code in
order to please the compiler that I
don't see the point of writing double
the amount in order to get the same
thing that you could do you could do
with groovy the problem is you need to
know ahead of time what you need to do
yeah so that's that's more or less the
feedback that I heard from people to
tried it and they're like okay that
copy-paste from getting started works
everything beyond that it's it's a
hellish nightmare yes and and even the
thing that should work like the code
completion and the tuning support
actually breaks first let's let's say
this way if you want to go down that
route is probably you will get better
support views playing SBT then code mean
DSL and that wasn't complement every
time you bring SBT it cannot be
converted anyway there's still not even
version one yet so I mean okay yeah it's
not ready for primetime correct yeah but
they're improving it may change when one
oh comes out I mean I understand there
and besides the people who are likely
the most likely to adopt it are going to
be the Android people because they're
already trying to use Kotlin throughout
the rest of their system so I expect the
adoption such as it will be if there is
any it's going to start in the Android
community and then Gradle will have to
respond very quickly to their concerns
and and eventually that will filter to
the rest of the an interesting side
effect is is that in able to support
code link plugins and a cotton DSL a
huge part of the core API and other
plugins have to be thought again so that
they can be rewritten in Java or have
much cleaner api's so in any case we
still win
everybody wins we'll have much better de
pais so that yes all that extra work we
will benefit from it's exciting the end
that's why I still would use groovy but
anyway yeah unless I'm dealing support
and any anything new about the releases
reform groove well there's a griffon
release coming up first of March will
release every three months so the next
release is next week what are you up to
now version number 214 2.14 2.14 yes
okay and now is there any feature or
anything you want to mention
coming or it's something that's come out
recently we have not had a lot of
discussions about Griffin on the on the
podcast not because we don't like it so
that's why you're here man yeah it could
be tens of people correct the record so
actually in the latest releases most of
the stuff that we have done is make sure
that we have better support for JavaFX
explicitly providing additional API is
for dealing with bindings or creating
new components but the core has already
stabilized itself now we're thinking
that this might be the latest release in
the 2x series because we're already
thinking about creating 3x which of
course being true to semantic versioning
will signify there might be some binary
incompatibilities and there is
definitely one clear incompatibility
coming forward I am also a speculative
jsr 3 7 7 the specification for writing
desktop applications
oh and the API it's pretty much done but
the specification documents still in the
works but once we finish this my goal is
to have Griffin be the reference
implementation for this jeiza
is it the same desktop applications
framework that's been in working for
like the swing application framework 296
yeah 83 77 is based on the same ideas
but it but 296 target only the swing
toolkit three seven seven targets pretty
much every toolkit and and is there so
we've been waiting for this application
desktop application toolkit for like
what since Java one existed like for 22
years now is there any reasonable
deadline that we will eventually have
something yes we will plan to be
finished by this year Wow
before the end of the year we want to
finish I should have we been late and
that is my fault I plan to be released
two years ago we didn't make it for four
reasons but it's my goal to have it
finished this year as early as possible
but seriously Griffin's gonna wind up
being the reference implementation for a
jsr spec that is the diary's
that would be awesome that would be very
impressive and not I mean it the the
desktop Java community then I'm using
that term to encompass everybody is I
mean the alternative languages as well
that is a small but very vocal community
as you know they do not like to be
overlooked so that doesn't thing I
cannot actually tell for sure if it's a
small or not the thing is especially
when I'm living in Switzerland and
Germany Austria you find a lot of
organizations writing desktop
applications whether it's displaying
Java fix or swing or they go with the
big platforms arts NetBeans RCP or
Eclipse RCP they are much into desktop
development the problem is they don't
speak about that right now here in the
US and in Canada and in Latin America
there are also companies are people
building these kind of applications but
we are not aware of them because they
are not talking about those things and
conferences or events or just making a
press release fascinating now it is more
often than not that you're going to find
people talking about mobile apps
what is Android OS covering as we just
did a web apps any kind of thing and if
your desktop it will probably be
electron no js' and this kind of
electron is is is a web application turn
out as how that's a desktop and it's
actually not nice but the thing is I'll
give you some hard time here but the
thing is it's actually a an advantage
that it's a web application that desktop
because it brings the army of web
developers to write desktop applications
without any barrier they did yes you Tom
there right all this kind of stuff they
use the technologies they they know and
like I don't know how you like the
JavaScript and boom you have a desktop
application no well you have is
something right not a decibel
application that is the same thing as
saying an infinite amount of monkeys
typing an infinite amount of typewriters
will eventually write the words of
Shakespeare
so an army of web developers will they
write a test of application I've gotta
go in there by the way there's a Twitter
joke I saw a million monkeys on a
million typewriters will eventually type
a Java program
and the rest will be Perl programs you
didn't hear that one okay anyway sorry
to interrupt and that JavaScript program
of course eventually well again I don't
want to anger but I see your point it's
possible to write something that behaves
like a decibel application if you don't
require file access or a specific device
access then this kind of platform would
work yes you know it gives you what I
hang to market
I'll keep yes but I'll keep giving you a
hard time so I use out of out of our
electron application time aware of that
are installed on my computer I use atom
it has local access it works with files
on local system it looks like a desktop
application and you know what if I
wasn't in the technology business if I
only would do coffee hey I wouldn't know
that it's all generally wouldn't care
its handling and I wouldn't care that
it's all sticking sheets until you start
to see the the CPU usage and the memory
usage right if then actually it's a as
against the word that you're doing then
you will care about it underlying
technology but you know what Java
developers are not the ones to complain
about CPU and memory usage but it's all
that they use if we need to if we need
to start up a JVM for a text editor we
are the last people to complain about JV
about memory and antabuse
so I don't know how you win this
argument but really this in well they
make an outstanding product and people
will use it right exactly and and and we
want Griffin to be and one of the
options you know for people to have to
be able to create this kind of something
process whether they want to use it with
just plain Java and of course using Ruby
as the programming language do have one
other uncomfortable question related to
that though you're ever gonna update
Griffin in action for the current system
I thought you were going to ask if
Griffin a little support coupling it
already does vary by codes to everywhere
all the way down so all right what's the
documentation story then on Griffin oh
it's much much better than they pass we
have a big guide
that uses asciidoc asciidoc is my
favorite is my favorite format so we can
embed the real production code and test
sources into the documentation so we can
have up-to-date snippets of code and and
grad information from all around our
code base and generate a really nice
documentation we also have tutorials and
a list of plugins and so many things
that that if you go to Griffin - frame
gorg you see plenty of information okay
so it's Griffin - framework and just for
those who are not aware it's Griffin
with an oh right Grif Fon mm oh and
double Fon - framework it's not like
Peter we're Louis or Stewie it's Griffin
with an oh yes that's where all the
information is anything else you want to
mention about either the jsr situation
or the Griffin framework or anything
else related just in case that is
somebody that is listening or is
watching us it really cares five people
yes the other two are outside the camera
of course yes if you care about desktop
development just reach out on Twitter or
go to the website on or reach out to us
and and we will make sure that if you
have any questions you have any doubts
how do you get started or if you want to
contribute you just do you want to do
something with the framework just let us
know now your your AR mirre on Twitter
right that is correct and just Griffin
habits we a Twitter handle yes it's
called the aviary Co the aviary right
right I'm sorry it's my accent is
because the Griffin Twitter handle was
already taken ah very good
okay the aviary is the at the aviary we
already know the je frog situation yes
okay well thank you very much for being
foolish enough to wander by it exactly
the wrong moment you know you want to
give a shout-out to e shell you want to
say hi to her while you're here
well yeah sadly so people that know us
they know that Excel and I always travel
together but in this particular time I
we didn't so I'm now alone that's why I
cannot even speak correctly today and
there's a reason why because there's a
chance she might actually be one of our
half-dozen or so you watch the viewers
you might watch this I don't think you
matter be really good
can't think so I mean not there to force
ourselves you know are the things to do
exactly that
now Grails is I think Jeff just did a
talk on Grail said new yours I think
it's tomorrow tomorrow it has tomorrow
yeah right so Grails I don't think has a
new version in the works although
there's a lot of discussions about there
currently 3.32 I believe and I don't
know when they're planning for the 3.4
release but that's on the way groovy
also is pretty stable at this point I
think though we've got where I think we
had about to have another beat up for ya
another beta 4 3 and 2 5 just a couple
of advertising notes minor thing I have
an article coming out in Java magazine
in the next issue on groovy 3 and the
associated changes and all that's the
fun stuff cribbed directly from Paul
Kings interview and from the the release
notes you know for anybody that is
listening it would be great if you can
download groovy 3 and give it a try we
get a side that it's natural to be de
and the great thing about train yourself
a 1 so this syntax is very close to Java
8 now I tried it and so the idea of
having very close to the Java syntax is
that you can copy and paste Java code
into groovy or just renamed exactly once
your new features - and we kind of go
through most of that in that in the
discussion also I do have to warn you I
talked to Hadi Hariri was a Kotlin guy
Java I actually appeared on the talking
Kotlin podcast there you go the Kotlin
can exposes himself again I tried to
defend hearing defend the possibility of
dynamic typing and all that I don't know
how successful that was when that
podcast comes out I will warn you so you
could stay far away if you like you know
clean Colin exposes himself the other
thing we want to mention is that was it
this week that is Grails one o is the
10-year anniversary's yes they on
outside of this university OC I tweeted
about that I started with 0.4 as
recall that was Jason Rudolph's original
book the getting started getting to the
great yeah yeah yeah that's the same one
yeah yes I did as well but anyway Jeff
Brown was supposed to be here and he got
tied up as is typical you know young is
in demand it's very important guy you
know he's a rock star but I think we're
gonna probably have to clear out of here
because they're gonna want this this
section but again thank you very
security guys coming in so yeah we need
we need see is that that happens when we
say grew beyond like Java conference up
get those guys started to say yeah yeah
anything else we left out no I think we
are all looking forward for a great conf
and others will be there and Ken will be
now but the coffee there's four of us
yes so you're in the yes and I'm now in
I I hope I it's not final yet but I hope
we will be able to make it as well and
it's possible Elk Grove ECMO will be
there l know for sure he's the mascot I
mean there is no I mean yes he's gonna
be a coping hearing for sure yeah nobody
really know it's like you and it's like
Tony Stark and Iron Man kind of thing
it's like you just never sure well you
you kind of do he pretty much they don't
if at the end of the first movie yeah
yeah it doesn't work with Superman Oh
groovy sumo eventually takes off his
mask too so I know we don't know we
don't know maybe it may be at the Great
Khan okay hopefully we will have another
groovy podcast before great Kampf you
know we're going to interview a couple
people and everything there we'll get
into it yeah Sauron probably the next
one but I think we've got everything we
need for today thank you again to the
knight hacking people for allowing us to
use the stage here we should apologize
we've pretty much driven everybody away
from the area here yeah but that's what
do we do yeah that's that's the report
Casper is your thing
yeah that's groovy podcast for you but
hopefully we'll see you all next time so
thank you for watching and take thank
you bye bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
