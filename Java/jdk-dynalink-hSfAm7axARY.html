presenting work I didn't do it's growing
into a habit maybe you can hire me I
should think about that ok so today I
stand here instead of Attila whom you
know who is the primary author of the
Dinah link framework and i'm going to
give you an update on what's new in
Dinah link as of jdk nine also there
will be a rough overview of what Dinah
link is and does and so forth I'm the
usual disclaimers applied don't shoot
the messenger don't ask me anything um
we'll see to the possibility of
answering questions as they arise I'm
still working on the music the agenda is
simple overview advanced more advanced I
have a mouthful of slides here it's
around 40 so we'll see how far i get and
how much of the material i can cover so
let's begin with the overview without
further ado um I mentioned yesterday in
the torque on NASA and modules that
diner link is as of JD canine a separate
package it's no longer part of NASA own
even though its source code still lives
in that repository but we have a
dedicated module in the JDK now and I'm
not going to give the whole story of
what Dinah link isn't us today because
the story has been told by atila mostly
numerous times and in this very place
and in other venues but there are some
things that have changed and I'll focus
on those so first and foremost um API
simplification
some streamlining um some work on the
class hierarchies things are simpler
somewhat more intuitive now and yeah
most importantly perhaps the operations
are now represented as as a type-safe
enum instead of strings that need to be
parsed and kept around so brief recap
dinah link it's a library for dynamic
linking of high-level operations on
objects read/write invoke whatnot it's
normally used in programming language
implementations the most prominent user
is nas horn probably um which is in the
which is also the context in which dan
the link was developed and so as soon as
as a programming language has an object
model that might differ from that of the
underlying JVM it might be worthwhile to
take a look at our link to take care of
the linking of operations at call sites
also when there are sometimes implicit
type conversions that go beyond what the
Java language specification imposes in
terms of coercion then the link might be
worth a try operations in the dynamic
context are call sites are represented
as call sites and will be linked to some
method handle at runtime it's all
dynamic umm Danah link will take into
account whatever contextual information
the invocation carries
the usefulness is explicitly not for
statically typed languages that have the
same object model as the java
programming language itself it's simply
not what Dinah link is supposed to do um
just use the usual bytecode instructions
they will do just fine but if you have
expressions that have a dynamic flavor
about them and I think the examples that
we have seen in Jason's presentation on
the Scala implementation just now fall
into that category then Dinah link is
indeed a good match to address those
problems up next little example from in
fact the nice whole area what we see
here is three java classes all of which
have a property that can go by the name
of color even though it is implemented
differently in each of the classes we
have one field we have one method that
returns a string and we have one more
method that returns an int so we have
three different implementations of a
property with the same name essentially
in JavaScript this code here which first
instantiates one of each of these
classes we just saw and then iterates
over those and gets the color property
using the same access mechanism each
time this single line or more precisely
the opt color bit of the line in the for
loop will boil down to something like
the invoke dynamic instruction shown
here on the slide so it's invoke dynamic
of something called color accepting an
object returning an object
and it has a static static argument to
the bootstrap method that says get
property is the operation that's
supposed to be run here so
yeah dinah link used to use strings to
encode these operations so here are some
changes um it now uses type safe
operation objects instead of strings and
that has several benefits for one both
the call site encoder that is the
compiler that generates the invoke
dynamic instruction and also the decoder
so the bit in the language
implementation runtime that guides what
the invoke dynamics you've linked to are
the responsibility of this same language
runtime environment so it makes little
sense to forcibly prescribe how it
should encode something that it only
reads back and for another code dealing
with operations internally can now work
with operation objects instead of
parsing all those strings finally the
strings had this certain load on the
constant pool and also the string in
turn table at runtime
so in the nutshell these composite
operations and what used to be this
string with the three different parts
for get property get element or get
method is now a composite operation over
three different constants from the
standard operation enum it's also named
operation what that is i'll get to that
later but the core here is it's a
composite operation can be any of these
those composite operations are used all
throughout the nasa on implementation
the reason is the dyno link recognizes
three different namespaces in the
standard operations its properties of
objects elements of collections and
methods of objects conversely javascript
objects only have one namespace and
dinah links composite operations give
this or semantics for attempting
operations on all those different
namespaces so this is what's being done
here
bytecode um it's not necessary to use
dyna link in an environment where
everything is about byte code generation
what dinah link returns as a result of a
link operation is a cold side and so
they can they can serve as site call
site abstractions in language
implementations of any kind an
interpreter built on down a link only
needs call sites with operation
encodings and then appropriate linkers
and decoders for these operations so it
could equally could could be equally
possible to use dyna link in the call
site it will return from a linking
operation in an AST interpreter or
whatnot okay more example coming up I'm
to illustrate the simplest possible use
of diner link in a language
implementation the characteristics here
are the language has its own dynamic
expressions no object model of its own
or any complex type conversion rules
here we go it's just part of the runtime
of course and the details of the decode
operation method are left out on purpose
because that's not what we what we are
about here it's this is rather about the
bits and pieces of the dandling
framework that are at use so as
explained no I'll have said that I will
now look at each of the highlighted
elements here and so first of all the
bootstrap methods have to return some
call site instance these are generated
by a linker
the method responsible for that is
called link and the linker is typically
obtained from the dynamic linker factory
as dyna link expects dynamism to some
degree the root call side abstraction it
applies is what we call a real inka
below all site there are different
embodiments of that interface first
there's a simple reeling cable call side
that's monomorphic and always links to a
single target now monomorphic he does
not mean that it's fixed once and for
all but that it applies monomorphic
caching so it's a cold side that only
knows one target and if the cache misses
it needs to relink on the other hand
there's a chained call site which is
polymorphic and this one builds
internally a link a linked list of guard
with tests handles that is growing as
new targets are encountered so each time
the cache misses there will be a new
addition to this list too up to a
certain degree volatile call sites are
not offered by dinah link it's not part
of the system so a call site as used by
dinah link is expressed in terms of a
descriptor that consists of a lookup
object for context and excess checks an
operation describing at a high level
what the calls i should do and the type
signature of the call site with all the
parameter types and the result at that
are expected there the actual java.lang
invoke call side objects are all
encapsulated inside those dynamic
specific objects and cannot be tampered
with in it way
the descriptor can be extended if the
language implementation sees fit if
additional arguments are needed then the
new descriptor implementations can be
used the operation describes what should
be done at a call site so for example a
composite operation of get property and
get element um can be used to get an
element with the given name from just
about any object and as mentioned new in
jdk 9 is that there is now an enum in
place to describe the standard
operations operations can be composed
and it is possible to have these named
operations where arguments are names
example coming up as an overview of the
standard operations that are offered we
have example expressions here in the
first column the second column describes
how they are represented as an operation
and on the right-hand side of the table
in the last column we see what the call
side signature looks like the difference
between standard and named operations if
you look at the first two rows object of
X just extracts the property from the
variable X the property with the name
given by the variable X so it's not a
named operation the named operation one
line further down below object of string
through that's a named operation where
the name itself is bound at the call
site so the name does not depend on any
extra variable which is also why the
expected arguments of the named
operation only include the object itself
instead of the variable and the object
you can think of a named operation as
one that binds some of the information
at the call site so here it's the name
to be looked up in the object that's
bound at the cold side and that's this
operation with this name will be applied
to each object subjected to that call
the standard operation for calls is
interesting because it requires two
operations that are applied in sequence
the method first needs to be looked up
vr get method and it can then be invoked
with call also the parameters the
arguments for these two operations
differ in the first case we only need
the object in the second case we then
have to pass the obtained function the
receiver object and all of the arguments
and again in the in the first of these
two operations that are needed to issue
a call we can again see that the named
operation is used to make sure that the
same name is used in all cases the name
is a property of the call site so far
for the operations dinah link supports
implementing dedicated linkers so if a
language has its own object model or
even its own type conversion rules then
a noun linker a dedicated linker needs
to be provided up next a small example
for this and there's a larger example
later in the talk which is about jython
so bring your own linker people in the
back is the code visible yeah still okay
good so if if at any point anything is
too small just raise a hand and let me
know I'll zoom in on details then
okay the dedicated linker implements the
guarding dynamic linker interface and as
we see here in the red line a dedicated
linker can be added to the set of
linkers that are available from the
dynamic linker factory it is definitely
possible to have more than one linker in
the system in asshole we use nine of
them um just to mention a few there is
what we call the beans linker to support
accessing properties on Java objects
whose API conforms to the javabeans
conventions then there are linked us for
various nasaan specific linkage
protocols to support access to jas
objects which are JavaScript objects
exposed to the outside world so objects
that can be interacted with and also to
Java adapters which as mentioned in the
talk yesterday I'm are created if you in
JavaScript implement a Java interface or
create a subclass of a Java class and
finally there's the bottom linker the
name is quite apt it catches all linkage
requests that could not be fulfilled by
any of the other linkers and will
depending on what it can do it applies
very conservative rules of its own it
will if it cannot handle the request it
will throw an appropriate exception or
will maybe successfully apply the very
conservative linkage rules
you are invited to go to the NASA horn
source code repository and build your
own instance of NASA on and then go to
jdk nine knots on samples dinah link
this directory is full of goodness and
many many examples for various aspects
of the dynamic framework and in fact
many of the examples I have in this in
this talk on these slides here are from
that directory just compile everything
there and then run with the jjs
executable any of the examples to shed
some light on how these details are
implemented I'm now going to walk
through walk quickly through an example
that adds a dot stream property to Java
arrays so that when you use the Java
array in JavaScript you can tell the
array dot stream and get a stream out of
it java utils stream stream code sighs
okay yeah not so okay good so this is
the overview slide anyway I'm going to
zoom in on all of the details here and
and briefly talk about all of the
highlighted bits in some given order
first of all the those are dynamic
linkers can be loaded automatically by
virtue of exploiting the JD case service
loader capabilities in this case here we
use a type based linker and zooming in a
bit a type based linker because it
should respond to certain types only and
the types we want to
respond to our array types as we want to
add this dot stream property to Java
erase the implementation is done in this
method here can link type and as you can
see what it does is it simply checks if
the type that's coming in is an array
type um and if so it will return true if
not false and then the linker will pass
on the request to the next linker in the
chain the guarded invocation here in
this method implements the operation on
the one hand and the cash check on the
other so what we do is we generate a
guarded guarded invocation that will
upon each invocation check whether the
operation can be applied and then we'll
apply the operation so if the guard
fails that the chasm a cache miss so to
speak finally unmentioned on this slide
there is a method called array to stream
which well turns the array into a stream
and then returns that this is the gist
of the implementation moving on
the argument of type link requests to
this method holds all the information
about what and where is to be linked and
the method extracts from this request
the receiver then applies the check
whether this linker is responsible for
the type that it found and it will then
also extract the call side descriptor
from the cold side descriptor the linker
can extract the operation and from the
operation in turn it can extract the
requested property or element and it
needs to check whether the requested
element is indeed stream and because
this linker is responsible for
generating those stream and those
streams from arrays it will only respond
to a get property operation with stream
as the named operation argument finally
we have this guards class that can be
used to generate various convenience
guards that are commonly used so in this
case is of class which checks if the
argument at hand is an instance of some
given class and this is in principle
what needs to be done to implement this
dot array no dot stream property on Java
arrays to be usable from JavaScript as
mentioned the actual method that does
that it is it's not shown this not quite
the interesting bit here
what constitutes a dynamic linker the
prioritized linkers so it's three
elements that constitute alinka or
constituted the link a factory and the
prioritized linkers are well prioritized
over all others they are tried first
then we have all the linkers that were
discovered through the service loader
mechanism and finally there are fallback
linkers in the nasa one case these
include the aforementioned beans linker
and also the bottom link up the beans
linker by the way is the default fall
back as mentioned it turns property
excesses into things that work if the
target object conforms to the javabeans
conventions so for instance an excess of
the form object color will be turned
into an object get color invocation if
that is available or into a field access
whatever the public property the
publicly visible property is
the fine print beans linker is pretty
capable come because it also supports
overloading and that also in the
presence of guest language-specific
coercion rules it also supports varargs
or variable arity invocations and cola
sensitive methods are linked in a secure
manner I mentioned this yesterday in the
Nassau on talked already for
completeness I will reiterate briefly so
call a sensitive is tricky because the
lookup context is relevant dinah link
uses method handles and normally applies
public look up but caller sensitive will
typically expect other lookup contexts
to be at the call site um and dinah link
takes care of transporting the call site
look up object through the entire
framework and into the caller sensitive
method so that the context of the actual
call site will be applied rather than
the context of the method handle that
was generated from diner link a new
addition to dinah link in jdk 9 is
dealing with missing methods um it
resembles very much the way that small
talk uses so when you send some message
to an object and the object doesn't
understand the message then it will
invoke the method called message not
understood and any class implementing
this method can deal with it the default
behavior is to pop up at a debugger
window but I digress this isn't about
small talk so in any case dinah link now
also offers such a message not
understood equivalent and it is entirely
controllable by the language
implementation so roll your own
security um if code wants to get hold of
the lookup object or linkers should be
automatically exported permissions have
to be set and now because these
operations deserve some attention not
going to go into much detail about this
one just as a remark by this I can
conclude the overview and move to
advanced topics this took me 30 minutes
so maybe we will not be able to cover
the more advanced topics or I will be
very quick we will see so I promised um
to take a look at a somewhat larger
scale example and that is a giant linker
built by sundar you should look at
everything on soon does blog and because
he keeps generating goodness just go
look at the stuff he publishes its
always good I'm now we're going to look
at the JSON example code sighs okay
yeah okay yes no okay I'll zoom in on
the relevant bits as usual um so here's
the code on this slide is actually
JavaScript but the red part is all
Python it's in the same file and that is
possible by virtue of a here doc when
you start NASA on in scripting mode you
can use this here doc syntax and it will
take everything until the closing bit as
one big string so what we do here is we
send an entire chunk of Python code to a
to the eval method of a JSON engine what
we do next is we get some data from this
JSON engine and then all in JavaScript
and at access some of the properties on
that point object and invoke some
methods on it so we have a little little
example of language into operation here
this this slide briefly illustrates how
to use such a linker by just adding the
jar file with the link to the classpath
thanks to the service loader this linker
will be automatically loaded and the
contents of that jar file are not so
much it's really just the classes and
and the manifests describing what
services are offered
a snippet from the source code of this
linker some aspects of what's needed to
link these property get us forge ifen
from Ghana link you can see some handle
constants at the top for getting an
attribute that's the PI object getattr
for translating an object from jython to
Java that's the PI to Java handle and
for checking whether an object is JSON
object that's the is PI object then on
the lower half of the slide the garden
invocation is created from a named
operation the name is bound to the Jason
get attribute handle the result is
converted thanks to filter return value
to a Java object and finally the
invocation is guarded with the is pi
objector and consequently it will not be
applied if the target is not a JSON
object so much for Jonathan more
examples I'm as mentioned the sample
directory is full of dynamic examples
this one is about XML dumb linking if
you look at the code down here you can
see that again we're using a here doc to
generate some HTML and in that here doc
we use variable expansion or expression
expansion to insert some computation
results the RSS object is the document
element a dom tree and any property
access that begins with an underscore is
treated accordingly by the dome linka so
we can get access to the document
objects channel element then
to that elements title element and then
to the content of that and the result of
that is inserted here in the HTML code
and so forth okay to summarize the
custom linker advantages custom link has
support implementing so to speak
embedded dsl's on alien objects alien
from the perspective of the diner link
application in this case now so on and
those alien objects don't even have to
know we have also run a little
experiment for databases and result sets
and this experiment works like this you
have a database connection jdbc database
connection dot table name dot filter and
then a JavaScript function and this can
be used internally to generate a sequel
query that will then be executed and
return result set the result set can be
dealt with using a linker equally well
so that it mimics a list and so forth
the opportunities are endless I've made
it to the more advanced topics hold
tight um so Danny link does not only
enable some flexibility in language
implementation as seen and it also
allows for very very fine-grained
control over details of the linking
process itself the linking process
consists of several sub steps each of
which can be controlled to some degree
these these methods here on this slide
represent the API entry points for
exacting this kind of control
this is the control flow of the linking
process internally the steps are applied
in the given order from top to bottom
what happens observably from a distance
is you call dynamic linker dot link and
in the end some call site dot said
target is done to link the call site the
one thing that is commonly under control
is passing a link request to known
guarding dynamic linkers and decoding
operations also type conversions are
commonly applied as required by the
language implementation at hand most of
the other things are hooks for more
advanced language runtime mechanics
first of which the auto conversion
strategy so the call site type and
method handle type may have to be
matched there may be slight mismatches
in the types dinah link automatically
does this for all the coercion zhdi find
by the java language specification and
also for custom type conversions defined
by linkers already sometimes though even
the standard JLS coercion rules need to
be customized and such things can be
plugged into the linking process here
nassau makes use of this capability in
unboxing null to primitives so in
JavaScript you can write these strange
things like seven plus null and this is
where the null will be converted or
coerced to the right type and value
internal object filters um a language
one time should avoid internal objects
leaking to the outside world not should
must Nath on internally uses for example
a class called cons string for delayed
concatenation of strings and also the
internal representation of of a
JavaScript object is called Script
object those are not supposed to be
observable from the outside so it must
be made sure that these don't escape and
this phase of the linking process can be
used to ensure that these objects never
escape from a diner link all site nASA
uses this to collapse con strings into
strings so it enforces the two string
operation on those delayed
concatenations and also to wrap script
objects into jas object instances and
jas object as mentioned is what what a
JavaScript object looks to the outside
pre link transform this almost last step
in the linking process is given the
final chance to transform a guarded
invocations method handles before
linking them to a call site guarding
dynamic linkers shouldn't apply long JLS
type conversions on method handles
return types to match them to the cold
side type and this should rather be left
to the peeling filter of the runtime
owning the call site this ensures the
correctness for run times with
optimistic typing and this is what it's
used for in Nassau on even when linking
handles from some foreign linker are
into its own call sites
okay so these are not so commonly used
I'm almost in time last slide Dinah link
is part of JD canine in a dedicated
separate module the source code lives in
the NASA own repository of the JDK 9
forest there are many examples there
there's javadoc and also again watch out
for posts in some doubts blog he already
has a sizable amount of very interesting
examples described at very good level of
detail there and also if you have
questions ask them on NASA on dev Attila
reads there too and we'll be happy to
answer questions so will i if I can</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
