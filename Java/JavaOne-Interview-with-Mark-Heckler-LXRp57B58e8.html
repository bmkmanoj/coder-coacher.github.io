javaone speakers who will be at the Java
one conference in San Francisco for
September's 22nd through September 26
with me I have mark heckler how you
doing mark fine how are you doing good
as you can see this is a lively
household I've kids some my own and some
other people's running around behind me
how about you you already figure for
your job one sessions well already is a
relative term we have pretty much
everything in place that we need to have
in place but there's a lot of polishing
and refining and last-minute
modifications that go into it so yeah I
mean all the pieces are there but we
have still have a lot of work to do so
cool let's let's jump right into some of
the sessions you're going to be talking
about I'll put your screen up and then
you can walk us through some of the
stuff you're going to be doing including
um okay watching me over Skype
absolutely okay well I guess let me take
them in reverse order actually because
that's what I'd like to the way I'd like
to step you through the the overview of
the actual you know the demo is a cool
good sounds good first of all I'm I
these are both team efforts the first
one I'm well the second one on the
screen I am privileged to team up with
Jose Peraza on a renewable energy and
Java embedded talk and we kind of came
into this from from opposite ends Jose
has a very nice large installation of
renewable energy photovoltaic modules
and the system that surrounds that and I
was coming at it from a very small scale
installation and we just kept meeting
back in the middle and talking about
Java embedded sweet and using Java to
monitor and manage these installations
and other installations potential
installations and we started thinking
about what we could do to maybe bring
that all together and not just monitor
the installations but actually use those
same installations to power it directly
because it seemed really silly in a lot
of cases what happens with power
generation with renewable energy is you
you you
generate it you store it in DC batteries
and then to use it in a lot of
circumstances a lot of like houses and
things like that or buildings you
convert that to AC well Oliver like
Ramon is inefficient and NAC has
advantages you know transmission
distance transmission and things like
that but it seems really silly didn't
have your sensors and equipment yandi
plugged in through a wall war which
converts AC to DC and then plugging that
into a system that you've already
convert from DC to AC so we started
brainstorming and coming over the ways
that we can make that a little more
direct and closed loop and came up with
a kind of the self licking ice cream
cone the systems that monitor the
renewable energy system also our power
directly by the renewable energy system
so we we've played with several
different configurations and several
different sensor bundles but we have the
system that we're going to be bringing
the Java one is a very small scale very
portable breakdown abul system and you
know I kind of jokingly say that
software that's easy hardware that's
that's easy figuring out how to get all
the equipment and fan and things like
that we need at the San Francisco that's
going to be pretty tricky so I may be
talking with you offline about that but
I guess to kind of give you the nickel
tour I'm not sure how this will work but
what I'd like to do is pick up the
computer and kind of show some of the
toys in the background okay and then
maybe what I'd like to also do is plug
in the wind machine to get the wind
turbine going and fire up the embedded
server and just take a look at it in
action I'll try to make that as quick as
possible let me let me unplug and
untether here a little bit and see how
that goes okay you stole my desk i
switch to uh well i'm backing or desktop
now if you would pop off that and then i
will go to live mode okay so you want me
to show your video shop yes jollies
oh here we go okay hopefully I won't
drop this I moved everything I have an
office downstairs so of course with this
being somewhat dependent upon the Sun
when one of my daughters moved off to
college I kind of took over her ear and
for at least the next month so if what
you see here in the back is a 50 watt
solar panel that's relatively small but
it works really nicely on a house or
hobbyist scale I'll actually not be
bringing that because what I found is
well the wind turbine you see in front
of that is very easily broken down and
assembled solar panels are very easily
broken huh so what I did was get a small
one that's used for cars and motorcycles
to keep the battery talked off and I'll
be bringing that it's about a 2 wat by
comparison this is about a 50 watt that
you see behind me this is a wind turbine
it puts out a maximum really of about I
guess it's almost 3 amps when everything
is flowing smoothly and high winds which
to high obviously you have a different
kind of problem over here you see a
small 12 volt battery and again my
installation that i have is actually
several much larger batteries but this
is much more transportable and i have
for ballast back behind my frame that i
built out of PVC pipe i have a stapler
just to hold that down but you also see
the terminal block and the sensor bundle
and i sit in some pictures and let's see
over here is the raspberry pi server and
the USB hub and then we have the
receiving arduino with a small n RF
20-24 l01 radio and Jose and I are doing
a couple different different kinds of
radio he's setting up a configuration
with XPS i'm using the NRF 24 l 01 each
has advantages but that's the quick tour
and then let me let me fire up the wind
machine set you down for a minute see if
that works if it's too loud i'll shut it
off good i'll be right back
okay too loud can you set out movie okay
now for the fun part let's get back over
to a terminal window and we'll fire up
the jet server now plug back in my
external keyboard that makes things a
little hand here cool
anyway really quickly we're using for
our sensors again the configuration
we're bringing it's primarily Arduino
based on the remote sensors because
Arduino has a few distinct advantages
the language that you use to develop for
the Arduino platform is very Java like
it's based on processing impact the IDS
even written in Java and also the
Arduino has a lot of add-on boards
shields they call them it's very
inexpensive very easily attainable
they're available everywhere and they
run on a wide variety of voltages so you
can power it from a over charged battery
to an undercharge battery and the thing
just keeps going so it's very nice the
little radios I'm using again are the
Nordic semiconductor in RF 24 l 0 1
switch are dirt cheap about a dollar
apiece little over a dollar piece when
bought in bulk so you can Network them
create sensor meshes for very little
money the XP is a little more expensive
but they're a little more
straightforward and how they handle
things a little more capable so it
depends on what you want let's see I
have that up and almost running now or I
guess it is running it's just not
showing any readings it takes a reading
about every 30 seconds
yep and oh one problem i did not plug in
my remote since your bundle know that i
would probably help that could be a
problem so let me reach over here and
you tell me no this is a real demo
because if it all goes purposely let me
know it's all can okay it's right no
chance of that let's see okay are you
back on the desktop on the desktop okay
excellent excellent so slight slight
delay on what we're getting but we see a
couple zeros now okay although those
aren't the good numbers so okay now
we're getting actual readings cool what
we wanted to do is not just monitor the
the power the power production but we
also wanted to try to capture a few
other things and in my case with this
bundle what I'm capturing is the ambient
temperature and relative humidity as
well as the voltage to the current now
let's go back over here and the nice
thing about jazz it gives you a lot of
the capabilities of a full-blown server
for 35 bucks so you can deploy this and
get restful web services you can run
servlets there's going to be a change in
architecture coming up and we don't know
all the specifics but but what we're
doing is showing what we have here now
and as you can see it it happily pulls
in the last reading if you want to query
the database it's out on the PI it
quickly and easily does that you can
pull up a listing just kind of some
basic basic stuff that again is really
easily handled by the Java embedded
sweet running on the pie so let me kill
that and we'll move into the second part
and let's see the second part okay well
i shouldn't've uh ya know the second
session i'm working with Hendrik Evers
Carl D and Garrett grin vault has been
involved at throughout to some degree
one degree or another and Hendrick I
don't know if you've been keeping up or
the folks have been keeping up with the
neat things he's doing but what we
wanted to do is look at a couple
different takes on frameworks no let me
shut off that noise maker you know that
would make make things a little bit
nicer go thank you very much much better
ok Hendrik has a really nice setup on
the Raspberry Pi which is almost like a
Roku or an Ouya where it it takes it
over and uses it as a media center very
nice full screen games different apps
it's it's pretty interesting if people
haven't checked it out please follow him
on twitter check out his YouTube videos
just great stuff Carl and I have been
tag-teaming on the other side of that
and Carl had a really great idea to kind
of pay homage to the widget FX that you
and Keith had to had done in the past
and a lot of other contributors as well
yeah there there's in the JavaFX world
it seems like there are a lot of neat
widget ideas that are just kind of
crying out for a way to to track them
and launch them and manage them and Carl
I have been working on that he's been
handling all the back-end development
I've been handling things more from the
front end developer if somebody who's
been wanting to come in and develop some
widgets and desktop useful applications
that are managed and deployed by this
framework so we should have some
interesting stuff to show i'll fire up
something now just a hint and let me
minimize some of the other things
got a lot of debugging information still
showing snow and everything that's again
how you know that it's real stuff not
that's right nothing can hear okay this
is a Tron clock that Carl hello you've
seen that one there's a proof of concept
and then I have a little app here I call
the pigeon which is just my picture
widget that allows you to drop any
pictures you wanted a directory and
it'll pull automatically from the
recreant cycle through them this time
goes on just kind of a nice little
electronic photo frame type of your
you're a bitch yes space and then the
last one is a ticker widget that I
created and what I wanted to do is build
this to accept a number of different
feeds right now I can plug in a Twitter
feed or a facebook feed and search
ultimately we have a lot of ideas or as
you know there's never a shortage of a I
he isn't we just the more we do the
Mormons back and forth and the more we
bet on the list but right now what we
have on the screen is the basic launch
tray Tron clock widget and ticker I so
that's kind of a hint of some of the
things on the one side of the frame
works in widgets talk so that's pretty
much all the show-and-tell I have any
any questions anything else tokes on the
stream have been really impressed with
with all the stuff like um very
impressed with the ticker with the
perpetual ice cream cone well you don't
add a lot of this stuff is everyone's
well aware a lot of it you know the
tools just give you so many
opportunities to do such productive
stuff in enjoy yourself while you're
doing it so we've we've really kind of
had a good time with it and just you
know it doesn't have to be complicated
like the picture widget it just has to
be something that you find useful and
you say you know why not let's let's do
that so it's our goal with the framework
and and with the embedded as well is to
have something that's that's fairly
quick and easy and inexpensive to spin
up and make something useful out of and
I think we've done that hopefully you
know we can learn some
things from the attendees you know I
mentioned in the the blog post that the
birds of a feather really is kind of a
neat format because it's it's more of a
round table than it is say yeah
definitely a session you know everybody
kind of throws in their two cents and
and everybody went inside cool now
thanks for taking your time out mark and
I look forward to seeing you at javaone
San Francisco can't wait thank you
giving us a bye-bye wave bye-bye okay so
I killed the recording officially we're
still broadcasting though so you can
check the chat out and chat with folks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
