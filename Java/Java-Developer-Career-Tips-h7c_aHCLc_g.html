recording and now it's transmitting live
so hi everyone we are here hey hello how
are you Tori so we are here directly
from Java one in San Francisco so this
2016 and we are here at the Java hub yes
this is the Java hub is this is this big
meeting place where we have the coolest
people on earth right right here yes you
know I can see open-source developers
Java developers JCP what no I don't see
any JavaScript developer here do I is
engine I don't know I see jobbies a
group leaders over there
for all over the place yes ok alright
and I'm here with one of the amazing
people from from all these events and
it's one of the persons that actually
had the courage of you know showing who
he really is
wearing this doctor outfits right and
I'm here we've Stewart Marx and he works
on open JDK he's part of the Oracle team
that works on open JDK but much more
important in this he is dr. duplicator
that's right
hi Stuart thank you very much we're here
with us glad to be here ok excellent
so Stuart's right before we came here in
the stage we're talking a little bit
about your career I don't know how he
started son and all the cool stuff that
you did how you work with James Gosling
and everything can you tell us a little
bit how you got involved this job itself
how I got involved with Java well I had
been working at Sun for a long time on
different things but Sun had a lot of
companies have have pretty pretty easy
ways to transfer is among among projects
okay so I've been working on some other
stuff and I decided well I needed to I
needed to find a new job so let's look
around inside a Sun and some of my
friends were working on this on this
cool thing which turned out to be Java
ME oh cool I talked to them they brought
me in for an interview and I transferred
over and yeah so I worked on John
Emme from 1999 to 2009 I don't know 2005
or so all right yeah so there's a really
a lot of activity a lot of cool stuff
going on at that time
yes so you're actually add at the the
the Java team when Java was open source
name because Java was open source in
2005 right yeah now the I did the the
Java SE JDK stuff was was a SEP hadn't
been working on that at that time okay I
did work on the open sourcing of Java ME
oh cool right out there remember I don't
know if anybody remembers the phone-a me
project for any project every quarter
there on java.net which is gonna go away
sometime I don't know what the date is
yeah it's somewhere yeah so it's out
there still if anybody wants to grab a
copy of it okay cool all right so now
you just mention one thing very very
important you know we are we are here at
1:00 at the premier Java developers
conference in the ward right and so
people that are here at JavaOne are of
course our developers are interested in
proving their careers because otherwise
you're not you know interesting improve
your career y-you could you come for an
event right yeah now you say that you
actually search it for a different job
inside your own company right let's
already you you went out why why were
you looking for something what's boring
or you know you need some challenge why
do you decide you to look for a
different job inside to come okay so we
don't have enough time to write but the
basic part of it was there had been some
reorg and my team was actually I was
running a team I was working on
electronic commerce project uh-huh
oh the job electronic oh no no no this
was this was actually independent of
that alright and it was one of these
things where it was difficult because we
had some modest success but it was start
to become clear that it wasn't really
gonna go anywhere man my team got reorg
actually my team was broken up and we
got reorg din two different things and
and essentially we were told to find new
jobs anyway in in a different
organization and it's like well why not
why not look elsewhere as well right
okay all right
but because because a lot of developers
are going to reduce right you know yeah
they're either working on boring
projects
or or de project working on doesn't look
like this going gonna go anywhere so do
you think that the fact that you went
out and you searched for different thing
and you challenge yourself to go look
for something was that really important
for your career oh absolutely yeah it
was it was a I when I look back actually
during that time in the first first 10
or 15 years of my career I think my
mistake was actually staying in the same
place for too long oh okay yeah so so
that was that was something where I
actually came to and I've done this a
couple times all the way and ended up
staying in Sun and then Oracle so on so
in one sense I've been in the same job
but in another sense I've actively
decided to seek out different things
that that were more to my liking to
further my career and I think I think
that was something that was it was a
growth experience for me where I said
instead of just bumbling along and
saying oh I'm not liking this anymore
I made an explicit decision okay well if
I'm in this situation that I don't like
it's up to me to do something about it
so I can either stay here and like it
better or actually what I tended to do
was try to fix it which sometimes works
uh-huh sometimes you're in a position
where you can't fix it right and the
realisation that I came to is you know
if the organization around you if you're
management you know if they want certain
things to happen and that's not to your
liking you can either live with that or
you can decide for yourself to go
somewhere else right actually and and I
think that's really nice to see because
a lot of us work on large companies and
it's not just see that actually you
don't need to leave your job or or go
you know just you can actually look
interesting project inside your own
organization then yeah I think son was
very good about that I think Oracle is -
in fact my most recent transfer into the
JDK group was after the half after the
acquisition the huh son by Oracle so
that was a it was an internal Oracle
transfer okay so yeah I think that that
is an advantage that that big companies
quite frankly don't pay enough attention
to but having internal transfer
processes is very important I think it's
an important retention thing for big
companies right and it's something that
you know you you're you're already
plugged into you know all the HR stuff
you know a lot of people you
usually and and and so it's a it's a
it's an easier step than kind of
switching companies alright excellent so
one of the things that so now you were
working on an open JDK right it's one of
the most important open-source project
in the world I mean it's you know of
course you're it's Java is the most
important and most used language in the
world
open indicates the basis of all of this
so you know there's no doubt it is one
of the most important projects now how I
know I know you're actually worked
inside Oracle not most most open-source
developers don't have the chance to work
in the company that does the product but
how working on an open source project
has been important for you you know
there's like a community thing or it's
just like learning or doesn't matter
much aren't I
a couple things I mean both of those so
one is and this is something that goes
back to Bill joy way in the early
Sundays I was I forget he had some very
very crisp way of putting it but the
point was that it as a company Josh
Joy's law that says that that you know
you there's how is there's always more
as more people outside and yeah yes yes
that's right yeah yeah that's that's
Joy's law yes okay yes right so so yeah
you could be a company trying to trying
to work on something and you know at at
a certain point it's very useful to be
able to if things are open then you can
discuss issues freely with anybody in
this industry who's interested right and
so you can you can gain the benefit of
external expertise that way right not
having to hire people
the fact is for whatever reason some
people don't want to work at this
company or they want to stay what
they're doing or they want to remain
independent or whatever but they can
still offer their expertise and a
company like Oracle can still benefit
from their expertise by working at open
source
right another thing is I think that I
you know certainly it's benefited my
career I have a lot of visibility I mean
look at this I mean I'm standing out
there and Bruno says come on over we
need to do it so that's that's nice I
also like talking to people and meeting
people and that's very nice
and just just gaining the certainly the
expertise but also the energy from
people in the community is very helpful
I think one other thing is I've worked
in in the past I've worked on
proprietary projects and most most
projects proprietary projects non
open-source projects in companies are
secret right and so you have to mark
things with proprietary confidential you
go to a conference like this and it's
like well what do you work on well and
you describe something in very general
terms but you can't really say anything
uh-huh but the great thing about working
on open source is it's like oh yeah you
know I ranted this interesting problem
I'll describe it for you in fact here
let's I'll show you the code look at
this and see this test is failing here
and look at the reason why did right and
so so and you know the fact that it's
open source you don't need to sign a
nondisclosure you have no formal relate
well maybe you do have an NDA with
probably but you you know I mean you
know if you ask somebody to sign an NDA
that's a huge barrier yes Louis yeah and
the fact that it's all open source it's
like hey you know look at the code look
what we're doing here and if they're
interested great if they're you know if
they're not okay well we had a fun
conversation cool I think that's that's
very very an enhancing and enriching
environment yeah and about the secret
are you talking about it's probably not
something that you need but a lot of
developers might that they're watching
us might have this problem you know you
you go to an interview or a company for
example and then you have to say oh I
working on this project at project all
secret things that's you can't really
show what you did but if you're gonna
work an open-source project you say okay
I work on this and my code is right here
and open JDK nine actually
you're alive likes a live query clone
online that's definitely true yeah and
and also the you know the I think with
the internet and I think many things are
long-lived although you know actually
we're seeing these you have to pay
attention to this stuff I'm thinking of
Java net going away but also Google code
went away so I think that's something to
be careful of I mean it's great that
it's out there but you also have to
understand you know it could go away if
you're not careful or you need to move
it somewhere
right but but it definitely is a benefit
that since it's all open source you can
you can go to somebody else and say look
I did that work and you know look at it
if you want you can even compile it or
try it out yeah that's a big advantage
excellent okay so now you you know
you've been working on open source
project I've been working on on Java and
and we are here talking with developers
and Java user groups right and is there
any anything that those people can
actually do to to improve their careers
by working open source project I mean I
wanna I wanna get you know discussing
some ideas right I think that we could
do right I'm not gonna ask about this
right now so don't don't jump don't jump
ahead right but you know do you think
that's for people to participate on open
source prodigies that a hard thing or is
actually easy I I think it's it's pretty
easy you have it depends on the project
it depends on your personality but you
have to you have to find a way to get
yourself gets out get yourself out there
and visible and ask questions right but
it was this thing about I mean you're
talking about open source projects and
how to how to get involved and
discussing with people and starting off
with small projects right like like
documentation or right I guess right and
I think it's true that most projects out
there most open-source projects out
there could benefit from better
documentation better tests you know you
know maybe the core committers are
interested in working on the next big
feature but there are these bugs here
that they're less interested in or they
haven't gotten to and be nice if
somebody could pick up pick up you know
little bug fixing and things like that
so I think that is a way for people to
get involved in open source projects
that's excellent so now you had an
amazing idea right that I just love it
and we you you have not told anyone yet
so this is like it was just a very small
group of people
now we gonna broadcast to the word right
and a way for people to actually get
involved on the most important
open-source projects to open JDK right
uh-huh and it's an easy way that any
developer around the world can
participate right Frank so how we gonna
how are you gonna help people get e+
open JDK then okay so here's the idea so
one of the most important things in
JD canine is modularization the juice on
my project right yeah and if you look at
the Java ecosystem there are jar the
open source projects and jar files
floating around everywhere in the
internet right there certainly maven
central bunch of other places where
people can go and get jar files and
applications of jar files all right yes
well yeah exactly I'm sure I don't know
how many there are but what we want to
do in the JDK is modular eyes everything
whoa yeah so the idea is if there's an
open source jar file an interesting and
fairly simple project is to take some
open source jar file and modularize it
right and so I'm calling this idea a dr.
module adopter module that's really cool
so basically what the idea is that you
know we gotta go get existing jar files
for open or open source projects and
when you call moralized
what do you mean like open it up rewrite
the whole thing no no okay so now we'll
dig into the jigsaw stuff a little bit
there right yeah there are you know
they're jigsaw talks up and down the
program you know all week here at
JavaOne but just very briefly say there
there are several different ways to
modularize something one is this concept
of an automatic module which is if you
if you read mark Reinholds proposals and
and so forth he'll describe it in detail
but basically you can take an existing
jar file and you if you put it on the
class path that's how you got access to
its classes now there's in Java 9
there's a concept of a module path which
is we're not not not individual classes
whether they're not in jar files but
instead it is where modules reside and
if the if if the JVM recognizes if the
JVM sees a jar on the module path it
automatically turns that jar into a
module and it gives it a name based on
the jar file name ok so you're saying
that actually you can just get a
existing Java file put it in the module
path and then he becomes a module that's
right so there's nothing to do well you
have to move it around right I think but
I think that ok so that's the first step
yeah I think the next step is to test it
cuz right not everything works in that
mode cool ok ok I mean there's
I think there's I think one of the
difficulties that we're working through
with jigsaw now is its frameworks that
we use lots of reflective access for
things and they need access and so forth
so I think certainly to turn something
into a module it's that easy moving on
to the module path instead of the class
and that's it right
but then test it figure out how to work
it and so forth yeah that's pretty cool
and of course you could also write the
module aim for also right yeah so
another step is to unpack the jar file
huh but you don't have to recompile the
the the classes from source but if you
have the hierarchy of class files and
huh you can add a module info dot Java
and compile that in and then pack up the
jar file again and get a full-fledged
named module okay cool so it's real and
and so it's interesting is you don't
have to recompile the whole thing from
source uh-huh you can in fact you can
even take the existing binaries which
might have been the class files might
have been compiled for JDK 6 right use
the Java 9 compiler and add a module
info to that and so now you have kind of
well it's a modular jar file which will
run just fine on JDK 6 but if you put it
onto the module path in JDK 9 it's a
full-fledged module ok so basically what
you're proposing is that something that
any developer can do right so you know
just download a jar file you're already
using your project test it out
automatically on Java 9 right right and
then open up the jar file create a a
module info compile that with with Java
9 and then you haven't you have a module
right so I mean any Java developer could
do this and you think this would be
valuable for Java 9 yeah I think so I
think what we're still working on Java 9
I think ironing out kinks in the module
system if there are bugs maybe there's
things in the JDK that need to be fixed
that's that's very good feedback to get
that before we go to the final release
of jk9 I think it's good feedback for
open source projects because maybe there
are open source projects out there who
were saying ok well we're working on our
features and whatnot but yeah there's
this module stuff we haven't dealt with
it somebody comes along and says here
I've done some things that turn your
project into into a you know your jar
artifact into a module now you can do
that after the
or once you've done it manually after
the fact maybe they can say oh okay all
we can do is is put this into our build
system this way and we can produce a
modular jar and that's a way for a
developer to to enhance an open source
project by helping them saying okay now
we can not only be producing our jar
artifact we're producing a module that
can be used in JDK 9 okay so pretty cool
so actually if you if you see we're
doing a going for circle here right now
because now you a job developer you can
you can participate on on open JDK a
very important project you can help your
favorite open source project and that
will help your career and with that you
can take the risks and in new new
challenges like like you did like
Stewart right to improve your career and
get a better position so I mean this is
the perfect this is the perfect
situation for every developer that's
right it's win-win for all around it
improves the community and improves Java
and improves the open source projects
and it just helps the the entire
ecosystem grow and and get better okay
so thank you very much and you for
watching us here pay attention that's
we're gonna have more tips for you to
improve your career
Stewart thanks a lot all right oh thank
you very much thank you thank you
alright and I have just press here to
stop and</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
