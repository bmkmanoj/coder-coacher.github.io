we are going to start to play with Java
and Raspberry Pi
actually raspbian are rad come with jdk
1.7 but we recommend you to upgrade JDK
1.8 early access so you can have access
to the new features of Java it's very
simple you just need to download
transfer the JDK 5 zip file to your
raspberry pi and so unzip this file and
you are ready to use jdk 1.8 so this is
the URL and you can use FileZilla to
transfer to your raspberry pi after
downloading and to unzip you can use
this command so with this command you
are going to unzip and you are going to
have the director inside /opt so you are
going to have a JDK 1.8 dot 0 director
inside the slash hope T test that's it
and you can check if the installation
was successful by typing this command
with this command you are going to check
the Java version so it's expected to
have JDK Java 1.8 version as the output
now you can set up your profile so you
can have the JDK 1.8 in your path and
with your Java home variable configurate
so you can do it using any editor our
suggestion here is to use the Nano so
with this command sudo nano / et Cie
slash profile you can edit this file and
you just need to put those lines one is
to export the Java home variable and the
other one is to include the JDK 1.8
slash bean into your path variable after
doing that you can with
Beauty our Raspberry Pi and it will be
ready to run Java with the 1.8 version
so after rebooting you can check if
everything is working fine and if you
can really use GTA 1.8 from any director
since you just put in your path so just
type in any director Java - version and
you supposed to see the Java version
like this you can also write a hello
world application to check if the
compiler is working fine so that's a
very simple hello world application you
just type this content inside a
HelloWorld dot Java file and Java C to
compile Java C HelloWorld dot Java enter
and Java HelloWorld to run this file you
also have a very nice job if exporting
raspberry pi so it's very powerful and
optimize it for the raspberry pi GPU so
you need to do some setup before using
java fax in your pie the first one is to
edit II did slash boot slash config T X
G and you need to uncomment two lines of
this file just take it out the hash at
the beginning like this and you're done
the second thing is to do another clock
to have a better performance so to do
that you need to run the recipe config
in using the sudo and go to the option
number seven overclock and you will be
advised about the lifetime of your
raspberry pi it will be a little bit
hotter and
but you are you are good no problem
sometimes the imaging just crash also if
you do the overclock to one gigahertz
but I never lose a Raspberry Pi because
of doing that and so here we are going
to choose the 900 megahertz it's a
moderate overclocking and the last thing
we need to do is to give more memory to
the GPU so instead of giving 64
megabytes we are going to change to a
128 megabytes of memory to the GPU
that's the most important thing for
JavaFX for the performance inside job FX
just go to the advanced set options
memory split and type the new amount of
memory finishing you need to reboot your
Raspberry Pi actually raspy config will
ask you for doing that so you can just
open NetBeans choose any kind of Java FX
sample application view that application
transfer to your Raspberry Pi type Java
les jar the name of the jar file to
generate a jar file while admins and you
can have your desktop shut effects
application running in your Raspberry Pi
this is a screenshot a picture of my
Raspberry Pi running the file works
application in my television so Java SE
embedded using jdk 1.8 early access is
totally red and you can take out the
advantage of your java SE regular
knowledge using raspberry pi so the next
video we are going to have more fun
playing with java c embedded pi 4 j +
GPIO see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
